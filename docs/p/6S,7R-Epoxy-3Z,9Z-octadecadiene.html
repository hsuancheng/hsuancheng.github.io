This complex is formed following the equilibrium reaction Pt(CN)(4)(2-) + Tl(dmso)(6)(3+) ⇆ (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) + dmso. The stability constant of the Pt-Tl bonded species, as determined using (13)C NMR spectroscopy, amounts to log K = 2.9 ± 0.2. The (NC)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) species constitutes the first example of a Pt-Tl bonded cyanide complex in which the sixth coordination position around Pt (in trans with respect to the Tl atom) is not occupied. The spectral parameters confirm the formation of the metal-metal bond, but differ substantially from those measured earlier in aqueous solution for complexes (CN)(5)Pt-Tl(CN)(n)(H(2)O)(x)(n-) (n = 0-3). The (205) Tl NMR chemical shift, δ = 75 ppm, is at extraordinary high field, while spin-spin coupling constant, (1)J(Pt-Tl) = 93 kHz, is the largest measured to date for a Pt-Tl bond in the absence of supporting bridging ligands. The absorption spectrum is dominated by two strong absorption bands in the UV region that are assigned to MMCT (Pt → Tl) and LMCT (dmso → Tl) bands, respectively, on the basis of MO and TDDFT calculations. The solution of the complex has a bright yellow color as a result of a shoulder present on the low energy side of the band at 355 nm. The geometry of the (CN)(4)Pt-Tl core can be elucidated from NMR data, but the particular stoichiometry and structure involving the dmso ligands are established by using Tl and Pt L(III)-edge EXAFS measurements. The Pt-Tl bond distance is 2.67(1) Å, the Tl-O bond distance is 2.282(6) Å, and the Pt-C-N entity is linear with Pt-C and Pt···N distances amounting to 1.969(6) and 3.096(6) Å, respectively. Geometry optimizations on the (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) system by using DFT calculations (B3LYP model) provide bond distances in excellent agreement with the EXAFS data. The four cyanide ligands are located in a square around the Pt atom, while the Tl atom is coordinated in a distorted octahedral fashion with the metal being located 0.40 Å above the equatorial plane described by four  atoms of dmso ligands. The four equatorial Tl-O bonds and the four cyano ligands around the Pt atom are arranged in an alternate geometry. The coordination environment around Pt may be considered as being square pyramidal, where the apical position is occupied by the Tl atom. The optimized geometry of (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) is asymmetrical (C(1) point group). This low symmetry might be responsible for the unusually large NMR linewidths observed due to intramolecular chemical exchange processes. The nature of the Pt-Tl bond has been studied by MO analysis. The metal-metal bond formation in (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) can be simply interpreted as the result of a Pt(5d(z(2)))(2) → Tl()(0) donation. This bonding scheme may rationalize the smaller thermodynamic stability of this adduct compared to the related complexes with (CN)(5)Pt-Tl entity, where the linear C-Pt-Tl unit constitutes a very stable bonding system.© 2011 American Chemical Society</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16026035> uptake kinetics and time to exhaustion in cycling and running: a comparison between trained and untrained subjects.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to compare pulmonary gas exchange kinetics (VO2 kinetics) and time to exhaustion (Tlim) between trained and untrained individuals during severe exercise performed on a cycle ergometer and treadmill. Eleven untrained males in running (UR) and cycling (UC), nine endurance cyclists (EC), and seven endurance runners (ER) were submitted to the following tests on separate days: (i) incremental test for determination of maximal  uptake (VO2max) and the intensity associated with the achievement of VO2max (IVO2max) on a mechanical braked cycle ergometer (EC and UC) and on a treadmill (ER and UR); (ii) all-out exercise bout performed at IVO2max to determine the time to exhaustion at IVO2max (Tlim) and the time constant of  uptake kinetics (tau). The tau was significantly faster in trained group, both in cycling (EC = 28.2 +/- 4.7s; UC = 63.8 +/- 25.0s) and in running (ER = 28.5 +/- 8.5s; UR = 59.3 +/- 12.0s). Tlim of untrained was significantly lower in cycling (EC = 384.4 +/- 66. vs. UC; 311.1 +/- 105.7 s) and higher in running (ER = 309.2 +/- 176.6 s vs. UR = 439.8 +/- 104.2 s). We conclude that the VO2 kinetic response at the onset of severe exercise, carried out at the same relative intensity is sensitive to endurance training, irrespective of the exercise type. The endurance training seems to differently influence Tlim during exercise at IVO2max in running and cycling.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12652971>Role of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (syndecan-1) on the renal epithelial cells during calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal attachment.</a></h2><p>We have reported that heparan sulfate (HS)/heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG, syndecan-1) expression significantly increased in the rat kidney during calcium oxalate (CaOx) nephrolithiasis. Although the exact role of syndecan still remains unclear, HS/syndecan-1 is thought to have some important role in the CaOx crystal formation. Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are most commonly used in kidney stone research. It was reported that MDCK cells do not express syndecan-1. In the present study, we established a novel MDCK cell line (KIC-synd-1) that expressed the human syndecan-1 gene. In this cell line, we confirmed stable expression of both sndecan-1 gene and core protein. Immunohistochemical study revealed positive staining of syndecan-1 monoclonal antibody in the basolateral and cytosolic area of the KIC-synd-1 cells. We also investigated the composition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) side chains in MDCK cells and KIC-synd-1 cells by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four types of HS chains were identified in both cells as follows; delta diHS-NS, delta diHS-, delta diHS-diS1, delta diHS-diS2. Increased production of delta diHS-NS and delta diHS-diS2 were shown in KIC-synd-1 cells compared with production in MDCK cells (p < 0.05). In contrast, only a small amount of delta diHS- and delta diHS-diS1 was contained in both cell lines. Total amount of HS was significantly increased in the KIC-synd-1 cells compare with that in the wild type MDCK cells (p < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy revealed no significant difference between cell surface of wild type MDCK cells and that of KIC-synd-1 cells in normal conditions. However, calcium oxalate crystal attachment was apparently decreased in the KIC-synd-1 cells. These results suggested that cell surface HS/syndecan-1 has preventive role for calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis via creation of a charge  against COM crystal attachment.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25557367>Mechanistic aspects of the gas-phase reactions of halobenzenes with bare lanthanide cations: a combined experimental/theoretical investigation.</a></h2><p>The gas-phase reactions of chlorobenzene with all atomic lanthanide cations Ln(+) (except Pm(+) ) have been investigated by using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in conjunction with density functional theory calculations.

The first group (n = 68 women) was treated from the preconceptional period until the 24th week of pregnancy with 1.75 g/day myo-inositol, 250 mg/day D-chiro-inositol, 12.5 mg/day Zinc pidolate, 100 mg/day methylsulfonylmethane, 120 mg/day Vitamin C and 400 mcg/day ()-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. The control group (n = 72) was only treated with 400 mcg/day folic acid. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of maternal GDM. Secondary outcome measures were the prevalence of NTDs and fetal macrosomia.A significant difference was found regarding body mass index (BMI), fasting oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), after 1-h-glucose OGTT, 2-h-glucose OGTT, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum folate, between the two groups. Five infants, in the control group, weighted greater than 4 kg. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between HbA1c and OGTT at the 24th week of pregnancy.This study shows the efficacy of preconceptional supplementation of inositol to reduce the risk of the onset of GDM and to confirm the importance of folic acid supplementation to avoid NTDs development. Moreover, the positive correlation between HbA1c and OGTT may be useful to consider the use of HbA1c as a single tool for GDM prevention and diagnosis in selected woman in pregnancy.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15326522>Barriers to internal rotation around the C-N bond in 3-(o-aryl)-5-methyl-rhodanines using NMR spectroscopy and computational studies.

These standards have been harmonized with the corresponding AAMI standards, namely EC11, EC13 and EC38. Together these standards have been in existence for decades and have evolved separately even though the technology used in these three clinical applications is very similar. A work proposal was initiated in the ISO/IEC Joint Work Group 22 (JWG22), which over sees the revision of these standards, to update the standards by creating a single new hybrid standard. The goal of this work is a joint endeavor between ISO and IEC to combine the three separate particular standards that cover ECG device and to harmonize the similar requirements that are common across all three types of devices into one set of general requirements. The requirements that separate specific to meeting the intended use and essential performance for each of the 3 types of devices (diagnostic, patient monitoring, and ambulatory ECG recording) will continue to remain as separate requirements. Furthermore, manufactures of ECG devices have also been required to meet standards for disposable electrodes (AAMI EC12), ECG cables and leadwires (AAMI EC53), and arrhythmia analysis performance reporting (AAMI EC57). In addition to the primary goal, a secondary goal for the JW22 work is to also incorporate these three AAMI standards into the ECG hybrid standard. This paper describes the work being done and highlights key updates, and explains the rationale for approaches and changes being made. The Joint Work Group is currently in the process of updating the committee draft of the new hybrid standard before requesting comments from National Standard Committees participating in JWG22.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Two molecules hypothesized to regulate RNA polymerase are the protein Rsd, which binds to σ, and the non-coding  RNA which binds to the RNA polymerase-σ holoenzyme. Despite multiple studies, the functions of Rsd and  RNA remain controversial. Here we use RNA-Seq in five phases of growth to elucidate their function on a genome-wide scale.

Some of them are involved in the regulation of virulence in pathogenic bacteria. So far, little is known about sRNAs in Bordetella, and only very few sRNAs have been identified in the genome of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough.An in silico approach was used to predict sRNAs genes in intergenic regions of the B. pertussis genome. The genome sequences of B. pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella avium were compared using a Blast, and significant hits were analyzed using RNAz. Twenty-three candidate regions were obtained, including regions encoding the already documented  RNA, and the GCVT and FMN riboswitches. The existence of sRNAs was verified by Northern blot analyses, and transcripts were detected for 13 out of the 20 additional candidates. These new sRNAs were named Bordetella pertussis RNAs, bpr. The expression of 4 of them differed between the early, exponential and late growth phases, and one of them, bprJ2, was found to be under the control of BvgA/BvgS two-component regulatory system of Bordetella virulence. A phylogenetic study of the bprJ sequence revealed a novel, so far undocumented repeat of ~90 bp, found in numerous copies in the Bordetella genomes and in that of other Betaproteobacteria. This repeat exhibits certain features of mobile elements.We shown here that B. pertussis, like other pathogens, expresses sRNAs, and that the expression of one of them is controlled by the BvgA/BvgS system, similarly to most virulence genes, suggesting that it is involved in virulence of B. pertussis.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26529074>Differences in efficiency, satisfaction and adverse events between self-administered intradermal and nurse-administered intramuscular influenza vaccines in hospital workers.</a></h2><p>Vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza takes tens of thousands of hours of work annually.

Of those who self-administered for the first time, 98.5% were successful on their first attempt with an additional 1.5% on their second attempt. Acceptability was high: 96% were very or somewhat certain that they administered the vaccine correctly, 83% would choose intradermal influenza vaccine again and of those, 75% would choose self-administration again, if given the choice.

SPase functions to release proteins that have been translocated into the inner membrane from the cell interior, by cleaving off their signal peptides. We report here the X-ray crystal structure of a catalytically active soluble fragment of E. coli SPase (SPase delta2-75). We have determined this structure at 1.9 A resolution in a complex with an inhibitor, a beta-lactam (5S, penem), which is covalently bound as an acyl-enzyme intermediate to the gamma- of a serine residue at position 90, demonstrating that this residue acts as the nucleophile in the hydrolytic mechanism of signal-peptide cleavage. The structure is consistent with the use by SPase of Lys 145 as a general base in the activation of the nucleophilic Ser90, explains the specificity requirement at the signal-peptide cleavage site, and reveals a large exposed hydrophobic surface which could be a site for an intimate association with the membrane.

Both of these species are too transient to have been characterized experimentally, and the transformation from one to the other has been only partially characterized. The observed requirement of two protons and the formation of water in this transformation suggests a proton-assisted dioxygen bond cleavage as a plausible pathway. However, this pathway is difficult to establish by experiment alone, and the source of the protons in the largely hydrophobic binding pocket of the P450s remains unclear. In this work we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the twice reduced dioxygen substrate-bound form of this isozyme in order to (i) determine the plausibility of the proposed pathway to compound I formation, a proton-assisted cleavage of the dioxygen bond, and (ii) investigate the possible source of these protons. The analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories of this species does indeed provide further evidence for this pathway and points to a source of protons. Specifically, two dynamically stable hydrogen bonds to the distal  atom of the dioxygen ligand, one by the substrate and the other by a bound water, are found, consistent with the proposed proton-assisted cleavage of the bond and formation of water. In addition, an extensive dynamically stable hydrogen bond network is formed that connects the distal  to Glu 360, a well-conserved residue in a channel accessible to solvent that could be the ultimate source of protons. The simulations were done for both a protonated and unprotonated Glu and led to a proposed mechanism of proton transfer by it to the distal  atom. In order to validate the procedures used for the simulation of this transient twice-reduced species, we have used these same procedures to perform molecular dynamics simulations of two other forms of P450eryF, the ferric and ferryl substrate-bound species, and compared the results with experiment. The results for the ferric substrate-bound species were assessed by comparisons to the experimentally determined X-ray structure and fluctuations, and good agreement was found. The simulations performed for the ferryl substrate-bound species led to the correct prediction of the observed regio- and stereospecific hydroxylation of its natural substrate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-DEB) at the  position. The results of these two additional studies lend credibility to the important mechanistic inferences from the simulations of the transient twice reduced dioxygen species: further evidence for a proton-assisted pathway from it to the catalytically active ferryl species and a possible source of the protons.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8185676>Synthesis, biotransformation, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral properties of 5-ethyl-5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxyuridine diastereomers.</a></h2><p>Diastereomers of 5-ethyl-5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxyuridine were synthesized by the regiospecific addition of XOMe (X = Br, Cl) to the 5,6-olefinic bond of 5-ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU). 5-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (HEDU) was identified as a metabolite of the 5-bromo-5-ethyl-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxyuridine diastereomers (BMEDU).

All of these 5-ethyl-5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro compounds, with the exception of (5S,)-BMEDU, had higher AUC values (ranging from 0.32 to 1.20 microM.hr.mL-1) and lower plasma clearances (10-36 mL.min-1) relative to the AUC values (0.14 microM.hr.mL-1) and plasma clearance (85 mL.min-1) of EDU. These BMEDU and CMEDU diastereomers are more lipophilic (log P = -0.42 to 0.40 range) than EDU (log P = -1.09), which should enhance their ability to cross the blood-brain . These 5,6-dihydro compounds showed higher levels (11-22%) of binding to bovine serum albumin than EDU (7%). The BMEDU compounds exhibited equipotent in vitro antiviral activity to EDU against HSV-1 and HSV-2, whereas the CMEDU analogs were inactive.

The low-valence band edge energies of typical oxide semiconductors prevents direct water splitting in compounds with band gaps below 3.0 eV, a limitation which these compounds are designed to overcome through the incorporation of low-lying Ag 4d(10) and Bi (2) states into compounds of nominal composition "AgBiM2O7". It was found that the "AgBiTa2O7" pyrochlores are in fact a solid solution with an approximate range of Ag(x)Bi(5/6)Ta2O(6.25+x/2) with 0.5 < x < 1. The structure of Ag4/5Bi5/6Ta2O6.65 was determined from the refinement of time-of-flight neutron diffraction data and was found to be a cubic pyrochlore with a = 10.52268(2) Å and a volume of 1165.143(6) Å(3). The closely related compound, AgBiNb2O7, appears to have an integer stoichiometry and to adopt an orthorhombically distorted pyrochlore-related structure with a subcell of a = 7.50102(8) Å, b = 7.44739(7) Å, c = 10.5788(1) Å, and V = 590.93(2) Å(3). Density functional theory-based calculations predict this distortion should result from A-site cation ordering. Fits to UV-vis diffuse reflectance data suggest that AgBiNb2O7 and "AgBiTa2O7" are both visible-light-absorbing semiconductors with the onset of strong direct absorption at 2.72 and 2.96 eV, respectively. Electronic structure calculations for an ordered AgBiNb2O7 structure show that the band gap reduction and the elevation of the valence band primarily result from hybridized Ag d(10)-O 2p orbitals that lie at higher energy than the normal O 2p states in typical pyrochlore oxides. While the minimum energy gap is direct in the band structure, the lowest energy dipole allowed optical transitions start about 0.2 eV higher in energy than the minimum energy transition and involve different bands. This suggests that the minimum electronic band gap in these materials is slightly smaller than the onset energy for strong absorption in the optical measurements. The elevated valence band energies of the niobate and tantalate compounds are experimentally confirmed by the ability of these compounds to reduce 2 H(+) to H2 gas when illuminated after functionalization with a Pt cocatalyst.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281143>Coulometric differential FFT admittance voltammetry determination of Amlodipine in pharmaceutical formulation by nano-composite electrode.</a></h2><p>An electrochemical detection technique based on combination of was coulometric differential fast Fourier transformation admittance voltammetry (CDFFTAV) and nano-composite film modified glassy carbon electrode was successfully applied for sensitive determination of Amlodipine. The nano-composite film was made by a mixture of ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4), multiwall carbon nanotube and Au nanoparticles as electrochemical mediators. Studies reveal that the irreversible oxidation of Amlodipine was highly facile on the electrode surface. The electrochemical response was established on calculation of the charge under the admittance peak, which was obtained by discrete integration of the admittance response in a selected potential range, obtained in a flow injection analysis. Once established the best operative optimum conditions, the resulting nano-composite film electrode showed a catalytic effect on the oxidation of the analyte. The response is linear in the Amlodipine concentration range of 1.0 × 10(-9) to 2.0 × 10(-7)M with a detection limit of 1.25 × 10(-10)M. Moreover, the proposed technique exhibited high sensitivity, fast response time (less than ) and long-term stability and reproducibility around 96%, and it was successfully used to the determination of Amlodipine content in the pharmaceutical formulation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Among molecular mechanisms, activation of BDNF receptor TrkB along with the inhibition of GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) are considered as critical molecular level determinants for ketamine's antidepressant effects. Hydroxynorketamines (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,)-HNK), non-anesthetic metabolites of ketamine, have been proposed to govern the therapeutic effects of ketamine through a mechanism not involving NMDARs. However, we have shown that nitrous oxide, another NMDAR blocking anesthetic and a putative rapid-acting antidepressant, evokes TrkB-GSK3β signaling alterations during rebound slow EEG (electroencephalogram) oscillations. We investigated here the acute effects of ketamine, 6,6-d-ketamine (a ketamine analogue resistant to ) and cis-HNK that contains (2R,6R) and (2S,) enantiomers in 1:1 ratio, on TrkB-GSK3β signaling and concomitant electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations in the adult mouse cortex. Ketamine dose-dependently increased slow oscillations and phosphorylations of TrkB and GSK3β in crude brain homogenates (i.e. sedative/anesthetic doses (>50 mg/kg, i.p.) produced more prominent effects than a subanesthetic dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.)). Similar, albeit less obvious, effects were seen in crude synaptosomes. A sedative dose of 6,6-d-ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) recapitulated the effects of ketamine on TrkB and GSK3β phosphorylation while cis-HNK at a dose of 20 mg/kg produced negligible acute effects on TrkB-GSK3β signaling or slow oscillations. These findings suggest that the acute effects of ketamine on TrkB-GSK3β signaling are by no means restricted to subanesthetic (i.e. antidepressant) doses and that cis-HNK is not responsible for these effects.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In that study four sward types were investigated: a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) only sward receiving 163 kg nitrogen per hectare per year (N/ha/yr) (PRG); a perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens) sward receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (PRGWC); a six species sward (two grasses (perennial ryegrass and timothy (Phleum pratense)), two legumes (white and red clover (Trifolium pratense)) and two herbs (ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and chicory (Cichorium intybus)) receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (); and a nine species sward containing cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), greater birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus pedunculatus) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium) in addition to the six species listed above, receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (9S). Each sward type was managed as a separate farmlet and stocked with 30 twin-rearing ewes at a stocking rate of 12.5 ewes/ha under rotational grazing management from turnout post-lambing until housing. Lamb live  was recorded fortnightly and lambs were drafted for slaughter at 45 kg. Ewe live  and  condition score (BCS) were recorded on five occasions annually. Lamb faecal egg count (FEC) was recorded fortnightly and lambs were treated with anthelmintics when mean lamb FEC per sward type was above 400 eggs per gram. Ewes grazing the  and 9S swards had heavier (P &lt; 0.01) live  and BCS throughout the study than the ewes grazing the PRG sward. Lambs grazing the  sward were heavier than lambs grazing all other sward types of 14 weeks old (P &lt; 0.05).

This study assessed the feasibility of the cartridge-based TEG   system (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, Massachusetts, United States) to monitor and quantify the effect of unfractionated and low-molecular- heparin (UFH and LMWH). Blood samples from healthy donors were spiked with UFH (   = 23; 0-1.0 IU/mL) or LMWH (enoxaparin;   = 22; 0-1.5 IU/mL). Functional fibrinogen maximum amplitude (CFF.MA), RapidTEG activated clotting time (CRT.ACT), and kaolin and kaolin with heparinase reaction time (CK.R and CKH.R) were evaluated for their correlation with heparin concentrations, as well as the combination parameters ΔCK.R - CKH.R, ratio CK.R/CKH.R, and ratio CKH.R/CK.R. Nonlinear mixed-effect modelling was used to study the relationship between concentrations and parameters, and Bayesian classification modelling for the prediction of therapeutic ranges. CK.R and CRT.ACT strongly correlated with the activity of LMWH and UFH (   < 0.001). Using combination parameters, heparin activity could be accurately quantified in the range of 0.05 to 0.8 IU/mL for UFH and 0.1 to 1.5 IU/mL for LMWH. CRT.ACT was able to quantify heparin activity at higher concentrations but was only different from the reference range (   < 0.05) at >0.5 IU/mL for UFH and >1.5 IU/mL for LMWH. Combination parameters classified blood samples into subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic heparin ranges, with an accuracy of >90% for UFH, and >78% for LMWH. This study suggests that TEG  can effectively monitor and quantify heparin activity for LMWH and UFH.

The action of episodic hypoxia might be related to low  itself (hypoxemia) and/or combined with low CO2 (hypocapnia) resulting from hyperventilation. It is unknown whether or not the cardiovascular abnormalities are related to alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) that may be manifested as neurotransmitter and/or behavioral changes. In this study, we investigated effects of episodic eucapnic and hypocapnic hypoxia on monoamine metabolism in both CNS and adrenal glands, and on motor behavioral activity. Thirty-five male rats were divided into 3 groups. Experimental rats were exposed 8 h daily to varying fractional concentrations of inspired  (FiO2) and carbon dioxide (FiCO2) for 35 days. These consisted of brief exposures (3-) of episodic (twice every min) eucapnic (3.5% FiO2 and 10% FiCO2, n = 6) or hypocapnic (3.5% FiO2 and 0% FiCO2, n = 14) hypoxia, or room air (21% FiO2 and 0.03% FiCO2, n = 15). Norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and adrenal glands were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Spontaneous behavioral activity was assessed for 30 min by automated activity monitors. Episodic hypocapnic hypoxia produced a decrease in dopamine turnover and eucapnic hypoxia increased norepinephrine levels in the hypothalamus. Animals exposed to hypocapnic hypoxia also exhibited a consistent increase in horizontal (walking) and vertical (rearing) activity, as well as in total activity time. From these results, it is concluded that episodic eucapnic and hypocapnic hypoxia may affect metabolism of different neurotransmitters in the CNS.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29229534>A novel compound DT-010 protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in zebrafish and H9c2 cells by inhibiting reactive  species-mediated apoptotic and autophagic pathways.</a></h2><p>Doxorubicin (Dox) is an effective anti-cancer agent but limited by its cardiotoxicity, thus the search for pharmacological agents for enhancing anti-cancer activities and protecting against cardiotoxicity has been a subject of great interest. We have previously reported the synergistic anti-cancer effects of a novel compound DT-010. In the present study, we further investigated the cardioprotective effects of DT-010 in zebrafish embryos in vivo and the molecular underlying mechanisms in H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. We showed that DT-010 prevented the Dox-induced morphological distortions in the zebrafish heart and the associated cardiac impairments, and especially improved ventricular functions. By using H9c2 cells model, we showed that DT-010 directly inhibited the generation of reactive  species by Dox and protected cell death and cellular damage. We further observed that DT-010 protected against Dox-induced myocardiopathy via inhibiting downstream molecular pathways in response to oxidative stress, including reactive  species-mediated MAPK signaling pathways ERK and JNK, and apoptotic pathways involving the activation of caspase 3, caspase 7, and PARP signaling. Recent studies also suggest the importance of alterations in cardiac autophagy in Dox cardiotoxicity. We further showed that DT-010 could inhibit the induction of autophagosomes formation by Dox via regulating the upstream Akt/AMPK/mTOR signaling. Since Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is multifactorial, our results suggest that multi-functional agent such as DT-010 might be an effective therapeutic agent for combating cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapeutic agents such as Dox.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As revealed by NMR and molecular dynamics simulations, the fCS repeating unit adopts a conformation similar to that of the Le(x) blood group determinant, bringing several sulfate groups into close proximity and creating large negative patches distributed along the helical skeleton of the CS backbone. This may explain the high affinity of fCS oligosaccharides for L- and P-selectins as determined by microarray binding of fCS oligosaccharides prepared by Cu(2+)-catalyzed Fenton-type and photochemical depolymerization. No binding to E-selectin was observed. fCS poly- and oligosaccharides display low cytotoxicity in vitro, inhibit human neutrophil elastase activity, and inhibit the migration of neutrophils through an endothelial cell layer in vitro. Although the polysaccharide showed some anti-coagulant activity, small oligosaccharide fCS fragments had much reduced anticoagulant properties, with activity mainly via heparin cofactor II. The fCS polysaccharides showed prekallikrein activation comparable with dextran sulfate, whereas the fCS oligosaccharides caused almost no effect. The H. forskali fCS oligosaccharides were also tested in a mouse peritoneal  model, where they caused a reduction in neutrophil infiltration. Overall, the data presented support the action of fCS as an inhibitor of selectin interactions, which play vital roles in  and metastasis progression. Future studies of fCS-selectin interaction using fCS fragments or their mimetics may open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30316116>Niobium doped tungsten oxide mesoporous film with enhanced electrochromic and electrochemical  storage properties.</a></h2><p>Exploring high performance cathode materials is of great means for the development of bi-functional electrochromic  storage devices.

Franquet (B. paniculatum), also named "Tu-bei-mu" in Chinese folk medicines, has been described in application for the treatment of tumors, warts,  and toxication in traditional Chinese medicinal books. The major constituents in B. paniculatum are triterpenoid saponins, which have been proved to possess dramatically cytotoxic activity and antivirus activity. The aim of this study is to isolate and identify the active triterpenoid saponin from the bulb of B. paniculatum by a bioassay-guided method.Four cucurbitacine triterpenoid sapogenins and 11 triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the active EtOAc and n-BuOH extract of B. paniculatum by using bioassay-guided screening. Their structures were elucidated based on the spectroscopic methods and compared with published data. Cytotoxic activities of isolated compounds were determined by MTT assay.Four cucurbitacine triterpenoid sapogenins, isocucurbitacin B(1), 23,24-dihydroisocucurbitacin B(2), cucurbitacin E(3), 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin E(4), and 11 triterpenoid saponins, tubeimosideI(5), tubeimoside III(6), tubeimoside V(7), dexylosyltubeimoside III(8), lobatoside C(9), tubeimoside A(10), tumeimoside B(11), lobatoside A(12), tubeimoside C(13), tubeimoside IV(14), 7β,18,20,26-tetrahydroxy-(20S)-dammar-24E-en-3-O-α-L-(4-acetyl)arabinopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranoside(15) were isolated from the active EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts. Of them, compounds 2, 4, 9 and 12 were firstly isolated from the Bolbostemma genus. MTT assay revealed that compounds 1, 3 and 4 had significantly activities against HeLa and HT-29 human cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.93 to 9.73μM. It is worth mentioning that compound 4׳s activities against the two cell lines are 12- and 8-fold that of the positive control drug (5-Fu). Whereas, the cyclic bisdesmosides 5-9 exerted significantly activities on BGC-823, HeLa, HT-29 and MCF-7 cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 1.30 to 15.64μM. And 6׳s activities against the four cell lines are 6-, 3-, 10- and 16-fold that of 5-Fu and 8׳s activities against the four cell lines are 5-, 3-, 14- and 9-fold that of 5-Fu.The cytotoxic activity of the bulbs of B. paniculatum is mainly ascribable to cucurbitacine triterpenoid sapogenins (1-4) and the cyclic bisdesmosides (5-9). The cyclic bisdesmosides are the main anti-cancer active compounds of B. paniculatum. The above results provide scientific evidence to support, to some extent, the ethnomedicinal use of B. paniculatum as anticancer remedies in traditional Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We argue that a charge disproportionation 3Cr(4+) → 2Cr(3+) + Cr(6+) in association with the -p hybridization on the Pb(2+) is responsible for the insulating ground state of PbCrO3 at ambient pressure and the charge disproportionation phase is suppressed under pressure to give rise to a metallic phase at high pressure. The model is well supported by density function theory plus the correlation  U (DFT+U) calculations.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15537878>Assessing the role of GLUK5 and GLUK6 at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.</a></h2><p>It has been suggested recently that presynaptic kainate receptors (KARs) are involved in short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Using genetic deletion and pharmacology, we here assess the role of GLU(K5) and GLU(K6) in synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. We found that the kainate-induced facilitation was completely abolished in the GLU(K6)-/- mice, whereas it was unaffected in the GLU(K5)-/-. Consistent with this finding, synaptic facilitation was reduced in the GLU(K6)(-/-) and was normal in the GLU(K5)-/-. In agreement with these results and ruling out any compensatory effects in the genetic deletion models, application of the GLU(K5)-specific antagonist LY382884 [(3S,4aR,,8aR)-6-(4-carboxyphenyl)methyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid] did not affect short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity at the hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.

High blood cholesterol is one of the major cardiovascular risk factors and plays a crucial role in causing cardiovascular disease. A strong positive and linear association between total and LDL cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events has been widely documented. Every 1.0 mmol/l decrease in LDL cholesterol levels results in a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. Lipid-lowering guidelines suggest as first step the use of statins as monotherapy and, in case of failure to achieve the recommended targets, combination therapy of statins with other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as ezetimibe. The results from the recent IMPROVE-IT trial provide evidence that further LDL-cholesterol lowering beyond the recommended targets significantly reduces the rate of cardiovascular events, supporting the concept that "Lower Is Better" while additional long-term data are collected. Non-adherence to statin therapy, often due to adverse drug reactions, results in an increased risk for cardiovascular events. In a non-negligible proportion of patients with hypercholesterolemia receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy, the residual risk remains high. In addition, statin use has been associated with accelerated onset of  in individuals already predisposed to developing . In conclusion, it is clear that statins are not the universal solution to the problem of high cholesterol levels, and the optimization of lipid-lowering therapy remains a therapeutic challenge.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29369106>Evidence-Based Practice in Liposuction.</a></h2><p>The goal of this study is to examine the existing peer reviewed literature comparing modern adjunctive techniques in liposuction including laser-assisted liposuction (LAL) and ultrasound-assisted liposuction (UAL) to standard suction-assisted liposuction (SAL).

A common attribute of all of the neutral species is that the Ce centers in both the molecules and clusters are in the +4 oxidation state. In bulk ceria (CeO), an unoccupied, narrow 4f band lies between the conventional valence (predominantly O 2p) and conduction (Ce 5d) bands. Within the CeO, CeOH, and Ce(OH) series, the PE spectra and computational results suggest that the Ce -based molecular orbital is the singly occupied HOMO in CeO but becomes destabilized as the Ce 4f-local orbital becomes stabilized with increasing coordination. CeO, a hyperoxide, undergoes photodissociation with 3.49 eV photon  to form the stoichiometric neutral CeO and O. In the CeO, CeO ,and CeO stoichiometric cluster series, the  destabilization with 4f stabilization is associated with increasing cluster size, suggesting that a bulk-like band structure may be realized with fairly small cluster sizes. The destabilization of the -based molecular orbitals can be rationalized by their diffuse size relative to Ce-O bond lengths in a crystal structure, suggesting that  bands in the bulk may be relegated to the surface.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240127>One-pot synthesis of magnetite nanorods/graphene composites and its catalytic activity toward electrochemical detection of dopamine.</a></h2><p>Magnetite (Fe3O4) nanorods anchored over reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were synthesized through a one-pot synthesis method, where the reduction of GO and in-situ generation of Fe3O4 nanorods occurred concurrently.

In the present work, we report an extensive DFT study of its geometric and electronic structure, composition in solution, and reactivity. The thermodynamic data and calculated (195)Pt NMR chemical shifts reveal that one solvent molecule is weakly coordinated to the complex in acetone solution. This ancillary ligand is responsible for the diamagnetic state of the complex, retards intramolecular  transfer, and facilitates CO oxidation. Chemical transformations of the coordinated acetone molecule, coordination of other ancillary ligands present in the reaction mixture, and protonation of the Pt-oxo group in nonacidic media are excluded based on thermodynamic or kinetic considerations. Bonding of the terminal oxo ligand with strong electrophiles presents the key interaction in the mechanisms of intramolecular  insertion into the Pt-P bond, in CO oxidation and in water activation mediated by microsolvation. Low affinity of the terminal oxo ligand toward "soft" covalent interactions brings about intermediate formation of agostic hydrido and hydroxo complexes along the reaction pathway of dihydrogen oxidation. Stabilization of the Pt-oxo bonding is attributed to bending of the terminal oxo ligand out of the plane of the complex and to significant transfer of electron density from compact low lying Pt 5d orbitals to more diffuse  and 6p orbitals.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886108>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of trans-β-Aryl-δ-hydroxy-γ-lactones and Enzymatic Kinetic Resolution of Their Racemic Mixtures.</a></h2><p>Two novel and convenient routes to obtain enantiomerically enriched -β-aryl-δ-hydroxy-γ-lactones - with potential antifeedant and anticancer activity were developed.

Carcinogenesis alters lipid  to facilitate cell growth and survival. For instance, metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with increasing colon cell proliferation. Moreover, precancerous colon lesions (i.e. adenomas) increase the risk for colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigated associations between plasma PUFAs and the number of colon polyps and polyp type (i.e. hyperplastic and adenoma). Healthy male participants (n=126) of 48-65 years of age were recruited before a routine colonoscopy screening. Plasma phospholipid (PPL) PUFAs were isolated by means of solid phase extraction and methylated. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed using gas chromatography. Factor analysis was used to cluster PUFAs into groups, and then generated factors and individual PUFAs were analyzed using polytomous logistic regression. In our age-adjusted and smoking-adjusted polytomous logistic regression, for each unit increase in PPL docosatetraenoic acid (DTA), individuals were 1.43 (1.00-2.06) and 1.33 (0.99-1.80) times more likely to have hyperplastic polyps and adenomas rather than no polyps, respectively. In our factor analysis, high PPL ω-6 PUFA and trans-fatty acid loading scores were associated with increased odds of adenoma presence rather than no polyps. Increases in long-chain PPL ω-6 PUFAs are associated with an increased risk for adenomas. As relative levels of DTA increase in PPLs, individuals had increased odds of having hyperplastic polyps and adenomas.

Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptors in the development of neurogenic  in the pelvis and pelvic organ cross-sensitization. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that desensitization of TRPV1 receptors in the urinary bladder can minimize the effects of cross-sensitization induced by experimental colitis on excitability of bladder spinal neurons. Extracellular activity of bladder neurons was recorded in response to graded urinary bladder distension (UBD) in rats pretreated with intravesical resiniferatoxin (RTX, 10(-7)M). Colonic  was induced by intracolonic instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The duration of excitatory responses to noxious UBD during acute colonic  (3 days post-TNBS) was significantly shortened in the group with RTX pretreatment (25.3±1.5s, n=49) when compared to the control group (35.1±4.2s, n=43, p<0.05). The duration of long-lasting excitatory responses, but not short-lasting responses of bladder spinal neurons during acute colitis was significantly reduced by RTX from 52.9±6.

The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial demonstrated that in patients who survived >2 years, there was a significant advantage to infrainguinal bypass compared with endovascular intervention, which increased with time. Validated survival models for patients with CLTI are lacking.The Vascular Quality Initiative was interrogated for patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass or endovascular intervention for CLTI (January 2003-February 2017). Cox survival models were generated using only preoperative variables. Survival at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years was modeled separately. Patients were defined as low risk (30-day survival >97% and 2-year survival >70%), medium risk (30-day survival 95%-97% or 2-year survival 50%-70%), and high-risk (30-day survival <95% or 2-year survival <50%).Among 38,470 unique CLTI patients, 63% (n = 24,214) underwent endovascular intervention and 37% (n = 14,256) underwent infrainguinal bypass. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years were 98%, 81%, and 69%, respectively. The proportion of patients in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups was 84%, 10%, and 6.5%, respectively. Patients in the low-risk group were significantly less likely to undergo endovascular intervention compared with those in the high-risk group (low risk, 59% endovascular; high risk, 75% endovascular; P < .0001). Independent predictors of death were similar in all three models, with greatest magnitude of effect associated with age >80 years, -dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and bedbound status. The C index for the 30-day model, 2-year model, and 5-year model was 0.76, 0.72, and 0.71, respectively. Procedure type (open or endovascular) was not significant in any models and did not have an impact on C indices.These survival prediction models, derived from a large U.S. cohort of patients who underwent revascularization for CLTI, demonstrated good performance and should be validated. Most CLTI patients considered candidates for limb salvage were of average perioperative risk and were predicted to survive beyond 2 years. These models can differentiate patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups to facilitate evidence-based revascularization recommendations that are consistent with current treatment guidelines.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

However, this function only becomes apparent when other processing enzymes are absent, raising the question of its primary physiological role. Here, we show that RNase BN itself is subject to growth phase-dependent regulation, because both rbn mRNA and RNase BN protein are at their highest levels in early exponential phase, but then decrease dramatically and are essentially absent in stationary phase. As a consequence of this variation, certain small RNAs, such as  RNA, remain low in exponential phase cells, and increase greatly in stationary phase. RNase BN affects  RNA abundance by decreasing its stability in exponential phase. RNase BN levels increase rapidly as cells exit stationary phase and are primarily responsible for the decrease in  RNA that accompanies this process. Purified RNase BN directly cleaves  RNA as shown by in vitro assays, and the  RNA:pRNA duplex is an even more favorable substrate of RNase BN. The exoribonuclease activity of RNase BN is unnecessary because all its action on  RNA is due to endonucleolytic cleavages. These data indicate that RNase BN plays an important role in determining levels of the global transcription regulator,  RNA, throughout the growth cycle.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7749919>Structure of cytochrome P450eryF involved in erythromycin biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450eryF catalyzes the -hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, the initial reaction in a multistep pathway to convert 6-deoxyerythronolide B into the antibiotic, erythromycin.

To determine the anticancer activity of the tested compounds, cell viability and cell  activity were checked using propidium iodide staining and the MTT test.

The investigated isomers exerted higher activity against canine lymphoma/leukemia cell lines than against mammary tumors, whereas the configuration of stereogenic centers of the examined compounds affected their activity.

In chronic bronchitis, the major disease of large airways, chronic mucus hypersecretion, is reflected by an increase in size of bronchial mucous glands. This may be a factor in airway narrowing, especially with coexisting edema of the airway wall. Excess intralumenal mucus compounds the obstruction. Increased airways reactivity is present in 15 to 70 percent of patients with chronic airflow obstruction.

The results show that when n = 12-15, the most stable structures are predicted to be exohedral frameworks with a quartet ground state, but when n = 16-20, they are predicted to be endohedral frameworks with a sextuplet ground state. These trend in stability across the clusters (gauged from their dissociation energies) was found to be approximately the same regardless of the DFT scheme used in the calculations, with HoSi13, HoSi16, HoSi18, and HoSi20 calculated to be more stable than the other clusters. The results obtained for cluster hardness indicated that doping the Ho atom into Si13 and Si16 leads to the most stable HoSi n clusters, while doping Ho into the other Si n clusters increases the photochemical sensitivity of the cluster. Analyses of intracluster charge transfer and magnetic moments revealed that charge always shifts from the Ho atom to the Si n cluster during the creation of exohedral HoSi n (n = 12-15) structures. However, the direction of charge transfer is reversed during the creation of endohedral HoSi n (n = 16-20) structures, which implies that Ho acts as an electron acceptor when it is encapsulated in the Si n cage. Furthermore, when the most stable exohedral HoSi n (n = 12-15) structures are generated, the 4f electrons of Ho are virtually unchanged and barely participate in intracluster bonding. However, in the most stable endohedral HoSi n (n = 16-20) frameworks, a 4f electron does participate in bonding.

The antioxidant potential of the partial isolates was evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging assay and mesangial cellular assay. Compounds 2, rel-(2α,3β)-7-O-methylcedrusin (4), syringylglycerol-8-O-4-(sinapyl alcohol) ether (5), and (+)-syringaresinol (7) were found to be most active on DPPH assay, whereas compounds 2, 4, 7, (1R,2R,5R,)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane, and buddlenol E could significantly inhibit high glucose-stimulated reactive  species production in mesangial cells.

For this isotypic series, B = P is pyromorphite, B = As is mimetite and B = V is vanadinite. The ionic radius for As (0.355 Å) is similar to that of V (0.335 Å), and this is twice as large as that for P (0.170 Å). However, the c unit-cell parameter for mimetite is surprisingly different from that of vanadinite, although their unit-cell volumes, V, are almost equal to each other. No explanation was available for this peculiar c-axis value for mimetite. Structural parameters such as average 〈B-O〉 [4], 〈Pb1-O〉 [9] and 〈Pb2-OCl〉 [8] distances increase linearly with V (the coordination numbers for the cations are given in square brackets). Mimetite has a short Pb2-O1 distance, so the O1  atom interacts with the  lone-pair electrons of the Pb cation that causes the Cl-Cl distance (= c/2) to increase to the largest value in the series because of repulsion, which causes the c-axis to increase anomalously. Although Pb apatite minerals occur naturally in ore deposits, they are also formed as scaly deposits in lead water pipes that give rise to lead in tap water, as was found recently in Flint, Michigan, USA. It is important to identify Pb-containing phases in water-pipe deposits.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26810483>Markers of endothelial damage and coagulation impairment in patients with severe sepsis resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42 vs Ringer acetate.</a></h2><p>The Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock () trial showed increased mortality in patients resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42 (HES) vs Ringer acetate. Different effects of the fluids on the endothelium may have contributed to the observed outcome. We aimed to investigate associations between HES vs Ringer and changes in plasma biomarkers reflecting endothelial damage and coagulation impairment.Six biomarkers, including soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), were assessed in a subgroup of 208 patients from the  trial. We analyzed differences in plasma concentration in the 2 intervention groups using linear or logistic regression models.The increase in plasma sTM was lower in the HES group (-1.8 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval, -2.9 to -0.7; P = .002). The change was not statistically significant associated with mortality whereas increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was (odds ratio for 1-unit increase, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.08; P = .01).Resuscitation with HES vs Ringer decreased early endothelial damage. Although this finding should be interpreted with caution, it indicates that the increased mortality observed with HES in the  trial may not be explained by endothelial damage and it emphasizes the challenge of using surrogate markers as outcome.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

()-8-Methyl-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-7,10-dione (alaptide), has been studied as a potential chemical permeation enhancer. Based on its structure, four selected piperazine-2,5-diones were synthesized by means of multi-step synthetic . All the compounds were investigated on their ability to enhance the permeation of the model drug theophylline from the hydrophilic medium propylene glycol:water (1:1). In vitro experiments were performed using vertical Franz diffusion cells at constant temperature 34 ± 0.5 °C and using full-thickness pig ( f. ) ear skin. Withdrawn samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC for determination of the permeated amount of theophylline. All the compounds were applied in ratio 1:10 (/) relative to the amount of theophylline. One hour after application, the permeated amount of theophylline from formulations with alaptide and (3,6)-3,6-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-dione, was ca. 15- and 12-fold higher, respectively, than from the formulation without the tested compounds. Despite the enhancement ratio of both enhancers in a steady state was ca. 2.3, the pseudo-enhancement ratio in the time range from 1 to 3 h was 4.4. These enhancement ratios indicate that the compounds are able to enhance the permeation of agents through the skin; however, the short-term application of both compound formulations seems to be more advantageous.

The identified metabolites were grouped into pathways in order to assess global responses.Treatment with (2R,6R)-HNK elicited the significant change in 49 metabolites and associated pathways implicated in fundamental mitochondrial functions such as TCA cycle, branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway, glycoxylate metabolic pathway, and fatty acid β-oxidation. The affected metabolites included glycerate, citrate, leucine, N,N-dimethylglycine, 3-hexenedioic acid, and carnitine and attenuated signals associated with 9 fatty acids and elaidic acid.

However, the mechanism by which this occurs continues to be nebulous. The relationship between OPN and inflammation-suppressing lymphocytes present in the human AAA condition was investigated and presented herein.Serum OPN concentrations were measured in healthy, risk factor-matched non-AAA and AAA patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the source of OPN secretion using aortic tissue collected from multiorgan donors and AAA patients undergoing open surgical repair. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to various inflammatory mediators, and OPN expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. The inflammatory nature of OPN and the aortic wall was determined using a TR1 suppressor cell induction assay as a surrogate and characterized by ELISA and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.OPN was found to be elevated in both the plasma and aortic homogenate of AAA patients compared with controls. On immunohistochemistry, OPN localized to the tunica media of the diseased aorta but was minimally expressed in healthy aorta. In vitro, cigarette smoke extract was the most potent stimulator of OPN secretion by VSMCs and increased both messenger RNA and supernatant concentrations. OPN demonstrated an ability to inhibit the induction of interleukin 10-secreting TR1 lymphocytes, a depleted population in the AAA patient, from naive precursors. Last, neutralizing receptor targets of OPN in the setting of AAA homogenate coincubation abrogated the inhibition of TR1 induction.OPN, secreted by the VSMCs of the tunica media, is elevated in the circulating plasma and aortic wall of patients with AAA. It can inhibit the induction of the TR1 suppressor cell, leading to an overall proinflammatory state contributing to progressive aortic wall breakdown and dilation.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Gastric residual beverage volume (GRBV) at each sampling time point was not different among 2S, 4S, , 8S, and water (P > 0.05). The 8G resulted in a significantly greater GRBV compared with other beverages at 20, 30, and 40 min (P < 0.05).

Optimal conditions for this mode were found by using a 750nm interference filter and  flows to the worker flames of this device that were about 10mL/min larger than those used for monitoring quadratic S2* emission. By employing these parameters, this mode provided a linear response over about 4 orders of magnitude, with a detection limit near 5.8×10(-11)gS/s and a selectivity of sulfur over carbon of about 3.5×10(3). Specifically, the minimum detectable masses for 10 different sulfur analytes investigated ranged from 0.4 to 3.6ng for peak half-widths spanning 4-. The response toward ten different sulfur compounds was examined and produced an average reproducibility of 1.7% RSD (n=10) and an average equimolarity value of 1.0±0.1. In contrast to this, a conventional single flame S2* mode comparatively yielded respective values of 6.7% RSD (n=10) and 1.1±0.4. HSO* emission in the mFPD was also found to be relatively much less affected by response quenching due to hydrocarbons compared to a conventional single flame S2* emission mode.

Tyramine was detected by the electrochemical reduction at -0.1V of the o- enzymatically-formed dopaquinone. Three different CaPs were explored as immobilization systems, monetite, brushite and brushite cement. Biosensors based on brushite matrices provide better analytical properties than the monetite one. Compared to brushite, a 10-fold increase of sensitivity was obtained with the brushite cement-based biosensor, which highlights the effect of brushite crystal formation in the presence of the enzyme in the biosensor performance. Several variables involved in the enzyme immobilization method such as glutaraldehyde cross-linking time, PPO/brushite ratio and thickness of the brushite-enzyme film were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of pH and temperature on biosensor performance were also optimized. Brushite cement-PPO-GA biosensor resulted in a reliable, highly sensitive, fast, inexpensive and easy analytical method for tyramine detection. Under optimal conditions (time of 15min, a ratio of 1.0 and 50μg of the brushite-enzyme mixture, 20°C and pH 6,0), a linear range of 5.8 × 10 to 1.6 × 10, sensitivity 1.50 × 10mAM cm, detection limit, 4.85 × 10M and a response time,  were obtained.

We found that Kr, Ar, and Ne atoms can be used to switch the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) channel from 3408 nm (6p[1/2]-'[1/2]) to 3680 nm (5d[1/2]-6p[1/2]), while Xe and He atoms do not show such a phenomenon. This ASE channel switch is mainly ascribed to the fast transfer of 6p[1/2] → 5d[1/2]. On the basis of the rate equations for two-state coupling (-transfer processes between the two states are very rapid), the reason why the ASE channel switch effect normally coincides with a double exponential decay of the spontaneous emission at 828 nm (6p[1/2]-[3/2]) is explained. The actual situations in Xe, Ar, Ne, and He follow this rule. However, the strictly single exponential decay of the spontaneous emission at 828 nm and strong ASE channel switch effect simultaneously emerge in Kr. This indicates that the transfer of 6p[1/2] → 5d[1/2] in Kr does not occur via two-state coupling, but via two steps of near-resonance collision through the 5s[3/2] (Kr) state as the intermediate state (6p[1/2] → 5s[3/2] (Kr) → 5d[1/2]). In addition, we found Xe (6p[1/2]) atoms strongly tend to reach the 6p[3/2], 6p[3/2], and 6p[5/2] states through the 5s[3/2] (Kr) state as the intermediate state in Kr. The 5s[3/2] (Kr) state plays a very important role in the -transfer kinetics for the Xe (6p[1/2]) atoms.

We conducted in vitro experiments to determine the effects of fresh frozen plasma, thawed plasma, solvent/detergent plasma, and an investigational spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma product on monocyte function.Monocytes were isolated from healthy adult volunteers and cocultured with aliquots of autologous plasma (control), fresh frozen plasma, thawed plasma, solvent/detergent treated plasma, or spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma. Monocyte function was assessed by cytokine production with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and flow cytometric assessment of HLA-DR cell surface expression.Monocyte cytokine production was not significantly altered after exposure to fresh frozen plasma or thawed plasma. In the absence of LPS, spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma exposure resulted in markedly increased IL-8 production compared to other plasma groups and controls (p = 0.01, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Likewise, spray-dried SD plasma exposure resulted in higher LPS-induced IL-8, TNFα, and IL-1β production compared with autologous plasma controls (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001, p = 0.002, respectively; ANOVA). LPS-induced IL-8 and TNFα production was lowest after exposure to solvent/detergent plasma (p < 0.0001, ANOVA).Exposure to spray-dried solvent/detergent plasma resulted in marked augmentation of monocyte inflammatory cytokine production. Solvent/detergent plasma exposure resulted in the lowest cytokine production, suggesting lower immunomodulatory potential.

The AST is a track consisting of 5-7 fundamental movement skill tasks that should be completed as fast as possible. The children performed the test during a regular physical education (PE) lesson under the supervision of their own PE teacher. For each version of the AST (AST-1: n=917; AST-2: n=3947; AST-3: n=3213) age- and gender-related reference centiles were derived from the gathered data using the Lambda, Mu, Sigma (LMS) method.All children completed the AST within 60s (mean 29., SD 7.7). An independent samples t-test showed that boys were significantly faster in completing the track than girls, except for the 4-year-old boys. Therefore, age- and gender-related reference centiles were derived. The reference curves demonstrate an almost linear decrease in time to complete AST-1 and AST-2 with increasing age.The present study provides age- and gender-related normative values and MQ values for the AST among 4- to 12-year-old Dutch children. With these normative values PE teachers can interpret children's performance on the AST.Copyright © 2018 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive spectroscopy show that graphene oxide-coated nanocellulose was partially reduced by both thermal treatment, and further reduced by chemical treatment (ascorbic acid). Fractal nanoplatinum with cauliflower-like morphology was formed on the reduced graphene oxide paper using pulsed sonoelectrodeposition, producing a conductive paper with an extremely high electroactive surface area (0.29±0.13cm(2)), confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The platinum surface was functionalized with either glucose oxidase (via chitosan encapsulation) or a RNA aptamer (via covalent linking) for demonstration as a point of care biosensor. The detection limit for both glucose (0.08±0.02μM) and E. coli O157:H7 (≈4 CFUmL(-1)) were competitive with, or superior to, previously reported devices in the biosensing literature. The response time ( for glucose and 12min for E. coli) were also similar to silicon biochip and commercial electrode sensors. The results demonstrate that the nanocellulose-graphene-nanoplatinum material is an excellent paper-based platform for development of electrochemical biosensors targeting small molecules or whole cells for use in point of care biosensing.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of Bcrp and Pgp on digoxin exposures in brain and CSF was investigated in wild-type mice in the presence of the inhibitors. In vivo studies showed dantrolene exposures in brain and CSF, but not the blood, increased in Bcrp(-/-) and Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice, or in the presence of the Bcrp inhibitors Ko143 or GF120918. Inhibition of Pgp by GF120918 and PSC833 significantly increased digoxin exposures in brain, CSF, and blood to a lesser extent. Results from the present study demonstrated that inhibition of Bcrp and Pgp increased not only the exposures of dantrolene and digoxin in brain, but also the exposures in CSF. In addition, the change of exposures in CSF reflected the changes in brain. The present study strongly suggests that the dantrolene and digoxin exposures in CSF are primarily determined by the rapid transport from brain to CSF, and inhibition of Bcrp and Pgp exhibits little impact on using CSF as surrogates to assess brain exposures of Bcrp and Pgp substrates.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27144355>NMDAR inhibition-independent antidepressant actions of ketamine metabolites.</a></h2><p>Major depressive disorder affects around 16 per cent of the world population at some point in their lives. Despite the availability of numerous monoaminergic-based antidepressants, most patients require several weeks, if not months, to respond to these treatments, and many patients never attain sustained remission of their symptoms. The non-competitive, glutamatergic NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine exerts rapid and sustained antidepressant effects after a single dose in patients with depression, but its use is associated with undesirable side effects. Here we show that the  of (R,S)-ketamine to (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) is essential for its antidepressant effects, and that the (2R,6R)-HNK enantiomer exerts behavioural, electroencephalographic, electrophysiological and cellular antidepressant-related actions in mice. These antidepressant actions are independent of NMDAR inhibition but involve early and sustained activation of AMPARs (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors). We also establish that (2R,6R)-HNK lacks ketamine-related side effects. Our data implicate a novel mechanism underlying the antidepressant properties of (R,S)-ketamine and have relevance for the development of next-generation, rapid-acting antidepressants.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408328>Total Synthesis and Structure Revision of (-)-Illisimonin A, a Neuroprotective Sesquiterpenoid from the Fruits of .</a></h2><p>Illisimonin A was isolated from  and has a previously unreported tricyclic carbon framework.

Its motor domain contains conserved nucleotide binding motifs, but is divergent in sequence (~35% identity) and size (~40% larger) compared to other kinesins. Using cryo-electron microscopy and biophysical assays, we have undertaken a mechanochemical dissection of the microtubule-bound MKLP2 motor domain during its ATPase cycle, and show that many facets of its mechanism are distinct from other kinesins. While the MKLP2 neck-linker is directed towards the microtubule plus-end in an ATP-like state, it does not fully dock along the motor domain. Furthermore, the footprint of the MKLP2 motor domain on the MT surface is altered compared to motile kinesins, and enhanced by kinesin-6-specific sequences. The conformation of the highly extended loop6 insertion characteristic of kinesin- is nucleotide-independent and does not contact the MT surface.

Jasmonate treatment of etiolated seedlings neither enhanced TDC activity nor could it replace the light requirement for D4H induction.

Unfortunately, there remain physiological barriers that prevent achieving this resolution in practice. BOLD contrast relies on the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity, whose associated cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO) changes may spread over several millimeters and last several seconds. Recent reports have suggested that significant improvements may be possible with cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted fMRI, which highlights the CBV changes rather than the BOLD changes associated with the hemodynamic response. Nevertheless, quantitative comparisons between CBV and BOLD are sparse, in particular regarding their temporal characteristics in human brain. To address this, we studied a cohort of subjects that received injection of ferumoxytol, an intravascular iron-oxide based contrast agent that introduces strong CBV contrast. An event-related visual stimulus paradigm was used to compare the impulse response (IR) for CBV and BOLD contrast, obtained with and without ferumoxytol, respectively. Experiments performed at 7 T (n = 5) at 1.2-1.5 mm spatial and 1 s temporal resolution showed that the onset time and time-to-peak of the CBV IR averaged 0.8 and 3.5 s respectively, both 0.6 s shorter than the BOLD IR. While significant, these improvements are relatively small and not expected to lead to practical advantages for the extraction of temporal information about neural activity. Nonlinearities in the observed IR were also compared and found to be similar between the CBV and BOLD, indicating that these are likely not caused by a 'ceiling' effect in the CBO response, but rather support a previously proposed model of vascular compliance, in which changes in vascular tone elicited by a preceding stimulus affect the IR.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354123>Matrix Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Studies for the Products of Lead Atom Reactions with Ethane and Halomethanes.</a></h2><p>The insertion products of laser-ablated Pb atom reactions with ethane and mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrahalomethanes in excess argon were prepared and identified from their matrix infrared spectra on the basis of DFT computed frequencies and observed isotopic shifts.

Deposition of immunoglobulin M, C1r, C4d, and fibrin and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, heparan sulfate (HS), E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were evaluated by fluorescence staining. In addition, high-mobility group box 1 protein was measured in plasma.Edema formation was reduced by C1 INH at two dosages, mirrored by improved histologic injury scores and preserved muscle viability. Deposition of immunoglobulin M, C4d, and fibrin was significantly decreased by 100 IU/kg C1 INH compared with nontreated controls. Pretreatment with 100 IU/kg C1 INH also significantly reduced HS shedding and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 as well as plasma levels of high-mobility group box 1 protein.Pretreatment with both 50 and 100 IU/kg C1 INH attenuated reperfusion injury of rat hind limbs. Pretreatment with 100 IU/kg also preserved the endothelial HS layer as well as the natural, profibrinolytic phenotype of the endothelium. Prevention of endothelial cell activation by C1 INH may therefore be a promising strategy to prevent I/R injury in the clinical setting of peripheral vascular diseases and elective surgery on extremities.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Acid exposure time, number of refluxes, baseline impedance, post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index and both automated and manual bolus clearance time were calculated. Patients were sub-grouped into pH/impedance positive (abnormal acid exposure and/or number of refluxes) and pH/impedance negative (normal acid exposure and number of refluxes), the former further subdivided on the basis of abnormal/normal acid exposure time (pH+/-) and abnormal/normal number of refluxes (impedance+/-).Poor correlation (r=0.35) between automated and manual bolus clearance time was found. Manual bolus clearance time progressively decreased from pH+/impedance+ (42.), pH+/impedance- (27.1s), pH-/impedance+ (17.8s) to pH-/impedance- (10.8s). There was an inverse correlation between manual bolus clearance time and both baseline impedance and post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index, and a direct correlation between manual bolus clearance and acid exposure time. A manual bolus clearance time value of 14.8s had an accuracy of 93% to differentiate pH/impedance positive from pH/impedance negative patients.When manually measured, bolus clearance time reflects reflux severity, confirming the pathophysiological relevance of oesophageal clearance in reflux disease.Copyright © 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

However, acting on the airway epithelium, such mediators may also elicit inflammatory responses. In human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells (bronchial epithelium + adenovirus 12-SV40 hybrid), regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) 2 mRNA and protein were synergistically induced in response to combinations of long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) (salmeterol, formoterol) plus glucocorticoid (dexamethasone, fluticasone propionate, budesonide). Equivalent responses occurred in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Concentrations of glucocorticoid plus LABA required to induce RGS2 expression in BEAS-2B cells were consistent with the levels achieved therapeutically in the lungs. As RGS2 is a GTPase-activating protein that switches off Gαq, intracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) flux was used as a surrogate of responses induced by histamine, methacholine, and the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619 [(Z)-7-[(1S,4R,5R,)-5-[(E,3S)-3-hydroxyoct-1-enyl]-3-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-6-yl]hept-5-enoic acid]. This was significantly attenuated by salmeterol plus dexamethasone pretreatment, or RGS2 overexpression, and the protective effect of salmeterol plus dexamethasone was abolished by RGS2 RNA silencing. Although methacholine and U46619 induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) release and this was inhibited by RGS2 overexpression, the repression of U46619-induced IL-8 release by salmeterol plus dexamethasone was unaffected by RGS2 knockdown. Given a role for Gαq-mediated pathways in inducing IL-8 release, we propose that RGS2 acts redundantly with other effector processes to repress IL-8 expression. Thus, RGS2 expression is a novel effector mechanism in the airway epithelium that is induced by glucocorticoid/LABA combinations. This could contribute to the efficacy of glucocorticoid/LABA combinations in asthma and COPD.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228507>Alcohol Dehydrogenase 5 Is a Source of Formate for De Novo Purine Biosynthesis in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p> Formate provides one-carbon units for de novo purine and thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis and is produced via both folate-dependent and folate-independent . Folate-independent  are mediated by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which generate formate by oxidizing formaldehyde. Formate is a potential biomarker of B-vitamin-dependent one-carbon . This study investigated the contributions of ADH5 and ALDH2 to formate production and folate-dependent de novo purine and dTMP synthesis in HepG2 cells. knockout and ALDH2 knockdown HepG2 cells were cultured in folate-deficient [0 nM () 5-formyltetrahydrofolate] or folate-sufficient [25 nM () 5-formyltetrahydrofolate] medium. Purine biosynthesis was quantified as the ratio of [C]-formate to [H]-hypoxanthine incorporated into genomic DNA, which indicates the contribution of the de novo purine synthesis pathway relative to salvage synthesis. dTMP synthesis was quantified as the ratio of [C]-deoxyuridine to [H]-thymidine incorporation into genomic DNA, which indicates the capacity of de novo dTMP synthesis relative to salvage synthesis. The [C]-formate-to-[H]-hypoxanthine ratio was greater in  knockout than in wild-type HepG2 cells, under conditions of both folate deficiency (+30%;  < 0.001) and folate sufficiency (+22%;  = 0.02). These data indicate that ADH5 deficiency increases the use of exogenous formate for de novo purine biosynthesis. The [C]-deoxyuridine-to-[H]-thymidine ratio did not differ between  knockout and wild-type cells, indicating that ADH5 deficiency does not affect de novo dTMP synthesis capacity relative to salvage synthesis. Under folate deficiency, ALDH2 knockdown cells exhibited a 37% lower ratio of [C]-formate to [H]-hypoxanthine ( < 0.001) compared with wild-type HepG2 cells, indicating decreased use of exogenous formate, or increased endogenous formate synthesis, for de novo purine biosynthesis. In HepG2 cells, ADH5 is a source of formate for de novo purine biosynthesis, especially during folate deficiency when folate-dependent formate production is limited.

We recently reported novel pyridine-2(1H)-ones as aliphatic amine-free MCHR1 antagonists that structurally featured an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-based bicyclic motif. To investigate imidazopyridine variants with lower basicity and less potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), we designed pyridine-2(1H)-ones bearing various less basic bicyclic motifs. Among these, a lead compound 6a bearing a 1H-benzimidazole motif showed comparable binding affinity to MCHR1 to the corresponding imidazopyridine derivative 1. Optimization of 6a afforded a series of potent thiophene derivatives (6q-u); however, most of these were found to cause time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4. As bioactivation of thiophenes to form sulfoxide or epoxide species was considered to be a major cause of CYP3A4 TDI, we introduced electron withdrawing groups on the thiophene and found that a CF3 group on the ring or a Cl adjacent to the sulfur atom helped prevent CYP3A4 TDI. Consequently, 4-[(5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)methoxy]-1-(2-cyclopropyl-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-6-yl)pyridin-2(1H)-one () was identified as a potent MCHR1 antagonist without the risk of CYP3A4 TDI, which exhibited a promising safety profile including low CYP3A4 inhibition and exerted significant antiobesity effects in diet-induced obese F344 rats.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

When endothelial nitric oxide synthase is 6R-BH4-deplete, it synthesizes superoxide rather than nitric oxide. Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability by interaction with reactive  species is implicated in endothelial dysfunction (ED). 6R-BH4 corrects ED in animal models of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and in patients with cardiovascular risks. It is uncertain whether the effect of exogenous 6R-BH4 on ED is through its cofactor or antioxidant action.In healthy volunteers, forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during intra-arterial infusion of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine, or the endothelium-independent vasodilator glyceryl trinitrate, before and after IRI. IRI reduced plasma total antioxidant status (P=0.03) and impaired vasodilatation to acetylcholine (P=0.01), but not to glyceryl trinitrate (P=0.3). Intra-arterial infusion of 6R-BH4, -BH4 and NH4 at approximately equimolar concentrations prevented IRI.IRI causes ED associated with increased oxidative stress that is prevented by 6R-BH4, -BH4, and NH4, an effect mediated perhaps by an antioxidant rather than cofactor function. Regardless of mechanism, 6R-BH4, -BH4, or NH4 may reduce tissue injury during clinical IRI syndromes.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28388376>How Much and What Type of Protein Should a Critically Ill Patient Receive?</a></h2><p>Protein loss, manifested as loss of muscle mass, is observed universally in all critically ill patients. Depletion of muscle mass is associated with impaired function and poor outcomes. In extreme cases, protein malnutrition is manifested by respiratory failure, lack of wound healing, and immune dysfunction. Protecting muscle loss focused initially on meeting energy requirements. The assumption was that protein was being used (through oxidation) as an energy source. In healthy individuals, small amounts of glucose (approximately 400 calories) protect muscle loss and decrease amino acid oxidation (protein-sparing effect of glucose). Despite expectations of the benefits, the high provision of energy (above basal energy requirements) through the delivery of nonprotein calories has failed to demonstrate a clear benefit at curtailing protein loss. The protein-sparing effect of glucose is not clearly observed during illness. Increasing protein delivery beyond the normal nutrition requirements (0.8 g/k/d) has been investigated as an alternative solution. Over a dozen observational studies in critically ill patients suggest that higher protein delivery is beneficial at protecting muscle mass and associated with improved outcomes (decrease in mortality). Not surprisingly, new Society of Critical Care Medicine/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition guidelines and expert recommendations suggest higher protein delivery (>1.2 g/kg/d) for critically ill patients. This article provides an introduction to the concepts that delineate the basic principles of modern medical nutrition therapy as it relates to the goal of achieving an optimal management of protein  during critical care illness, highlighting successes achieved so far but also placing significant challenges limiting our success in perspective.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30693927>Adjustable optical nonlinearity in d cations containing chalcogenides via dp hybridization interaction.</a></h2><p>The introduction of d10-metal cations is of importance in the design of infrared nonlinear optical materials.

Extracellular cytokine and pattern recognition receptor levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 were constitutively expressed in both aortic tissues and blood samples from AAA patients and healthy volunteers. In patients with AAA, higher TLR3 expression in aortic tissues than in blood was found (P = .004).

Plasma adrenalin (Adr), noradrenalin (NAdr) and cortisol were measured and perceived exertion and pain reported during exercise. Attenuated Adr responses (p<0.001) with normal plasma NAdr and cortisol (p>0.19) responses were found during exercise in the FM group compared with the control group. Significantly higher EMG amplitude (%EMG(max)) during the contraction phases (p=0.001) was found in the FM than in the control group. Perceived exertion and pain responses to exercise were higher in the FM group than in the controls (p<0.001), without relationship to the sympathoadrenal responses. In conclusion; the exercise was perceived as being more painful and strenuous in the FM group. Muscle performance was altered with increased muscle activity during the exercise. Women with FM showed an attenuated Adr response to repetitive isometric exercise.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017097>Subchronic administration of (R,S)-ketamine induces ketamine ring hydroxylation in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Subchronic administration of (R,S)-ketamine, (R,S)-Ket, is used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, in particular Complex Regional Pain , but the effect of this protocol on the metabolism of (R,S)-Ket is unknown. In this study, daily administration of a low dose of (R,S)-Ket for 14-days to Wistar rats was conducted to determine the impact of sub-chronic dosing on the pharmacokinetics of (R,S)-Ket and its major metabolites. The data indicate that, relative to a single administration of (R,S)-Ket, subchronic administration resulted in increased clearance of (R,S)-Ket and the N-demethylated metabolite norketamine measured as elimination half-life (t1/2) and decreased plasma concentrations of these compounds. Subchronic administration produced a slight decrease in t1/2 and an increase in plasma concentration of the major metabolite, (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine, and produced significant increases in the plasma concentrations of the (2S,6R;2R,)-hydroxynorketamine and (2S,4R;2R,4S)-hydroxynorketamine metabolites. The metabolism of (R,S)-Ket predominately occurs via two microsomal enzyme-mediated pathways: (R,S)-Ket⇒(R,S)-norketamine⇒(2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine and (2S,4R;2R,4S)-hydroxynorketamine and the (R,S)-Ket⇒(2S,6R;2R,)-hydroxyketamine⇒(2S,6R;2R,)-hydroxynorketamine and (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine.

Although the direct-acting antivirals targeting HCV replication have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C, several obstacles persist, including resistance development, potential side-effects, and the prohibitive cost that limits their availability. Furthermore, treatment of HCV re-infection in liver transplantation remains a significant challenge. Developing novel antivirals that target viral entry could help expand the scope of HCV therapeutics and treatment strategies. Herein, we report (4R,)-2-dihydromenisdaurilide (DHMD), a natural butenolide, as an efficient inhibitor of HCV entry. Specifically, DHMD potently inhibited HCV infection at non-cytotoxic concentration. Examination on the viral life cycle demonstrated that DHMD selectively targeted the early steps of infection while leaving viral replication/translation and assembly/release unaffected. Furthermore, DHMD did not induce an antiviral interferon response. Mechanistic dissection of HCV entry revealed that DHMD could inactivate cell-free virus, abrogate viral attachment, and inhibit viral entry/fusion, with the most pronounced effect observed against the viral adsorption phase as validated using ELISA and confocal microscopy. Due to its potency, DHMD may be of value for further development as an entry inhibitor against HCV, particularly for application in transplant setting.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747322>Ribonucleoprotein purification and characterization using RNA Mango.</a></h2><p>The characterization of RNA-protein complexes (RNPs) is a difficult but increasingly important problem in modern biology. By combining the compact RNA Mango aptamer with a fluorogenic thiazole orange desthiobiotin (TO1-Dtb or TO3-Dtb) ligand, we have created an RNA tagging system that simplifies the purification and subsequent characterization of endogenous RNPs. Mango-tagged RNP complexes can be immobilized on a streptavidin solid support and recovered in their native state by the addition of free biotin. Furthermore, Mango-based RNP purification can be adapted to different scales of RNP isolation ranging from pull-down assays to the isolation of large amounts of biochemically defined cellular RNPs. We have incorporated the Mango aptamer into the  U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), shown that the Mango-snRNA is functional in cells, and used the aptamer to pull down a U1 snRNA-associated protein. To demonstrate large-scale isolation of RNPs, we purified and characterized bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme (HE) in complex with a Mango-containing  RNA. We were able to use the combination of a red-shifted TO3-Dtb ligand and eGFP-tagged HE to follow the binding and release of the  RNA by two-color native gel analysis as well as by single-molecule fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. Together these experiments demonstrate how the Mango aptamer in conjunction with simple derivatives of its flurophore ligands enables the purification and characterization of endogenous cellular RNPs in vitro.© 2017 Panchapakesan et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524831>Acute kidney injury with hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42 in severe sepsis.</a></h2><p>We aimed to detail the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) vs. Ringer's on kidney function including the interaction with mortality in post-hoc analyses as resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 increased mortality in the Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock () trial.In all 798 randomised patients, we assessed the incidence and effect on mortality of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the HES vs. Ringer's acetate groups using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome criteria.

The maximal AKI stage was higher in the HES vs. Ringer's group within the first 5 days after randomisation (P = 0.03), the average difference being 0.2 points (P < 0.01). An increase in AKI stage was associated with mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.35; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49; P < 0.01). Significantly, more patients in the HES group received RRT within the first 5 days (P = 0.01), and the time to initiation of RRT was also shorter compared with the Ringer's group (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.01-1.93; P = 0.04).

These 5,6-dihydro derivatives, which are also potential prodrugs to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), were designed in an effort to enhance the duration of action, lipophilicity, and cephalic delivery to the central nervous system. The 5-halo-6-alkoxy(or azido)-5,6-dihydro-3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidines, which differ in configuration at the C-5 and C-6 positions, were synthesized by the regiospecific addition of XR (X = Br, Cl, I; R = alkoxy, azido) to the 5,6-olefinic bond of AZT. The 5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro derivatives of AZT are more lipophilic (P = 3.3-18.8 range) than the parent compound AZT (P = 1.29). These 5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro compounds, like AZT, did not undergo glycosidic bond cleavage upon incubation with Escherichia coli thymidine phosphorylase. Regeneration of the 5,6-olefinic bond to give AZT, upon incubation of the 5-halo-6-methoxy-5,6-dihydro compounds with glutathione, mouse blood, or mouse liver homogenate, was dependent upon the nature of the 5-halo substituent (I > Br).

The experiment started by randomly assigning weaned pigs to groups V (n=24) and U (n=26). V pigs were vaccinated with a commercial live attenuated PRRSV vaccine and the U animals were kept as unvaccinated controls. Twenty-eight days later, 6U pigs were separated and allocated in individual boxes. The remaining 20U pigs were intranasally inoculated with PRRSV isolate 3267 (from now on designated as seeder (S) pigs) and 48h later were distributed in boxes where they were commingled with either V or U pigs in 1:1 groups (first contact phase), resulting in :U and 14S:V pairs. As soon as a V pig was detected to be viremic because of contact with a S, the infected V (from now on designated as V) was transferred (<24h after detection) to a new pen where it was comingled with a new V pig (designated as V) in a second contact phase. For the first contact phase, pigs were maintained 21days at maximum and for the second contact phase the maximum exposure period was 14days. Two V pigs tested positive for the vaccine virus (>99.5% similarity) when they were relocated with the corresponding V pigs and they were removed; thus, only 12V were finally considered. All V pigs (12/12) exposed to S animals became infected although the first detection of viremia occurred at 13.6±3.6days, one week later than in U (p<0.05). Also, duration of viremia was shorter for V compared to U, (5.5±4.3days versus 12.5±2.7days). The V group showed remarkable individual variability: eight animals had a viremic period of 5 or less days (3.0±1.4) while the remaining four had a longer viremic period of more than one week (10.8±2.9). This situation was not observed in U. In the second contact phase, transmission from V to V pigs occurred in 7/8 cases (87.5%). The mean duration of viremia for V was 4.8±3.4 and two different patterns were again observed: two animals had viremias of 9-10days and the rest averaged 3.0±1.4days (range: 2-5days). Vaccinated groups V and V had a significantly lower PRRSV shedding in oral fluids for at least the first 9days after the onset of the viremia compared to U, and shedding for V2 was even significantly lower (p<0.05) than shedding for V. Our experimental design reproduced the worst-case scenario for evaluating the effect of vaccination and, under such conditions; it was still efficacious in slowering PRRSV transmission and decreasing the global viral load and particularly oral shedding.Copyright © 2016.

Here, three-dimensional SnS nanoflower structures assembled with thin nanosheets were synthesized via a facile solvothermal process. When applied to detect 100ppm NH at 200°C, the SnS based sensor exhibited high response value of 7.4, short response/recovery time of 40./624s. Moreover, the sensor demonstrated a low detection limit of 0.5ppm NH and superb selectivity to NH against CO, CH, H, ethanol and acetone. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique thin layers assembled flower-like nanoarchitecture, which facilitates both the carrier charge transfer process and the adsorption/desorption reaction. More importantly, it was found that the sensor response enhanced with increasing  content in background and was improved by 3.57 times with  content increasing from 0 to 40%. The increased response is owing to the enhanced binding energies between SnS and NH moleculers. Theoretically, density functional theory was employed to reveal the NH adsorption mechanism in different background  contents, which opens a new horizon for LMD based structures applied in various gas sensing fields.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Dose-response studies showed that biologically derived LXA and synthetic LXA were equally effective in inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity. -LXA, with its -OH group in an (S) configuration, proved to be approximately half as potent as LXA. In contrast, -11-trans-LXA and 11-trans-LXA displayed virtually no inhibitory activities. The methyl esters of both LXA and -LXA proved to be more potent than their corresponding free acids. Thus, LXA inhibition of NK cells displays clear-cut stereochemistry. In the absence of putative inhibitors, NK cells bind to their targets to form conjugates. This event is followed by polarization of the NK Golgi apparatus, which moves towards the plasma membrane that is in contact with the target cell. However, in the presence of either the methyl ester or free acid of LXA, the Golgi apparati of NK cells bound to their targets were randomly oriented. In contrast, neither -11-trans-LXA nor the potent NK inhibitor prostaglandin E2 affected the polarization. Furthermore, although prostaglandin E2 resulted in a decrease in NK-target cell binding efficiency, LXA and its isomers failed to affect conjugate formation. Together these results indicate that LXA-induced inhibition of NK cytotoxicity does not act on NK cell binding but may block cytotoxicity by disrupting "signals" involved in the specific orientation of the Golgi.

We biolistically transfected astrocytes in rat hippocampal slice cultures to facilitate fluorescent confocal microscopy, and subjected these slices to transient oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) that causes delayed excitotoxic death of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This insult caused a delayed loss of mitochondria from astrocytic processes and increased colocalization of mitochondria with the autophagosome marker LC3B. The losses of neurons in area CA1 and mitochondria in astrocytic processes were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) antagonists, tetrodotoxin, ziconotide (Ca(2+) channel blocker), two inhibitors of reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (KB-R7943, YM-244769), or two inhibitors of calcineurin (cyclosporin-A, FK506). The effects of OGD were mimicked by NMDA. The glutamate uptake inhibitor (3S)-3-[[3-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]-l-aspartate increased neuronal loss after OGD or NMDA, and blocked the loss of astrocytic mitochondria. Exogenous glutamate in the presence of iGluR antagonists caused a loss of mitochondria without a decrease in neurons in area CA1. Using the genetic Ca(2+) indicator Lck-GCaMP-, we observed two types of Ca(2+) signals: (1) in the cytoplasm surrounding mitochondria (mitochondrially centered) and (2) traversing the space between mitochondria (extramitochondrial). The spatial spread, kinetics, and frequency of these events were different. The amplitude of both types was doubled and the spread of both types changed by ∼2-fold 24 h after OGD. Together, these data suggest that pathologic activation of glutamate transport and increased astrocytic Ca(2+) through reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange triggers mitochondrial loss and dramatic increases in Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytic processes.Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain, are vital integrators of signaling and . Each astrocyte consists of many long, thin branches, called processes, which ensheathe vasculature and thousands of synapses. Mitochondria occupy the majority of each process. This occupancy is decreased by ∼50% 24 h after an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, due to delayed fragmentation and mitophagy. The mechanism appears to be independent of neuropathology, instead involving an extended period of high glutamate uptake into astrocytes. Our data suggest that mitochondria serve as spatial buffers, and possibly even as a source of calcium signals in astrocytic processes. Loss of mitochondria resulted in drastically altered calcium signaling that could disrupt neurovascular coupling and gliotransmission.Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/367110-19$15.00/0.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12881821>Blood flow response to electrically induced twitch and tetanic lower-limb muscle contractions.</a></h2><p>To compare the effect of electric stimulation (ES)-induced twitch with tetanic leg muscle contractions on blood flow responses and to assess blood flow responses in the contralateral inactive leg.Intervention with within-subject comparisons.University research laboratory.A volunteer sample of 12 healthy men (mean age, 25.1+/-3.0y).ES was applied at 1 and 3Hz to induce twitch contractions and at 35Hz to induce tetanic contractions of the lower- and upper-leg muscles.

These products were characterized by physico-chemical and chemical techniques. The chemical structures, (5S, 6R)-5,20-dihydroxy--cysteinyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-icosatetraenoic acid (omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E4) and (5S, 6R)-5-hydroxy--cysteinyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-icosatetraen-1,20-d ioic acid (omega-carboxy-leukotriene E4) suggested that leukotriene E4 was transformed by an omega-hydroxylase and omega-hydroxyleukotriene E dehydrogenase in sequence. N-Acetyl-leukotriene E4 was also transformed by these enzymes, but at a rate six times lower than leukotriene E4. The products formed from N-acetylleukotriene E4 were characterized as being N-acetyl-omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E4 and N-acetyl-omega-carboxy-leukotriene E4. Other substrates were 11-trans-leukotriene E4 and N-acetyl-11-trans-leukotriene E4. In contrast, leukotrienes C4 and D4 were not converted into omega-oxidized metabolites. The leukotriene E omega-hydroxylase reaction required NADPH and molecular  as cofactors, and was most rapidly catalyzed by liver microsomes. Liver cytosol, fortified with NAD+, converted omega-hydroxyleukotriene E4 and N-acetyl-omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E4 into omega-carboxy metabolites. Microsomes contained at least 18 times less omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E dehydrogenase activity than did cytosol. Liver microsomes supplemented with acetyl-coenzyme A converted omega-hydroxy and omega-carboxy-leukotriene E4 into the corresponding N-acetyl derivatives.

While boron in bulk lanthanide hexaboride materials assumes octahedral B units, the monomer assumes a less compact structure to delocalize the charge. Two competitive molecular structures were identified for the anion and neutral species, which include a boat-like structure and a planar or near-planar teardrop structure. Ce adopts different orbital occupancies in the two isomers; the boat-like structure has a 4f superconfiguration while the teardrop favors a 4f  occupancy. The B ligand in these structures carries a charge of -4 and -3, respectively. The teardrop structure, which was calculated to be isoenergetic with the boat structure, was most consistent with the experimental spectrum. B-local orbitals crowd the  window between the Ce 4f and  (HOMO) orbitals. A low-lying transition from the B-based orbitals is observed slightly less than 1 eV above the ground state. The results suggest that edge and corner conductivity involves stabilized, highly diffuse  orbitals or bands rather than the bulk-favored 5d band. High-spin and open-shell low-spin states were calculated to be very close in  for both the anion and neutral, a characteristic that reflects how decoupled the 4f electron is from the B 2p- and Ce -based molecular orbitals.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435958>Potential  surface for the reaction Sm + CO → SmO + CO: guided ion beam and theoretical studies.</a></h2><p>The potential  surface (PES) for the oxidation of samarium cations by carbon dioxide is explored both experimentally and theoretically.

Yet, the accumulation of data in neurosciences suggests the next emergence of biomarkers, whose interest is that they are closely associated to the biological disturbances underlying psychiatric illnesses, and that they are accessible by means of technological tools such as imaging devices. These tools allow to explore the effects on brain of psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood stabilizers, in relation to their therapeutic action. The obtained results allow to consider the use of such biomarkers in clinical trials in addition to more conventional approaches. In particular, they could be used as targets to measure brain response to treatment in association with clinical response, to predict a therapeutic response from the neurofunctional characteristics of patients, or to establish the safety profile of drugs on the nervous system. The use of such biomarkers in clinical trials would help to better define the explored populations and their characteristics, as well as the variables to assess, and to better measure the impact of the treatments and their potential harmful effects on the nervous system.© L’Encéphale, Paris, 2016.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048701>Characterization of the interaction interface and conformational dynamics of human TGIF1 homeodomain upon the binding of consensus DNA.</a></h2><p>The TG interacting factor-1 homeodomain (TGIF1-HD) binds with the consensus DNA motif 5'-TGTCA-3' in gene promoters through its three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) type homeodomain, and then recruits co-regulators to regulate gene expression. Although the solution NMR structure of human TGIF1-HD has been reported previously, little is known about its DNA binding mechanism. NMR titrations have been extensively used to study mechanisms of ligand binding to target proteins; however, an intermediate exchange occurred predominantly between TGIF1-HD in the free and bound states when titrated with the consensus DNA, which resulted in poor-quality NMR spectra and precluded further exploration of its interaction interface and conformational dynamics. Here, the helix α3 of TGIF1-HD was speculated as the specific DNA binding interface by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, and subsequently confirmed by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) spectroscopy. In addition, simultaneous conformational changes in other regions, including α1 and α2, were induced by DNA binding, explaining the observation of chemical shift perturbations from extensive residues besides those located in α3. Further, low-populated DNA-bound TGIF1-HD undergoing a slow exchange at a rate of 130.2 ± 3.6 s was derived from the analysis of the CEST data, and two residues, R220 and R221, located in the middle of α3 were identified to be crucial for DNA binding.

Ketamine treatment can produce rapid antidepressant effects in MDD patients, effects that are mediated-at least partially-through glutamatergic neurotransmission. Two active metabolites of ketamine, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) and (2S,)-HNK, also appear to play a key role in ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects through the activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors. In the present study, we demonstrated that estrogen plus ketamine or estrogen plus active ketamine metabolites displayed additive effects on the induction of the expression of AMPA receptor subunits. In parallel, the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was also significantly upregulated. Even more striking, radioligand binding assays demonstrated that [H]-ketamine can directly bind to ERα (K: 344.5 ± 13 nM). Furthermore, ketamine and its (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,)-HNK metabolites displayed similar affinity for ERα (IC: 2.31 ± 0.1, 3.40 ± 0.2, and 3.53 ± 0.2 µM, respectively) as determined by [H]-ketamine displacement assays. Finally, induction of AMPA receptors by either estrogens or ketamine and its metabolites was lost when ERα was knocked down or silenced pharmacologically. These results suggest a positive feedback loop by which estrogens can augment the effects of ketamine and its (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,)-HNK metabolites on the ERα-induced transcription of CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, estrogen inducible enzymes that catalyze ketamine's biotransformation to form the two active metabolites. These observations provide novel insight into ketamine's molecular mechanism(s) of action and have potential implications for the treatment of MDD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Whereas the injurious effects of surgical preparation of the vein conduit have been extensively studied, little is known about the influence of the clinical environment of the donor leg from which the vein is obtained.We studied the cellular responses of fresh saphenous vein samples obtained before implantation in 46 patients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass surgery. Using an ex vivo model of response to injury, we quantified the outgrowth of cells from explants of the adventitial and medial layers of the vein. We correlated this cellular outgrowth with the clinical characteristics of the patients, including the Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection classification of the donor leg for ischemia, wounds, and infection as well as smoking and diabetes.Cellular outgrowth was significantly faster and more robust from the adventitial layer than from the medial layer. The factors of leg ischemia (P < .001), smoking (P = .042), and leg infection (P = .045) were associated with impaired overall outgrowth from the adventitial tissue on multivariable analysis. Only ischemia (P = .046) was associated with impaired outgrowth of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the medial tissue. Co-culture of adventitial cells and SMCs propagated from vein explants revealed that adventitial cells significantly inhibited the growth of SMCs, whereas SMCs promoted the growth of adventitial cells. The AA genotype of the -838C>A p27 polymorphism (previously associated with superior graft patency) enhanced these effects, whereas the factor of smoking attenuated adventitial cell inhibition of SMC growth. Comparing gene expression, the cells cultured from the media overexpress Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  associated with inflammation and infection, whereas those from the adventitia overexpress gene families associated with development and stem/progenitor cell maintenance.The adverse clinical environment of the leg may influence the biologic behavior of the cells in the vein wall, especially the adventitial cells. Chronic ischemia was the most significant factor that retards adventitial cell outgrowth. The cells arising from the vein adventitia may be key players in determining a healthy adaptive or a pathologic response to the injuries associated with vein grafting.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Two-photon excitation of Rydberg states lying above the lowest IP state dissociation threshold (1st tier) is found to be followed by direct parallel transitions into IP states of the 1st tier asymptotically correlating to a pair of I ions in their lowest states I(+)((3)P2) + I(-)((1)S0), of the 2nd tier correlating to I(+)((3)P0) + I(-)((1)S0), and of the 3rd tier correlating to I(+)((1)D2) + I(-)((1)S0). Predissociation via the 1st tier proceeds presumably with a delay of 1.6-1.7 ps which is close to the vibrational period in the 3rd tier state (3rd tier-mediated process). The 2nd tier IP state is concluded to be the main precursor for predissociation via lower lying Rydberg states proceeding with a characteristic time of 7-8 ps and giving rise to Rydberg atoms I(5s(2)5p(4)(1)).

Ex vivo cultivated human PVSMCs were preincubated with the endothelin-A-receptor selective inhibitor ambrisentan, with the endothelin-B-receptor selective inhibitor BQ788 [sodium (2R)-2-{[(2S)-2-({[(2R,)-2,6-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]carbonyl}amino)-4,4-dimethylpentanoyl][1-(methoxycarbonyl)-d-tryptophyl]amino}hexanoate], or with the dual blocker bosentan before stimulation with smooth LPS (S-LPS), rough LPS (Re-LPS), or a mixture of long and short forms (M-LPS).

All LPS forms induced interleukin (IL)-6-, IL-8-, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release. Bosentan and BQ788 inhibited M-LPS-induced release of all cytokines and soluble CD14 (sCD14) but not TLR4 expression. Ambrisentan blocked M-LPS-induced IL-6 release but not IL-8, GM-CSF, or LPS receptors. IL-8 release induced by S-LPS, which requires CD14 to activate TLR4, was blocked by bosentan and BQ788. IL-8 release induced by Re-LPS, which does not require CD14 to activate TLR4, was insensitive to both bosentan and BQ788. In conclusion, PVSMCs contribute to  in bacteria-induced exacerbations of chronic lung diseases.

Nowadays, it is suggested that inhibition of NF-κB activation could delay the development of DN and DC. 6-shogaol was reported to modulate NF-κB besides its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore, it is worth testing it against diabetic complications. Rats were divided to 4 groups: Normal control (NC), 6-shogaol (), diabetic control (DC), diabetic rats treated with 6-shogaol (DC+).

The therapeutic properties of GAGs are related to their ability to interact with proteins, which is very much influenced by sulfation position and patterns. Since currently GAGs cannot be chemically synthesized, they are sourced from natural products, with high intra- but also inter-species variability, in terms of chain length, disaccharide composition and sulfation pattern. Consequently, sulfated GAGs are the most interesting molecules in the marine environment and constitute the focus of the present review. In particular, chondroitin sulfate (CS) appears as the most promising compound. CS-E chains [GlcA-GalNAc(4S,)] extracted from squid possess antiviral and anti-metastatic activities and seem to impart signalling properties and improve the mechanical performance of cartilage engineering constructs; Squid CS-E and octopus CS-K [GlcA(3S)-GalNAc(4S)], dermatan sulfate (DS) from sea squirts [-iK units, IdoA(3S)-GalNAc(4S)] and sea urchins [-iE units, IdoA-GalNAc(4S,)] and hybrids CS/DS from sharks (-B/iB [GlcA/IdoA(2S)-GalNAc(4S)], -D/iD [GlcA/IdoA(2S)-GalNAc()] and -E/iE units [GlcA/IdoA-GalNAc(4S,)]) promote neurite outgrowth and could be valuable materials for nerve regeneration. Also displaying antiviral and anti-metastatic properties, a rare CS with fucosylated branches isolated from sea cucumbers is an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agent. In this same line, marine heparin extracted from shrimp and sea squirt has proven anti-inflammatory properties, with the added advantage of decreased risk of bleeding because of its low anticoagulant activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the competing predissociation and autoionization mechanisms in superexcited  molecules and found that autoionization is dominant for the low n Rydberg states. We measured an autoionization lifetime of 92±6 fs and 180±10 fs for the (5s,4d)σ(g) and (,5d)σ(g) Rydberg state groups, respectively.

None of the analogs alone, or in combination with diprionol acetate, was attractive in Sweden, even at 100 times the amount of diprionol acetate attractive to N. sertifer. In Japan, the acetate of (2S,3S)-3-methyl-2-pentadecanol attracted males when tested in amounts 10-20 times higher than the acetate pheromone component. The acetate esters of the (2S,3R)-analog and the (2S,3R,7R)-isomer of diprionol also were tested in combination with the pheromone compound (acetate ester). Both compounds caused an almost total trap-catch reduction in Sweden, whereas in Japan they appear to have relatively little effect on trap capture when added to diprionol acetate. Butyrate and iso-butyrate esters of diprionol were unattractive to N. sertifer in Sweden. In summary, there exists geographic variation in N. sertifer in responses to both diprionyl acetate and some of its analogs.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561106>Design, synthesis, in-vitro evaluation and molecular docking studies of novel indole derivatives as inhibitors of SIRT1 and SIRT2.</a></h2><p>Sirtuins (SIRTs), class III HDAC (Histone deacetylase) family proteins, are associated with cancer, , and other age-related disorders. SIRT1 and SIRT2 are established therapeutic drug targets by regulating its function either by activators or inhibitors. Compounds containing indole moiety are potential lead molecules inhibiting SIRT1 and SIRT2 activity. In the current study, we have successfully synthesized 22 indole derivatives in association with an additional triazole moiety that provide better anchoring of the ligands in the binding cavity of SIRT1 and SIRT2. In-vitro binding and deacetylation assays were carried out to characterize their inhibitory effects against SIRT1 and SIRT2. We found four derivatives, 6l, 6m, 6n, and 6o to be specific for SIRT1 inhibition; three derivatives, 6a, 6d and 6k, specific for SIRT2 inhibition; and two derivatives,  and 6t, which inhibit both SIRT1 and SIRT2. In-silico validation for the selected compounds was carried out to study the nature of binding of the ligands with the neighboring residues in the binding site of SIRT1. These derivatives open up newer avenues to explore specific inhibitors of SIRT1 and SIRT2 with therapeutic implications for human diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Given the critical role of the endothelium in balancing hemostasis, we investigated single-point associations between whole blood coagulopathy by thrombelastography (TEG) and plasma/serum markers of endothelial activation and damage in patients with severe sepsis.A post-hoc multicenter prospective observational study in a subgroup of 184 patients from the Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock () Trial. Study patients were admitted to two Danish intensive care units. Inclusion criteria were severe sepsis, pre-intervention whole blood TEG measurement and a plasma/serum research sample available from baseline (pre-intervention) for analysis of endothelial-derived biomarkers. Endothelial-derived biomarkers were measured in plasma/serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (syndecan-1, thrombomodulin, protein C (PC), tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Pre-intervention TEG, functional fibrinogen (FF) and laboratory and clinical data, including mortality, were retrieved from the trial database.Most patients presented with septic shock (86%) and pulmonary (60%) or abdominal (30%) focus of infection. The median (IQR) age was 67 years (59 to 75), and 55% were males. The median SOFA and SAPS II scores were 8 (6 to 10) and 56 (41 to 68), respectively, with 7-, 28- and 90-day mortality rates being 21%, 39% and 53%, respectively. Pre-intervention (before treatment with different fluids), TEG reaction (R)-time, angle and maximum amplitude (MA) and FF MA all correlated with syndecan-1, thrombomodulin and PC levels. By multivariate linear regression analyses, higher syndecan-1 and lower PC were independently associated with TEG and FF hypocoagulability at the same time-point: 100 ng/ml higher syndecan-1 predicted 0.64 minutes higher R-time (SE 0.25), 1.78 mm lower TEG MA (SE 0.87) and 0.84 mm lower FF MA (SE 0.42; all P < 0.05), and 10% lower protein C predicted 1.24 mm lower TEG MA (SE 0.31).In our cohort of patients with severe sepsis, higher circulating levels of biomarkers of mainly endothelial damage were independently associated with hypocoagulability assessed by TEG and FF.

ALS is universally fatal, characterized by progressive weakness due to the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, and leads eventually to respiratory failure which is the usual cause of death. Only a single treatment has been approved, the modestly effective nonspecific neuroprotectant Rilutek (riluzole; 2-amino-6-(trifluoromethoxy)benzothiazole). KNS-760704 [(6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine dihydrochloride, RPPX], a synthetic amino-benzothiazole with demonstrated activity in maintaining mitochondrial function, is being developed as a treatment for ALS. It has proven to be effective in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays of neuroprotection, including the G93A-SOD1 mutant mouse model; however, its specific mechanism of action remains unknown. The potential of KNS-760604 as a treatment for ALS was first suggested by studies showing that its optical enantiomer, Mirapex[()-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine; pramipexole dihydrochloride; PPX], a high-affinity agonist at dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors, exhibits important neuroprotective properties independent of its dopamine receptor agonism. In cell-based assays, both RPPX and PPX reduce the production of reactive  species (ROS), attenuate the activation of apoptotic pathways, and increase cell survival in response to a variety of neurotoxins. However, PPX has limited utility as a clinical neuroprotective agent because the drug concentrations required for neuroprotection would likely produce unacceptable dopaminergic side effects. RPPX, on the other hand, while possessing the same neuroprotective potential as PPX, is a much lower-affinity dopamine receptor agonist and may therefore be more useful in the treatment of ALS. This review will examine the data supporting the hypothesis that the RPPX may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including ALS. In addition, we will briefly review recent preclinical data in support of RPPX, and discuss the current status of its clinical development.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220731>Early haemodynamic changes observed in patients with epilepsy, in a visual experiment and in simulations.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether previously reported early blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in epilepsy could occur as a result of the modelling techniques rather than physiological changes.EEG-fMRI data were analysed from seven patients with focal epilepsy, six control subjects undergoing a visual experiment, in addition to simulations.

Ketamine is extensively metabolized to several other metabolites. The major secondary metabolite (2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (6-hydroxynorketamine) is not an NMDA antagonist. However, it may modulate nociception through negative allosteric modulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We studied whether 6-hydroxynorketamine could affect nociception or the effects of morphine in acute or chronic administration settings. Male Sprague Dawley rats received subcutaneous 6-hydroxynorketamine or ketamine alone or in combination with morphine, as a cotreatment during induction of morphine tolerance, and after the development of tolerance induced by subcutaneous minipumps administering 9.6 mg morphine daily. Tail flick, hot plate, paw pressure and rotarod tests were used. Brain and serum drug concentrations were quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Ketamine (10 mg/kg), but not 6-hydroxynorketamine (10 and 30 mg/kg), enhanced antinociception and decreased rotarod performance following acute administration either alone or combined with morphine. Ketamine efficiently attenuated morphine tolerance. Acutely administered 6-hydroxynorketamine increased the brain concentration of morphine (by 60%), and brain and serum concentrations of 6-hydroxynorketamine were doubled by morphine pre-treatment. This pharmacokinetic interaction did not, however, lead to altered morphine tolerance. Co-administration of 6-hydroxynorketamine 20 mg/kg twice daily did not influence development of morphine tolerance. Even though morphine and 6-hydroxynorketamine brain concentrations were increased after co-administration, the pharmacokinetic interaction had no effect on acute morphine nociception or tolerance. These results indicate that 6-hydroxynorketamine does not have antinociceptive properties or attenuate opioid tolerance in a similar way as ketamine.© 2017 The Authors.

The effect of agitation and leukoreduction on whole blood stored at 4°C requires investigation, as reductions in hemostatic capacity of whole blood may reduce its efficacy in treating trauma-induced coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction. We hypothesize that agitation of whole blood will not affect hemostatic function and that leukoreduction will reduce hemostatic function of whole blood.In this in vitro randomized controlled study, 21 units of leukoreduced and 20 nonleukoreduced whole blood units were each randomly assigned into four agitation groups. Hemostatic parameters were measured using viscoelastic assays (rotational thromboelastometry-Extrinsic Screening Test (ROTEM-EXTEM) and thromboelastography (TEG) platelet mapping), impedance aggregometry (agonists-adenosine phosphate, arachidonic acid, thrombin receptor activating peptide, and collagen), and a thrombin generation assay from these whole blood units before and after filtration and on 0, 5, 10, and 15 days of storage at 4°C.Leukoreduction compared to nonleukoreduction reduced platelet concentration on Day 0. Viscoelastic measures and thrombin generation parameters revealed significant reduction in hemostatic function between the leukoreduced units and the nonleukoreduced units at a few time points. Leukoreduced units consistently demonstrated reduced platelet aggregation compared to the nonleukoreduced units. Agitation methods did not significantly affect any of the hemostatic parameters examined.Leukoreduction of whole blood with a platelet-sparing filter caused a moderate but significant reduction in some measures of whole blood hemostatic function most evident early in storage.

Acute traumatic coagulopathy has historically been defined by a prolonged prothrombin time, although newer, more informative measurements of hemostatic function have been used to improve diagnosis and support clinical decision making. The underlying biochemical mechanisms of and best practice therapeutics for ATC remain under active investigation because of its significant correlation to poor outcomes. The wide range of hypothesized mechanisms for ATC results from the large number of symptoms, phenotypes, and altered states in these patients as observed by multiple research groups. Much like the ancient fable of blind men describing an elephant from their limited perspectives, the limited nature of clinical and laboratory tools used to diagnose coagulopathy or evaluate hemostatic function has made finding causation difficult. The prolonged prothrombin time, degree of fibrinolysis, depletion of coagulation factors and inhibitors, and general failure of the blood have all been identified as being primary indicators for ATC. Therapeutic interventions including recombinant coagulation factors, antifibrinolytics, and blood products have been used with varying degrees of success as they are used to address specific symptoms. To truly understand the causes of ATC, research efforts must recognize the complexity of the hemostatic system and get to the heart of the matter by answering the question: "Is ATC a pathological condition that develops from the observed deficiencies in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and autoregulation, or is ATC an adaptive response generated as the body attempts to restore perfusion and avoid massive organ failure?" Because patient management must proceed without definitive answers regarding the entire causative chain, the current therapeutic focus should be on using what knowledge has been gained to the patient's advantage: control hemorrhage, maintain appropriate homeostatic balances of coagulation proteins, and restore  perfusion.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30557831>Unravel a neuroactive sHA sulfation pattern with neurogenesis activity by a library of defined oligosaccharides.</a></h2><p>Sulfated hyaluronic acid (sHA) is chemically synthetic mimetic of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) presenting promising biological functions.

The primary outcome measure was either death or end-stage kidney failure (dependence on dialysis) at 90 days after randomization.Of the 804 patients who underwent randomization, 798 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. The two intervention groups had similar baseline characteristics. At 90 days after randomization, 201 of 398 patients (51%) assigned to HES 130/0.42 had died, as compared with 172 of 400 patients (43%) assigned to Ringer's acetate (relative risk, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.36; P=0.03); 1 patient in each group had end-stage kidney failure. In the 90-day period, 87 patients (22%) assigned to HES 130/0.42 were treated with renal-replacement therapy versus 65 patients (16%) assigned to Ringer's acetate (relative risk, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.80; P=0.04), and 38 patients (10%) and 25 patients (6%), respectively, had severe bleeding (relative risk, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.94 to 2.48; P=0.09).

Patients with chronic liver disease can have comorbidities that limit their ability to breath-hold (BH) for the required acquisition time. Our aim was to evaluate whether stiffness measurements obtained from a navigator-triggered MRE acquisition are comparable to standard expiratory breath-hold, inspiratory breath-hold or free-breathing in healthy participants.Twelve healthy participants were imaged using the four methods on a clinical 1.5T MR system equipped with a product MRE system. Mean liver stiffness, and measurable area of stiffness (with a confidence threshold >95%) were compared between sequences using the concordance correlation coefficient. Repeatability of each sequence between two acquisitions was also assessed.The standard BH expiratory technique had high concordance with the navigated technique (r=0.716), and low concordance with the BH inspiration (r=0.165) and free-breathing (r=0.105) techniques. The navigator-triggered technique showed no statistical difference in measurable area of liver or in repeatability compared with the standard expiratory acquisition (p=0.997 and p=0.407 respectively). The free-breathing technique produced less measurable liver area and was less repeatable than the alternative techniques. The increase in acquisition time for navigator techniques was 3min  compared to standard expiratory breath-hold.Navigator-based hepatic MRE measurements are comparable to the reference standard expiratory breath-hold acquisition in healthy participants.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Their diagnostic and therapeutic management remains a challenge. A nationwide survey was conducted among 13 of the largest pediatric units in the United Kingdom, to obtain insight in the current management of IFD in neonates and children. All responding centers were tertiary teaching centers. The use of fungal diagnostic tools and imaging modalities varied among centers. Antifungal prophylaxis was prescribed in most centers for extreme-low birth  (LBW) infants and high-risk hemato-oncologic patients, but with a huge variety in antifungals given. An empirical treatment was favored by most centers in case of febrile neutropenia. First line therapy for candidemia consists of either fluconazole or liposomal amphotericin B, with voriconazole being first-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Disseminated invasive aspergillosis was most often mentioned as a reason to prescribe combination antifungal therapy. In conclusion, this survey reinforces the fact that there are still important aspects in the management of pediatric IFD which should ideally be addressed in pediatric clinical trials. Attention needs to be given the knowledge gaps as observed in the results of our survey to optimize the management of IFD in children and neonates.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17824659>The thiopyran route to polypropionates: enantioselective synthesis of membrenone B from racemic fragments.</a></h2><p>(,7S,8S,9R,10S)-(--)-Membrenone B was synthesized in nine steps (9.4% overall yield) beginning with two-directional aldol coupling of tetrahydro-4H-thiopyran-4-one with racemic 1,4-dioxa-8-thiaspiro[4.5]decane-6-carboxaldehyde.

Clinicians want molecular imaging that-by being more reliable in tailoring treatment and monitoring response for each patient-will become a key facet of precision medicine, surgery, and radiation therapy.

The analytes and the internal standard were extracted from plasma samples by simple ultrafiltration centrifugation-based extraction. The separation was achieved on a chiral HSA column (150 mm×4 mm, 5 μm) using mobile phases containing 10 mmol pH 8.0 ammonium acetate and acetonitrile in gradient mode. The method showed good linearities in the ranges of 25-5000 μg/L and 12.5-3000 μg/L for leucovorin and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate diastereoisomers, respectively.

In the metalation, the  pair of the Bi atom in 1a and 1b had an extraordinary nucleophilicity toward the unsaturated Cr(CO) fragment, even in the presence of the more chemically active 5s or 4s pair, whereas in the case of methylation, only the 4s pair of Se could be selectively alkylated. Upon oxidation of 1a and 1b with suitable oxidizing agents, NaBiO or KSeO, Bi-E bonded tetrahedral complexes [{EFe(CO)}Bi] [E = Te (4a) or Se (4b)] were formed by the elimination of one Fe(CO) vertex. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that all of the Bi atoms in these complexes had oxidation states close to +1.

Although inhibition of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) is one mechanism proposed to underlie ketamine's antidepressant and adverse effects, the potency of (2,6)-HNK to inhibit NMDARs has not been established. We used a multidisciplinary approach to determine the effects of (2,6)-HNK on NMDAR function. Antidepressant-relevant behavioral responses and (2,6)-HNK levels in the extracellular compartment of the hippocampus were measured following systemic (2,6)-HNK administration in mice. The effects of ketamine, (2,6)-HNK, and, in some cases, the (2,6)-HNK stereoisomer were evaluated on the following: () NMDA-induced lethality in mice, () NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the CA1 field of mouse hippocampal slices, () NMDAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and NMDA-evoked currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices, and () recombinant NMDARs expressed in  oocytes. While a single i.p. injection of 10 mg/kg (2,6)-HNK exerted antidepressant-related behavioral and cellular responses in mice, the ED of (2,6)-HNK to prevent NMDA-induced lethality was found to be 228 mg/kg, compared with 6.4 mg/kg for ketamine.

Linear mixed models, and correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationships between unit staffing, shift, paging burden and response time.

Using automated eye tracking methods, we found that children with ASD failed to demonstrate sensitivity to asynchronies of 0.3s, 0., or 1.0s between a video of a woman speaking and the corresponding audio track. In contrast, typically developing children who were language-matched to the ASD group, were sensitive to both 0. and 1.0s asynchronies.

We hypothesized that neonatal leptin would prevent the development of GR-associated behavioral abnormalities. From postnatal day 4-14, C57BL/6 mice were randomized to daily injections of saline or leptin (80ng/g), and GR was identified by a weanling  below the tenth percentile. The behavioral phenotypes of GR and control mice were assessed beginning at 4 months. Within the tripartite chamber, GR mice had significantly impaired social interaction. Baseline escape times from the Barnes maze were faster for GR mice (65+/- vs 87+/-7s for controls, p<0.05), but GR mice exhibited regression in their escape times on days 2 and 3 (56% regressed vs 22% of control saline mice, p<0.05). Compared to controls, GR mice entered the open arms of the elevated plus maze more often and stayed there longer (72+/-10s vs 36+/-5s, p<0.01). Neonatal leptin supplementation normalized the behavior of GR mice across all behavioral assays. In conclusion, GR alters the social interactions, learning and activity of mice, and supplementation with the neurotrophic hormone leptin mitigates these effects. We speculate neonatal leptin deficiency may contribute to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with postnatal growth restriction, and postnatal leptin therapy may be protective.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most common forms of damage is oxidation of the thymine nucleobase to form (5R,)-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydro-thymine (thymine glycol or Tg), which stops DNA polymerases and is thus cytotoxic. Thymine glycol damage is repaired through a variety of mechanisms, including the multi-step base excision repair (BER) pathway. In the first BER step, the glycosidic bond of the dTg nucleotide is hydrolyzed by a DNA glycosylase. In order to understand the catalytic effect of the glycosylases, the corresponding uncatalyzed mechanisms and barriers are required, as well as an appreciation of the relative reactivity of the glycosidic bond with respect to the corresponding canonical nucleoside. To this end, the PCM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d) reaction potential energy surfaces (PES) for deoxythymidine (dT) and dTg hydrolysis are characterized in the present study using solvent-phase optimizations and a model containing three explicit water molecules. The surfaces are comparable to those generated using functionals that account for dispersion interactions (B3LYP-D3 and M06-2X). Mapping the PES as a  of the glycosidic bond length and nucleophile-sugar distance reveals a synchronous S(N)2 mechanism as the lowest energy pathway for damaged dTg hydrolysis, which contrasts the preferred dissociative S(N)1 mechanism isolated for the deglycosylation of natural dT. As proposed for other enzymes, the difference in excision pathway may at least in part help the enzyme selectively target the damaged base and discriminate against the natural counterpart. Interestingly, the  to dTg deglycosylation (ΔG(‡) = 138.0 kJ mol(-1)) is much higher than for dT deglycosylation (ΔG(‡) = 112.7 kJ mol(-1)), which supports the stability of this lesion and clarifies the catalytic feat presented to DNA repair enzymes that remove this detrimental damage from the genome. Although nucleotide excision repair (NER) typically targets bulky DNA lesions, the large calculated  for dTg deglycosylation rationalizes why the NER mechanism also excises this non-bulky lesion from cellular DNA.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797788>An 18-electron system containing a superheavy element: theoretical studies of sg@au12.</a></h2><p>M@Au12 cage molecules (M = transition element from group 6) are interesting clusters with high-symmetric structure and significant stability. As the heavier homologue of W is (106)Sg, it is interesting to pinpoint whether the Sg@Au12 cluster is also stable. Geometric and electronic structures and bonding of various Sg@Au12 isomers were investigated with density functional theory (PW91, PBE, B3LYP) and wave function theory (MP2, CCSD(T)) approaches. The lowest- isomer of Sg@Au12 has icosahedral symmetry with significant Sg(6d)-Au() covalent-metallic interaction and is comparable to the lighter homologues (M = Mo, W), with similar binding , although Sg follows (as a rare case) the textbook rule "ns below (n - 1)d". The 12  valence electrons from Au12 and the six 7s6d ones from Sg can be viewed as an 18e system below and above the interacting Au 5d band, forming nine delocalized multicenter bond pairs with a high stability of ∼0.8 eV of bond  per each of the 12 Sg-Au contacts. Different prescriptions (orbital, multipole-deformation, charge-partition, and X-ray-spectroscopy based ones) assign ambiguous atomic charges to the centric and peripheral atoms; atomic core-level  shifts correspond to some negative charge shift to the gold periphery, more so for Cr@Au12 than for Sg@Au12 or Au@Au12.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30468546>C3 and C6 Modification-Specific OYE Biotransformations of Synthetic Carvones and Sequential BVMO Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Chiral Caprolactones.</a></h2><p>The scope for biocatalytic modification of non-native carvone derivatives for speciality intermediates has hitherto been limited. Additionally, caprolactones are important feedstocks with diverse applications in the polymer industry and new non-native terpenone-derived biocatalytic caprolactone syntheses are thus of potential value for industrial biocatalytic materials applications. Biocatalytic reduction of synthetic analogues of R-(-)-carvone with additional substituents at C3 or C6, or both C3 and C6, using three types of OYEs (OYE2, PETNR and OYE3) shows significant impact of both regio-substitution and the substrate diastereomer. Bioreduction of (-)-carvone derivatives substituted with a Me and/or OH group at C6 is highly dependent on the diastereomer of the substrate. Derivatives bearing C6 substituents larger than methyl moieties are not substrates. Computer docking studies of PETNR with both ()-Me and (6R)-Me substituted (-)-carvone provides a model consistent with the outcomes of bioconversion. The products of bioreduction were efficiently biotransformed by the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVase) CHMO_Phi1 to afford novel trisubstituted lactones with complete regioselectivity to provide a new biocatalytic entry to these chiral caprolactones. This provides both new non-native polymerization feedstock chemicals, but also with enhanced efficiency and selectivity over native (+)-dihydrocarvone Baeyer-Villigerase expansion. Optimum enzymatic reactions were scaled up to 60-100 mg, demonstrating the utility for preparative biocatalytic synthesis of both new synthetic scaffold-modified dihydrocarvones and efficient biocatalytic entry to new chiral caprolactones, which are potential single-isomer chiral polymer feedstocks.© 2019 The Authors.

Recent work demonstrates that specialized proresolving lipid mediators biosynthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as resolvin D1 (RvD1), actively orchestrate the process of  resolution. We investigated the effects of local perivascular delivery of RvD1 in a rabbit vein graft model.Ipsilateral jugular veins were implanted as carotid interposition grafts through an anastomotic cuff technique in New Zealand white rabbits (3-4 kg; N = 80). RvD1 (1 μg) was delivered to the vein bypass grafts in a perivascular fashion, using either 25% Pluronic F127 gel (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo) or a thin bilayered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) film. No treatment (bypass only) and vehicle-loaded Pluronic gels or PLGA films served as controls. Delivery of RvD1 to venous tissue was evaluated 3 days later by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Total leukocyte infiltration, macrophage infiltration, and cell proliferation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Elastin and trichrome staining was performed on grafts harvested at 28 days after bypass to evaluate neointimal hyperplasia and vein graft remodeling.Perivascular treatments did not influence rates of graft thrombosis (23%), major wound complications (4%), or death (3%). Leukocyte (CD45) and macrophage (RAM11) infiltration was significantly reduced in the RvD1 treatment groups vs controls at 3 days (60%-72% reduction; P < .01). Cellular proliferation (Ki67 index) was also significantly lower in RvD1-treated vs control grafts at 3 days (40%-50% reduction; P < .01). Treatment of vein grafts with RvD1-loaded gels reduced neointimal thickness at 28 days by 61% vs bypass only (P < .001) and by 63% vs vehicle gel (P < .001). RvD1-loaded PLGA films reduced neointimal formation at 28 days by 50% vs bypass only (P < .001). RvD1 treatment was also associated with reduced collagen deposition in vein grafts at 28 days.Local perivascular delivery of RvD1 attenuates vein graft hyperplasia without associated toxicity in a rabbit carotid bypass model. This effect appears to be mediated by both reduced leukocyte recruitment and decreased cell proliferation within the graft. Perivascular PLGA films may also impart protection through biomechanical scaffolding in this venous arterialization model. Our studies provide further support for the potential therapeutic role of specialized proresolving lipid mediators such as D-series resolvins in modulating vascular injury and repair.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

We have used Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy together with (57)Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) to probe the structure of NifB-co while bound to the NifX protein from Azotobacter vinelandii. The spectra have been interpreted in part by comparison with data for the completed FeMo-co attached to the NafY carrier protein: the NafY:FeMo-co complex. EXAFS analysis of the NifX:NifB-co complex yields an average Fe-S distance of 2.26 A and average Fe-Fe distances of 2.66 and 3.74 A. Search profile analyses reveal the presence of a single Fe-X (X = C, N, or O) interaction at 2.04 A, compared to a 2.00 A Fe-X interaction found in the NafY:FeMo-co EXAFS. This suggests that the interstitial light atom (X) proposed to be present in FeMo-co has already inserted at the NifB-co stage of biosynthesis. The NRVS exhibits strong bands from Fe-S stretching modes peaking around 270, 315, 385, and 408 cm(-1). Additional intensity at approximately 185-200 cm(-1) is interpreted as a set of cluster "breathing" modes similar to those seen for the FeMo-cofactor. The strength and location of these modes also suggest that the FeMo-co interstitial light atom seen in the crystal structure is already in place in NifB-co. Both the EXAFS and NRVS data for NifX:NifB-co are best simulated using a Fe  9X trigonal prism structure analogous to the 6Fe core of FeMo-co, although a 7Fe structure made by capping one trigonal 3S terminus with Fe cannot be ruled out. The results are consistent with the conclusion that the interstitial light atom is already present at an early stage in FeMo-co biosynthesis prior to the incorporation of Mo and R-homocitrate.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682911>Detection of individual responses to clopidogrel: Validation of a novel, rapid analysis using thrombelastography .</a></h2><p>There is potential value in testing individual response to P2Y12 inhibitors to predict ischemic and bleeding risk in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Lead(II) may either form hemidirected complexes with large bond distance distribution and an apparent gap for excess electron density, or holodirected ones with a symmetric coordination sphere with normal bond distance distribution, depending on the strength of antibonding lead /ligand np molecular orbital interactions and ligand-ligand interactions. The crystallographic data show that the solid lead(II) perchlorate and trifluoromethanesulfonate hydrate structures are hemidirected, while the solid lead(II) solvates of dma and dmpu have regular octahedral configuration with holodirected geometry and mean Pb-O bond distances in the range 2.50-2.52 Å. EXAFS data on the hydrated lead(II) ion in aqueous solution show broad bond distance distribution and a lack of inner-core multiple scattering contributions strongly indicating a hemidirected structure. The Pb-O bond distances found both by EXAFS and LAXS, 2.54(1) Å, point to a six-coordinate hydrated lead(II) ion in hemidirected fashion with an unevenly distributed electron density. The results obtained for the dmso solvated lead(II) ion in solution are ambiguous, but for the most part support a six-coordinate hemidirected complex. The mean Pb-O bond distances determined in dmf and dma solution by LAXS, 2.55(1) and 2.48(1) Å, respectively, indicate that in both solvate complexes lead(II) binds six solvent molecules with the former complex being hemidirected whereas the latter is holodirected. The dmpu and tmu solvated lead(II) ions have a regular holodirected octahedral configuration, as expected given their space-demanding characteristics and ligand-ligand intermolecular interactions. The dmtf solvated lead(II) ion in solution is most likely five-coordinate in a hemidirected configuration, with a mean Pb-S bond distance of 2.908(4) Å.

Essentially, GE primarily includes active ginger phenolics viz., 6-gingerol (6G), 8-gingerol (8G), 10-gingerol (10G), and 6-shogaol (). However, the druglikeness properties of active GE phenolics like solubility, stability, and  characteristics are poorly understood. Herein, we determined the physicochemical and biochemical properties of GE phenolics by conducting  assays and mouse pharmacokinetic studies with and without co-administration of ketoconazole (KTZ). GE phenolics showed low to moderate solubility in various pH buffers but were stable in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, indicating their suitability for oral administration. All GE phenolics were metabolically unstable and showed high intrinsic clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and human liver microsomes. Upon oral administration of 250 mg/kg GE, sub-therapeutic concentrations of GE phenolics were observed. Treatment of plasma samples with β-glucuronidase (βgd) increased the exposure of all GE phenolics by 10 to 700-fold. Co-administration of KTZ with GE increased the exposure of free GE phenolics by 3 to 60-fold. Interestingly, when the same samples were treated with βgd, the exposure of GE phenolics increased by 11 to 60-fold, suggesting inhibition of phase I  by KTZ but little effect on glucuronide conjugation. Correlating the in vitro and in vivo results, it is reasonable to conclude that phase II  seems to be the predominant clearance pathway for GE phenolics.

The configuration of natural teneraic acid is reported to correspond to trans-(2S,). However, a few studies are focused on the stereospecific synthesis of trans-(2S,)-teneraic acid. The present study investigates a convenient synthetic method that includes regiospecific anodic oxidation and stereospecific cobalt-catalyzed carbonylation to obtain trans-(2S,)-teneraic acid. Methyl (S)-N-benzoyl-α-methoxypipecolate, the key intermediate that displays a structure that corresponds to an intermediate (N-α-hydroxyalkyl amide) of intramolecular amidocarbonylation, was obtained via an anodic oxidation of methyl (S)-N-benzoylpipecolate.

In vitro studies conducted in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells show that the intracellular accumulation of vemurafenib is significantly restricted because of active efflux by P-gp and BCRP. Bidirectional flux studies indicated greater transport in the basolateral-to-apical direction than the apical-to-basolateral direction because of active efflux by P-gp and BCRP.

The first synthesis of such a precursor was achieved in an efficient and fully enantioselective manner using a thiopyran-based strategy for polypropionate synthesis. This putative precursor, a complex mixture of ring-chain and keto-enol tautomers, was kinetically stable and isomerized exceedingly slowly to the thermodynamically more stable siphonarin B. In the presence of imidazole, the mixture reached apparent equilibrium within several hours giving siphonarin B as the predominant component (ca. 70%), thereby constituting its enantioselective total synthesis. In the presence of alumina, both siphonarin B and the dihydroxytetraone precursor underwent retro-Claisen rearrangements (via a hemiacetal tautomer) to give baconipyrones A and C among other products. This is the first total synthesis of baconipyrone A and "biomimetic" synthesis of baconipyrone C. Control experiments suggested that baconipyrone A was produced in an unprecedented cascade process where the intermediate enol(ate) of the retro-Claisen rearrangement was directly engaged in aldol cyclization while baconipyrone C resulted from simple ketonization of the enol(ate). These experiments provide the first unambiguous demonstration that the baconipyrones are plausible isolation artifacts and suggest they are most likely derived from siphonarins rather than an "acyclic" precursor.

Limb perfusion and revascularization were assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging, capillary density, and collateral artery development. Mesenteric collateral artery flow and development were determined by arterial flow measurement and by histologic analysis, respectively. An in vitro aortic ring assay was performed on p53 and p53 aortic tissue to evaluate endothelial function. The p53 inhibitor and activator pifithrin-α and quinacrine, respectively, were used to modulate p53 activity in vivo after ischemia.Absence of p53 in mice resulted in increased limb perfusion (P < .05), capillary density (P < .05), and collateral artery development (P < .05) after induction of hindlimb ischemia. In the nonischemic mesenteric artery ligation model of arteriogenesis, p53 expression was induced in collateral arteries and increased arterial blood flow in mice lacking p53 (P < .05). Lack of p53 decreased apoptosis in ischemic hindlimb tissue (P < .05) and increased proangiogenic factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Endothelial cell outgrowth in vitro increased in the absence of p53 (P < .05). Pharmacologic augmentation of p53 expression after ischemia impaired perfusion and collateral artery formation and decreased VEGF levels (P < .05). Conversely, inhibition of p53 with pifithrin-α augmented limb perfusion (P < .05) and collateral artery formation (P < .05) and increased protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and VEGF. Pharmacologic augmentation and inhibition of p53 had no significant effect in mice lacking p53.p53 negatively regulates ischemia-induced angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Inhibition of p53 increases ischemia-induced arteriogenesis and limb perfusion and thus represents a potential therapeutic strategy for arterial occlusive disease.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Watching roadside, drinking and driving under drowsiness were assessed by an observer and self-reporting from the drivers. The common features of vehicle motions under four types of drowsy/distracted driving were analyzed using descriptive statistics and then Wilcoxon rank sum test. The results indicated that there was a significant difference of lateral acceleration rates and yaw rate acceleration between "normal driving" and drowsy/distracted driving. Study results also shown that, under drowsy/distracted driving, the lateral acceleration rates and yaw rate acceleration were significantly larger from the normal driving. The lateral acceleration rates were shown to suddenly increase or decrease by more than 2.0m/s(3) and the yaw rate acceleration by more than 2.5°/s(2). The standard deviation of acceleration rate (SDA) and standard deviation of yaw rate acceleration (SDY) were identified to as the common features of vehicle motion for distinguishing the drowsy/distracted driving from the normal driving. In order to identify a time window for effectively extracting the two common features, a double-window method was used and the optimized "Parent Window" and "Child Window" were found to be 55s and , respectively. The study results can be used to develop a driving assistant system, which can warn drivers when any one of the four types of drowsy/distracted driving is detected.Copyright © 2015.

Among these, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate, side chains of PGs, are widely distributed in animal kingdom and show structural variations, such as sulfation patterns and degree of epimerization, which are responsible for their physiological functions through interactions with growth factors, chemokines and adhesion molecules. However, structural changes in CS, particularly the ratio of 4--sulfation to 6--sulfation (4S/) and CS chain length that occur during the aging process, are not fully understood. We found that 4S/ ratio and molecular  of CS were decreased in polyamine-depleted cells. In addition, decreased levels of chondroitin synthase 1 (CHSY1) and chondroitin 4--sulfotransferase 2 proteins were also observed on polyamine depletion. Interestingly, the translation initiation of CHSY1 was suppressed by a highly structured sequence (positions -202 to -117 relative to the initiation codon) containing RNA G-quadruplex (G4) structures in 5'-untranslated region. The formation of the G4s was influenced by the neighboring sequences to the G4s and polyamine stimulation of CHSY1 synthesis disappeared when the formation of the G4s was inhibited by site-directed mutagenesis. These results suggest that the destabilization of G4 structures by polyamines stimulates CHSY1 synthesis and, at least in part, contribute to the maturation of CS chains.© 2018 The Author(s).

One possible comedication is the sedative α-agonist medetomidine. Advantages of that combination are the compensation of side effects of the two drugs and the anesthetic-sparing effect of medetomidine. In vitro studies showed that medetomidine has an inhibitive effect on the formation of norketamine. Norketamine is the first metabolite of ketamine and is also active. It is followed by others like 6-hydroxynorketamine and 5,6-dehydronorketamine (DHNK). In an in vivo pharmacokinetic study Beagle dogs under sevoflurane anesthesia (mean end-tidal concentration 3.0±0.2%) or following medetomidine sedation (450μg/m) received 4mg/kg racemic ketamine or 2mg/kg S-ketamine. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 900min after drug injection. 50μL aliquots of plasma were pretreated by liquid-liquid extraction prior to analysis of the reconstituted extracts with a robust enantioselective capillary electrophoresis assay using highly sulfated γ-cyclodextrin as chiral selector and electrokinetic sample injection of the analytes from the extract across a short buffer plug without chiral selector. Levels of S- and R-ketamine, S- and R-norketamine, (2S,)- and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine and S- and R-DHNK were determined. Data were analyzed with compartmental pharmacokinetic models which included two compartments for the ketamine and norketamine enantiomers and a single compartment for the DHNK and 6-hydroxynorketamine stereoisomers. Medetomidine showed an effect on the formation and elimination of all metabolites. Stereoselectivities were detected for 6-hydroxynorketamine and DHNK, but not for ketamine and norketamine.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The graphene modified electrode was achieved by simply dipping the GCE in GO suspension, followed by cyclic voltammetric scanning in the potential window from 0V to -1.5V. Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) [Ru(bpy)3(2+)] was immobilized on the graphene modified electrode and used as the redox probe to evaluate the electron transfer behavior. The electron transfer rate constant (Ks) was calculated to be 61.9±5.8s(-1), which is much faster than that of tiled graphene modified GCE (7.1±0.(-1)). The enhanced electron transfer property observed with the GCE modified by reductively deposited graphene is probably due to its standing configuration, which is beneficial to the electron transfer comparing with the tiled one. Because the abundant -containing groups are mainly located at the edges of GO, which should be much easier for the reduction to start from, the reduced GO should tend to stand on the electrode surface as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. In addition, due to the favored electron transfer and standing configuration, the Ru(bpy)3(2+) electrochemiluminescence sensor fabricated with standing graphene modified GCE provided much higher and more stable efficiency than that fabricated with tiled graphene.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The PE spectra all exhibit an intense electronic transition to the neutral ground state, all falling in the range of 0.7 to 1.1 eV electron binding , with polarization dependence consistent with detachment from diffuse Ce -based molecular orbitals. There is no monotonic increase in electron affinity with increasing oxidation. A qualitative picture of how electronic structure evolves with an oxidation state emerges from comparison between the spectra and the computational results. The electronic structure of the smallest metallic cluster observed in this study, Ce, is similar to the bulk structure in terms of atomic orbital occupancy (4f 5d ). Initial cerium cluster oxidation involves largely ionic bond formation via Ce 5d and O 2p orbital overlap (i.e., larger O 2p contribution), with Ce-O-Ce bridge bonding favored over Ce=O terminal bond formation. With subsequent oxidation, the Ce 5d-based molecular orbitals are depleted of electrons, with the highest occupied orbitals described as diffuse Ce  based molecular orbitals. In the y ≤ (x + 1) range of oxidation states, each Ce center has a singly occupied non-bonding 4f orbital. The PE spectrum of CeO is unique in that it exhibits a single nearly vertical transition. The highly symmetric structure predicted computationally is the same structure determined from CeO IR predissociation spectra [A. M. Burow et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 13, 19393 (2011)], indicating that this structure is stable in -1, 0, and +1 charge states. Spectra of clusters with x ≥ 3 exhibit considerable continuum signal above the ground state transition; the intensity of the continuum signal decreases with increasing oxidation. This feature is likely the result of numerous quasi-bound anion states or two-electron transitions possible in molecules with abundant nearly degenerate partially occupied orbitals.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753580>Acceleration of diabetic wound healing with adipose-derived stem cells, endothelial-differentiated stem cells, and topical conditioned medium therapy in a swine model.</a></h2><p>The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), endothelial-differentiated ASCs (EC/ASCs), and various conditioned media (CM) on wound healing in a diabetic swine model. We hypothesized that ASC-based therapies would accelerate wound healing.Diabetes was induced in four Yorkshire swine through intravenous injection of streptozotocin. ASCs were harvested from flank fat and cultured in either M199 or EGM-2 medium. A duplicate series of seven full-thickness dorsal wounds were surgically created on each swine. The wounds in the cellular treatment group underwent injection of low-dose or high-dose ASCs or EC/ASCs on day 0, with a repeat injection of one half of the initial dose on day 15. Wounds assigned to the topical CM therapy were covered with 2 mL of either serum-free M199 primed by ASCs or human umbilical vein endothelial cells every 3 days. Wounds were assessed at day 0, 10, 15, 20, and 28. The swine were sacrificed on day 28. ImageJ software was used to evaluate the percentage of wound healing. The wounded skin underwent histologic, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examinations to evaluate markers of angiogenesis and inflammation.We found an increase in the percentage of wound closure rates in cell-based treatments and topical therapies at various points compared with the untreated control wounds (P < .05). The results from the histologic, messenger RNA, and protein analyses suggested the treated wounds displayed increased angiogenesis and a diminished inflammatory response.Cellular therapy with ASCs, EC/ASCs, and topical CM accelerated diabetic wound healing in the swine model. Enhanced angiogenesis and immunomodulation might be key contributors to this process.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The recovery of the SPE method in the analysis of sewage treatment plant (STP) influent and effluent wastewater was on average 80% and the ion suppression 30%. For less demanding samples Oasis MCX used alone may be an alternative method, although for STP influent waters containing high loads of organic compounds the clean-up achieved using only Oasis MCX was insufficient, leading to unreliable quantitation. Furthermore, serial SPE separation according to molecular charge added an additional degree of analyte confirmation. For quantitation, an approach combining external standard calibration curves, isotopically labelled surrogate standards and single-point standard addition was used.

For a majority of techniques, the most common long-term complication is pseudoptosis. It has previously been proposed that upper breast suspensory ligaments (SL) are weaker than lower breast SL. We tested this hypothesis through anthropometry of the proxies for upper and lower SL strength: the sternal notch-nipple (SN-N) distance and the nipple-inframammary fold (N-IMF) distance, respectively.An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty in an academic faculty practice between 2008 and 2015 was conducted. Patient demographics included age, race, and  mass index (BMI); patient comorbidities included smoking status, diabetes, and hypertension. Breast anthropometric measurements included SN-N and N-IMF. Sternal notch-nipple was used as the primary metric of the upper SL strength, whereas N-IMF was used as the primary metric of the lower SL strength. Intraoperative details included reduction technique and resection mass. Postoperative complications were recorded, including nipple areola complex necrosis and hematoma. Linear regression analysis was performed with the primary endpoint of the relationship between SN-N and N-IMF distance in macromastia.Data from 208 patients, totaling 400 individual breast measurements, were collected. The mean SN-N length was 35.1 cm, mean N-IMF length was 16.0 cm, and mean resection  was 1094 g. Linear regression found that N-IMF distance could be predicted as 45% of the SN-N distance (N-IMF = 0.454 * SN-N). This was a strong relationship, demonstrated by univariate analysis of SN-N and N-IMF (R, 0.624; P < 0.001). A Wise pattern was used in 89.9% of cases; an inferior pedicle was used in 83.7% of cases. Nipple areola complex necrosis occurred in 15 breasts (3.75%). Sternal notch-nipple (R, 0.127; P = 0.011) and N-IMF (R, 0.119; P = 0.017) were both predictive of nipple areola complex necrosis (Table 4).In our series, the N-IMF distance increased 0.45 cm for every 1 cm increase in the SN-N distance. This relationship strengthens our primary hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. Taking this into consideration, we suggest that surgeons seeking to minimize pseudoptosis rates should favor techniques that minimally disrupt the lower SL.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30104096>Reversible secretome and signaling defects in diabetic mesenchymal stem cells from peripheral arterial disease patients.</a></h2><p>Regenerative medicine seeks to stall or to reverse the pathologic consequences of chronic diseases. Many people with diabetes have peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which increases their already high risk of major amputation. Cellular therapies are a promising regenerative medicine approach to PAD that can be used to focally inject regenerative cells to endangered tissue beds. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to promote tissue regeneration through stromal support and paracrine stimulation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Whereas little is known about human diabetic MSCs (dMSCs), particularly those from patients with PAD, dMSCs have a limited expansion capacity but can be improved with human platelet lysate (PL) supplementation. PL is rich in many growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is known to be important to cell proliferation and survival signaling . We hypothesize that dMSCs have a reversible defect in EGF receptor . The objective of this work was to test this hypothesis using dMSCs from PAD patients.The secretome expression of EGF and prominent angiogens was characterized from bone marrow (BM)-derived and adipose tissue-derived (ATD) dMSCs from five patients (six limbs) undergoing major amputation. Western blot was used to characterize the AKT and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 expression in dMSCs under standard culture (5% fetal bovine serum plus fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF2]), 5% human PL, or 5% fetal bovine serum plus EGF. Healthy donor MSCs were control cells. The angiogenic activity of BM- and ATD-dMSCs was tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs). Paired t-test, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate.Both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had typical MSC surface marker expression and similar expansion profiles, and they did not express EGF in their secretome. PL supplementation of dMSCs improved AKT signaling, but they were resistant to FGF2 activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2. EGF supplementation led to similar AKT expression as with PL, but PL had greater phosphorylation of AKT at 30 and 60 minutes. The conditioned media from both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had robust levels of prominent angiogens (vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, hepatocyte growth factor), which stimulated EC proliferation and migration, and the co-culture of dMSCs with ECs led to significantly longer EC sprouts in three-dimensional gel than EC-alone pellets.PL and EGF supplementation improves AKT expression in dMSCs over that of FGF2, but PL improved pAKT over that of EGF. Thus, PL supplementation strategies may improve AKT signaling, which could be important to MSC survival in cellular therapies. Furthermore, BM- and ATD-dMSCs have similar secretomes and robust in vitro angiogenic activity, which supports pursuing dMSCs from both reservoirs in regenerative medicine strategies.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

We sought to utilize validated patient-reported outcomes instruments to identify the patient population with the greatest burn-related disability in order to appropriately allocate plastic surgery resources to those in greatest need.The Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and Burn-Specific Health Scale-Revised, Brief, and Adapted questionnaires were administered via an interpreter during a plastic surgery trip to Jharkhand, India, in January 2018. Demographics, comorbidities, and burn-specific history were recorded.Twenty-eight postburn patients were surveyed (mean age, 17.0 ± 9.2 years; male:female ratio, 1:2.5). Mean time from injury was 4.74 years. No patient had received formal, primary burn care. Mechanism of injury: flame (39%), oil (32%), scalding water (14%), and other (14%). Fifty-four percent were extremity burns; 25%, facial; and 18%, neck burns. The Burn-Specific Health Scale-Revised, Brief, and Adapted demonstrated that the most significantly impacted domains for all patients were body image and skin sensitivity, with more than 80% of patients complaining of issues with skin sensitivity. In addition, children (aged <18 years) had diminished body image domain scores. RAND SF-36 scores were lowest in the  (73.1 ± 25.0) and general health (76.5 ± 13.8) domains, and females with extremity burns demonstrated statistically significant decreases in their physical limitation domain scores (85.9 ± 17.3, P < 0.05). Females with extremity burns also had statistically significant lower scores in the  domain (64.09 ± 25.75) as compared with their male counterparts with extremity burns (100 ± 0, P = 0.045). In general, females scored lower than did males in multiple domains, and those results reached statistical significance in the  (65.9 ± 24.6 vs 93.6 ± 10.9), emotional (77.2 ± 21.5 vs 95.4 ± 11.2), and general health domains (71.1 ± 11.9 vs 90.0 ± 7.5) with P < 0.05.

Male and female children with extremity burns and adult women with extremity burns were most significantly affected in multiple domains. Consequently, children and adult women with extremity burns appear to be the patient cohort with the greatest opportunity to impact their quality of life.

RNA sequencing of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs), the preferred targets during human rickettsioses, infected with R. prowazekii revealed the presence of 35 trans-acting and 23 cis-acting sRNAs, respectively. Of these, expression of two trans-acting (Rp_sR17 and Rp_sR60) and one cis-acting (Rp_sR47) novel sRNAs and four well-characterized bacterial sRNAs (RNaseP_bact_a, α-tmRNA, 4.5S RNA,  RNA) was further confirmed by Northern blot or RT-PCR analyses. The transcriptional start sites of five novel rickettsial sRNAs and  RNA were next determined using 5' RLM-RACE yielding evidence for their independent biogenesis in R. prowazekii. Finally, computational approaches were employed to determine the secondary structures and potential mRNA targets of novel sRNAs. Together, these results establish the presence and expression of sRNAs in R. prowazekii during host cell infection and suggest potential functional roles for these important post-transcriptional regulators in rickettsial biology and pathogenesis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30427335>Excited interatomic potential  surfaces of Rb + He that correlate with Rb terms 5S through 7S.</a></h2><p>The excited state interatomic potential  surfaces for Rb + He are computed at the spin-orbit multi-reference configuration interaction level of theory using all-electron basis sets of triple and quadruple-zeta quality that have been contracted for Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) Hamiltonian and includes core-valence correlation. Davidson-Silver corrections (MRCI+Q) are employed to ameliorate size consistency error.

In the excitation spectra extracted from the 2D-EE scans, two dominant thermally stable sites were identified, consisting of a classic, three-fold split Jahn-Teller band, labeled the blue site, and an unusual asymmetric 2 + 1 split band, the violet site. A much weaker band has also been identified, whose emission is strongly overlapped by the violet site. The temperature dependence of the luminescence for these sites was monitored revealing that the blue site has a non-radiative channel competing effectively with the fluorescence even at 9.8 K. By contrast, the fluorescence decay time of the violet site was recorded to be 4.3 ns and independent of temperature up to 24 K. The nature of the dominant thermally stable trapping sites was investigated theoretically with Diatomics-in-Molecule (DIM) molecular dynamics simulations. The DIM model was parameterized with ab initio multi-reference configuration interaction calculations for the lowest  excited states of the Ba⋅Xe pair. The simulated absorption spectra are compared with the experimental results obtained from site-resolved excitation spectroscopy. The simulations allow us to assign the experimental blue feature spectrum to a tetra-vacancy trapping site in the bulk xenon fcc crystal-a site often observed when trapping other metal atoms in rare gas matrices. By contrast, the violet site is assigned to a specific 5-atom vacancy trapping site located at a grain boundary.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894723>Theory of Valence Transition in BiNiO_{3}.</a></h2><p>Motivated by the colossal negative thermal expansion recently found in BiNiO_{3}, the valence transition accompanied by the charge transfer between the Bi and Ni sites is theoretically studied. We introduce an effective model for Bi- and Ni-3d orbitals taking into account the valence skipping of Bi cations, and investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams within the mean-field approximation. We find that the valence transition is caused by commensurate locking of the electron filling in each orbital associated with charge and magnetic orderings, and the critical temperature and the nature of the transitions are strongly affected by the relative  between the Bi and Ni levels and the effective electron-electron interaction in the Bi sites. The obtained phase diagram well explains the temperature- and pressure-driven valence transitions in BiNiO_{3} and the systematic variation of valence states for a series of Bi and Pb perovskite oxides.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28156029>Cationic imprinting of Pb(II) within composite networks based on bovine or fish chondroitin sulfate.</a></h2><p>Imprinting chondroitin sulfate (CS)/silica composites with Pb(II) and Cu(II) cations was explored with CS of bovine and different fish species origin. The process was based on the assumption that particular arrangements of the linear CS chains in aqueous solution, induced so as to accommodate cross complexation with the cations, would be embodied into a tridimensional matrix created through an organoalkoxysilane sol-gel scheme. The presence of Cu(II) in the synthesis of the composites did not result in the production of significantly stronger Cu(II)-oriented binding arrangements, and therefore, the imprinting was not successful. Inversely, for Pb(II), the materials obtained exhibited a "memory" effect for the Pb(II) ions, expressed in the observation of stronger (13%-44%) binding as compared to the nonimprinted counterparts, and increased selectivity (1.5-2 folds) against Cd(II). The imprinting features observed were dependent on the CS source. However, it was not possible to identify, among a set of their properties (carboxylate and sulfate abundance, percent of disulfated units, 4S/ ratio, and molecular ), any that correlated directly with the observed imprinting features. The augmented selectivity provided by the cation-imprinting process may be advantageous in areas such as analytical separation, remediation, purification, sensing, and others, particularly in those cases where a certain cation is of special interest within a mixture of them.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30007776>Type 1  is associated with T-wave morphology changes.

Although the cloned enzyme has been demonstrated to have a critical role in tumor metastasis, the substrate specificity has been poorly understood. In the present study, the specificity of the purified recombinant human heparanase was investigated for the first time using a series of structurally defined oligosaccharides isolated from heparin/heparan sulfate. The best substrates were deltaHexUA(+/-2S)-GlcN(NS,)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,) and deltaHexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,)-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,) (where deltaHexUA, GlcN, GlcUA, NS, 2S, and  represent unsaturated hexuronic acid, d-glucosamine, d-glucuronic acid, 2-N-sulfate, 2-O-sulfate, and 6-O-disulfate, respectively). Based on the percentage conversion of the substrates to products under identical assay conditions, several aspects of the recognition structures were revealed. 1) The minimum recognition backbone is the trisaccharide GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN. 2) The target GlcUA residues are in the sulfated region. 3) The -GlcN()-GlcUA-GlcN(NS)- sequence is essential but not sufficient as the cleavage site. 4) The IdoUA(2S) residue, located two saccharides away from the target GlcUA residue, claimed previously to be essential, is not indispensable. 5) The 3-O-sulfate group on the GlcN is dispensable and even has an inhibitory effect when located in a highly sulfated region. 6) Based on these and previous results, HexUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,)-IdoUA-GlcNAc()-GlcUA-GlcN(NS,+/-)-IdoUA(2S)-GlcN(NS,) (where HexUA represents hexuronic acid) has been proposed as a probable physiological target octasaccharide sequence.

The transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the average particle diameter, which decreased from 4.4nm at 80kGy to 2.8nm at 120kGy. The UV-visible absorption spectrum was measured and found that platinum nanoparticles exhibit two steady absorption maxima in UV regions due to plasmonic excitation of conduction electrons, which blue shifted to lower wavelengths with a decrease in particle size. We consider the conduction electrons of platinum nanoparticles to follow Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-Weizsacker atomic model that they are not entirely free but weakly bounded to particles at lower- states {n = 5, l = 2 or 5d} and {n = 6, l = 0 or }, which upon receiving UV photon  the electrons make intra-band quantum excitations to higher- states allowed by the principles of quantum number that results the absorption maxima.

Urine from most mucopolysaccharidoses types had significant increases in di- and monosulfated N-acetylhexosamines (GalNAc4,, GalNAc6S, GalNAc4S, or GlcNAc6S) and monosulfated N-acetylhexosamine-uronic acid disaccharides (GalNAc6S-UA, GalNAc4S-UA, or GlcNAc6S-UA). Analysis of plasma and dried blood spots on filter paper collected from mucopolysaccharidoses patients showed elevations of total monosulfated N-acetylhexosamines but less than that seen in urine. Urine samples from bone marrow transplant recipients, mucopolysaccharidosis IVA and mucopolysaccharidosis VI patients, showed decreases in HexNAcS, HexNAcS(2)/GalNAc4,, and HexNAcS-UA post-transplant. This decrease correlated with clinical improvement to levels comparable with those identified in patients with less severe phenotypes. These  markers therefore have potential applications in diagnosis, phenotype prediction and monitoring of current and future therapies, particularly for the mucopolysaccharidosis IIID, IVA, VI, and multiple sulfatase deficiency. This paper reports a sensitive and simple method for the measurement of sulfated N-acetylhexosamines and sulfated disaccharides shown to be elevated in some mucopolysaccharidosis and multiple sulfatase deficient patients.Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science (USA)</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12633904>Sources of glucose production in cirrhosis by 2H2O ingestion and 2H NMR analysis of plasma glucose.</a></h2><p>Plasma glucose 2H enrichment was quantified by 2H NMR in patients with cirrhosis (n=6) and healthy subjects (n=5) fasted for 16 h and given 2H(2)O to approximately 0.5% body water. The percent contribution of glycogenolysis and  to glucose production (GP) was estimated from the relative enrichments of hydrogen 5 and hydrogen 2 of plasma glucose. Fasting plasma glucose levels were normal in both groups (87+/-7 and 87+/-24 mg/dl for healthy and cirrhotic subjects, respectively). The percent contribution of glycogen to GP was smaller in cirrhotics than controls (22+/-7% versus 46+/-4%, P<0.001), while the contribution from  was larger (78+/-7% versus 54+/-4%, P<0.001). In all subjects, glucose 6R and  hydrogens had similar enrichments, consistent with extensive exchange of 2H between body water and the hydrogens of gluconeogenic oxaloacetate (OAA). The difference in 2H-enrichment between hydrogen 5 and hydrogen  was significantly larger in cirrhotics, suggesting that the fractional contribution of glycerol to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)-moiety of plasma glucose was higher compared to controls (19+/-6% versus 7+/-6%, P<0.01). In all subjects, hydrogens 4 and 5 of glucose had identical enrichments while hydrogen 3 enrichments were systematically lower. This reflects incomplete exchange between the hydrogen of water and that of 1-R-dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) or incomplete exchange of DHAP and G3P pools via triose phosphate isomerase.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30115367>The multiple arrhythmia dataset evaluation database (M.A.D.A.E.).</a></h2><p>The convergence between wearable and medical device technologies is a natural progression. Miniaturization has allowed the design of small, compact monitoring systems that can record physiological signals over longer periods of time. Thus, the potential for these devices to expand the understanding of disease progression and patients' clinical status is very high. The accuracy of these devices, however, is dependent upon the computer algorithms utilized in the analysis of the large volume of physiological data monitored and/or recorded by the devices. Automated interpretation of the data by these new technologies, therefore, necessitates closer examination by regulatory organizations. The current requirements for the validation of novel Ambulatory ECG (A-ECG) annotation algorithms are based on the AAMI/ANSI-EC57 and IEC60601-2-47 Standard. These standards are being updated, but they rely on a very limited set of digitized ECG recordings from a couple of ECG databases built in the first half of the 70's. These reference signals are obsolete. We are developing a validation tool for computerized methods designed to detect and monitor cardiac activities based on -surface ECGs. We will rely on a set of existing digital high-resolution 12‑lead A-ECG recordings acquired in cardiac patients and healthy individuals. These ECG signals include a large and unique set of electrocardiographic events. This tool is being qualified by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Medical Device Development Tool (MDDT). This document provides insights into the design of the M.A.D.A.E. database, its functionalities, and its ultimate role in enabling the next generations of automatic interpretation of ECG signals.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, in the case of the non-basic reactant [Na3(H2O)4]2-[Al3Si3O12]2 an overexchange occurs with respect to the number of nonframework cationic charges. Rietveld structure refinement of the lead hydro sodalite based on powder X-ray diffraction data (cubic, a = 9.070 A, room temperature, space group P43n) revealed that the two lead cations within each polyhedral sodalite cage form an orientationally disordered dinuclear [Pb2(micro-OH)(micro-H2O)(H2O)2]3+ complex. Due to additional lead framework  bonds the coordination environment of each metal cation (CN 3+3) is approximately spherical, and clearly the lead  electron lone pair is stereochemically inactive. This is also suggested by the absence of a small peak at 13.025 keV, attributed in other Pb2+-O compounds to an electronic 2p- transition, in the PbL3 edge XANES spectrum. 1H MAS NMR and FTIR spectra show that the hydrogen atoms of the aqua hydroxo complex (which could not be determined in the Rietveld analysis) are involved in hydrogen bonds of various strengths.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25946320>Photodissociation of Methyl Iodide via Selected Vibrational Levels of the B̃ ((2)E3/2) Rydberg State.</a></h2><p>We have determined the I (2)P3/2 and (2)P1/2 branching fractions following the photodissociation of methyl iodide (CH3I) via a number of vibronic bands associated with the B̃ ((2)E3/2) Rydberg state at excitation wavelengths between 201.2 and 192.7 nm.

The main symptoms of CHF were edema in 54.5% of cases, dyspnea in 77% of cases, ascites was detected in only 2 patients, an enlarged liver in 7 patients. Abdominal  was detected in 53 patients. Quality of life was assessed by the SF‑36 questionnaire, the level of salt intake was assessed by the Charlton: SaltScreener questionnaire. Results. On average, the time of occurrence of the bendopnea was 22.5±9.3 seconds, the minimum was 5 seconds. The absence of the eﬀect of abdominal  on the risk of bendopnea (relative risk 1.18 [0.76; 1.83]) was revealed. According to the SF‑36 questionnaire, a decrease in physical health indicators (median 31.3 points [20.7; 42.3]) and psychological health (average score 43.2±21.7) was found. In patients with bendopnea, QOL was reduced due to both physical and mental health, unlike patients without bendopnea: physical functioning (Physical Functioning - PF) 24.8±16.1 against 47±28.9 points, p=0.001 ; role‑based functioning due to physical condition (Role‑Physical Functioning - RP), 0 [0; 25] vs. 37.5 [0; 100] points, p=0.008; general health (General Health - GH) 29.9±15.8 against 50±14.2 points, p=0.0005, social functioning (Social Functioning - SF) 56 ± 38 against 78.9 ± 17.8 points ; p = 0.004.

A time of flight mass spectrometer is used to detect the cluster distribution before and after the reactions. The observation of  reduction and hydrogen pickup of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) clusters strongly suggests the following reactions: (1) Ce(m)O(2m)(+) + C(2)H(4) --> Ce(m)O(2m-1)(+) + C(2)H(4)O (m = 2-6); (2) Ce(m)O(2m)(+) + CO --> Ce(m)O(2m-1)(+) + CO(2) (m = 4-6); and (3) Ce(m)O(2m)(+) + CH(4)/C(2)H(6) --> Ce(m)O(2m)H(+) + CH(3)/C(2)H(5) (m = 2-4). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to study reaction mechanisms of Ce(2)O(4)(+) + X (X = CO, CH(4), C(2)H(4), and C(2)H(6)). The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The structural and bonding properties of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) (m = 2-5) clusters are also investigated by the DFT calculations. The unpaired electron in each of the clusters is mainly distributed over one Ce atom (4f and 5p orbitals) and two O atoms (2p orbital) in a CeO(2) moiety, which can be considered as the active site in the cluster. To further understand the nature of the active sites in Ce(m)O(2m)(+) clusters, the fast flow reaction experiments are also carried out on zirconium oxide clusters Zr(m)O(n)(+), because both Zr ([Kr]4d(2)5s(2)) and Ce ([Xe]4f(1)5d(1)(2)) have the same number of valence electrons while the latter has one more f and one less d electrons. In addition to the  transfer reactions such as Zr(m)O(2m)(+) + C(2)H(4) --> Zr(m)O(2m-1)(+) + C(2)H(4)O (m = 1-4) reported in the literature, hydrogen abstraction reactions Zr(m)O(2m)(+) + CH(4)/C(2)H(6) --> Zr(m)O(2m)H(+) + CH(3)/C(2)H(5) are also identified. The rate constants of CO oxidation as well as hydrogen abstraction by Ce(m)O(2m)(+) and Zr(m)O(2m)(+) are very different. The reactivity and selectivity of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) versus Zr(m)O(2m)(+) can be well rationalized based on the DFT calculations. The  transfer and hydrogen abstraction reactions studied in this work are of widespread importance. The nature of the active sites of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) clusters is unique and may be considered in the use and design of cerium oxide based catalysts.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463398>Quel pourrait être le futur de la prise en charge de l’anémie dans l’insuffisance rénale chronique ?</a></h2><p>Erythropoietin (EPO) plays an essential role in the regulation of erythropoiesis.

Our results indicated that both expressed GII.3S/GII.6P and GII./GII.3P chimeric proteins successfully assembled into VLPs. Trypsin digestion of VLPs assembled from both chimeric proteins led to the generation of two fragments with molecular sizes similar to those of wild-type VP1-containing VLPs.

Patients with burns, drowning, and missing injury severity score were excluded. Volumes of crystalloid, packed red blood cells (PRBC), whole blood, plasma, and platelets (PLT) given in the first 24 hours were calculated per kilogram . Tranexamic acid use was also determined.

Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay and 24-hour and in-hospital mortality rates were compared.A total of 4,358 patients met inclusion criteria. Comparing Early versus Late, injuries from explosions, isolated or predominant head injuries, and injury severity score all increased.

A diabatization scheme has been designed to obtain the necessary potential  surfaces and couplings for complexes of Ba with an arbitrary number of helium atoms. It involves computing new He-Ba electronic wave functions and expanding them in determinants of the non-interacting complex. The 6p P ←  S photodissociation spectrum of He⋯Ba calculated with this model shows very weak coupling for a single He atom. However, several electronic relaxation mechanisms are identified, which could potentially explain the expulsion of barium ions from helium nanodroplets observed experimentally upon Ba photoexcitation. For instance, an avoided crossing in the ring-shaped HeBa structure is shown to provide an efficient pathway for fine structure relaxation. Symmetry breaking by either helium density fluctuations or vibrations can also induce efficient relaxation in these systems, e.g., bending vibrations in the linear HeBa excimer. The identified relaxation mechanisms can provide insight into helium-induced non-adiabatic transitions observed in other systems.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27679365>Uterine  as a Positive Correlation Factor for Longer Surgical Times in Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361007>Quantitative analysis of chondroitin sulfate disaccharides from human and rodent fixed brain tissue by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Chondroitin sulfates (CS) are long, negatively-charged, unbranched glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached to CS-proteoglycan (CSPG) core proteins that comprise the glycan component in both loose interstitial extracellular matrices (ECM) and in rigid, structured perineuronal net (PNN) scaffolds within the brain. As aberrant CS-PNN formations have been linked to a range of pathological states, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia, the analysis of CS-GAGs in brain tissue at the disaccharide level has great potential to enhance disease diagnosis and prognosis. Two mass-spectrometry (MS)-based approaches were adapted to detect CS disaccharides from minute fixed tissue samples with low picomolar sensitivity and high reproducibility. The first approach employed a straightforward, quantitative direct infusion (DI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technique to determine the percentages of Δ4S- and Δ-CS disaccharides within the 4S/-CS ratio, while the second used a comprehensive liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS technique to determine the relative percentages of Δ0S- Δ4S- Δ- Δ4S6S-CS, and Δ2S6S-CS disaccharides, with internal validation by full chondroitin lyase activity. The quantitative accuracy of the five primary biologically-relevant CS disaccharides was validated using a developmental time course series in fixed rodent brain tissue. We then analyzed the CS disaccharide composition in formalin-fixed human brain tissue, thus providing the first quantitative report of CS sulfation patterns in human brain. The ability to comprehensively analyze the CS disaccharide composition from fixed brain tissue provides a means with which to identify alterations in the CS-GAG composition in relation to the onset and/or progression of neurological diseases.© The Author(s) 2019.

The working electrode of a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was modified with nanocomposite constituted by poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and GO, which was electrochemically reduced to obtain PVA/PVP/RGO/SPCE. The interactions and morphology of the PVA/PVP/GO nanocomposite were investigated by SEM, FTIR and UV-Vis. SEM images indicated an excellent dispersion of the GO sheets in the polymer matrix. Besides, FTIR and visible UV studies revealed strong interactions between polymer mixture and GO sheets. According to electrochemical studies, the new platform increased the electroactive surface area by a factor of 20.46 compared to the unmodified SPCE. Also, the PVA/PVP/RGO/SPCE had a fast electron kinetics transfer process with a value of k = 9.6 s. The modified electrode was applied to the determination of IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies for the serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. The IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies quantification showed a detection limit of 0.012 U mL, and the coefficients of variation intra-day and inter-day assays were lower than 4.5% and 6.2%, respectively. The electrochemical platform proved to be a sensitive and easily applicable tool applied to the serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Therefore, the developed nanocomposite represents an excellent alternative for the electrochemical biosensor fabrication.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TSA was performed in 122 patients (50%), RTSA was performed in 103 (42%), and HA was performed in 20 (8%). No significant difference was found among the 5 BMI groups in arthroplasty type (P = .108) or in complications, including reoperations (P = .27). All groups had significant postoperative improvements in PROs and ROM (P < .001 for both).

Conventional OxFlow (Conv-OxFlow) entails four interleaves incorporated in a single pulse sequence - two for phase-contrast based measurement of tCBF in the supplying arteries of the neck, and two to measure the intra- to extravascular phase difference in the superior sagittal sinus to derive Y [Jain et al., JCBFM 2010]. However, this approach limits achievable temporal resolution thus precluding capture of rapid changes of brain  states such as the response to apneic stimuli. Here, we developed a time-efficient, multiplexed OxFlow method and evaluated its potential for measuring dynamic alterations in global CMRO during a breath-hold challenge. Two different implementations of multiplexed OxFlow were investigated: 1) simultaneous-echo-refocusing based OxFlow (SER-OxFlow) and 2) simultaneous-multi-slice imaging-based dual-band OxFlow (DB-OxFlow). The two sequences were implemented on 3T scanners (Siemens TIM Trio and Prisma) and their performance was evaluated in comparison to Conv-OxFlow in ten healthy subjects for baseline CMRO quantification. Comparison of measured parameters (Y, tCBF, CMRO) revealed no significant bias of SER-OxFlow and DB-OxFlow, with respect to the reference Conv-OxFlow while improving temporal resolution two-fold (12.5 versus 25s). Further acceleration shortened scan time to 8 and  for SER and DB-OxFlow, respectively, for time-resolved CMRO measurement. The two sequences were able of capturing smooth transitions of Y, tCBF, and CMRO over the time course consisting of 30s of normal breathing, 30s of volitional apnea, and 90s of recovery. While both SER- and DB-OxFlow techniques provide significantly improved temporal resolution (by a factor of 3 - 4 relative to Conv-OxFlow), DB-OxFlow was found to be superior for the study of short physiologic stimuli.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Its diverse range of substrates includes many common chemotherapeutics such as imatinib, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone. Physiologically, ABCG2 is highly expressed in areas such as the blood-brain  and gastrointestinal tract, where it is thought to play a role in protection against xenobiotic exposure. High ABCG2 expression has also been found in a variety of solid tumors and in hematologic malignancies and has been correlated with poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore, ABCG2 expression is a characteristic feature of cancer stem cells, which are able to self-renew and differentiate. These cancer stem cells have been postulated to play an important role in MDR, where their inherent ABCG2 expression may allow them to survive chemotherapy and repopulate the tumor after exposure to chemotherapeutics. This observation raises the exciting possibility that by inhibiting ABCG2, cancer stem cells and other cancers may be targeted and eradicated, at which point conventional chemotherapeutics would be sufficient to eliminate the remaining tumor cells. Inhibitors of ABCG2, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, and the fumitremorgin-type indolyl diketopiperazine, Ko143 [(3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester], could potentially be used for this purpose.

Both EPCs and MSCs are critical to the wound repair process, which is hindered in diabetes mellitus. Diabetes has been shown to decrease the function of these progenitor cells, whereas estrogen has beneficial wound healing effects. However, the role of estrogen in modulating EPC and MSC biology in diabetes is unknown. We investigated the effect of estrogen on improving bone marrow (BM)-derived EPC and MSC function using a murine diabetic wound healing model.Female diabetic db/db and nondiabetic control mice were wounded cutaneously and treated with topical estrogen or placebo cream. On day 5 after wounding, BM cells were harvested to quantify EPC number and colony-forming units of EPCs and MSCs. Wound healing rate was concurrently studied. Vessel density and scar density were then quantified using whole body perfusion and laser confocal microscopy. EPC recruitment was documented by immunohistochemistry to identify CD34- and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-positive cells in the vessel wall. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance.Topical estrogen significantly increased colony-forming units of both EPCs and MSCs compared with placebo treatment, indicating improved viability and proliferative ability of these cells. Consistently, increased recruitment of EPCs to diabetic wounds and higher vessel density were observed in estrogen-treated compared with placebo-treated mice. Consequently, topical estrogen significantly accelerated wound healing as early as day 6 after wounding. In addition, scar density resulting from collagen deposition was increased in the estrogen-treated group, reflecting increased MSC activity and differentiation.Estrogen treatment increases wound healing and wound neovascularization in diabetic mice. Our data implicate that these beneficial effects may be mediated through improving the function of BM-derived EPCs and MSCs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Four different models based on either the crystal or the aqueous solution structure of ubiquitin were used to describe H-bonding for selected residue pairs of ubiquitin. Calculated and measured 3hJ(NC') coupling constants differ depending on the model used, which is due to the fact that the geometry of ubiquitin is different in the solid state and in aqueous solution. Also, conformational averaging leads to a decrease of the magnitude of the measured 3hJ(NC') constants, which varies locally (larger for -sheets, smaller for -helix). Two different spin-spin coupling mechanisms were identified. While mechanism I transmits spin polarization via an electric field effect, mechanism II involves also electron delocalization from the lone pair of the carbonyl  to the antibonding orbital of the N-H bond. Mechanism I is more important in the crystal structure of ubiquitin, while in aqueous solution, mechanism II plays a larger role. It is possible to set up simple relationships between the spin-spin coupling constants associated with the H bond in proteins and the geometrical features of these bonds.

AuROC of plasma and urine NGAL for AKI were 0.66 (0.54-0.77) and 0.71 (0.59-0.82), respectively, and for 90-day mortality 0.55 (0.47-0.63) and 0.61 (0.53-0.70), respectively. Combining NGAL values with plasma creatinine did not improve AuROCs.In ICU patients with severe sepsis, plasma and urine NGAL had low predictive power for use of RRT, AKI and 90-day mortality. These results were supported by sensitivity and exploratory analyses.© 2014 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

To facilitate the transfer of these genes into wheat, information on their chromosomal location is important. A genetic linkage map of Ae. sharonensis was constructed based on 179 F2 plants derived from a cross between accessions resistant (1644) and susceptible (1193) to wheat leaf rust. The linkage map was based on 389 markers (377 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci) and was comprised of 10 linkage groups, ranging from 2.3 to 124.6 cM. The total genetic length of the map was 818.0 cM, with an average interval distance between markers of 3.63 cM. Based on the chromosomal location of 115 markers previously mapped in wheat, the four linkage groups of A, B, C, and E were assigned to Ae. sharonensis (S(sh)) and homoeologous wheat chromosomes 6, 1, 3, and 2. The single dominant gene (designated LrAeSh1644) conferring resistance to leaf rust race THBJ in accession 1644 was positioned on linkage group A (chromosome (sh)) and was flanked by DArT markers wpt-9881 (at 1.9 cM distal from the gene) and wpt-6925 (4.5 cM proximal). This study clearly demonstrates the utility of DArT for genotyping uncharacterized species and tagging resistance genes where pertinent genomic information is lacking.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685513>Expression of platelet-derived growth factor B is upregulated in patients with thoracic aortic dissection.</a></h2><p>Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a serious condition requiring urgent treatment to avoid catastrophic consequences. The inflammatory response is involved in the occurrence and development of TAD, possibly potentiated by platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). This study aimed to determine whether expression of PDGF-B (a subunit of PDGF-BB) was increased in TAD patients and to explore the factors responsible for its upregulation and subsequent effects on TAD.Full-thickness ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients (n = 15) and control patients (n = 10) were examined for expression of PDGF-B and its receptor (PDGFRB) and in terms of morphology, inflammation, and fibrosis. Blood samples from TAD and control patients were collected to detect plasma levels of PDGF-BB and soluble elastins.Expression levels of PDGF-B, PDGFRB, and collagen I were significantly enhanced in ascending aorta wall specimens from TAD patients compared with controls. Furthermore, soluble elastic fragments and PDGF-BB were significantly increased in plasma from TAD patients compared with controls, and numerous irregular elastic fibers and macrophages were seen in the ascending aorta wall in TAD patients.An increase in elastic fragments in the aorta wall might be responsible for inducing the activation and migration of macrophages to injured sites, leading to elevated expression of PDGF-B, which in turn induces deposition of collagen, disrupts extracellular matrix homeostasis, and increases the stiffness of the aorta wall, resulting in compromised aorta compliance.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

PCC 6803.</a></h2><p>The  RNA is a global transcriptional riboregulator, which is exceptionally widespread among most bacterial phyla. While its role is well-characterized in some heterotrophic bacteria, we subjected a cyanobacterial homolog to functional analysis, thereby extending the scope of  RNA action to the special challenges of photoautotrophic lifestyles.Physiological characterization of a  RNA deletion strain (ΔssaA) demonstrates a delay in the recovery from nitrogen starvation. Significantly decelerated phycobilisome reassembly and glycogen degradation are accompanied with reduced photosynthetic activity compared to the wild type. Transcriptome profiling further revealed that predominantly genes encoding photosystem components, ATP synthase, phycobilisomes and ribosomal proteins were negatively affected in ΔssaA. In vivo pull-down studies of the RNA polymerase complex indicated that the presence of  RNA promotes the recruitment of the cyanobacterial housekeeping σ factor SigA, concurrently supporting dissociation of group 2 σ factors during recovery from nitrogen starvation.The combination of genetic, physiological and biochemical studies reveals the homologue of  RNA as an integral part of the cellular response of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to changing nitrogen availability. According to these results,  RNA supports a rapid acclimation to changing nitrogen supply by accelerating the switch from group 2 σ factors SigB, SigC and SigE to SigA-dependent transcription. We therefore introduce the cyanobacterial  RNA as a novel candidate regulator of RNA polymerase sigma factor recruitment in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Further studies on mechanistic features of the postulated interaction should shed additional light on the complexity of transcriptional regulation in cyanobacteria.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1643265>Heavy metal binding to heparin disaccharides.

A conformational analysis of the metal free and metal bound solutions was made by comparing calculated [(NOE)]s, [T1]s, and [J]s to experimental values. The 1C4, 4C1, and 2S0 conformations of the L-idopyranosiduronate ring and the 4E and 4T3 of the anhydro-D-mannitol ring are evaluated as are rotations about the C5-C6 hydroxymethylene of the AnManOH() or GlcNS () residues. The NOE between IdopA2S H1 and H3 and the known NOE between H2 and H5, as well as the T1 of IdopA2S H3, are introduced as NMR observables sensitive to the IdopA2S ring conformation. Similarly, a NOE between IdopA2S H5 and AnManOH() or GlcNS() H3 was observed that directly restricts the allowed interglycosidic conformational space. For all disaccharides, the Zn(II) bound spectral data are consistent with models in which these motions are partially "frozen" such that the 1C4 conformation of the IdopA2S is stabilized along with the 4T3 conformation of the AnManOH() ring. The interglycosidic conformation is also stabilized in one of two minima. Electrostatic potential energy calculations gave the best overall agreement with experiment and suggest metal binding conformations with the carboxylate and ring  of the IdopA2S residues (1C4 conformation) and either O3 of the GlcNS() residues or the sulfate oxygens of the 6-sulphate for 2b providing additional chelating sites. These chelation models concur with the observation of marked 13C and 1H NMR chemical shifts for the IdopA2S resonances and of GlcNS H3 for 2 alpha and GlcNS6S C6 for 2b. This study of model compounds implicates the IdopA2S(alpha 1,4)GlcNS6S group as part of the heavy metal binding site in biologically important acidic oligosaccharides such as heparin.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14219073>THE IMMUNOLOGIC BEHAVIOR OF BABY PIGS.

Physiological concentrations of tetrahydrobiopterin, the natural and endogenous cofactor for the hydroxylase, significantly enhance the inactivation of the enzyme caused by each of these nitric oxide generators. The substrate tryptophan does not have this effect. The chemically reduced (tetrahydro-) form of the pterin is required for the enhancement, because neither biopterin nor dihydrobiopterin is effective. The -isomer of tetrahydrobiopterin, which has little cofactor efficacy for tryptophan hydroxylase, does not enhance enzyme inactivation as does the natural 6R-isomer. A number of synthetic, reduced pterins share with tetrahydrobiopterin the ability to enhance nitric oxide-induced inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase. The tetrahydrobiopterin effect is not prevented by agents known to scavenge hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radicals, peroxynitrite anions, hydroxyl radicals, or singlet . On the other hand, cysteine partially protects the enzyme from both the nitric oxide-induced inactivation and the combined pterin/nitric oxide-induced inactivation. These results suggest that the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor enhances the nitric oxide-induced inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase via a mechanism that involves attack on free protein sulfhydryls. Potential in vivo correlates of a tetrahydrobiopterin participation in the inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase can be drawn to the neurotoxic amphetamines.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27506534>Genetics and mapping of seedling resistance to Ug99 stem rust in winter wheat cultivar Triumph 64 and differentiation of SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42.</a></h2><p>Resistance to Ug99 stem rust in Triumph 64 was conferred by SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS and was mapped to the same position as SrCad and Sr42 , however, the three genes show functional differences. Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is an important disease of wheat that can be controlled by effective stem rust resistance (Sr) genes. The emergence of virulent Pgt races in Africa, namely Ug99 and its variants, has stimulated the search for new Sr genes and genetic characterization of known sources of resistance. Triumph 64 is a winter wheat cultivar that carries gene SrTmp, which confers resistance to Ug99. The goals of this study were to genetically map SrTmp and examine its relationship with other Sr genes occupying a similar chromosome location. A doubled haploid (DH) population from the cross LMPG-/Triumph 64 was inoculated with Ug99 at the seedling stage. A single gene conditioning resistance to Ug99 segregated in the population. Genetic mapping with SSR markers placed SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS in a region similar to SrCad and Sr42. SNP markers developed for SrCad were used to further map SrTmp and were also added to a genetic map of Sr42 using a DH population (LMPG-/Norin 40). Three SNP markers that co-segregated with SrTmp also co-segregated with SrCad and Sr42. The SNP markers showed no difference in the map locations of SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42. Multi-race testing with DH lines from the Triumph 64 and Norin 40 populations and a recombinant inbred-line population from the cross LMPG-/AC Cadillac showed that SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42 confer different spectra of resistance. Markers closely linked to SrTmp are suitable for marker-assisted breeding and germplasm development.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18309764>Attention deficit disorders--drugs or nutrition?</a></h2><p>3-9% of schoolchildren in the U.K. suffer Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gel-permeation chromatography were conducted to identify the structure of -PCL-PEG. The biocompatibility of the -PCL-PEG was evaluated by a cell counting kit-8 assay. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by a water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion (W/O/W) solvent evaporation method. The size distribution and zeta potential of NPs were determined by dynamic light scattering. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of NPs. Drug-loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, and the release behavior of ovalbumin (OVA)-loading NPs were tested by the bicinchoninic acid assay kit. The stability and activity of OVA released from NPs were detected and the uptake of NPs was evaluated by NIH-3T3 cells.All results indicated the successful synthesis of amphiphilic copolymer -PCL-PEG, which possessed excellent biocompatibility and could formulate NPs easily.

To this end, we exposed crystals of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase CpI from  to  and quantitatively investigated the effects on the H-cluster structure over several time points using multiple data sets, while correlating it to decreases in enzyme activity. Our results reveal the loss of specific Fe atoms from both the diiron (2Fe) and the [4Fe-4S] subcluster (4Fe) of the H-cluster. Within the 2Fe, the Fe atom more distal to the 4Fe is strikingly more affected than the more proximal Fe atom. The 4Fe interconverts to a [2Fe-2S] cluster in parts of the population of active CpI, but not in crystals of the inactive apoCpI initially lacking the 2Fe. We thus propose two parallel processes: dissociation of the distal Fe atom and 4Fe interconversion.

We assessed the cardiovascular profile of RWJ 29009 in anesthetized and conscious dogs. RWJ 29009 (0.1-2 micrograms/kg intravenously, i.v.) dose-relatedly increased coronary blood flow (CBF) and decreased arterial pressure in anesthetized dogs. Total peripheral resistance and coronary vascular resistance were concurrently reduced without significant changes in heart rate (HR) or cardiac output (CO). Left ventricular (LV) dP/dtmax and myocardial contractile force were decreased only at the highest dose of 10 micrograms/kg. Cromakalim (3-100 micrograms/kg), although much less potent, had a qualitatively similar profile. Glyburide pretreatment (5 mg/kg i.v.) shifted the dose response of RWJ 29009 for increasing CBF and decreasing arterial pressure to the right. The dose responses of cromakalim were similarly shifted to the right, whereas the effects of nifedipine on CBF and arterial pressure were not affected by glyburide. RWJ 29009 (0.3 and 1 microgram/kg) had no effect on myocardial O2 consumption (MVO2) except for a transient increase immediately after administration of 1 microgram/kg. MVO2 returned to control 15 min after dosing, although CBF remained significantly increased. In conscious dogs, RWJ 29009 (0.3-10 micrograms/kg, i.v. and orally, p.o.) produced dose-related increases in CBF and decreases in arterial pressure similar to those produced in anesthetized dogs, except that HR was increased concurrently. The i.v. and p.o. potency of RWJ 29009 were comparable, indicating high oral bioavailability. Thus, RWJ 29009 is an extremely potent coronary and peripheral vasodilator with a cardiovascular profile similar to that of other potassium channel activators.

Ketamine is a chiral compound and S-ketamine is known to be the more potent enantiomer. Here, we present the development and validation of three LC-MS/MS assays; the first for the quantification of racemic KET, n-KET and DHNK in human serum, urine and feces; the second for the separation and quantification of the S- and R-enantiomers of KET, n-KET and DHNK, and the third for separation and quantification of 2S,-hydroxynorketamine (2S,-HNK) and 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (2R,6R-HNK) in serum and urine with the ability to separate and detect 10 additional hydroxylated norketamine metabolites of racemic ketamine. Sample preparation was done by liquid-liquid extraction using methyl tert-butyl ether. For achiral determination of KET and its metabolites, an isocratic elution with ammonium acetate (pH 3.8; 5mM) and acetonitrile on a C18 column was performed. For the separation of S- and R-enantiomers of KET, n-KET and DHNK, a gradient elution was applied using a mobile phase of ammonium acetate (pH 7.5; 10mM) and isopropanol on the CHIRAL-AGP column. The enantioselective separation of the HNK metabolites was done on the chiral column Lux-Amylose-2 with a gradient method using ammonium acetate (pH 9; 5mM) and a mixture of isopropanol and acetonitrile (4:1). The mass spectrometric detection monitored for each analyte 2-3 mass/charge transitions. D4-ketamine and D4-n-KET were used as internal standards. The assays were successfully validated according to current bioanalytical guidelines and applied to a pilot study in one healthy volunteer. Compared to previously published methods, our assays have superior analytical features such as a lower amount of required matrix, faster sample preparation, shorter analytical run time and higher sensitivity (LLOQ up to 0.1ng/ml). Moreover, our assay enables for the first time the enantioselective determination of 2R,6R- and 2S,-HNK which were shown to be responsible for the promising antidepressant effects of ketamine.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

P450eryF is a bacterial P450 that catalyzes the hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B at the  position, a necessary step in the biosynthesis of erythromycin. The lack of a conserved threonine residue in the I-helix, in contrast to other P450s, makes P450eryF unable to oxidize other substrates. A recent study [Xiang et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35999-36006] has shown that the substitution of Ala-245 by threonine confers on P450eryF significant testosterone hydroxylase activity. Therefore, we investigated various known fluorescent P450 substrates with P450eryF wild-type as well as two mutants, A245S and A245T. Among the various fluorescent compounds tested, 7-benzyloxyquinoline (7-BQ) was found to be the most suitable probe for P450eryF A245T, with rates of oxidation being lower for A245S and wild-type enzyme. The steady-state kinetics of 7-BQ oxidation by A245T are sigmoidal (V(max) = 0.71 nmol/min/nmol, n = 2.18, and S(50) = 132 microM). alpha-Naphthoflavone (alpha-NF), a well-known activator of CYP3A4, did not stimulate 7-BQ oxidation by A245T, although the S(50) value for alpha-NF binding to wild-type P450eryF was similar to P450 3A4. Interestingly, spectral binding studies of wild-type P450eryF and A245T with ketoconazole and miconazole showed differential binding behaviors. Titration of wild-type with ketoconazole and miconazole and of A245T with miconazole showed the expected type-II binding. However, titration of A245T with ketoconazole produced a spectrum similar to type-I. Inhibition studies showed that both ketoconazole and miconazole are able to inhibit 7-BQ oxidation by A245T, although miconazole showed a slightly higher potency.

Dye reduction occurs within the phagocyte shortly after bacterial ingestion as measured by the phagocytic index technique and by the uptake of (125)I-pneumococci. Bacteria prepared with gammaG antibody were not phagocytosed unless a small volume of fresh normal serum was added. Using fresh sera deficient in single complement components, it was demonstrated that the first four components are necessary for optimal bacterial phagocytosis. When highly purified complement components were added to the antibody-coated pneumococci, enhancement of phagocytosis was achieved only with the sequential addition of C1, C4, C2, and C3. Evidence has been presented that human C3 bound to an immune complex exhibits peptidase activity and that this activity is essential for phagocytosis. A heat-labile, dialyzable serum cofactor which enhances C3 peptidase activity enhanced the phagocytosis of pneumococci prepared with purified complement components. A second phagocytosis-promoting cofactor, which is not a complement component, was found to be a heat-labile, 5-, beta pseudoglobulin.

The clinically significant impact of infection and capsular contracture after breast implant surgery has brought clinicians to create infection reduction protocols for both oncologic and cosmetic operations alike. The use of triple-antibiotic saline irrigation has become a recommended intraoperative maneuver within these protocols to minimize surgical site infections, but the constituents of the irrigation, its individual efficacy, and the acceptability of including povidone-iodine within irrigation recipes have been debated. This review will investigate the microbiological data behind the selection of the constituents of triple-antibiotic saline.

BiVO4 films were prepared by the metal-organic decomposition method, and particles were 90-150 nm in diameter. Under visible-light irradiation, H2 and O2 evolved in a stoichiometric ratio (H2/O2 = 2) from an aqueous solution of Na2SO4 with an external bias.

We surmise that hybridization between the O-2p and Bi- orbitals might contribute to the negative shift of the BiVO4 valence band.

The COX-catalyzed free radical peroxidation of arachidonic acid (ω-6) can produce deleterious metabolites (e.g. 2-series prostaglandins) that are implicated in cancer development. Thus, COX inhibition has been intensively investigated as a complementary therapeutic strategy for cancer. However, our previous study has demonstrated that a free radical-derived byproduct (8-hydroxyoctanoic acid) formed from COX-catalyzed peroxidation of dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, the precursor of arachidonic acid) can inhibit colon cancer cell growth. We thus hypothesize that the commonly overexpressed COX in cancer (~90% of colon cancer patients) can be taken advantage to suppress cell growth by knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, a key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic acid). In addition, D5D knockdown along with DGLA supplement may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. After knocking down D5D in HCA-7 colony 29 cells and HT-29 cells (human colon cancer cell lines with high and low COX levels, respectively), the antitumor activity of DGLA was significantly enhanced along with the formation of a threshold range (~0.5-1.0μM) of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid. In contrast, DGLA treatment did not inhibit cell growth when D5D was not knocked down and only limited amount of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid was formed. D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment also enhanced the cytotoxicities of various chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil, regorafenib, and irinotecan, potentially through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. p53 and caspase 9. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the overexpressed COX in cancer cells can be utilized in suppressing cancer cell growth. This finding may provide a new option besides COX inhibition to optimize cancer therapy.

Here, we report the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of doped M1@Au24(SR)18 (M = Pd, Pt; R = CH2CH2Ph) clusters using femtosecond visible and near infrared transient absorption spectroscopy. Three relaxation components are identified for both mono-doped clusters: (1) sub-picosecond relaxation within the M1Au12 core states; (2) core to shell relaxation in a few picoseconds; and (3) relaxation back to the ground state in more than one nanosecond. Despite similar relaxation pathways for the two doped nanoclusters, the coupling between the metal core and surface ligands is accelerated by over 30% in the case of the Pt dopant compared with the Pd dopant. Compared to Pd doping, the case of Pt doping leads to much more drastic changes in the steady state and transient absorption of the clusters, which indicates that the 5d orbitals of the Pt atom are more strongly mixed with Au 5d and  orbitals than the 4d orbitals of the Pd dopant. These results demonstrate that a single foreign atom can lead to entirely different excited state spectral features of the whole cluster compared to the parent Au25(SR)18 cluster.

In bacteria, secreted biomolecules are not only involved in intra-species communication but they also play roles in inter-kingdom exchanges and pathogenicity. To date, released products, such as small molecules, DNA, peptides, and proteins, have been well studied in bacteria. However, the bacterial extracellular RNA complement has so far not been comprehensively characterized. Here, we have analyzed, using a combination of physical characterization and high-throughput sequencing, the extracellular RNA complement of both outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-associated and OMV-free RNA of the enteric Gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 substrain MG1655 and have compared it to its intracellular RNA complement. Our results demonstrate that a large part of the extracellular RNA complement is in the size range between 15 and 40 nucleotides and is derived from specific intracellular RNAs. Furthermore, RNA is associated with OMVs and the relative abundances of RNA biotypes in the intracellular, OMV and OMV-free fractions are distinct. Apart from rRNA fragments, a significant portion of the extracellular RNA complement is composed of specific cleavage products of functionally important structural noncoding RNAs, including tRNAs, 4.5S RNA,  RNA, and tmRNA. In addition, the extracellular RNA pool includes RNA biotypes from cryptic prophages, intergenic, and coding regions, of which some are so far uncharacterised, for example, transcripts mapping to the fimA-fimL and ves-spy intergenic regions.

However, ESD is technically demanding, and potentially severe complications, such as bleeding and perforation, may occur. -based techniques (e.g., radiofrequency ablation) might offer a potential alternative to ESD. However, their use mandates the ability to predict the damage induced and to identify a "signature" of the complete ablation, without the need for a physical specimen. Ideally, an -based procedure should be tunable in order to limit the ablation to the superficial layers, namely mucosa (M) and submucosa (SM), without injuring the muscularis propria (MP), thereby minimizing GI perforation. This experimental study aims to investigate thermal damage induced by Nd:YAG laser on the gastric wall, at different laser settings such as power (P) and time (t). Laser ablation was performed on the stomach wall of 6 Wistar rats. Two powers (2.5W and 1.0W) and 3 exposure times (12s,  and 2s) were tested, for a total of 30 ablations. Histological analysis allowed to assess thermal damage, in terms of damage depth (DD) and identification of involved layers. The ratio (R) between DD and the total depth (TD) of target layers (M+SM) was used as an index to evaluate the effectiveness of laser settings. At P=2.5W, MP was damaged (R>1) in the majority of cases (11/15). At P=1.0W, MP was preserved in all tests (R<;1), and rarely (4/15) did the damage reach the whole SM (R=1). Histopathological analysis evidenced that tissue damage was strongly related to the variable tissue thickness. These preliminary results seem to support the fact that endoscopic tunable laser ablation is feasible with a consistent damage/power correlation. Further tests are required to optimize the settings for applications on early GI tumors.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290496>Fucoidan attenuates angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms through the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor κB activation.</a></h2><p>Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is one of the leading causes of sudden death among the elderly. Most incidental AAAs are below the threshold for intervention at the time of detection; however, there is no evidence that commonly used cardiovascular drugs have clinical beneficial effects on AAA progression. Therefore, in addition to current cardiovascular risk-reducing treatments, an adjunctive medical therapy targeting the regulation of extracellular matrix metabolism is still required in the clinical setting. Fucoidan is an extract of brown seaweed and a sulfated polysaccharide. Emerging evidence suggests that fucoidan has potential cardiovascular applications. Numerous investigations of fucoidan in diseases of the cardiovascular system have mainly focused on its pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Specifically, fucoidan has been shown to have matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-reducing effects in several studies. We aimed to evaluate the beneficial effect of fucoidan on aneurysmal growth in a murine model of aortic aneurysm and further provide a rationale for using fucoidan as a medical adjunctive therapy.A murine model of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA was used to assess the therapeutic effects of fucoidan on AAA growth in vivo. The characteristics and quantification of AAAs were determined in situ. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used for studying the involved pathways in vitro. Western blotting was used to detect the involved signaling pathways both in vivo and in vitro.Treatment with fucoidan significantly reduced the incidence of AAA formation. Administration of fucoidan significantly attenuated Ang II-induced aortic expansion from 1.56 ± 0.76 mm to 1.09 ± 0.30 mm. Administration of fucoidan significantly suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and reduced the grade of elastin degradation in vivo. In vitro, we found that fucoidan could ameliorate the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor κB p65, and it further reduced MMP and reactive  species production.Fucoidan inhibits the progression of experimental AAA growth through the attenuation of proinflammatory nuclear factor κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation.

Six skinfold thicknesses (sigma ) and maximal  uptake (VO2 max) were measured in 348 Caucasian subjects (149 women and 199 men). Fiber type proportions (type I, type IIA, and type IIB) and activity levels of marker enzymes for the Krebs cycle (malate dehydrogenase, MDH) and for the fatty acid oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HADH) pathways were determined in vastus lateralis muscle samples. No significant correlation was found between fiber type proportions and sigma . Significant and negative correlations were, however, obtained in both genders between the sigma  and MDH enzyme activity (r = -0.23; p < 0.01), but not between the sigma  and HADH enzyme activity. When individuals with low and high amount of subcutaneous fat but paired for VO2max were compared, vastus lateralis of fat men exhibited the same proportion of type I fiber (38.6 +/- 10.3 vs 38.5 +/- 13.4%) and HADH activity level (3.43 +/- 1.05 vs. 3.34 +/- 0.81 U/g), but had about 20% less MDH enzyme activity than vastus lateralis of leaner men (158 +/- 35 vs. 198 +/- 43 U/g;p < 0.05). No difference was found in any of these muscle phenotypes when comparisons were made between women with low and high amount of subcutaneous fat but also paired for VO2max. Moreover, no relations were observed between skeletal muscle fiber type proportion or metabolic markers with relative subcutaneous fat distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692405> RNA in Rhodobacter sphaeroides:  RNA and pRNA transcript levels peak in late exponential phase and gene deletion causes a high salt stress phenotype.</a></h2><p>The function of  RNA, a global regulator of transcription, was studied in the photosynthetic α-proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides.

The computations reveal significant differences in the underlying electronic structures that are responsible for the varied crystal chemistry of the lone pair cations. The filled 5s orbitals of the Sn2+ ion interact strongly with the 2p orbitals of , which leads to a significant destabilization of symmetric structures (scheelite and zircon) favored by electrostatic forces. The destabilizing effect of this interaction can be significantly reduced by lowering the symmetry of the Sn2+ site to enable the antibonding Sn 5s-O 2p states to mix with the unfilled Sn 5p orbitals. This interaction produces a localized, nonbonding state at the top of the valence band that corresponds closely with the classical notion of a stereoactive electron lone pair. In compounds containing Pb2+ and Bi3+ the relativistic contraction of the  orbital reduces its interaction with , effectively diminishing its role in shaping the crystal chemical preferences of these ions. In PbWO4 this leads to a stabilization of the symmetric scheelite structure. In the case of BiVO4 the energy of the Bi  orbital is further stabilized. Despite this stabilization, the driving force for a stereoactive lone pair distortion appears to be enhanced. The energies of structures exhibiting distorted Bi3+ environments are competitive with structures that possess symmetric Bi3+ environments. Nevertheless, the "lone pair" that results associated with a distorted Bi3+ environment in BiVO4 is more diffuse than the Sn2+ lone pair in beta-SnWO4. Furthermore, the distortion has a much smaller impact on the electronic structure near the Fermi level.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095998>Localization and Organization of Scopolamine Biosynthesis in Duboisia myoporoides R.

Hyoscyamine and scopolamine are currently obtained at commercial scale from hybrid crosses of Duboisia myoporoides × Duboisia leichhardtii plants. In this study, we present a global investigation of the localization and organization of TA biosynthesis in a Duboisia myoporoides R. Br. wild-type line. The tissue-specific spatial distribution of TAs within D. myoporoides is presented, including quantification of the TAs littorine, 6-hydroxy hyoscyamine, hyoscyamine, scopolamine and, additionally, hyoscyamine aldehyde as well as scopolamine glucoside. Scopolamine (14.77 ± 5.03 mg g-1), and to a lesser extent hyoscyamine (3.01 ± 1.54 mg g-1) as well as 6-hydroxy hyoscyamine (4.35 ± 1.18 mg g-1), are accumulated in leaves during plant development, with the highest concentration of total TAs detected in 6-month-old plants. Littorine, an early precursor in TA biosynthesis, was present only in the roots (0.46 ± 0.07 mg g-1). During development, the spatial distribution of all investigated alkaloids changed due to secondary growth in the roots. Transcripts of pmt, tr-I and cyp80f1 genes, involved in early stages of TA biosynthesis, were found to be most abundant in the roots. In contrast, the transcript encoding hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (h6h) was highest in the leaves of 3-month-old plants. This investigation presents the spatial distribution of biochemical components as well as gene expression profiles of genetic factors known to participate in TA biosynthesis in D. myoporoides. The results of this investigation may aid in future breeding or genetic enhancement strategies aimed at increasing the yields of TAs in these medicinally valuable plant species.© The Author 2017.

To further validate this method, this analysis was applied to mice fed with synthetic diets whose carbohydrate components consisted solely of either glucose or fructose.Eight glucose-fed and 12 fructose-fed mice were given  H O followed by ad libitum feeding overnight. Mice were then euthanized, hepatic glycogen was isolated and derivatized to monoacetone glucose, and  H-enrichment of positions 2, 5, and 6 were measured by  H NMR. From these data, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance from the direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling and indirect pathway were estimated. Indirect pathway fractions were resolved into Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources-the latter including contributions from fructose metabolism.After overnight feeding, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance derived from direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling in glucose-fed-mice was 63 ± 1%. For the indirect pathway, Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources contributed 22 ± 1% and 15 ± 1%, respectively. For fructose-fed-mice, glycogen appearance was dominated by triose-phosphate sources (60 ± 2%) with lesser contributions from Krebs cycle (14 ± 1%) and direct and/or glycogen cycling (26 ± 2%).

In previous studies, it has been suggested that aneurysm rupture depends on intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness, which varies across each individual aneurysm. We hypothesized that hemostatic components differentially accumulate in AAA tissue in relation to ILT thickness. Thick (A1) and thin (B1) segments of ILTs and aneurysm wall sections A (adjacent to A1) and B (adjacent to B1) from one aneurysm sac were taken from 35 patients undergoing elective repair.Factor levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of protein extract.Tissue factor (TF) activities were significantly higher in thinner segments of AAA (B1 vs A1, P = .003; B vs A, P < .001; B vs A1, P < .001; B vs B1, P = .001). Significantly higher tissue plasminogen activator was found in thick thrombus-covered wall segments (A) than in B, A1, and B1 (P = .015, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Plasminogen concentrations were highest in ILT. Concentrations of α-antiplasmin in thin ILT adjacent walls (B) were higher compared with wall (A) adjacent to thick ILT (P = .021) and thick ILT (A1; P < .001). Significant correlations between levels of different factors were mostly found in thick ILT (A1). However, no correlations were found at B sites, except for a correlation between plasmin and TF activities (r = 0.55; P = .004).These results suggest that higher TF activities are present in thinner AAA regions.

However, the structural specificity of HS in these interactions remains largely undefined. Here, we used completely synthetic, structurally defined, alternating N-sulfated glucosamine (NS) and 2-O-sulfated iduronate (IS) residues to generate dodecasaccharides ([NSIS]6) that contained no, one or six glucosamine 6-O-sulfates (). The aim was to address how  contributes to the potential of defined HS dodecasaccharides to inhibit the angiogenic growth factors FGF2 and VEGF165, in vitro and in vivo. We show that the addition of a single  at the non-reducing end of [NSIS]6, i.e. [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5, significantly augments the inhibition of FGF2-dependent endothelial cell proliferation, migration and sprouting in vitro when compared to the non- variant. In contrast, the fully 6-O-sulfated dodecasaccharide, [NSIS6S]6, is not a potent inhibitor of FGF2. Addition of a single  did not significantly improve inhibitory properties of [NSIS]6 when tested against VEGF165-dependent endothelial cell functions.In vivo, [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 blocked FGF2-dependent blood vessel formation without affecting tumor growth. Reduction of non-FGF2-dependent ovarian tumor growth occurred when [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 was combined with cisplatin. The degree of inhibition by [NSIS6S]-[NSIS]5 in combination with cisplatin in vivo equated with that induced by bevacizumab and sunitinib when administered with cisplatin.

The XPS analysis overcomes and addresses the shortcomings of prior XPS studies of this material.

Herein, Mo-doped WO3 nanowire arrays are rationally fabricated by a sulfate-assisted hydrothermal method. Compared to the pure WO3, the optimized Mo-doped WO3 nanowire arrays exhibit improved electrochromic properties with fast switching speed (3.2s and 2. for coloration and bleaching, respectively), significant optical modulation (56.7% at 750nm, 83.0% at 1600nm and 48.5% at 10μm), high coloration efficiency (123.5cm(2)C(-1)) and excellent cycling stability. In addition, as a proof of concept, the Mo-doped WO3 nanowire arrays are demonstrated with electrochemical  storage monitored by the electrochromism. This electrode design protocol can provide an alternative way for developing high-performance active materials for bi-functional electrochromic batteries.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of viral DOM (vDOM) on the uninfected co-occurring phytoplankton remains largely unknown. Here, we conducted transcriptomic analyses to study the effects of vDOM on the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, which is the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. Using Prochlorococcus MIT9313, we showed that its growth was not affected by vDOM, but many tRNAs increased in abundance. We tested tRNA-gly and found that its abundance increased upon addition of glycine. The decreased transcript abundances of N  genes also suggested that Prochlorococcus responded to organic N compounds in vDOM. Addition of vDOM to Prochlorococcus reduced the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II and CO fixation while increasing its respiration rate, consistent with differentially abundant transcripts related to photosynthesis and respiration. One of the highest positive fold-changes was observed for the  RNA, a noncoding RNA functioning as a global transcriptional regulator in bacteria. The high level of  RNA might be responsible for some of the observed transcriptional responses. Taken together, our results revealed the transcriptional regulation of Prochlorococcus in response to viral lysis products and suggested its  potential to utilize organic N compounds.© 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448396>The VO2 response to submaximal ramp cycle exercise: Influence of ramp slope and training status.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to test whether ramp slope and training status interact in the  uptake (VO2) response during submaximal ramp exercise.

Investigations showed: white cell count 13.4 × 10/L (normal 3.6-9.3), haemoglobin 11.8 g/dl (normal 11-15), platelet count 356 × 10/L (normal 170-420), sodium 138 mmol/L (normal 134-144), potassium 3.5 mmol/L (normal 3.5-5.0), creatinine 32 µmol/L (normal 40-75), albumin 30 g/L (normal 35-48), alanine aminotransferase 707 IU/L (normal 15-54), alkaline phosphatase 151 IU/L (normal 30-130), bilirubin 384 µmol/L (normal 7-31) and prothrombin time 27.2 s (normal 11.7-14). Screening for hepatitis A, B, C, E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and autoimmune hepatitis was negative. Tests for anti-smooth muscle, antinuclear, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies were negative; immunoglobulin levels and ceruloplasmin levels were normal. Liver ultrasonography demonstrated a liver of normal contour with no biliary dilatation, a normal spleen size and patent vessels. Liver biopsy revealed severe portal interface hepatitis with lobular inflammation and scant plasma cells. Her clinical condition deteriorated in the following days with prothrombin time and bilirubin rising to 56.6 s and 470 µmol/L, respectively. At follow-up after 11 days, her alanine aminotransferase level was 1,931 IU/L.

The reaction involves the 1,4-elimination of phosphate and the C-(6proR) hydrogen of the substrate with unusual anti stereochemistry and requires a reduced flavin cofactor. This paper describes the kinetics of the formation and decay of a flavin intermediate, EPSP consumption, chorismate and phosphate formation, and phosphate dissociation during single and multiple turnover experiments, determined using rapid reaction techniques. The kinetics of phosphate dissociation using the substrate analogues (6R)-[6-2H]EPSP and ()-6-fluoro-EPSP have also been determined. The observations are consistent with a nonconcerted chorismate synthase reaction. The flavin intermediate is not simply associated with the conversion of substrate to product because it forms before the substrate is consumed. The transient spectral changes must be associated primarily with events such as protonation of the reduced flavin, a charge transfer complex between reduced flavin and an aromatic amino acid, or a conformational change in the protein. This does not rule out the direct role of flavin in catalysis.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/381947>The action of the dihydro derivatives of prostacyclin--(6R)-PGI1 and ()-PGI1 on the heart and the coronary vasculature.</a></h2><p>The action of the dihydro prostacyclins, (6R)-PGI1 and ()-PGI1, was studied on the isolated guinea pig heart and bovine coronary artery strips. PGE2 and PGI2 were used as standards. In the isolated guinea pig heart ()-PGI1 decreased the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), myocardial force of contraction (MFC) and  consumption (QO2). (6R)-PGI1 did not produce a significant change in these parameters. The ED50 (50% o maximum coronary dilation) was approximately 20 times higher for ()-PGI1 than for PGI2 or PGE2. Treatment of the hearts with reserpine + tyramine abolished the ()-PGI1-induced decrease in MFC but not the decrease in the CPP. The same pattern of responses was seen with PGE2. Bovine coronary artery strips were contracted by both ()-PGI1 and (6R)-PGI1, the ED50 (50% of maximum increase in tension) being 5 and 10 times higher than that for PGE2. The ()-PGI1-induced contraction was preceeded by a small relaxation, which, however, was much less than that seen after PGI2. It is concluded that the hydration of the 5,6 double bound in the PGI2 molecule results in an almost complete loss of PGI2-like activity and generates PGE-like activity. The same biological activity of both dihydro prostacyclins in the isolated coronary artery strip but not in the intact coronary vascular bed leads to suggest that the sites of action in these systems are different.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29124565>Glycosaminoglycans from fish swim bladder: isolation, structural characterization and bioactive potential.</a></h2><p>The swim bladder of fish is an internal gas-filled organ that allows fish to control their buoyancy and swimming depth. Fish maws (the dried swim bladders of fish) have been used over many centuries as traditional medicines, tonics and a luxurious gourmet food in China and Southeast Asia. Little is known about the structural information of polysaccharides comprising this important functional material of fish tissue. In the present study, the total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) from fish maw was characterized. Two GAGs were identified, chondroitin sulfate (CS, having a molecular  of 18-40 kDa) and heparan sulfate (HS), corresponding to 95% and 5% of the total GAG, respectively. Chondroitinase digestion showed that the major CS GAG was composed of ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc4S (59.7%), ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc4, (36.5%), ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc6S (2.2%) and ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc (1.6%) disaccharide units. H-NMR analysis and degradation with specific chondroitinases, both CS-type A/C and CS-type B were present in a ratio of 1.4:1. Analysis using surface plasmon resonance showed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 bound to the CS fraction (K = 136 nM). These results suggest that this CS may be involved in FGF-signal pathway, mediating tissue repair, regeneration and wound healing.

Streptavidin is assumed to accumulate at the site of infection/ because of increased vascularity and vascular permeability. Subsequent administration of In-biotin leads to the accumulation of radioactivity at the site of infection or  because biotin has a very strong affinity (dissociation constant = 10) for streptavidin (6).

Life expectancy is dominated by cardiovascular risk, which is the leading cause of death in these patients. Up to one third of diabetic patients will develop diabetic nephropathy related to micro-angiopathy. Renal impairment further increases cardiovascular risk. Reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is a major public health issue, as well as early preventing and managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Good glycemic control prevents the micro-vascular complications of the disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, etc.) and, more recently recognized through prolonged monitoring of the VADT cohort, prevents cardiovascular complications. Control of blood pressure and dyslipidemia are essential in primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention. In addition, the blockers of the renin-angiotensin system slow down the progression of the MRC. Elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) form another growing group of the nephrologist daily patient pool. Especially for very elderly patients with comorbidities, the question of favoring conservative treatment rather than starting or pursuing dialysis may arise. Survival and quality of life are indeed not necessarily better in elderly patients undergoing dialysis, complications can occur eventually leading to discontinuation, and are occasionally associated with a feeling of stubbornness. Creation of prognostic score is a useful tool to help the decision-making process. However, dialogue with the patient and his/her family, as well as multidisciplinary collaboration remain fundamentals to determine the most suitable care.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Single substitution of Y by Ce or by La produces atomistic expansions around the impurities, which are significantly smaller than the ionic radii mismatches and the overall lattice distortions are found to be confined within their second coordination spheres. In double-substitutional defects, the impurities tend to be as close as possible. La-codoping Ce:YAG provokes an anisotropic expansion around Ce defects. The Ce impurity introduces 4f occupied states in the 5.0 eV computed gap of YAG, peaking 0.25 eV above the top of the valence band, and empty 4f, 5d, and  states starting at 3.8 eV in the gap and spreading over the conduction band. La-codoping produces very small effects on the electronic structure of Ce:YAG, the most visible one being the decrease in covalent bonding with one of the  atoms, which shifts 0.05 Å away from Ce and gets 0.04 Å closer to La in the most stable Ce-La double-substitutional defect.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27984167>Sesquiterpenes from the whole plants of Parasenecio roborowskii.</a></h2><p>Six eremophilane-type (parasenolide A-F) and an eudesmane-type (parasenin) sesquiterpenoids, along with eight known sesquiterpenes, were isolated from the whole plants of Parasenecio roborowskii.

Each patient was intubated with both laryngoscopes successively, in a randomized order. Intubation success rate, time to best glottic view, time to intubation, time to ventilation, Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy grades, and complications related to the laryngoscopy and intubation were analyzed.First pass intubation success rates were similar for the King Vision and the Macintosh (96.6% vs. 94.3%, respectively, p>0.05). King Vision resulted in a longer average time to glottic view (95% CI 0.5-1.4s, p<0.001), and time to intubation (95% CI 3-4., p<0.001). The difference in time to intubation was similar when unsuccessful intubation attempts were excluded (95% CI 2.8-4.4s, p<0.001). Based on the modified Mallampati class at the preoperative visit, the King Vision improved the glottic view in significantly more patients (220 patients, 56.7%) compared with the Macintosh (180 patients, 46.4%) (p<0.001). None of the patients had peripheral  desaturation below 94%. Experienced anesthesiologists may obtain similar rates of first pass intubation success and airway trauma with both laryngoscopes.

These particles effectively avoided phagocytosis of macrophages and were stable in blood circulation. Distribution analysis indicated that ATIQCTPC accumulated and released ATIQC in the tumor tissue through a targeting manner. Thus, the antitumor and the anti-thrombotic activities of ATIQCTPC were 100-fold higher than those of ATIQC, and ATIQCTPC was able to prevent cancer patients from suffering from thrombosis. Based on the observation that ATIQCTPC decreased serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in S180 mice, we hypothesized that this is the mechanism that ATIQCTPC utilized to slow tumor growth.

Direct electron transfer of Mn-TPAA is realized with a formal redox potential (E°') falling in the range of the E°' values of the redox couples O(2)/O(2)(-) and O(2)(-)/H(2)O(2). This suggests that Mn-TPAA on TiO(2) films is electrochemically active and capable of thermodynamically mediating both the oxidation of O(2)(-) to O(2) and the reduction of O(2)(-) to H(2)O(2). Therefore, Mn-TPAA immobilized on the TiO(2) films can be used electrochemically for determination of O(2)(-) due to its electrochemical activities and biomimetic catalytic activities like superoxide dismutase (SOD) toward O(2)(-). The present biomimetic O(2)(-) sensor shows high selectivity at the low working potential of 0V vs. Ag|AgCl, a wide linear range from 10(-7)M to 10(-4)M and a quick response time within .

Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the in vivo estimation of the relationship between the plasma concentration of a drug and its target occupancy, optimizing dose selection and reducing the time and cost of early development. Triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs), also referred to as serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, enhance monoaminergic neurotransmission by blocking the action of the monoamine transporters, raising extracellular concentrations of those neurotransmitters. GSK1360707 [(1R,)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-4-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane] is a novel TRI that until recently was under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder; its development was put on hold for strategic reasons. We present the results of an in vivo assessment of the relationship between plasma exposure and transporter blockade (occupancy).

Ms1 interacts with the RNA polymerase (RNAP) core devoid of sigma factors, which differs from  RNA that binds to RNAP holoenzymes containing the primary sigma factor. Here we show that Ms1 is the most abundant non-rRNA transcript in stationary phase in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The accumulation of Ms1 stems from its high-level synthesis combined with decreased degradation. We identify the Ms1 promoter, P , and cis-acting elements important for its activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PNPase (an RNase) contributes to the differential accumulation of Ms1 during growth. Then, by comparing the transcriptomes of wt and ΔMs1 strains from stationary phase, we reveal that Ms1 affects the intracellular level of RNAP. The absence of Ms1 results in decreased levels of the mRNAs encoding β and β' subunits of RNAP, which is also reflected at the protein level. Thus, the ΔMs1 strain has a smaller pool of RNAPs available when the transcriptional demand increases. This contributes to the inability of the ΔMs1 strain to rapidly react to environmental changes during outgrowth from stationary phase.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685509>RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenic differentiation of macrophages in the abdominal aorta of angiotensin II-infused apolipoprotein E knockout mice.</a></h2><p>Osteoclastogenic activation of macrophages (OCG) occurs in human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and in calcium chloride-induced degenerative AAAs in mice, which have increased matrix metalloproteinase activity. As the activity of OCG in dissecting aneurysms is not clear, we tested the hypothesis that OCG contributes to angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced dissecting aneurysm (Ang II-induced AAA) in apolipoprotein E knockout mice.AAAs were produced in apolipoprotein E knockout mice via the administration of Ang II. Additionally, receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL)-neutralizing antibody (5 mg/kg) was administered to one group of mice 7 days prior to Ang II infusion. Aneurysmal sections were probed for presence of RANKL and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase via immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. Mouse aortas were also examined for RANKL and matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression via Western blot. In vitro murine vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) and murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) were analyzed for the expression of osteogenic factors via Western blot, qPCR, and flow cytometry in response to Ang II or RANKL stimulation. The signaling pathway that mediates Ang II-induced RANKL expression in MOVAS cells was also investigated via application of TG101348, a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor, and Western blot analysis.Immunohistochemical staining of Ang II-induced AAA sections revealed OCG as evidenced by increased RANKL and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase expression compared with control mice. Immunofluorescence staining of AAA sections revealed co-localization of vascular smooth muscle cells and RANKL, revealing vascular smooth muscle cells as one potential source of RANKL. Systemic administration of RANKL-neutralizing antibody suppressed Ang II-induced AAA, with significant reduction of the maximum diameter of the abdominal aorta compared with vehicle controls (1.5 ± 0.4 mm vs 2.2 ± 0.2 mm). Ang II (1 μM) treatment induced a significant increase in RANKL messenger RNA expression levels in MOVAS cells compared with the vehicle control (1.0 ± 0.2 vs 2.8 ± 0.2). The activities of JAK2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) were also significantly increased by Ang II treatment. Inhibition of JAK2/STAT5 suppressed Ang II-induced RANKL expression, suggesting the involvement of the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway.OCG with increased RANKL expression was present in Ang II-induced AAA, and neutralization of RANKL suppressed AAA formation. As neutralization of RANKL has been used clinically to treat osteoporosis and other osteoclast-related diseases, additional study of the effectiveness of RANKL neutralization in AAA is warranted.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

From Computational Fluid Dynamics it was calculated that the light exposure times ranged from 0.4 to 3.6 s while the exposure times to darkness were much longer, from 6 to 21 s. It was demonstrated that these times are too long for light integration, the cells fully adapting to local irradiances. This phenomenon was validated in the real outdoor raceway at different seasons. Simulations allows to confirm that if total light integration is achieved biomass productivity can increase up to 40 g/m·day compared to 29 g/m·day obtained considering local adaptation, which is close to the experimental value of 25 g/m·day.

The fully optimised molecular structures of two tetrasaccharide conformations (differing from each other in the conformational form of the sulphated iduronic acid residue⁻one ¹₄ and the other ²₀) were obtained using the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory and applying explicit water molecules to simulate the presence of a solvent. The theoretical data provided insight into variations of the bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles, formations of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. Optimised molecular structures indicated the formation of a complex hydrogen bond network, including interresidue and intraresidue bonds. The ionic interactions strongly influence the first hydration shell and, together with hydrogen bonds, play an important role in shaping the 3D tetrasaccharide structure. DFT-derived indirect three⁻bond proton⁻proton coupling constants (³) showed that the best agreement with experiment was obtained with a weighted average of 67:33 (¹₄:²₀) of the IdoA2S forms. Detailed analysis of Fermi-contact contributions to ³ showed that important contributions arise from the  lone pairs of neighbouring  atoms.

There were 70,290 TF releases identified, with 1887 (2.68%) SSIs captured within 3 months after surgery and 3144 (4.47%) within 1 year after surgery. There was a statistically significant increase in SSI rates in patients with hypoglycemia within 90-day (P = 0.006) and 1-year (P < 0.001) time intervals post-TF injection. Likewise, a statistically significant increase in SSI rate in patients with hypoglycemia undergoing TF release within 1 year after release was seen (P = 0.003).Hypoglycemia before TF injection or release increases the risk for SSI.

The characterization of these relevant structures facilitates the gaining of insight into the role of the different residues in the active site.

Epoxidation of unsaturated spiroacetal 5 using dimethyldioxirane showed greater preference for the alpha-epoxide 11 over the beta-epoxide 12. Treatment of the alpha-epoxide 11 with lithium diethylamide in tetrahydrofuran afforded both the allylic alcohol 7 and the homoallylic alcohol 13 in approximately equal amounts. Use of a nonpolar solvent (hexane) suppressed the isomerization of the allylic alcohol 7 to the homoallylic alcohol 13, affording a 21:1 ratio of 7:13. Coordination of an  lone pair with the electron-deficient lithium center of the reagent sets up a transition state in which abstraction of a syn-proton and opening of the epoxide leads to stereoselective formation of allylic alcohol 7 with a pseudoaxial hydroxyl group at C-5. The hydroxyl group liberated in the epoxide rearrangement step was then used to direct a second epoxidation to the lower face of the alkene. Thus, treatment of alcohol 7 with m-CPBA buffered with sodium acetate afforded alpha-syn-epoxy alcohol 9. Subsequent epoxide opening using lithium aluminum hydride proceeded smoothly, affording syn-3,5-diaxial diol 10 and 4,5-diol 22. Epoxy alcohol 9 was then treated with sodium hydride and methyl iodide or benzyl bromide, affording methyl ether 23 or benzyl ether 24, respectively. Reduction of methoxy epoxide 23 with lithium aluminum hydride then afforded alcohol 25 together with the regioisomeric alcohol 27. Benzyloxy epoxide 24 afforded alcohols 29 and 31. Finally benzylation of alcohol 25 afforded bis-ether 3 whereas methylation of alcohol 29 afforded bis-ether 4. Spiroacetals 3 and 4were screened for herbicidal activity and exhibited significant activity against the weeds Avena fatua, Setaria viridis, Amaranthus retroflexus, and Chenopodium album when applied preemergence.

However, in humans predominately supplemented with high eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), there is no evidence of endurance performance enhancement. Therefore, this study examined if DHA-rich fish oil could improve repeated bouts of physiologically stressful cycling and a subsequent time trial in a state of fatigue. Twenty-six trained males took part in a double-blind study and were supplemented with either 2 × 1g/day soy oil, Control) or DHA-rich tuna fish oil (Nu-Mega) (FO) (560mg DHA / 140mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), for 8 weeks. Maximal cycling power (3 × ), isometric quadriceps strength (MVC), Wingate cycling protocol (6 × 30s) and a 5min cycling time-trial were assessed at baseline and eight weeks. The Omega-3 Index was not different at baseline (Control: 4.2 ± 0.2; FO: 4.7 ± 0.2%) and increased in the FO group after eight weeks (Control: 3.9 ± 0.2; FO: 6.3 ± 0.3%, p < .01). There was no effect of DHA-rich fish oil on power output of maximal  cycle sprinting (Control: Pre 1100 ± 49 Post 1067 ± 51; FO: Pre 1070 ± 46 Post 1042 ± 46W), during 5min time trail (Control: Pre 267 ± 19 Post 278 ± 20; FO: Pre 253 ± 16 Post 265 ± 16 W) or maximal voluntary contraction force (Control: Pre 273 ± 19 Post 251 ± 19; FO: Pre 287 ± 17 Post 283 ± 16 Nm).

Patients received intramuscular (IM) midazolam (0.1mg.kg(-1)) as premedication and we performed induction with propofol (2.5mg.kg(-1)) or etomidate (0.3mg.kg(1)), preceded by fentanyl (250mg) and followed by cisatracurium (0.1mg.kg(-1)). The patients were ventilated with 100%  until obtaining a reduction of 95% or more in the adductor pollicis response amplitude, with subsequent laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Neuromuscular function was monitored by acceleromyograhpy. We evaluated the onset of action of cisatracurium, tracheal intubation conditions, and hemodynamic repercussions.The mean time and standard deviations of cisatracurium onset were: GI (86.6±14.3s) and GII (116.9±11.), with a significant difference (p<0, 0001). Intubation conditions were acceptable in 100% of GI and 53.3% of GII patients (p<0.0001).Induction of neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium was faster, with better intubation conditions in patients receiving propofol compared to those receiving etomidate, without hemodynamic repercussions.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

Due to significant heterogeneity, there are remarkable differences in how patients respond to treatment. A primary objective of psychiatric research is to identify biological markers that could be used to better predict and enhance responses to antidepressant treatments. Diet impacts various aspects of health, including depression. The fatty acid composition of the Western diet, which has a high ratio of -6:-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is associated with increased incidence of depression. The brain is rich in lipids, and dietary fatty acids act within specific brain regions to regulate processes that impact emotional behavior. This manuscript reviews existing evidence demonstrating brain region-specific fatty acid profiles, and posits that specific fatty acids may serve as predictive biomarkers of response to antidepressants. Furthermore, increasing blood levels of certain fats, such as -3s, via dietary intervention may serve as an adjunct to improve the efficacy of antidepressants. Notably, most of the existing research regarding fats and depression-related brain regions has focused on -3s, as compared to -, monounsaturated, and saturated fats. This review article will help guide future work investigating the relationships between fatty acids, brain regions, and antidepressant efficacy.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27469513>Effects of Ketamine and Ketamine Metabolites on Evoked Striatal Dopamine Release, Dopamine Receptors, and Monoamine Transporters.</a></h2><p>Following administration at subanesthetic doses, (R,S)-ketamine (ketamine) induces rapid and robust relief from symptoms of depression in treatment-refractory depressed patients. Previous studies suggest that ketamine's antidepressant properties involve enhancement of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized to (2S,)- and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), which have antidepressant actions independent of N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor inhibition. These antidepressant actions of (2S,;2R,6R)-HNK, or other metabolites, as well as ketamine's side effects, including abuse potential, may be related to direct effects on components of the dopaminergic (DAergic) system. Here, brain and blood distribution/clearance and pharmacodynamic analyses at DA receptors (D1-D5) and the DA, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters were assessed for ketamine and its major metabolites (norketamine, dehydronorketamine, and HNKs). Additionally, we measured electrically evoked mesolimbic DA release and decay using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry following acute administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg, i.p.). Following ketamine injection, ketamine, norketamine, and multiple hydroxynorketamines were detected in the plasma and brain of mice. Dehydronorketamine was detectable in plasma, but concentrations were below detectable limits in the brain. Ketamine did not alter the magnitude or kinetics of evoked DA release in the nucleus accumbens in anesthetized mice. Neither ketamine's enantiomers nor its metabolites had affinity for DA receptors or the DA, noradrenaline, and serotonin transporters (up to 10 μM). These results suggest that neither the side effects nor antidepressant actions of ketamine or ketamine metabolites are associated with direct effects on mesolimbic DAergic neurotransmission. Previously observed in vivo changes in DAergic neurotransmission following ketamine administration are likely indirect.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29166345>Prepectoral Immediate Direct-to-Implant Breast Reconstruction with Anterior AlloDerm Coverage.</a></h2><p>Staged subpectoral expander-implant breast reconstruction is widely performed. Disruption of the pectoralis major origin and the frequent occurrence of animation deformity and functional discomfort associated with subpectoral reconstruction remain ongoing concerns. Prepectoral single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction resolves many of these issues. In this study, the authors explored the rationale for prepectoral single-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with anterior AlloDerm coverage as an alternative to the staged approach.Seventy-three breasts in 50 patients were reconstructed using a single-stage direct-to-implant prepectoral approach with total anterior AlloDerm coverage during a 24-month period. The decision to proceed with single-stage reconstruction was predicated upon the adequacy of mastectomy skin flap blood flow based on indocyanine green fluorescence perfusion assessment. The patients were followed up for a maximum of 32 months.Ninety-seven percent of patients achieved complete healing within 8 weeks. There were 2 implant losses (2.7%) due to infection. Major seroma rate requiring repeated aspiration and drain insertion was 1.2%. There were no full-thickness skin losses. Capsular contracture was 0% in nonradiated patients. There were no cases of animation deformity. The authors were unable to establish significant correlation between complications and any of the usually stated risk factors, such as smoking, , and large mastectomy weights, presumably due to the rigorous application of intraoperative skin perfusion assessment.Single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction using a prepectoral approach appears to be a safe and effective means of breast reconstruction in many patients, assuming adequate skin perfusion is present.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29401129>Early Ambulation After Microsurgical Reconstruction of the Lower Extremity.</a></h2><p>Successful outcomes after microsurgical reconstruction of the lower extremity include timely return to ambulation.

The present study investigates the binding and antagonistic characteristics of small non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e. gepants) in isolated rat brain and mesenteric resistance arteries.The antagonistic behavior of gepants was investigated in isolated rat mesenteric arteries using a wire myograph setup while binding of gepants to CGRP receptors was investigated in rat brain membranes using a radioligand competitive binding assay. Furthermore, the histological location of the key components of CGRP receptor (RAMP1 and CLR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Our functional studies clearly show that all gepants are reversible competitive antagonists producing Schild plot slopes not significantly different from unity and thus suggesting presence of a uniform CGRP receptor population in the arteries. A uniform receptor population was also confirmed by radioligand competitive binding studies showing similar affinities for the gepants in rat brain and mesenteric arteries, the exception being rimegepant which had 50-fold lower affinity in brain than mesenteric arteries. CLR and RAMP1 were shown to be located in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry.The present results indicate that, despite species differences in the CGRP receptor affinity, the antagonistic nature of these gepants, the distribution pattern of CGRP receptor components and the mechanism behind CGRP-induced vasodilation seem to be similar in resistance-sized arteries of human and rats.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the sourdough lactic acid bacteria Leuconostoc citreum TR116, selected for its ability to produce high amounts of mannitol, was used to produce wheat sourdough and its biochemical characteristics (cell count, pH, TTA, sugar- and acid profile, as well as mannitol production) were monitored over 48 h. The so produced sourdough was then incorporated, as a functional ingredient, into a sugar reduced burger bun system and the quality characteristics of the dough and the final product were determined. Sourdough incorporation counteract the negative effects of sugar reduction on dough properties and resulted in the same viscoelastic properties (0.423 ± 0.008) and gluten-network-development (PMT: 160 ± 12.6 s; TM: 44.0 ± 2.6 BU) as the full-sugar control dough. Furthermore, the investigation of specific volume, crumb hardness and chewiness revealed no significant differences between sugar reduced sourdough burger buns and its control. It is noteworthy that sourdough contributed to browning reaction resulting in darker crumb and crust colour (-8.2%; -9.6%) and it extended microbial shelf life of the burger buns significantly (+3.5 days). Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences in sweetness and sourness between sugar reduced buns containing sourdough and the full-sugar control. In conclusion, the incorporation of mannitol-rich sourdough fermented by Leuconostoc citreum TR116 represents a novel technological approach in the field of sugar reduction and showed high potential as a functional ingredient to ameliorate the losses of important quality parameters. Especially sourdough containing higher amounts of mannitol and lower amounts of lactate improved significantly the dough and burger bun quality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We have examined and analyzed the effects of systematic molybdenum ions intercalation on lead-borate glasses and glass ceramics with interesting results. The observations present in these mechanisms show the lead ions bonded ionic have a strong affinity towards [BO₃] units containing non-bridging oxygens and [MoO₄]²⁻ molybdate units. The pronounced affinity towards molybdate anions yields the formation of the PbMoO₄ crystalline phase. Then, the excess of  can be supported into the glass network by the formation of [MoO₆] and [Mo₂O₇] structural units. Pb²(+) ions with ² configuration show strong absorption in the ultraviolet due to parity allowed s²-sp transition and yield an absorption band centered at about 310 nm. The changes in the features of the absorption bands centered at about 310 nm can be explained as a consequence of the appearance of additional absorption shoulder due to photoinduced color centers in the glass such as the formation of borate-molybdate and lead-molybdate paramagnetic defect centers in the glasses. The concentration of molybdenum ions influences the shape and width of the EPR signals located at g ∼ 1.86, 1.91 and 5.19.

The charge ordering is accompanied by breathing distortion of the BiO6 octahedra (extension and contraction of the Bi-O bond lengths). Standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations fail to obtain the crystal structure instability caused by the pure breathing distortions. Combining effects of the breathing distortions and tilting of the BiO6 octahedra allows DFT to reproduce qualitatively an experimentally observed insulator with monoclinic crystal structure but strongly underestimates the breathing distortion parameter and energy gap values. In the present work we reexamine the BaBiO3 problem within the GGA + U method using a Wannier function basis set for the Bi -band. Due to the high oxidation state of bismuth in this material, the Bi -symmetry Wannier function is predominantly extended spatially on surrounding  ions and hence differs strongly from a pure atomic -orbital. That is in sharp contrast to transition metal oxides (with exclusion of high oxidation state compounds) where the major part of the d-band Wannier function is concentrated on the metal ion and a pure atomic d-orbital can serve as a good approximation. The GGA + U calculation results agree well with experimental data, in particular with experimental crystal structure parameters and energy gap values.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and their interactions with sirtuins play an important role in regulating intermediary  in this process. However, there is little research into whether PARP inhibition affects alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH/NASH).We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of PARP1 and pharmacological inhibition of PARP in models of early alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as on Kupffer cell activation in vitro using biochemical assays, real-time PCR, and histological analyses. The effects of PARP inhibition were also evaluated in high fat or methionine and choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis models in mice.PARP activity was increased in livers due to excessive alcohol intake, which was associated with decreased NAD content and SIRT1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP restored the hepatic NAD content, attenuated the decrease in SIRT1 activation and beneficially affected the -, inflammatory-, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to alcohol feeding in the liver. PARP1 animals were protected against alcoholic steatohepatitis and pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of PARP1 also attenuated Kupffer cell activation in vitro. Furthermore, PARP inhibition decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation,  dysregulation, or inflammation and/or fibrosis in models of NASH.Our results suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in steatohepatitis with high translational potential, considering the availability of PARP inhibitors for clinical treatment of cancer.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the most abundant nuclear enzymes. The PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) is a recently FDA-approved therapy for cancer. This study shows that PARP is overactivated in livers of subjects with alcoholic liver disease and that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme with 3 different PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, attenuates high fat or alcohol induced liver injury, abnormal  alteration, fat accumulation, inflammation and/or fibrosis in preclinical models of liver disease. These results suggest that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'immunity', 'inflammation', 'metabolism', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28970882>Colloidal thallium halide nanocrystals with reasonable luminescence, carrier mobility and diffusion length.</a></h2><p>Colloidal lead halide based perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have been recently established as an interesting class of defect-tolerant NCs with potential for superior optoelectronic applications. The electronic band structure of thallium halides (TlX, where X = Br and I) show a strong resemblance to lead halide perovskites, where both Pb and Tl exhibit a  inert pair of electrons and strong spin-orbit coupling. Although the crystal structure of TlX is not perovskite, the similarities of its electronic structure with lead halide perovskites motivated us to prepare colloidal TlX NCs. These TlX NCs exhibit a wide bandgap (>2.5 eV or <500 nm) and the potential to exhibit a reduced density of deep defect states. Optical pump terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy with excitation fluence in the range of 0.85-5.86 × 10 photons per cm on NC films shows that the TlBr NCs possess high effective carrier mobility (∼220 to 329 cm V s), long diffusion length (∼0.77 to 0.98 μm), and reasonably high photoluminescence efficiency (∼10%). This combination of properties is remarkable compared to other wide-bandgap (>2.5 eV) semiconductor NCs, which suggests a reduction in the deep-defect states in the TlX NCs.

Role of myocardial  supply-demand imbalance.</a></h2><p>To clarify conflicting reports concerning the effects of ischemia on left ventricular chamber stiffness, we compared the effects of hypoxia at constant coronary perfusion with those of global ischemia on left ventricular diastolic chamber stiffness using isolated, perfused rabbit hearts in which the left ventricle was contracting isovolumically. Since chamber volume was held constant, increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) reflected increases in chamber stiffness. At a control coronary flow rate (30 ml/min), 2 min of hypoxia and pacing tachycardia (4.0 Hz) produced major increases in postpacing LVEDP (10+/-1 to 24+/-3 mm Hg, P < 0.01) and the relaxation time constant, T, (40+/-4 to 224+/-37 ms, P < 0.001), while percent lactate extraction ratio became negative (+ 18+/-2 to -48+/-15%, P < 0.001). Coronary perfusion pressure decreased (72+/-5 to 52+/-3 mm Hg, P < 0.01), and since coronary flow was held constant, the fall in coronary perfusion pressure reflected coronary dilation and a decrease in coronary vascular resistance. Following an average of 71+/- reoxygenation and initial heart rate (2.0 Hz), LVEDP and relaxation time constant T returned to control. Hypoxia alone (without pacing tachycardia) produced similar although less marked changes (LVEDP, 10+/-1 to 20+/-3 mm Hg; and T, 32+/-3 to 119+/-22 ms; P < 0.01 for both) and there was a strong correlation between LVEDP and T (r = 0.82, P < 0.001). When a similar degree of coronary vasodilatation was induced with adenosine, no change in LVEDP occurred, indicating that the increase in end diastolic pressure observed during hypoxia was not secondary to vascular engorgement, but due to an acute effect of hypoxia on the diastolic behavior of the ventricular myocardium. In contrast, global ischemia produced by low coronary flow (12-15 ml/min) resulted in a decrease in LVEDP, as well as a marked fall in left ventricular systolic pressure. In 14 global ischemia experiments, pacing tachycardia led to a further decline in left ventricular systolic pressure, and no increase was noted in postpacing LVEDP. Changes in lactate extraction ratio were much smaller in magnitude than with hypoxia and constant coronary perfusion. In two experiments (one at normal coronary flow and one at 15 ml/min), left ventricular systolic pressure did not change markedly from control when tachycardia was superimposed, and postpacing LVEDP showed a marked rise (to > 25 mm Hg), which gradually recovered over 1-2 min at the control heart rate. From these results, we conclude that left ventricular chamber stiffness increases when myocardial O(2) demand exceeds supply. This change is usually masked in ischemic (reduced coronary flow) preparations, perhaps because of reduced turgor of the coronary vascular bed, marked reductions in systolic work (and therefore myocardial O(2) requirements), and local accumulation of hydrogen ion and metabolites following acute severe reduction of coronary flow. The increased chamber stiffness during hypoxia is accompanied by marked slowing of relaxation, with increased diastolic pressure relative to volume persisting throughout diastole.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11969424>Oxidation of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to 10-formyldihydrofolate by complex IV of rat mitochondria.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that the unanticipated bioactivity of orally administered unnatural carbon-6 isomers, (6R)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-HCO-THF) and ()-5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH-THF), in humans [Baggott, J. E., and Tamura, T. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1472, 323-32] is explained by the rapid oxidation of ()-10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-HCO-THF), which is produced by in vivo chemical processes from the above folates. An oxidation of 10-HCO-THF produces 10-formyldihydrofolate (10-HCO-DHF), which no longer has the asymmetric center at carbon-6 and is metabolized by aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) transformylase forming bioactive dihydrofolate. Since cytochrome c (Fe(3+)) rapidly oxidizes both (6R)- and ()-10-HCO-THF [Baggott et al. (2001) Biochem. J. 354, 115-22], we investigated the metabolism of 10-HCO-THF by isolated rat liver mitochondria. We found that 10-HCO-THF supported the respiration of mitochondria without uncoupling ATP synthesis. The site of electron donation was identified as complex IV, which contains cytochrome c; the folate product was 10-HCO-DHF, and the reaction was saturable with respect to 10-HCO-THF. Both ()- (unnatural) and (6R)-10-HCO-THF supported the respiration of mitochondria, whereas ()-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-HCO-THF) was inactive. To our knowledge, this cytochrome c oxidation of 10-HCO-THF to 10-HCO-DHF in the mitochondrial intermembrane space represents a possible folate metabolic pathway previously unidentified and would explain the bioactivity of unnatural carbon-6 isomers, (6R)-5-HCO-THF and ()-5,10-CH-THF, in humans.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25305414>Effect of hepatocyte-specific gadolinium-based contrast agents on hepatic fat-fraction and R2(⁎).</a></h2><p>The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of a hepatocyte-specific gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) on quantitative hepatic fat-fraction (FF) and R2* measurements. Fifty patients were imaged at 1.5T, using chemical-shift encoded water-fat MRI with low (5°) and high (15°) flip angles (FA), both before and after administration of a hepatocyte-specific GBCA (gadoxetic acid). Low and high FA, pre- and post-contrast FF and R2* values were measured for each subject. Available serum laboratory studies related to liver disease were also recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis were performed to compare measurements. Hepatic FF was unaffected by GBCA at low FA (slope=1.02±0.02, p=0.32). FF was overestimated at high FA pre-contrast (slope=1.33±0.03, p<10(-10)), but underestimated post-contrast (slope=0.81±0.02, p<10(-10)). Hepatic R2* was unaffected by FA (mean difference±95% CI pre-contrast:2.2±4.9s(-1), post-contrast:2.8±3.(-1)), but increased post-contrast in patients with total bilirubin <2.5mg/dL (ΔR2*=13.4±12.7s(-1)). Regression analysis of serum values demonstrated a correlation of post-contrast change in R2* with total bilirubin (p<0.01) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (p≈0.01). In conclusion, GBCA has no effect on hepatic FF at low FA due to a lack of T1-weighting, potentially allowing flexibility for FF imaging with hepatobiliary imaging protocols. Hepatic R2* increased significantly after GBCA administration, particularly in the biliary tree. Therefore, R2* maps should be obtained prior to contrast administration.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Retention index has been approved to be helpful for compound identification in one-dimensional gas chromatography, which is also true for two-dimensional gas chromatography. In this work, a novel regression model was proposed for calculating the second dimension retention index of target components where n-alkanes were used as reference compounds. This model was developed to depict the relationship among adjusted second dimension retention time, temperature of the second dimension column and carbon number of n-alkanes by an exponential nonlinear function with only five parameters. Three different criteria were introduced to find the optimal values of parameters. The performance of this model was evaluated using experimental data of n-alkanes (C7-C31) at 24 temperatures which can cover all 0- adjusted retention time area. The experimental results show that the mean relative error between predicted adjusted retention time and experimental data of n-alkanes was only 2%. Furthermore, our proposed model demonstrates a good extrapolation capability for predicting adjusted retention time of target compounds which located out of the range of the reference compounds in the second dimension adjusted retention time space. Our work shows the deviation was less than 9 retention index units (iu) while the number of alkanes were added up to 5.

However, the effects of reduced loading caused by the absence of  bearing or joint motion on articular cartilage and subchondral bone is still poorly understood. We aimed to characterize morphological and metabolic responses of articular cartilage and subchondral bone to decreased mechanical stress in vivo.Mice were subjected to periods of hindlimb unloading by tail suspension or external fixation of the knee joints. The articular surface was observed with digital microscope and the epiphyseal bone was assessed by micro-CT analysis. Articular cartilage and subchondral bone were further evaluated by histomorphometric, histochemical, and immunohistochemical analyses.The joint surface was intact, but thickness of both the total and uncalcified layer of articular cartilage were decreased both after joint unloading and immobilization. Subchondral bone atrophy with concomitant marrow expansion predisposed osteoclast activity at bone surface to invade into cartilaginous layer. Uncalcified cartilage showed decreased aggrecan content and increased aggrecanase expression. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was increased at uncalcified cartilage, whereas decreased at calcified cartilage. The distributions of hypertrophic chondrocyte markers remained unchanged.Thinning of articular cartilage induced by mechanical unloading may be mediated by metabolic changes in chondrocytes, including accelerated aggrecan catabolism and exquisitely modulated matrix mineralization, and cartilage matrix degradation and resorption by subchondral osteoclasts. Cartilage degeneration without chondrocyte hypertrophy under unloading condition indicate the possible existence of mechanism which is different from osteoarthritis pathogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

RNAi-mediated knockdown of  mRNA confirmed the role of  in murgantiol biosynthesis. TPS expression is highly specific to tissues lining the cuticle of the abdominal sternites of mature males. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that TPS is derived from a -IDS progenitor and diverged from bona fide -IDS proteins including IDS-2, which functions as an (,)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase. Structure-guided mutagenesis revealed several residues critical to TPS and FPPS activity. The emergence of an IDS-like protein with TPS activity in  demonstrates that de novo terpene biosynthesis evolved in the Hemiptera in an adaptation for intraspecific communication.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Clarithromycin (CAM) has been reported to suppresses MMP activity. In this study, we investigated whether CAM could prevent the formation and rupture of AA.Male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (28-30 weeks of age) were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days. CAM (100 mg/kg/d) or saline (as a control) was administered orally to the mice every day (CAM group, n = 13; control group, n = 13). After the administration period, the aortic diameter, elastin content, macrophage infiltration, MMP levels, and levels of inflammatory cytokines, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), were measured.The aortic diameter was significantly suppressed in the CAM group (P < .001). No rupture death was observed in the CAM group in contrast to five deaths (38%) in the control group (P < .01). CAM significantly suppressed the degradation of aortic elastin (56.3% vs 16.5%; P < .001) and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages (0.05 vs 0.16; P < .01). Compared with the controls, the enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly reduced in the CAM group (MMP-2, 0.15 vs 0.56 [P < .01]; MMP-9, 0.12 vs 0.60 [P < .01]), and the levels of interleukin 1β (346.6 vs 1066.0; P < .05), interleukin 6 (128.4 vs 346.2; P < .05), and phosphorylation of NF-κB were also decreased (0.3 vs 2.0; P < .01).CAM suppressed the progression and rupture of AA through the suppression of inflammatory macrophage infiltration, a reduction in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, and the inhibition of elastin degradation associated with the suppression of NF-κB phosphorylation.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine are used in modern medicine to treat pain, motion sickness, as eye pupil dilators and antidotes against organo-phosphate poisoning. Hyoscyamine is converted to 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine (anisodamine) and scopolamine by hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (H6H), a 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase. We describe here a marked chemo-diversity in the tropane alkaloid content in Mandragora spp. M. officinarum and M. turcomanica lack anisodamine and scopolamine but display up to 10 fold higher hyoscyamine levels as compared with M. autumnalis. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that H6H is highly conserved among scopolamine-producing Solanaceae. MoH6H present in M. officinarum differs in several amino acid residues including a homozygotic mutation in the substrate binding region of the protein and its prevalence among accessions was confirmed by Cleaved-Amplified-Polymorphic-Sequence analyses. Functional expression revealed that MaH6H, a gene isolated from M. autumnalis encodes an active H6H enzyme while the MoH6H sequence isolated from M. officinarum was functionally inactive. A single G to T mutation in nucleotide 663 of MoH6H is associated with the lack of anisodamine and scopolamine in M. officinalis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, needle based in situ fenestration (ISF) has shown great potential in endovascular total aortic arch repair (ETAAR). This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of ETAAR via needle based ISF, and to present initial experience with this technique.Patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective study. The supra-arch branches were manually punctured in a retrograde manner using liver biopsy needles (18 gauge/30 cm) in the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and brachiocephalic trunk (BCT), and endo-puncture system or aspiration biopsy needles (21-gauge) in the left subclavian artery (LSA). All the branches were revascularised with bridge stents. Routine follow-up occurred at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post surgery.Ten patients with arch pathologies underwent ETAAR. Revascularisation of three branches was successfully performed in eight patients, but attempts to create ISF in LSA were unsuccessful in two patients because of tortuosity and sharp angle. The time taken to establish ISF in LCCA and BCT was 100.4s and 489., respectively. Bilateral regional cerebral  saturation (RCOS) decreased after the arch endograft deployment (both, p < .001) and recovered to the pre-operative level once both carotid arteries were reconstructed (left, p = .0856; right, p = .6). The right RCOS was higher with the beneficial effect of extracorporeal circulation (after cTAGs deployment, p < .001; after LCCA revascularised, p = .0148) during the ischaemic period. In one case, the left iliac artery ruptured, but no ISF related or neurological complications occurred. An early follow-up (mean 5.44 months) CTA and ultrasound confirmed patency of all the branch grafts without any endoleak or migration CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ETAAR via needle based ISF, making full use of off the shelf devices and techniques, can be successfully performed in aortic arch pathologies with a favourable early outcome.Copyright © 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

This combination of tracers allows three separate elements of hepatic glucose production (GP) to be probed simultaneously in a single study: 1) endogenous GP, 2) the contribution of glycogen, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and glycerol to GP, and 3) flux through PEP carboxykinase, pyruvate recycling, and the TCA cycle. Isotope-dilution measurements of [1,6-(13)C(2)] glucose by (1)H and (13)C NMR indicated that GP in 16-h-fasted humans was 10.7 +/- 0.9 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1). (2)H NMR spectra of monoacetone glucose (derived from plasma glucose) provided the relative (2)H enrichment at glucose H-2, H-5, and H-, which, in turn, reflects the contribution of glycogen, PEP, and glycerol to total GP (5.5 +/- 0.7, 4.8 +/- 1.0, and 0.4 +/- 0.3 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1), respectively).

However, the CS structure is complicated due to different sources and the number and positions of sulfate groups. The objective of this study was to prepare different low molecular  chondroitin sulfates (LMWCSs) and to investigate the biological activity in anti-complement capacity. A series of LMWCSs was prepared from different sources and characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), size exclusion chromatography-multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Hemolytic, anti-complement 3 deposition capacity and cell viability assays were carried out to investigate the biological activities in vitro. The results showed that LMWCS prepared from shark cartilage with the oxidative degradation method (LMWCS-S-O) had the best anti-complement capacity. LMWCS-S-O could inhibit the alternative pathway of the complement system and protect chondrocytes from cell death. The attenuating effect of LMWCS-S-O on Osteoarthritis (OA) was investigated by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model in vivo. Functional wind-up, histological and C5b-9 analyses were used to evaluate the treatment effect on the OA model. In vivo results showed that LMWCS-S-O could attenuate OA.

There is paucity of comparative data on tumor margins and re-excisions in these patients. High re-excision rates up to 25% have been reported in breast conservation therapy patients; efforts to obtain cosmesis and avoid implant rupture might increase this further. We analyzed tumor margins, re-excision rates, and recurrence in previously augmented versus non-augmented patients undergoing lumpectomy for breast cancer. We preserved preexisting implants if feasible with oncologic clearance and cosmesis.Institutional review board-approved retrospective analysis was performed on patients undergoing lumpectomy with history of prior breast augmentation (N = 52) and consecutively selected non-augmented patients (N = 51). Based on tumor distance to inked margin, we grouped margins as negative (≥2 mm), close (<2 mm), and positive. Patients were followed up clinically and with imaging in the outpatient clinic, and recurrences were documented.Patients in the non-augmented group were significantly more likely to have larger tumors (T2 and above; P = 0.05) compared with the augmented group. Although more patients in the augmented group had positive margins, this was not statistically significant (6 vs 3, P = 0.86). No difference was noted between re-excision rates among the augmented versus non-augmented groups (21.1% vs 19.6%, respectively; odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-2.37; P = 0.85); these remained unchanged even when adjusting for tumor stage (P = .75) and margins (P = 0.73). Although more patients in the augmented group recurred (4 vs 0), this was not statistically significant (P = 0.1).Our results indicate that, from the oncological standpoint, patients with prior augmentation can undergo lumpectomy with equivalent tumor margins and re-excision rates.

For the activation of methane, the TSR (two-state reactivity) mechanism has been certified through the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) calculation and the Landau-Zener-type model. In the vicinity of the minimum energy crossing point (MECP), SOC equals 900.23 cm(-1) and the probability of intersystem crossing is approximately 0.62. Spin inversion makes the activation barrier decline from 1.63 to 0.57 eV. NBO analysis demonstrates that empty  and 5d orbitals of the Hf atom play the major role for the activation of C-H bonds. Finally, CH4 dehydrogenates to produce Hf-CH2(2+). For oxidation of CO by N2O catalyzed by HfO(2+) or TaO(2+), the covalent bonds between transition metal atoms and the  atom restrict the freedom of valence electrons. Therefore, they are all SSR (single-state reactivity). The  atom is directly extracted during the course of  transfer, and its microscopic essence has been discussed.

However, it is unclear if significant quantities of folate are absorbed in an intact microbiome.We determined whether and how much of a physiologic dose of [(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate delivered in a pH-sensitive enteric caplet to an intact colonic microbiome is absorbed.Healthy adults ingested a specially designed pH-sensitive acrylic copolymer-coated barium sulfate caplet that contained 855 nmol (400 μg) [(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate. After a washout period ≥ 4 wk, subjects received an intravenous injection of the same compound (214 nmol).

The present films exhibited homogeneous microstructure with low porosity. O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the amount of  vacancies. The ferroelectric measurements showed that the ferroelectricity deteriorates with the increase in the number of  vacancies. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and XPS were used to study the electronic structure. The results indicated that the decreased ferroelectricity might be ascribed to the weakened hybridization between O 2p and Pb  and Ti 3d orbitals. The ferromagnetic behaviors were also observed in the thin films and saturated magnetization raised monotonously with the  vacancy rising due to the enhanced F-center exchange interaction.

This study aimed to compare the rate of successful defibrillation using 1- and 2-min defibrillation intervals.Twenty-six pigs were randomly assigned to 1- or 2-min interval groups. After inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF), we observed pigs for 2 min. Thereafter, basic life support was initiated with a 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio for 8 min. Defibrillation was performed with an  of 2 J/kg at 10 min after VF and was repeated every 1 or 2 min according to randomization. Advanced cardiac life support, including continuous chest compression with ventilation every 6 s and intravenous injection of 1 mg epinephrine every 3 min, was performed until the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or until 20 min after VF induction. Haemodynamic parameters and baseline arterial blood gas profiles were compared between groups. ROSC, 24 -h survival, and the neurologic deficit score (NDS) were evaluated at 24 h.Haemodynamic parameters during resuscitation and baseline arterial blood gas profiles did not differ between groups. ROSC was more frequently observed in the 1-min interval group (p = 0.047). Time to ROSC was not different between groups (p = 0.054). The 24 -h survival was higher (p = 0.047) and NDS at 24 h was lower (92 ± 175) in the 1-min interval group than in the 2-min interval group (272 ± 190) (p = 0.028).Defibrillation success and resuscitation outcomes were superior when using a 1-min defibrillation interval in animal models of cardiac arrest.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The calculated OH generation rate was 1373.4 μM min in ballast water, which is much higher than that in other advanced oxidative processes such as photocatalysis. As a result, non-indigenous red tide algae were inactivated to meet the ballast water discharge standards (<10 cells mL) of the International Maritime Organization. The ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (F/F) for algal chlorophyll rapidly decreased to zero within a contact time of only 6 s, indicating complete inactivation of algae. Observation under a scanning electron microscope showed no cellular materials were released by algal cells upon OH inactivation. A risk assessment of the OH treatment system was conducted, and the ratios of predicted environmental concentrations to predicted no effect concentrations of all detected disinfection byproducts were less than 1, even at a worst-case oxidant concentration of 2.41 mg L. Ship ballast water treated using OH inactivation is safe for marine environments.

The hypotheses were tested that injury induces an expansion of S1PR1-positive cells and that these cells accumulate toward the lumen because they follow the sphingosine-1-phosphate gradient from arterial wall tissue (low) to plasma (high).A humanized rat model was used in which denuded human internal mammary artery (IMA) was implanted into the position of the abdominal aorta of immunosuppressed Rowett nude rats. This injury model is characterized by medial as well as intimal hyperplasia, whereby intimal cells are of human origin. At 7, 14, and 28 days after implantation, grafts were harvested and processed for fluorescent immunostaining for S1PR1 and smooth muscle α-actin. Nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidine-2'-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Using digitally reconstructed, complete cross sections of grafts, intimal and medial areas were measured, whereby the medial area had virtually been divided into an outer (toward adventitia) and inner (toward lumen) layer. The fraction of S1PR1-positive cells was determined in each layer by counting S1PR1-positive and S1PR1-negative cells.The fraction of S1PR1-postive cells in naive IMA is 58.9% ± 6.0% (mean ± standard deviation). At day 28 after implantation, 81.6% ± 4.4% of medial cells were scored S1PR1 positive (P < .01). At day 14, the ratio between S1PR1-positive and S1PR1-negative cells was significantly higher in the lumen-oriented inner layer (9.3 ± 2.1 vs 6.0 ± 1.0; P < .01). Cells appearing in the intima at day 7 and day 14 were almost all S1PR1 positive. At day 28, however, about one-third of intimal cells were scored S1PR1 negative.From these data, we conclude that denudation of IMA specifically induces the expansion of S1PR1-positive cells. Based on the nonrandom distribution of S1PR1-positive cells, we consider the possibility that much like lymphocytes, S1PR1-positive smooth muscle cells also use S1PR1 to recognize the sphingosine-1-phosphate gradient from tissue (low) to plasma (high) and so migrate out of the media toward the intima of the injured IMA.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Here, we have systematically investigated how the xyloside concentration and the type of xyloside, as well as the cell type, influenced the structure of xyloside-primed glycosaminoglycans in terms of the heparan sulfate and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proportion and disaccharide composition. We found that although greatest influence was exerted by the cell type, both the xyloside concentration and type of xyloside impacted the proportion of heparan sulfate and the complexity of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate. The disaccharide composition of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate was influenced by the xyloside concentration and type of xyloside to a higher extent than that of the heparan sulfate; the proportion of 4S-sulfated disaccharides in the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate decreased and the proportions of -sulfated and/or nonsulfated disaccharides increased both with increasing concentrations of xyloside and with increasing xyloside hydrophobicity, whereas the proportion of nonsulfated disaccharides was primarily altered in the heparan sulfate with increasing concentrations of xyloside.

The hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase genes of Hyoscyamus niger (HnH6H) and S. lurida (SlH6H) were cloned and respectively overexpressed in hairy root cultures of S. lurida, to compare their effects on promoting the production of TAs, especially the high-value scopolamine. Root cultures with SlH6H/HnH6H overexpression were confirmed by PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that the enzymatic steps defined by H6H were strongly elevated at the transcriptional level. Tropane alkaloids, including hyoscyamine, anisodamine and scopolamine, were analyzed by HPLC. Scopolamine and anisodamine contents were remarkably elevated in the root cultures overexpressing SlH6H/HnH6H, whereas that of hyoscyamine was more or less reduced, when compared with those of the control. These results also indicated that SlH6H and HnH6H promoted anisodamine production at similar levels in S. lurida root cultures. More importantly, HnH6H-overexpressing root cultures had more scopolamine in them that did SlH6H-overexpressing root cultures.

The aims of this study were to assess the relative value of endothelial inflammatory markers for this application and to develop molecular ultrasound contrast agents for their imaging.Human CEA specimens were obtained prospectively from asymptomatic (30) and symptomatic (30) patients. Plaques were assessed by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, P-selectin, and von Willebrand factor. Established small peptide ligands to each of these targets were then synthesized and covalently conjugated to the surface of lipid-shelled microbubble ultrasound contrast agents, which were then evaluated in a flow chamber for binding kinetics to activated human aortic endothelial cells under variable shear conditions.Expression of VCAM-1 on the endothelium of CEA specimens from symptomatic patients was 2.4-fold greater than that from asymptomatic patients (P < .01). Expression was not significantly different between groups for P-selectin (P = .43), von Willebrand factor (P = .59), or lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (P = .99). Although most plaques from asymptomatic patients displayed low VCAM-1 expression, approximately one in five expressed high VCAM-1 similar to plaques from symptomatic patients. In vitro flow chamber experiments demonstrated that VCAM-1-targeted microbubbles bind cells that express VCAM-1, even under high-shear conditions that approximate those found in human carotid arteries, whereas binding efficiency was lower for the other agents.VCAM-1 displays significantly higher expression on high-risk (symptomatic) vs low-risk (asymptomatic) carotid plaques. Ultrasound contrast agents bearing ligands for VCAM-1 can sustain high-shear attachment and may be useful for identifying patients in whom more aggressive treatment is warranted.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

However, very little is known whether the donors' anti-A and/or anti-B titers change over time and whether repeated titer measurements on the same donor are required to ensure that each donation produces a low titer product.The anti-A and/or anti-B titers were measured on 56 healthy adult volunteers (47 blood donors; nine blood center personnel) every 3 months for 12 consecutive months using an automated solid phase analyzer. The results were expressed as log2 titer steps (e.g., titer 32 = 5 titer steps).Minor variations in the average anti-A and/or anti-B titers were seen over time; the maximum individual SD in each group was 1.50 (IgG anti-A) or 1.00 (IgM anti-A, IgM, and IgG anti-B). When the SDs for the four titer measurements from all 56 volunteers were combined as appropriate, the highest overall combined SD was 0.47 titer steps for IgG anti-A. This value corresponds to a 95% confidence interval for intraindividual variation in this antibody's titer over 12 months of 0.96 titer steps. Thus, based on one measurement, an IgG anti-A with a titer step of, for example, 6 would be expected to be in the range of titer step 5 to titer step 7 over the course of 1 year with 95% probability.The titers of anti-A and/or anti-B among healthy adults are stable over at least 1 year.

However, in the rat, the DREZ becomes a boundary to regenerating sensory axons after Postnatal Days 2-3. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause regenerative failure at the DREZ after the critical period for regeneration are unknown. Recent studies demonstrate that two extracellular matrix molecules, Cytotactin/tenascin (CT) and chondroitin 6-sulfate-containing proteoglycans (C--PG) are present in normal boundary regions of the brain and spinal cord during development. In the present study we sought to visualize the expression of these two putative inhibitory molecules in the DREZ of normally developing and adult animals, and also in animals after injury. CT and C--PG spread laterally from the midline to the DREZ by Postnatal Day 3, correlating exactly with the end of the critical period. The staining intensity for these two molecules increases further in the DREZ after root lesions, but not sciatic lesions, at ages when axons cannot regenerate into the spinal cord. Following root lesion CT and C--PG were mostly present in association with reactive glia at the DREZ and in white matter, rather than with reactive glia in grey matter of the dorsal horn, suggesting that astroglia are heterogeneous in their response to root lesion.

Core-to-valence XANES features that vary in intensity differentiate with unprecedented sensitivity the number and identity of Hg ligands and the geometry of the ligand environment. Post-Hartree-Fock XANES calculations, coupled with natural population analysis, performed on MP2-optimized Hg[(SR)2···(RSR)n] complexes show that the shape, position, and number of electronic transitions observed at high -resolution are directly correlated to the Hg and S (l,m)-projected empty densities of states and occupations of the hybridized Hg  and 5d valence orbitals. Linear two-coordination, the most common coordination geometry in mercury chemistry, yields a sharp 2p to  + 5d electronic transition. This transition varies in intensity for Hg bonded to thiol groups in macromolecular NOM. The intensity variation is explained by contributions from next-nearest, low-charge, thioether-type RSR ligands at 3.0-3.3 Å from Hg. Thus, Hg in NOM has two strong bonds to thiol S and k additional weak Hg···S contacts, or 2 + k coordination. The calculated stabilization  is -5 kcal/mol per RSR ligand. Detection of distant ligands beyond the first coordination shell requires precise measurement of, and comparison to, spectra of reference compounds as well as accurate calculation of spectra for representative molecular models. The combined experimental and theoretical approaches described here for Hg can be applied to other closed-shell atoms, such as Ag(I) and Au(I).

The combination of tyrosine hydroxylase and the cofactor produces more  radicals than does the autoxidation of the cofactor. This production of  radicals could be damaging to dopaminergic neurons. In the presence of tyrosine, the enzyme produces less radicals than it does in the absence of tyrosine. Mechanisms are proposed for the generation of reactive  species during the autoxidation of the cofactor and during enzymatic catalysis.

The clearance mechanism of PF-06409577 in animals and humans involves uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT)-mediated glucuronidation to an acyl glucuronide metabolite of PF-06409577 [(2,3,4,5,6)-6-((6-chloro-5-(4-(1-hydroxycyclobutyl)phenyl)-1-indole-3-carbonyl)oxy)-3,4,5-trihydroxytetrahydro-2-pyran-2-carboxylic acid (M1)], which retains selective activation of human 1-containing AMPK isoforms. This paper describes a detailed characterization of the human UGT isoform(s) responsible for glucuronidation of PF-06409577 to M1. Studies using a panel of 13 human recombinant UGT (hrUGT) enzymes indicated that PF-06409577 was converted to M1 in a highly selective fashion by UGT1A1, which was further verified in human liver microsomes treated with specific chemical inhibitors, and in different UGT1A1 expressers. Conversion of PF-06409577 to M1 by UGT1A1 occurred in a relatively selective fashion, compared with -estradiol (ES), a conventional probe substrate of UGT1A1. The Michaelis-Menten constant ( ) and   values describing the formation of M1 from PF-06409577 in hrUGT1A1 and microsomal preparations from human intestine, liver, and kidney ranged from 131 to 212 M ( ) and 107-3834 pmol/min per milligram ( ) in the presence of 2% bovine serum albumin. Relative activity factors (RAF) were determined for UGT1A1 using PF-06409577 and ES to enable estimation of intrinsic clearance from various tissues. RAF values from PF-06409577 and ES were generally comparable with the exception of intestinal microsomes, where ES overestimated the RAF of UGT1A1 due to glucuronidation by intestinal UGT1A8 and UGT1A10.

The novel pClasper yeast homologous recombination technique was used to isolate from a BAC clone a 60-kb DNA fragment that included the Hec-6st (Chst4) gene with flanking sequences. Transgenic mice were generated with the beta-galactosidase (LacZ) reporter gene inserted in-frame in the exon II of Hec-6st within the isolated BAC DNA fragment. LacZ was expressed specifically on HEV in LN, as indicated by its colocalization with peripheral node vascular addressin. LacZ was increased in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue during development and was reduced in LN and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue by LTbetaR-Ig (lymphotoxin-beta receptor human Ig fusion protein) treatment in a manner identical to the endogenous gene. The transgene was expressed at high levels in lymphoid accumulations with characteristics of tertiary lymphoid organs in the salivary glands of aged mice. Thus, the Hec--LacZ construct faithfully reproduces Hec-6st tissue-specific expression and can be used in further studies to drive expression of reporter or effector genes, which could visualize or inhibit HEV in autoimmunity.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328632>Use of Processed Nerve Allografts to Repair Nerve Injuries Greater Than 25 mm in the Hand.</a></h2><p>Processed nerve allografts (PNAs) have been demonstrated to have improved clinical results compared with hollow conduits for reconstruction of digital nerve gaps less than 25 mm; however, the use of PNAs for longer gaps warrants further clinical investigation. Long nerve gaps have been traditionally hard to study because of low incidence. The advent of the RANGER registry, a large, institutional review board-approved, active database for PNA (Avance Nerve Graft; AxoGen, Inc, Alachua, FL) has allowed evaluation of lower incidence subsets. The RANGER database was queried for digital nerve repairs of 25 mm or greater. Demographics, injury, treatment, and functional outcomes were recorded on standardized forms. Patients younger than 18 and those lacking quantitative follow-up data were excluded. Recovery was graded according to the Medical Research Council Classification for sensory function, with meaningful recovery defined as S3 or greater level. Fifty digital nerve injuries in 28 subjects were included. There were 22 male and 6 female subjects, and the mean age was 45. Three patients gave a previous history of , and there were 6 active smokers. The most commonly reported mechanisms of injury were saw injuries (n = 13), crushing injuries (n = 9), resection of neuroma (n = 9), amputation/avulsions (n = 8), sharp lacerations (n = 7), and blast/gunshots (n = 4). The average gap length was 35 ± 8 mm (range, 25-50 mm). Recovery to the S3 or greater level was reported in 86% of repairs. Static 2-point discrimination (s2PD) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWF) were the most common completed assessments. Mean s2PD in 24 repairs reporting 2PD data was 9 ± 4 mm. For the 38 repairs with SWF data, protective sensation was reported in 33 repairs, deep pressure in 2, and no recovery in 3. These data compared favorably with historical data for nerve autograft repairs, with reported levels of meaningful recovery of 60% to 88%. There were no reported adverse effects. Processed nerve allograft can be used to reconstruct long gap nerve defects in the hand with consistently high rates of meaningful recovery. Results for PNA repairs of digital nerve injuries with gaps longer than 25 mm compare favorably with historical reports for nerve autograft repair but without donor site morbidity.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30852248>Application of agent-based modelling to assess single-molecule transport across the cell envelope of E. coli.</a></h2><p>Single cells often show stochastic behaviour and variations in the physiological state of individual cells affect the behaviour observed in cell populations. This may be partially explained by variations in the concentration and spatial location of molecules within and in the vicinity of each cell.This paper introduces an agent-based model that represents single-molecule transport through the cellular envelope of Escherichia coli at the micrometre scale. This model enables broader observation of molecular transport throughout the different membrane layers and the study of the effect of molecular concentration in cellular noise. Simulations considered various low molecular  molecules, i.e. ampicillin, bosentan, coumarin, saquinavir, and terbutaline, and a gradient of molecular concentrations. The model ensured stochasticity in the location of the agents, using diffusing spherical particles with physical dimensions.Simulation results were validated against theoretical and experimental data. For example, theoretically, ampicillin molecules take 0.6 s to cross the entire cell envelope, and computational simulations took 0.68 s, 0.68 s, 0.70 s, and 0.69 s, for concentrations of 1.44 μM, 13.21 μM, 26.4 μM and 105.61 μM, respectively. Replicate standard deviation decreased with growing initial concentrations of the molecules. In turn, no clear relationship could be observed between molecular size and variability.This work presented a novel agent-based model to study the effect of the initial concentration of low molecular  molecules on cellular noise. Cellular noise during molecule diffusion was found to be concentration-dependent and size-independent. The new model holds considerable potential for future, more complex analyses, when emerging experimental data may enable modelling of membrane transport mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Our interest focused on a conformationally constrained form of compound 4, because it appeared that the rigid form resulted in not only selectivity for group II mGluR but was orally active. Therefore, we introduced a fluorine atom to compound 4, based on the molecular size (close resemblance to hydrogen atom) and electronegativity (effects on the electron distribution in the molecule) of this atom and carbon-fluorine bond energy. Compound (+)-7 (MGS0008), the best compound among 3-fluoro derivatives 7-10, retained the agonist activity of compound 4 for mGluR2 and mGluR3 ((+)-7: EC(50) = 29.4 +/- 3.3 nM and 45.4 +/- 8.4 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively; 4: EC(50) = 18.3 +/- 1.6 nM and 62.8 +/- 12 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively) and increased the oral activity of compound 4 ((+)-7: ED(50) = 5.1 mg/kg and 0.26 mg/kg for phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperactivity and PCP-induced head-weaving behavior, respectively; 4: ED(50) = >100 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg for PCP-induced hyperactivity and PCP-induced head-weaving behavior, respectively). In addition, a compound [(3)H]-(+)-7 binding study using mGluR2 or 3 expressed in CHO cells was successful ((+)-7: K(i) = 47.7 +/- 17 nM and 65.9 +/- 7.1 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively; 4: K(i) = 23.4 +/- 7.1 nM and 53.5 +/- 13 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively). On the basis of a successful result of compound 7, we focused on the introduction of a fluorine atom on the C6 position of compound 4. (1R,2S,5R, 6R)-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid ((-)-11) exhibited a high degree of agonist activity for group II mGluRs equal to that of compound 4 or 7 ((-)-11: K(i) = 16.6 +/- 5.6 and 80.9 +/- 31 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively). Our interest shifted to modification on CH(2) at C4 position of compound 11, since replacement of the CH(2) group with either an  atom or sulfur atom yielded compound 5 or 6, resulting in increased agonist activity. We selected a carbonyl group instead of CH(2) at the C4 position of compound 11. The carbonyl group might slightly change the relative conformation of three functional groups, the amino group and two carboxylic acids, which have important roles in mediating the interaction between group II mGluRs and their ligand, compared with the CH(2) group of 4,  atom of 5, and sulfur atom of 6. (1R,2S,5S,)-2-Amino-6-fluoro-4-oxobicyclo[3.1. 0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid monohydrate ((+)-14, MGS0028) exhibited a remarkably high degree of agonist activity for mGluR2 (K(i) = 0.570 +/- 0.10 nM) and mGluR3 (K(i) = 2.07 +/- 0.40 nM) expressed in CHO cells but not mGluR4, 6, 7, 1a, or 5 expressed in CHO cells (K(i) = >100 000 nM). Furthermore, compound (+)-14 strongly inhibited phencyclidine (PCP)-induced head-weaving behavior (ED(50) = 0.090 microg/kg) and hyperactivity (ED(50) = 0.30 mg/kg) in rats. Thus, (+)-7 and (+)-14 are potent, selective, and orally active group II mGluR agonists and might be useful not only for exploring the functions of mGluRs but in the treatment of schizophrenia.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30000416>Pravastatin.</a></h2><p>Levels of pravastatin in milk are low, but no relevant published information exists with its use during breastfeeding.

Formation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide may be injurious to tissue directly; however, it is thought that the primary mediators of tissue damage are the secondarily derived oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and hypohalous acid. The gastrointestinal tract is particularly well endowed with the enzymatic machinery necessary to form large amounts of ROMs. Sources of ROMs in the gastrointestinal tract include mucosal oxidases such as xanthine oxidase, amine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase as well as the NADPH oxidase found in the resident phagocytic leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils) of the lamina propria. We have demonstrated that reperfusion of ischemic small intestine results in substantial mucosal injury that is mediated by oxy radicals generated from xanthine oxidase and inflammatory leukocytes. The final mediator of toxicity appears to be the hydroxyl radical derived from the iron-catalyzed interaction between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Data from our laboratories as well as other laboratories suggest that reactive  metabolites may play an important role in mediating mucosal injury during active episodes of ulcerative colitis. We present a working hypothesis which states that transient ischemic episodes in the bowel initiate a cascade of self-perpetuating cycles of ROM formation, inflammation and, ultimately, mucosal injury.</p><p>Keyword:['colitis', 'inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28525415>Effects of Collagenase Digestion and Stromal Vascular Fraction Supplementation on Volume Retention of Fat Grafts.</a></h2><p>The use of autologous fat as a soft tissue filler has increased over the past decade in both reconstructive and aesthetic surgeries. Enhancement of autologous fat grafts with the addition of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has been reported to improve long-term volume retention. Stromal vascular fraction is most commonly isolated using enzymatic digestion, but it is unknown what effect the digestion process has on the adipocytes and SVF cells that comprise the graft. Some clinicians have reported use of enzymatically digested fat grafts to alter the physical properties of the tissue in specialized applications. We have previously reported that increasing collagenase digestion duration adversely affects the viability of adipocytes and SVF cells. Here, we aimed to determine if collagenase digestion of adipocytes before grafting is detrimental to long-term graft retention and if SVF supplementation can abrogate these potential deleterious effects.We used a published xenograft model in which human lipoaspirate was implanted into the scalp of immunocompromised mice to study the effects of collagenase digestion on in vivo graft survival after 12 weeks. We used 4 experimental groups: grafts composed of collagenase-digested and nondigested adipocytes (50-minute digestion) and grafts with and without SVF supplementation. We used microcomputed tomography to serially and noninvasively quantify graft volume, in conjunction with hematoxylin-eosin staining of histological cross-sections of implanted and excised grafts to assess overall tissue viability. We found that adipocytes that were collagenase-digested before implantation had significantly lower retention rates at 12 weeks and poorer tissue health, which was assessed by quantifying the number of intact adipocytes, the number of cystic formations, and by scoring the degree of inflammation and fibrosis. Further, we found that SVF supplementation of the digested grafts improved graft survival, but not to the level observed in undigested grafts.We conclude that collagenase digestion adversely affects the long-term volume retention of fat grafts, but that graft retention is improved by SVF supplementation. These experimental results can serve as an initial framework to further elucidate the reported efficacy and safety of using collagenase-digested fat grafts and SVF in the clinical setting.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1408799>Synthesis of the diastereomers of thymidine glycol, determination of concentrations and rates of interconversion of their cis-trans epimers at equilibrium and demonstration of differential alkali lability within DNA.</a></h2><p>5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidine (thymidine glycol) is a major product of the reaction of thymidine with reactive  species, including those generated by ionizing radiation. Thymidine glycol exists as 2 diastereomeric pairs by virtue of the chirality of the C(5) and C(6) atoms. A simple procedure is described for synthesizing and purifying each of the diastereomeric pairs separately. After brominating thymidine, the two trans 5-bromo-6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidine (thymidine bromohydrin) C(5) diastereomers were easily separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Each thymidine bromohydrin was quantitatively converted to the corresponding diastereomeric thymidine glycol pair by reflux in aqueous solution. The concentrations at equilibrium of the cis (5S,6R),(5R,) and trans (5S,),(5R,6R) forms of the thymidine glycol diastereomers were determined and were 80% cis and 20% trans for the 5S pair and 87% cis and 13% trans for the 5R pair. At equilibrium, the rate of cis-trans epimerization of the two sets of diastereomers was essentially identical. The 5S diastereomeric pair was significantly more alkali labile than the 5R pair due to the higher concentration of the 5S trans epimer at equilibrium. This differential alkali lability was also manifest when the thymine glycol moiety was present in chemically oxidized poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) indicating that the chemical differences between the diastereomeric pairs are preserved in DNA.

This pathology is a significant obstacle to the clinical development of MMP inhibitors and in pre-clinical models MSS can be verified only after terminal histopathology. Consequently, we devised a longitudinal and functional readout of MSS in conscious rats treated with marimastat that was validated against terminal histological assessment.MSS was induced by minipump infusion of marimastat (5-10mg/kg/day). In marimastat-treated or vehicle-control groups, three possible functional biomarkers were assessed: paw volume (PV), landing foot splay separation (LFSS), and rotarod performance (n=6 rats/group for each endpoint).Histologically, fibrosis scores in the synovium and ligament increased from 0 on Day 1 (D1) to 4.6±0.2 and 4.7±0.1, respectively, on D15; growth plate thickness was also elevated from 215.0±6.3μm (D1) to 253.3±8.0μm (D15). While neither PV nor LFSS were correlative with MSS histopathology, marimastat (10mg/kg/day) reduced rotarod performance from 180±0s (D0) to 135±30s (D9) using a constant speed protocol (10rpm, 180s) and from 180±0s (D0) to 96± (D6) employing a variable speed protocol (increasing from 5 to 25rpm over 180s).Results of the present study demonstrate that rotarod performance can be used as a predictive longitudinal, in vivo functional biomarker of MSS concomitant with histological evidence of joint damage to effectively facilitate compound selection during drug discovery. Moreover, for targets with a mechanistic risk for MSS, the model is also conducive to inclusion in secondary pharmacodynamic studies during lead optimization to identify the best (safest) compounds for advancement into clinical trials.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We applied density functional theory (DFT) at the nonrelativistic and scalar and SO-coupled relativistic levels, and also the ab initio coupled cluster approach. The chemically active electron shells of the lanthanide atoms comprise the 5d and  (and 6p) valence atomic orbitals (AO) and also the filled inner 4f semivalence and outer 5p semicore shells. Four different frozen-core approximations for Lu were compared: the (1s(2) -4d(10) ) [Pd] medium core, the [Pd+5s(2) 5p(6) = Xe] and [Pd+4f(14) ] large cores, and the [Pd+4f(14) +5s(2) 5p(6) ] very large core. The errors of LuX bonding are more serious on freezing the 5p(6) shell than the 4f(14) shell, more serious upon core-freezing than on the effective-core-potential approximation. The LnX distances correlate linearly with the AO radii of the ionic outer shells, Ln(3+) -5p(6) and X(-) -np(6) , characteristic for dominantly ionic Ln(3+) -X(-) binding. The heavier halogen atoms also bind covalently with the Ln-5d shell. Scalar relativistic effects contract and destabilize the LuX bonds, spin orbit coupling hardly affects the geometries but the bond energies, owing to SO effects in the free atoms.

The global cardiovascular risk is the probability of suffering from a coronary event or stroke in a given period of time and in this sense it is an absolute risk, generally reported as percentage at 10 years. Usually risk functions are used, derived from longitudinal studies of healthy people at baseline. They consider some factors that are coherently linked with events in population analyses: among these there are some  factors (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fasting blood glucose), some biological factors (blood pressure) and some lifestyle factors (tobacco smoking), all modifiable beyond those non-modifiable like age and gender. The chosen factors must be independent at multivariate analysis, simple and standardized to measure, and contribute to significantly increase the risk-function predictivity. To be reliable, these risk functions must be derived from the same population where they will be later administered. For this reason the Italian Progetto CUORE, in the longitudinal study section, built a database of risk factors from longitudinal comparable studies started between the mid '80s and '90s and followed up the participants for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity to estimate the Italian global cardiovascular risk (first coronary or cerebrovascular event) for men and women. Two tools have been produced, the risk charts and a score software (see www.cuore.iss.it). The ongoing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and the fact that diabetes is associated with classical risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia induced the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association to launch a "call to action" to prevent both cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In this paper, as cardiometabolic risk factors were considered those "closely related to diabetes and cardiovascular disease: fasting/postprandial hyperglycemia, overweight/obesity, elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and dyslipidemia". The association among the cardiometabolic risk factors has been known for a long time, and much of their etiology has been ascribed to insulin resistance. Also, the fact that these "" abnormalities can cluster in many individuals gave rise to the term "", a construct embraced by many organizations but questioned by other authors. From an epidemiological point of view the  seems to increase modestly the cardiovascular risk, whereas in non-diabetic individuals it predicts diabetes much more efficiently. Many studies have compared the performance of the classical cardiovascular evaluation tools (the Framingham risk score, the SCORE charts, the Progetto CUORE score) and  in cardiovascular disease prediction. Usually in people at high risk the presence of the  does not improve the risk, whereas in people at lower risk its presence increases significantly the chances of cardiovascular disease. Many studies have shown that positive lifestyle interventions markedly reduce the rate of progression of type 2 diabetes. Also some drugs were tested for diabetes prevention, usually in people with impaired glucose tolerance. Oral diabetes drugs considered together (acarbose, metformin, flumamine, glipizide, phenformin) were less effective than lifestyle interventions, with different results among the drugs; the antiobesity drug orlistat gave similar results to lifestyle interventions. In Italy an appropriate approach to cardiovascular disease and diabetes prevention may be that of first evaluating the global cardiovascular risk using the charts or the score software of the Progetto CUORE, because high-risk subjects (> or =20%) must be treated aggressively independently of the presence of the ; as a second step the  may be sought, because it increases the risk; finally some attention should be paid to non-diabetic hyperglycemic individuals.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1705198>Macrophage vitronectin receptor, CD36, and thrombospondin cooperate in recognition of neutrophils undergoing programmed cell death.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28537398>Discovery of Clinical Candidate 2-((2S,)-2-Phenyl-6-hydroxyadamantan-2-yl)-1-(3'-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl)ethanone [BMS-816336], an Orally Active Novel Selective 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Inhibitor.</a></h2><p>BMS-816336 (6n-2), a hydroxy-substituted adamantyl acetamide, has been identified as a novel, potent inhibitor against human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) enzyme (IC 3.0 nM) with >10000-fold selectivity over human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2). 6n-2 exhibits a robust acute pharmacodynamic effect in cynomolgus monkeys (ED 0.12 mg/kg) and in DIO mice.

TBUT values were significantly shorter than both NIBUT (geometric mean 8. versus 10.9s, p=0.03) and mTBUT (geometric mean 8. versus 10., p=0.03), and demonstrated narrower spread (both p<0.05). No significant differences were detected between NIBUT and mTBUT (all p>0.05).Tear film break-up time values measured with conventional fluorescein instillation were shortened, while minimal fluorescein instillation and non-invasive methods produced comparable readings. This suggests that minimising instilled volumes can reduce the impact of fluorescein on clinical measurements of tear film stability.Copyright © 2017 British Contact Lens Association.

Six major mutational hotspots in p53 contain methylated CpG (mCpG) sites, and C -->T transition is the most common mutation at these sites. It was hypothesized that the formation of 5-methylcytosine glycol induced by reactive  species, its spontaneous deamination to thymine glycol and the miscoding property of the latter may account, in part, for the ubiquitous C -->T mutation at CpG site. Here, we assessed the kinetics of deamination for two diastereomers of 5-methylcytosine glycol in duplex DNA. Our results revealed that the half-lives for the deamination of the (5S,) and (5R,6R) diastereomers of 5-methylcytosine glycol in duplex DNA at 37 degrees C were 37.4 +/- 1.6 and 27.4 +/- 1.0 h, respectively. The deamination rates were only slightly lower than those for the two diastereomers in mononucleosides. Next, we assessed the formation of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine glycol in the form of its deaminated product, namely, thymidine glycol (Tg), in methyl-CpG-bearing duplex DNA treated with Cu(II)/H(2)O(2)/ascorbate. LC-MS/MS quantification results showed that the yield of Tg is similar as that of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxycytidine. Together, our data support that the formation and deamination of 5-methylcytosine glycol may contribute significantly to the C -->T transition mutation at mCpG dinucleotide site.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525411>Can we increase the speed and efficacy of antidepressant treatments? Part II. Glutamatergic and RNA interference strategies.</a></h2><p>In the second part we focus on two treatment strategies that may overcome the main limitations of current antidepressant drugs. First, we review the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the use of glutamatergic drugs as fast-acting antidepressants. Secondly, we review the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the use of small RNAs (e.g.., small interfering RNAs or siRNAs) to knockdown genes in monoaminergic and non-monoaminergic neurons and induce antidepressant-like responses in experimental animals. The development of glutamatergic agents is a promising venue for antidepressant drug development, given the antidepressant properties of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Its unique properties appear to result from the activation of AMPA receptors by a metabolite [(2S,;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK)] and mTOR signaling. These effects increase synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons and enhance serotonergic neurotransmission via descending inputs to the raphe nuclei. This view is supported by the cancellation of ketamine's antidepressant-like effects by inhibition of serotonin synthesis. We also review existing evidence supporting the involvement of miRNAs in MDD and the preclinical use of RNA interference (RNAi) strategies to target genes involved in antidepressant response. Many miRNAs have been associated to MDD, some of which e.g., miR-135 targets genes involved in antidepressant actions. Likewise, SSRI-conjugated siRNA evokes faster and/or more effective antidepressant-like responses. Intranasal application of sertraline-conjugated siRNAs directed to 5-HT receptors and SERT evoked much faster changes of pre- and postsynaptic antidepressant markers than those produced by fluoxetine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

In this article, we are advancing for the first time the RM1 model for lanthanides. Designed to be a much more general NDDO model, the RM1 model for lanthanides is capable of predicting geometries of lanthanide complexes for the cases when the central lanthanide trication is directly coordinated to any other atoms, not only  or nitrogen. The RM1 model for lanthanides is defined by three important attributes: (a) the orbitals, the lanthanide ion has now three electrons and a NDDO basis set made of 5d, , and 6p functions; (b) the parametrization, via cluster analysis and an adequate sampling; and (c), the statistical validation of the parameters to make sure the errors behave as random around a mean. All three aspects are described in detail in the article. Results indicate that the RM1 model does extend the accuracy of the previous Sparkle Models to types of coordinating bonds other than Ln-O and Ln-N; the most common ones for Eu, Gd, and Tb, being Ln-C, Ln-S, Ln-Cl, and Ln-Br. Overall, these other coordinating bonds are now predicted within 0.06 Å of their correct values. Therefore, the RM1 model here presented is capable of predicting geometries of lanthanide complexes, materials, metal-organic frameworks, etc., with useful accuracy.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129725>Computational investigation of catalytic effects of CXCOOH (X = F,Cl,H) on the three-component cyclocondensation reaction.</a></h2><p>The mechanism of acetic acid (AA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) catalyzed three-component cyclocondensation reaction to (4S,)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazinane-2-thione was determined via density functional calculations.

The objective of this study was to investigate antinociceptive effects of TD. Its activity was compared with the activity of morphine. The effects of TD and morphine were evaluated in models of inflammatory and noninflammatory pain. TD (6-1200 μmol/kg, intraperitoneally) significantly reduced the nociceptive effects induced by acetic acid or formalin in mice. TD also demonstrated an antinociceptive effect in the tail-flick and hot-plate model. The opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (at 15 μmol/kg, intraperitoneally), reversed the antinociceptive activity of TD in all the models evaluated. Morphine and TD induced tolerance in mice. However, the onset of tolerance to TD was delayed compared with that induced by morphine.

Participants were categorized into groups based upon a validated CL dry-eye questionnaire (CLDEQ-8) (n = 17 'asymptomatic', CLDEQ-8 score <9; n = 21 'symptomatic', CLDEQ-8 score ≥13). Examinations were performed at two visits (one with, and one without, CL wear), separated by one-week. Testing included: tear osmolarity, ocular redness, tear stability, ocular surface staining, meibography, tear production and tear collection. Tear osmolarity was taken from the inferior-lateral and superior-lateral menisci. The 'Inferior-Superior Osmotic Difference', I-SOD, was the absolute osmolarity difference between these menisci. Concentrations of seven cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were assayed from basal tears using multiplex cytometric bead array.At baseline, there was no significant difference in key clinical signs between asymptomatic and symptomatic CL wearers (p > 0.05).

Under these conditions, the expression level of Sp1 is unaltered. A decreased availability of putative repressor AP-1 proteins may also indirectly contribute to the effect of HDAC inhibitors. Finally, FR-beta selectively mediated growth inhibition by () dideazatetrahydrofolate in a manner that was greatly potentiated in AML cells by ATRA and HDAC inhibition.

This enzyme efficiently degraded hyaluronic acid (HA) and CS variants, but not E unit-rich CS-E, into unsaturated disaccharides; therefore, we designated this enzyme a CS-E-resisted HA/CS lyase (HCLase Er). We isolated a series of resistant oligosaccharides from the final product of a low-sulfated CS-E exhaustively digested by HCLase Er and found that the E units were dramatically accumulate in these resistant oligosaccharides. By determining the structures of several resistant tetrasaccharides, we observed that all of them possessed a ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S,) at their non-reducing ends, indicating that the disulfation of GalNAc abrogates HCLase Er activity on the β1-4 linkage between the E unit and the following disaccharide. ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAc(4S,)β1-4GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4S,) was most strongly resistant to HCLase Er. To our knowledge, this study is the first reporting a glycosaminoglycan lyase specifically inhibited by both 4-- and 6--sulfation of GalNAc.

In vitro experiments using monkey liver slices suggested that the apparent synthetic rate of VPA glucuronide (VPA-G) increased in the presence of carbapenems. However, no such increase was observed in the experiment using monkey liver microsomes. Although no increase of uridine 5'-diphosphate D-glucuronic acid was found in monkey liver slices in the presence of carbapenems, potent inhibitory activity of carbapenems for the hydrolysis of VPA-G was found in monkey and rat liver homogenate. In vivo hydrolysis of VPA-G was clearly shown by the existence of VPA in plasma after dosing of VPA-G to rats, and its inhibition by carbapenems was also clearly shown by the negligible levels of VPA in rat plasma after coadministration of carbapenems and VPA-G. These results clearly indicate one of the important causes of drug interaction as follows: carbapenems would inhibit the hydrolytic enzyme, which is involved in the hydrolysis of VPA-G to VPA, resulting in a decrease of plasma concentration of VPA.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576513>Plant-specific ribosome biogenesis factors in Arabidopsis thaliana with essential function in rRNA processing.</a></h2><p>rRNA processing and assembly of ribosomal proteins during maturation of ribosomes involve many ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs). Recent studies identified differences in the set of RBFs in humans and yeast, and the existence of plant-specific RBFs has been proposed as well. To identify such plant-specific RBFs, we characterized T-DNA insertion mutants of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding nuclear proteins with nucleotide binding properties that are not orthologues to yeast or human RBFs. Mutants of nine genes show an altered rRNA processing ranging from inhibition of initial 35S pre-rRNA cleavage to final maturation events like the  pre-rRNA processing. These phenotypes led to their annotation as 'involved in rRNA processing' - IRP. The irp mutants are either lethal or show developmental and stress related phenotypes. We identified IRPs for maturation of the plant-specific precursor 5'-5.8S and one affecting the pathway with ITS2 first cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA transcript. Moreover, we realized that 5'-5.8S processing is essential, while a mutant causing  accumulation shows only a weak phenotype. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of the maturation of the plant-specific precursor 5'-5.8S for plant development as well as the occurrence of an ITS2 first cleavage pathway in fast dividing tissues.© The Author(s) 2018.

The cancer tissue samples contained over twice as much chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) as did the normal tissue samples, while the amount of heparan sulfate (HS) and hyaluronan (HA) in normal and cancer tissues were not significantly different. In HS, several minor disaccharide components, including NS6S, NS2S and 2S were significantly lower in cancer tissues, while the levels of major disaccharides, TriS, NS and 0S disaccharides were not significantly different in normal and cancer tissues. In regards to CS/DS, the level of 4S disaccharide (the major component of CS-type A and DS) decreased and the level of  disaccharide (the major component of CS- type C) increased in cancer tissues. We also compared the content and structure of GAGs in lung tissues from smoking and non-smoking patients. Analysis of the glycolipids showed all lipids present in these lung tissues, with the exception of sphingomyelin were higher in cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Western analysis showed that syndecan 1 and 2 proteoglycans displayed much higher expression in cancer tissue/biopsy samples. This investigation begins to provide an understanding of patho-physiological roles on glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids and might be useful in identifying potential biomarkers in lung cancer.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27369516>Interruption of electronically excited Xe dimer formation by the photoassociation of Xe([3/2]2)-Xe(5p(6) (1)S0) thermal collision pairs.</a></h2><p>The diatomic collisional intermediate responsible for the formation of an electronically excited molecule by teratomic recombination has been observed in both the spectral and temporal domains by laser spectroscopy. We report experiments demonstrating thermal Xe([3/2]2)-Xe(5p(6) (1)S0) atomic collision pairs to be the immediate precursor to the formation of Xe2 (∗)(a(3)Σu (+),A(1)Σu (+)) by the three body process: Xe(∗)() + 2Xe ⟶ Xe2 (∗) + Xe, where the asterisk denotes an excited electronic state.

The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated for the first time that a glucose-lowering agent, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality when given in addition to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk. These results were entirely unexpected and have led to much speculation regarding the potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits.

This surface contained  vacancies in subsurface position within the topmost O-Ce-O trilayer [Pan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2013, 111, 206101.]. The present work builds upon these findings and discusses additional results obtained using PBE+U and hybrid functionals. These approaches do not predict the same relative stabilities for the various adsorption sites of a single Au adatom at an O-defect concentration of a ¼ ML or 1.984 nm. We attribute this discrepancy to a different alignment within the O 2p-Ce 4f gap, i.e. a different order by energy of partially occupied Ce 4f and Au  orbitals. The energy offset of these orbitals matters, because the adsorption of Au() atop Ce(4f) or atop a subsurface  atom in the first coordination shell of a Ce(4f) involves creation of Au() and Ce(4f) ions. The electron transfer to Au is coupled to stabilizing ionic relaxation in the lattice, commonly known as polaronic distortion, reinforcing the Au-Ce bond. The order of 4f and  orbitals depends on the density functional approximation and is also strongly influenced by the  defect concentration.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23926905>Hydroxyethyl starch - the importance of being earnest.</a></h2><p>Despite ongoing controversial expert discussions the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently recommended to suspend marketing authorisations for hydroxyethyl starch. This comment critically evaluates the line of arguments. Basically, the only indication for a colloid is intravascular hypovolemia. Crystalloid use appears reasonable to compensate ongoing extracellular losses beyond. In the hemodynamically instable patient this leads to the distinction between an initial resuscitation phase where colloids might be indicated and a crystalloidal maintenance phase thereafter. It is important to bear this in mind when reevaluating the studies the EMA referred to in the context of its recent decision: i) VISEP compared ringer's lactate to 10% HES 200/0.5 in septic patients and found an increased incidence of renal failure in HES receivers. Unfortunately, study treatment was started only after initial stabilization with HES, randomizing hemodynamically stable patients into a rational (crystalloids) and an irrational (high dose starch until ICU discharge) maintenance treatment. ii)  compared ringer's acetate to 6% HES 130/0.42 for fluid resuscitation in septic patients and found an increased need of renal replacement therapy and a higher mortality in the HES group. However, patients of both groups were again randomized only after initial stabilization with colloids, the actual comparison was, therefore, again rational vs. irrational. Beyond that, the documentation is partly fragmentary, leaving many important questions around the fate of the patients unanswered. iii) CHEST randomized ICU patients to receive saline or 6% HES 130/0.4 for fluid resuscitation. Actually, despite partly discussed in a different way, this trial showed no relevant differences in outcome. In all, two studies showed what happens to septic patients if starches are used in a way we do not observe in daily practice. The third one actually proves their safety. The benefit of perioperative goal-directed preload optimization using starches is unquestioned. Taking these informations into account, the recommendation of the EMA starches to be generally dangerous remains mysterious and incomprehensible. An authority being able to dictate behavior should stand clear from oppressively ending a worldwide expert discussion and step back into the role of the observer until science achieves an agreement.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1997278>Apoptosis (programmed cell death) and functional changes in aging neutrophils.

At 2 and 4 weeks after surgery, subchondral bone changes were evaluated via micro-computed tomography with various knee flexion angles to simulate -bearing during rat ambulation under a 3-dimensional motion capture apparatus. Additionally, the biomechanical properties, histology, and ultrastructure of the medial tibia and femoral condyle were evaluated.Focal subchondral bone plate perforations were confirmed in the medial tibia within 2 weeks after surgery and were aggravated rapidly 2 weeks later. This subchondral plate porosity colocalized with articular cartilage lesions as confirmed by histology and scanning electron microscopy, and coincided with the likely point of contact between the posterior femoral condyle and tibial plateau during ambulation. Biomechanical properties were confirmed at the medial tibia, at which stiffness was reduced to approximately half that of the sham-operated knee at 4 weeks after surgery.Cartilage-subchondral bone plate alterations localized in the region of the point of mechanical load during ambulation in DMM-operated knees, at which the mechanical integrity of cartilage was impaired. These results indicate that DMM-induced increases in mechanical load play an important role in the pathogenesis of early post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA), and it might accelerate the development of the disease via cartilage-subchondral bone plate crosstalk through increased subchondral plate perforations.Copyright © 2015 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

R. conorii, the causative agent of Mediterranean spotted fever, is a tick-borne pathogen that primarily infects microvascular endothelium in humans. We have determined the transcriptional landscape of R. conorii during infection of Human Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HMECs) by strand-specific RNA sequencing to identify 4 riboswitches, 13 trans-acting (intergenic), and 22 cis-acting (antisense) small RNAs (termed 'Rc_sR's). Independent expression of four novel trans-acting sRNAs (Rc_sR31, Rc_sR33, Rc_sR35, and Rc_sR42) and known bacterial sRNAs (, RNaseP_bact_a, ffs, and α-tmRNA) was next confirmed by Northern hybridization. Comparative analysis during infection of HMECs vis-à-vis tick AAE2 cells revealed significantly higher expression of Rc_sR35 and Rc_sR42 in HMECs, whereas Rc_sR31 and Rc_sR33 were expressed at similar levels in both cell types.

Four weeks after the surgery, the animals were subjected to moderate (12 m/min) or intense (21 m/min) treadmill exercises for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. PTOA development in articular cartilage and SB was examined using histological and immunohistochemical analyses, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis, and biomechanical testing at 8 weeks after surgery. Gremlin-1 was injected to determine the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling on PTOA development following moderate exercise.Moderate exercise increased BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP receptor 2, pSmad-5, and inhibitor of DNA binding protein-1 expression in the superficial zone chondrocytes and suppressed cartilage degeneration, osteophyte growth, SB damage, and osteoclast-mediated SB resorption. However, intense exercise had little effect on BMP expression and even caused progression of these osteoarthritis (OA) changes. Gremlin-1 injection following moderate exercise caused progression of the PTOA development down to the level of the non-exercise DMM-operated knee.Exercise regulated cartilage-SB PTOA development in DMM-operated knees in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings shed light on the important role of BMP expression in superficial zone chondrocytes in attenuation of PTOA development following physiological exercise loading.

Zeiss Airyscan 880 ″super-resolution" or "high-resolution" imaging was done with very low levels of illumination (0.009% laser power). In cellular areas imaged every 9 s (ROI or regions of interest), transient depolarizations of variable amplitudes occurred at increasing rates for the first 30 min. The time to first depolarization events was 8.4 min (±1.1 SEM n = 21 cells). At longer times, essentially permanent and irreversible depolarizations occurred at an increasing fraction of all events. In other cellular areas surrounding the ROI,  were rarely illuminated (once per 5 min) and virtually no permanent depolarization events occurred for over 1 h of imaging. These findings suggest that photon stress due to the imaging itself plays an important role in the generation of both the transient mPTP opening events as well as the permanent mPTP opening events. Consistent with the evidence that photon "stress" in  loaded with virtually any photon absorbing substance, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1-5], we show that cyclosporine-A (CsA, 10 μM) and the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 10 mM), reduced the number of events by 80% and 93% respectively. Furthermore, CsA and NAC treatment led to the virtual disappearance of permanent depolarization events. Nevertheless, all transient depolarization events in any condition (control, CsA and NAC) appeared to repolarize with a similar half-time of 30 ± 6 s (n = 478) at 37 °C. Further experiments showed quantitatively similar results in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, using a different confocal system, and different photon absorbing reagent (TMRE; tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester). In these experiments, using modest power (1% laser power) transient depolarization events were seen in only 8 out of 23 cells while with higher power (8%), all cells showed transient events, which align with the level of photon stress being the driver of the effect. Together, our findings suggest that photon-induced ROS is sufficient to cause depolarization events of individual  in quiescent cells; without electrical or mechanical activity to stimulates mitochondrial metabolism, and without raising the mitochondrial matrix Ca. In a broad context, these findings neither support nor deny the relevance or occurrence of ΔΨ depolarization events in specific putatively physiologic mitochondrial behaviors such as MitoFlashes [6,7] or MitoWinks [8]. Instead, our findings raise a caution with regards to the physiological and pathophysiological functions attributed to singular ΔΨ depolarization events when those functions are investigated using photon absorbing substances. Nevertheless, using photon stress as a tool ("Optical Stress-Probe"), we can extract information on the activation, reversibility, permanency and kinetics of mitochondrial depolarization. These data may provide new information on mPTP, help identify the mPTP protein complex, and establish the physiological function of the mPTP protein complex and their links to MitoFlashes and MitoWinks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The X-ray crystal structure of [Bi(DO3A)] evidences the octa-coordination of the Bi(iii) ion, which is directly coordinated to the four nitrogen atoms of the cyclen unit and three  atoms of the carboxylate groups. The octa-coordination is completed by an  atom of a neighboring carboxylate group, which bridges Bi(iii) ions thanks to μ2-η1:η1 coordination, resulting in the formation of a coordination polymer.

A computational DFT study indicates that the 6s2 lone pair of Bi(iii) is stereochemically active in [Bi(DO3A)] and most of the cyclen-based complexes reported in the literature. Depending on the spatial arrangement of the donor atoms of the ligand the lone pair points in different directions, so that Bi(iii) can easily accommodate different coordination environments.

Firstly, our data demonstrate a rank order of potency of domoate>kainate>ATPA>alpha-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalolyl)propionic acid Secondly, we confirm that the effects of ATPA are not mediated indirectly via the activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (i.e. either GABA(A) or GABA(B)). Thirdly, we show that the small increase in conductance induced by ATPA is insufficient to account for the depression of monosynaptic inhibition. Fourthly, we show that the effects of ATPA on IPSPs are antagonised by the GLU(K5)-selective antagonist (3S, 4aR, , 8aR)-6-(4-carboxyphenyl)methyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY382884). However, LY382884 is less potent as an antagonist of the effects of ATPA on IPSPs compared to its depressant effect on EPSPs.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486437>Small synthetic hyaluronan disaccharides afford neuroprotection in brain ischemia-related models.</a></h2><p>High molecular weight (HMW) glycosaminoglycanes of the extracellular matrix have been implicated in tissue repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate if small synthetic hyaluronan disaccharides with different degrees of sulfation (methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-O-sulfo-α-d-glucopyranoside, sodium salt (di0S), methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-6-di-O-sulfo-α-d-glucopyranoside, disodium salt (di6S) and methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-α-d-glucopyranoside, trisodium salt (di4,)) could improve cell survival in in vitro and in vivo brain ischemia-related models. Rat hippocampal slices subjected to  and glucose deprivation and a photothrombotic stroke model in mice were used. The three hyaluran disaccharides, incubated during the  and glucose deprivation (15min) and re-oxygenation periods (120min), reduced cell death of hippocampal slices measured as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction, being the most potent di4,; in contrast, high molecular hyaluronan was ineffective. The protective actions of di4, against  and glucose deprivation were related to activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, reduction of p65 translocation to the nucleus, inhibition of inducible nitric oxide oxidase induction and reactive  species production, and to an increase in glutathione levels. Administered 1h post-stroke, di4, reduced cerebral infarct size and improved motor activity in the beam walk test. In conclusion, di4, affords neuroprotection in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic neuronal damage. Our results suggest that its neuroprotective effect could be exerted through its capability to reduce oxidative stress during ischemia. Its small molecular size makes it a more potential druggable drug to target the brain as compared with its HMW parent compound hyaluronan.Copyright © 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, clear proofs of biodegradation were only presented for Comamonas testosteroni KT5 and Rhodococcus sp. OCT10. Hence, this study aims on the isolation of additional strains and their characterization in pilot-scale biotrickling filters. Three strains named OCT2, OCT9, and OCT14 of the genus Rhodococcus were isolated, able to mineralize gaseous 2-chlorotoluene like the previously isolated strain Rhodococcus sp. OCT10. The performance levels of these strains were tested in four biotrickling filters each containing 18.8 L of polyurethane foam package, showing elimination capacities of carbon (C) of 30.9 (OCT2), 30.1 (OCT9), 32.2 (OCT10), and 3.9 g C·m·h (OCT14) at an average crude gas level of 397.6 mg C·m and an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 22.6 s. Since OCT10 showed the highest performance levels, this strain was characterized in a second biotrickling filter configuration at long-term conditions of 985 days, varying crude gas levels, EBRT and nutrient supply. Chloride balancing showed a recovery of 94.4% of 2-chlorotoluene eliminated out of the gas phase, pointing out mineralization of 2-chlorotoluene. German emission limit values were met at crude gas levels up to 750 mg C·m at EBRTs of 120 s or higher. The maximum elimination capacity was 51.2 g C·m·h at a specific freight of 51.9 g C·m·h and an EBRT of 254 s. Performance levels were strongly boosted by addition of ammonia as nutrient and stabilized at efficiency levels higher than 90% at a feed rate of 4 g ammonium sulfate per week and 100 L of package volume. Repetitive monitoring of the established 2-chlorotoluene degrading community by BOX-PCR fingerprinting revealed a high long-term stability of OCT10, underlining its suitability in this kind of application.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, visible micro channel methods [micro channel array flow analyzer (MC-FAN)] have been developed to clinically evaluate blood rheology. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to clarify the factors important for impairment of blood rheology in obese subjects using MC-FAN.One hundred and fifty-nine obese subjects and 100 non-obese subjects with no history of cardiovascular diseases were enrolled. Blood passage time (BPT) was measured using MC-FAN and relationships between BPT and various clinical parameters were examined.BPT was significantly higher in obese subjects than in non-obese subjects (obesity vs. non-obesity: 62.8 ± 17.9s vs. 54.1 ± 14., p<0.001); however, there were no significant relationships between BPT and body mass index or waist circumference in obese subjects. BPT was significantly related to systolic blood pressure levels (r=0.21; p<0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations (r=0.37; p<0.001), a marker of inflammation, and derivatives of reactive  metabolites test (r=0.38; p<0.001), a marker of oxidative stress, smoking, and exercise habits in obese subjects.

GAG were isolated from chicken eggshell membranes and calcified shells. Disaccharide compositional analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All 4 groups of GAG - hyaluronan (HA), keratan sulfate (KS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), and heparan sulfate (HS) - were detected in shell membranes and in calcified shells. HA was the most plentiful GAG in shell membranes, and CS was the most abundant in calcified shells. The CS present, in both membranes and calcified shells, consisted primarily of , 4S, and 0S disaccharides. Neither 4S6S nor 2S was detectable in shell components. Small amounts of 2S4S were detected in membranes and TriS, and 2S4S and 2S6S were detected in calcified shells. HS in calcified shells contained all disaccharides except for 2S6S. In shell membranes, HS contained primarily NS and 0S as well as small amounts of TriS, NS2S, NS6S, and , but neither 2S6S nor 2S was detectable. The disaccharide composition of membrane CS, as well as membrane and calcified shell HS, were very similar in all eggshells. In contrast, the composition of calcified shell CS disaccharides was highly variable. In membranes, both HA and KS content showed a correlation with egg shape index. The 4S content correlated with eggshell strength, and 0S correlated with eggshell strength and calcified shell thickness. HS content and its disaccharide composition showed no apparent correlation to properties of calcified shells. In calcified shells, only HS  correlated with egg shape index.

The primary difficulty in mapping genes is determining which chromosome carries the gene of interest. Several approaches have been developed to address this problem, each with advantages and disadvantages. Here we describe a new approach called multiple bulked segregant analysis (MBSA). A set of 423 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were selected based on profile simplicity, frequency of polymorphism, and distribution across the wheat genome. SSR primers were preloaded in 384-well PCR plates with each primer occupying 16 wells. In practice, 14 wells are reserved for "mini-bulks" that are equivalent to four gametes (e.g. two F(2) individuals) comprised of individuals from a segregated population that have a known homozygous genotype for the gene of interest. The remaining two wells are reserved for the parents of the population. Each well containing a mini-bulk can have one of three allele compositions for each SSR: only the allele from one parent, only the allele from the other parent, or both alleles. Simulation experiments were performed to determine the pattern of mini-bulk allele composition that would indicate putative linkage between the SSR in question and the gene of interest. As a test case, MBSA was employed to locate an unidentified stem rust resistance (Sr) gene in the winter wheat cultivar Norin 40. A doubled haploid (DH) population (n = 267) was produced from hybrids of the cross LMPG-/Norin 40. The DH population segregated for a single gene (χ (1:1) (2) = 0.093, p = 0.76) for resistance to Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici race LCBN. Four resistant DH lines were included in each of the 14 mini-bulks for screening. The Sr gene was successfully located to the long arm of chromosome 2D using MBSA. Further mapping confirmed the chromosome location and revealed that the Sr gene was located in a linkage block that may represent an alien translocation. The new Sr gene was designated as Sr54.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755453>Single molecule studies of antibody-antigen interaction strength versus intra-molecular antigen stability.</a></h2><p>We investigated molecular recognition of antibodies to membrane-antigens and extraction of the antigens out of membranes at the single molecule level.

Gas laser regimes with metastable Ne, Ar, and Kr atoms have been investigated, while studies of RGLs based on metastable Xe are sparse. In this work, when a strong excitation laser (2.92 mJ/pulse, 7.44 × 10 W/cm) was applied to excite Xe atoms from the ground state to the 6p[1/2] state, an interesting phenomenon emerged: An intense fluorescence of 980 nm (6p[1/2]-[3/2]) was produced. However, when the  of excitation laser was decreased to 0.50 mJ/pulse (1.27 × 10 W/cm), the fluorescence of 980 nm became very weak. Besides, lifetime and decay rate constant of the 6p[1/2] state under the condition of E = 2.92 mJ are significantly different from either those measured by other groups or those of E = 0.50 mJ. These phenomena indicate that the high  of excitation laser should trigger some new kinetic mechanisms. Further works identified that the new kinetic mechanism is the MIR ASE of 3408 nm (6p[1/2]-'[1/2]). The mechanisms are proposed as follows. Substantial 6p[1/2] atoms are produced by laser excitation. Then, the ASE of 3408 nm (6p[1/2]-'[1/2]) is quickly produced to populate substantial '[1/2] atoms. The '[1/2] atoms can readily arrive at the 6p[1/2] states through collision by virtue of the small  difference (84 cm) and high collision rate constant of the transition from the '[1/2] state to the 6p[1/2] state.

In this regard, oxyfluorides appear unsuitable because of the higher electronegativity of fluorine. Here we show an exceptional case, an anion-ordered pyrochlore oxyfluoride PbTiOF that has a small band gap (ca. 2.4 eV). With suitable modification of PbTiOF by promoters such as platinum nanoparticles and a binuclear ruthenium(II) complex, PbTiOF worked as a stable photocatalyst for visible-light-driven H evolution and CO reduction. Density functional theory calculations have revealed that the unprecedented visible-light-response of PbTiOF arises from strong interaction between Pb- and O-2p orbitals, which is enabled by a short Pb-O bond in the pyrochlore lattice due to the fluorine substitution.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25995077>Demonstration of glucose-6-phosphate hydrogen 5 enrichment from deuterated water by transaldolase-mediated exchange alone.</a></h2><p>Enrichment of glucose position 5 (H5) from deuterated water ((2)H2O) is widely used for quantifying .

Despite clear advances in the prevention and treatment of CVD, the impact of T2DM on CVD outcome remains high and continues to escalate. Available evidence indicates that the risk of macrovascular complications increases with the severity of hyperglycemia, thus suggesting that the relation between  disturbances and vascular damage is approximately linear. Although current antidiabetic drugs are highly effective for the management of hyperglycemia, most T2DM patients remain exposed to a substantial and concrete risk of CVD. Over the last decade many glucose-lowering agents have been tested for their safety and efficacy in T2DM with CVD. Noteworthy, most of these studies failed to show a significant benefit in terms of CV morbidity and mortality, despite intensive glycemic control. The recent trials Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME); Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN-6); Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER); and Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke (IRIS) have shed some light on this important clinical issue, thus showing a convincing effect of empagliflozin, liraglutide, and pioglitazone on CVD outcomes.

This is hypothesized to be due to retained circulating maternal estrogens decreasing the structural density of collagen; however, this has not been fully tested. Cartilage elasticity is dependent on the concentration of the proteoglycan aggregate, and hyaluronic acid, a constituent of proteoglycan aggregate, is increased by estrogens. Nonsurgical correction of these deformities in more developed patients has the potential to change clinical practice and eliminate surgical risks. Previous studies have demonstrated preliminary promise with the use of injectable estrogen to treat auricular deformities. For this study, we have validated an animal model and demonstrated the feasibility of a more therapeutically appropriate topical estrogen treatment in restoring neonatal plasticity of auricular cartilage.Ears of 12 New Zealand rabbits were folded and splinted, and assigned an experimental group (estrogen, placebo, and untreated control) (n = 8 ears). Treatment ears received topical estrogen or placebo cream daily for 4 weeks, whereas controls received no treatment. The splints were removed following 2 additional weeks, and photographs were taken to calculate the retained fold angle. Biopsies were also taken for histologic analysis.The 8 control ears showed a statistically increased angle from a folded orientation of 46.6 degrees to return of ear position to a normal upright position of 151.2 degrees by the fourth day after splint removal. Both the estrogen-treated and placebo-treated ears responded to splinting with maintained folding (36.6 degrees and 32.5 degrees, respectively). Auricular cartilage thickness trended toward thicker in ears treated with estrogen, consistent with increased matrix components.Estrogen and placebo treatment with splinting of ears lead to a significant change to the cartilage configuration, validating the model. The results of this study are very encouraging and provide the foundation for a noninvasive therapeutic approach for correcting auricular deformities. Future work will include a more detailed mechanistic study evaluating the dosing of estrogen and the efficiency of dermal penetration as well as evaluating the long-term outcomes and molecular mechanism-associated cartilaginous responses to estrogen.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443655>Imaging of mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics in astrocytes using cell-specific -targeted GCaMP5G/: mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and cytosolic Ca2+ availability via the endoplasmic reticulum store.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial Ca(2+) plays a critical physiological role in cellular energy metabolism and signaling, and its overload contributes to various pathological conditions including neuronal apoptotic death in neurological diseases. Live cell mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging is an important approach to understand mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics. Recently developed GCaMP genetically-encoded Ca(2+) indicators provide unique opportunity for high sensitivity/resolution and cell type-specific mitochondrial Ca(2+) imaging. In the current study, we implemented cell-specific mitochondrial targeting of GCaMP5G/ (mito-GCaMP5G/) and used two-photon microscopy to image astrocytic and neuronal mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics in culture, revealing Ca(2+) uptake mechanism by these organelles in response to cell stimulation. Using these mitochondrial Ca(2+) indicators, our results show that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in individual  in cultured astrocytes and neurons can be seen after stimulations by ATP and glutamate, respectively. We further studied the dependence of mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics on cytosolic Ca(2+) changes following ATP stimulation in cultured astrocytes by simultaneously imaging mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca(2+) increase using mito-GCaMP5G and a synthetic organic Ca(2+) indicator, x-Rhod-1, respectively. Combined with molecular intervention in Ca(2+) signaling pathway, our results demonstrated that the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is tightly coupled with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the activation of G protein-coupled receptors. The current study provides a novel approach to image mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics as well as Ca(2+) interplay between the endoplasmic reticulum and , which is relevant for neuronal and astrocytic functions in health and disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The mice brain and plasma were collected at 0.25, 1, and 3 h and were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. The K(p) determined from discrete dosing versus cassette dosing in the wild-type mice were within 2-fold for all the compounds except sulfasalazine and Ko143. The brain concentrations of sulfasalazine and Ko143 and the plasma concentrations of Ko143 were below the lower limit of quantitation. In addition, the K(p) values estimated by mass spectrometry responses, namely the ratio of compound peak area to internal standard peak area, were within 2-fold of the K(p) observed from the actual concentrations. Furthermore, the ratios of K(p) in Mdr1a/1b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp1(-/-) mice versus the K(p) in the wild-type mice from cassette dosing were consistent with the ones reported in the literature where the compounds were dosed discretely.

Sessions consisted of a standardised running warm-up, followed by a 5km time trial (TT1), a one hour recovery period, then a repeat of the warm-up and 5km time trial (TT2). One session required the use of sports compression socks during the first warm-up and time trial (COMP), while the other did not (CON).The decline in run performance in CON from TT1 to TT2 was moderate and significantly greater than that experienced by runners in COMP (9., d=0.67, p<0.01). No difference was found between experimental conditions for  consumption, blood lactate or calf volume (p=0.61, 0.54, 0.64, respectively). Perceptual measures of muscle soreness, fatigue and recovery were also similar between trials (p=0.56, 1.00 & 0.61, respectively).Wearing sports compression socks during high intensity running has a positive impact on subsequent running performance.

TRAP has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer. Thus, this study set out to identify small-molecule inhibitors of TRAP activity. A microplate-based enzymatic assay for TRAP 5b was applied in a screen of 30,315 compounds, resulting in the identification of 90 primary hits. After removal of promiscuous compounds, unwanted groups, and false positives by orthogonal assays and three-concentration validation, the properties of 52 compounds were further investigated to better understand their mechanism of action. Full-concentration-response curves for these compounds were established under different enzyme concentrations and (pre)incubation times to remove compounds with inconsistent results and low potencies. Full-concentration-response curves were also performed for both isoforms, to examine isoform prevalence. Filtering led to six prioritized compounds, representing different clusters.

As treatment of infected CF patients is problematic, multiple preventive measures are taken to reduce the infection risk. Besides a stringent segregation policy to prevent patient-to-patient transmission, clinicians also advise patients to clean and disinfect their respiratory equipment on a regular basis. However, problems regarding the efficacy of several disinfection procedures for the removal and/or killing of B. cepacia complex bacteria have been reported. In order to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance of biofilm-grown Burkholderia cenocepacia cells against high concentrations of reactive  species (ROS), the present study focussed on the transcriptional response in sessile B. cenocepacia J2315 cells following exposure to high levels of H2O2 or NaOCl.The exposure to H2O2 and NaOCl resulted in an upregulation of the transcription of 315 (4.4%) and 386 (5.4%) genes, respectively. Transcription of 185 (2.6%) and 331 (4.6%) genes was decreased in response to the respective treatments. Many of the upregulated genes in the NaOCl- and H2O2-treated biofilms are involved in oxidative stress as well as general stress response, emphasizing the importance of the efficient neutralization and scavenging of ROS. In addition, multiple upregulated genes encode proteins that are necessary to repair ROS-induced cellular damage. Unexpectedly, a prolonged treatment with H2O2 also resulted in an increased transcription of multiple phage-related genes. A closer inspection of hybridisation signals obtained with probes targeting intergenic regions led to the identification of a putative  RNA.Our results reveal that the transcription of a large fraction of B. cenocepacia J2315 genes is altered upon exposure of sessile cells to ROS. These observations have highlighted that B. cenocepacia may alter several pathways in response to exposure to ROS and they have led to the identification of many genes not previously implicated in the stress response of this pathogen.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24321377>Twisting and ignoring facts on hydroxyethyl starch is not very helpful.</a></h2><p>Large randomized trials on critically ill patients have related the use of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) to negative outcomes.

Aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics are compounds in which saturated polyhydroxylated nitrogen and  heterocycles are linked by an all-carbon tether. The saturated  heterocycle has the potential to mimic the departing sugar in a glycosidase-catalysed reaction and aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics may, therefore, be more potent inhibitors of these enzymes.The scope, limitations and diastereoselectivity of the dihydroxylation of stereoisomeric 2-butyl-1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridin-3-ols is discussed. In the absence of a 6-substituent on the piperidine ring, the Upjohn (cat. OsO4, NMO, acetone-water) and Donohoe (OsO4, TMEDA, CH2Cl2) conditions allow complementary diastereoselective functionalisation of the alkene of the (2R*,3R*) diastereoisomer. However, in the presence of a 6-substituent, the reaction is largely controlled by steric effects with both reagents. The most synthetically useful protocols were exploited in the two-directional synthesis of aza-C-linked disaccharide analogues. A two-directional oxidative ring expansion was used to prepare bis-enones such as (2R,,2'S)-6-methoxy-2-(6-methoxy-3-oxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-1,6-dihydro-2H-pyridin-3-one from the corresponding difuran. Selective substitution of its N,O acetal was possible. The stereochemical outcome of a two-directional Luche reduction step was different in the two heterocyclic rings, and depended on the conformation of the ring. Finally, two-directional diastereoselective dihydroxylation yielded seven different aza-C-linked disaccharide analogues.A two-directional approach may be exploited in the synthesis of aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics. Unlike previous approaches to similar molecules, neither of the heterocyclic rings is directly derived from a sugar, allowing mimetics with unusual configurations to be prepared. The work demonstrates that highly unsymmetrical molecules may be prepared using a two directional approach.

Patient demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative descriptors were reported.

Similarly, no free proteolytic activity could be detected in the patient's serum, and serum concentrations of known protease inhibitors were normal.Complement-mediated functions, which were markedly deficient in the patient's serum, could be restored partially or completely by the addition of a 5- heat-labile beta pseudoglobulin from normal serum. The C3 proinactivator, which has these physicochemical characteristics, was also shown to be either absent or nonfunctional in the patient's serum. An unidentified  beta pseudoglobulin to which a monospecific antiserum was available was not detectable in the patient's serum. This last protein appeared not to be a complement component, nor was it the C3 inactivator or proinactivator. Finally, the substance or substances necessary for the conversion of C3b to C3c were missing from the patient's serum. The administration of 500 ml of normal plasma to the patient corrected all of his abnormalities partially or completely for as long as 17 days. The changes in C3 were dramatic; serum concentration rose from 8 to 70 mg/100 ml, and C3b could no longer be detected. A second metabolic study during this normalization period showed a decrease in fractional catabolic rate toward normal. The patient's histamine excretion was constantly elevated but increased further after a warm shower and after receiving normal plasma; at both times he had urticaria. These observations were consistent with the endogenous production of C3a and the resulting histamine release from mast cells. The inactivating mechanism for C3a was apparently intact in the patient's serum. The difference in the electrophoretic mobilities of C3b and C3c was shown as well as the electrophoretic heterogeneity of C3c. Suggestive evidence was also presented that the form of C3 with an activated combining site for red cells, previously postulated by others, is a transient C3 conversion product with an electrophoretic mobility slower than that of C3 on agarose electrophoresis.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159978>Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia.</a></h2><p>Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is associated with mortality, amputation, and impaired quality of life. These Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are focused on definition, evaluation, and management of CLTI with the goals of improving evidence-based care and highlighting critical research needs. The term CLTI is preferred over critical limb ischemia, as the latter implies threshold values of impaired perfusion rather than a continuum. CLTI is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration >2 weeks duration. Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric ) has not been established. Regenerative medicine approaches (eg, cell, gene therapies) for CLTI should be restricted to rigorously conducted randomizsed clinical trials. The GVG promotes standardization of study designs and end points for clinical trials in CLTI. The importance of multidisciplinary teams and centers of excellence for amputation prevention is stressed as a key health system initiative.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery and European Society for Vascular Surgery.

The hexacoordinate heme (Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX) or hemochrome form of holoShp (hemoShp) is stable in air in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, binds to apoHtsA with a K(d) of 120 +/- 18 microm, and transfers its heme to apoHtsA with a rate constant of 28 +/- (-1) at 25 degrees C, pH 8.0. The hemoHtsA product then autoxidizes to the hexacoordinate hemin (Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX) or hemichrome form (hemiHtsA) with an apparent rate constant of 0.017 +/- 0.002 s(-1). HemiShp also rapidly transfers hemin to apoHtsA through a hemiShp.apoHtsA complex (K(d) = 48 +/- 7 microM) at a rate approximately 40,000 times greater than the rate of simple hemin dissociation from hemiShp into solvent (k(transfer) = 43 +/- 3s(-1) versus k(-hemin) = 0.0003 +/- 0.00006 s(-1)). The rate constants for hemin binding to and dissociation from HtsA (k'(hemin) approximately 80 microm(-1) s(-1), k(-hemin) = 0.0026 +/- 0.0002 s(-1)) are 50- and 10-fold greater than the corresponding rate constants for Shp (k(hemin) approximately 1.6 microM(-1) s(-1), k(-hemin) = 0.0003 s(-1)), which implies that HtsA has a more accessible active site. However, the affinity of apoHtsA for hemin (k(hemin) approximately 31,000 microm(-1)) is roughly 5-fold greater than that of apoShp (k(hemin) approximately 5,300 microM(-1)), accounting for the net transfer from Shp to HstA. These results support a direct, rapid, and affinity-driven mechanism of heme and hemin transfer from the cell surface receptor Shp to the ATP-binding cassette transporter system.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563324>Binding Characteristics and Analgesic Effects of Mirogabalin, a Novel Ligand for the  Subunit of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels.</a></h2><p>Mirogabalin ([(1,5,6)-6-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylbicyclo[3.2.0]hept-3-en-6-yl]acetic acid), a novel ligand for the  subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, is being developed to treat pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro binding characteristics and in vivo analgesic effects of mirogabalin compared with those of pregabalin, a standard  ligand. Mirogabalin showed potent and selective binding affinities for the  subunits, while having no effects on 186 off-target proteins. Similar to pregabalin, mirogabalin did not show clear subtype selectivity (-1 vs. -2) or species differences (human vs. rat). However, in contrast to pregabalin, mirogabalin showed greater binding affinities for human -1, human -2, rat -1, and rat -2 subunits; further, it had a slower dissociation rate for the -1 subunit than the -2 subunit. Additionally, in experimental neuropathic pain models, partial sciatic nerve ligation rats and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, mirogabalin showed more potent and longer lasting analgesic effects. In safety pharmacological evaluations, mirogabalin and pregabalin inhibited rota-rod performance and locomotor activity in rats; however, the safety indices of mirogabalin were superior to those of pregabalin. In conclusion, mirogabalin shows potent and selective binding affinities for the human and rat  subunits, and slower dissociation rates for the -1 subunit than the -2 subunit. It shows potent and long-lasting analgesic effects in rat models of neuropathic pain, and wider safety margins for side effects of the central nervous system. These properties of mirogabalin can be associated with its unique binding characteristics.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28527471>The electron shuffle: Cerium influences samarium 4f orbital occupancy in heteronuclear Ce-Sm oxide clusters.</a></h2><p>The anion photoelectron (PE) spectra along with supporting results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations on SmO, SmCeO, and SmO (y = 1, 2) are reported and compared to previous results on CeO [M.

Similar to the results on CeO clusters, the PE spectra of SmO, SmCeO, and SmO (y = 1, 2) all exhibit electronic transitions to the neutral ground state at approximately 1 eV eBE. The Sm centers in SmO and SmO neutrals can be described with the 4f superconfiguration, which is analogous to CeO and CeO neutrals in which the Ce centers can be described with the 4f  superconfiguration (Z = Z - 4). The Sm center in CeSmO, in contrast, has a 4f occupancy, while the Ce center maintains the 4f  superconfiguration. The less oxidized Sm centers in both SmO and SmCeO have 4f  occupancies. The 4f subshell occupancy results in relatively weak Sm-O bond strengths. If this extra 4f occupancy also occurs in bulk Sm-doped ceria, it may play a role in the enhanced O ionic conductivity in Sm-doped ceria. Based on the results of DFT calculations, the heteronuclear Ce-Sm oxides have molecular orbitals that are distinctly localized Sm 4f, Sm , Ce 4f, and Ce  orbitals. The relative intensity of two electronic bands in the PE spectrum of SmO exhibits an unusual photon -dependence, and the PE spectrum of SmO exhibits a photon -dependent continuum signal between two electronic transitions. Several explanations, including the high magnetic moment of these suboxide species and the presence of low-lying quasi-bound anion states, are considered.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29438888>Tricyclic pyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one scaffold derivatives: Synthesis and biological evaluation as selective BuChE inhibitors.</a></h2><p>BuChE inhibitors play important roles in treatment of patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD). A series of tricyclic pyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]benzoxazepin-5(6H)-one derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors. Some derivatives showed selective BuChE inhibitory activity, which was influenced by the volumes of the substituted groups at the C6 position and halogen substituents at the benzene ring of tricyclic scaffold. Among them, compounds 3f and 3o with dihalogen and 6-ethyl substituent showed the most potent activity (IC = 2.95, 2.04 μM, and mixed-type, non-competitive inhibition against BuChE, respectively). Eutomer (6R)-3o exhibited better BuChE inhibitory activity than ()-3o. Compound 3o exhibited nontoxic, good ADMET properties, and remarkable neuroprotective activity. Docking studies revealed the same binding orientation within the active site of target enzyme. Compound 3o was nicely bound to BuChE via three hydrogen bonds, one Alkyl interaction and three Pi-Alkyl interactions.

Raltegravir uptake, accumulation, and permeability were evaluated in vitro in (i) P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), or MRP4-overexpressing MDA-MDR1 (P-gp), HEK-ABCG2, HeLa-MRP1, or HEK-MRP4 cells, respectively; (ii) cell culture systems of the human blood-brain (hCMEC/D3), mouse blood-testicular (TM4), and human blood-intestinal (Caco-2) barriers; and (iii) rat jejunum and ileum segments using an in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model. [(3)H]Raltegravir accumulation by MDA-MDR1 (P-gp) and HEK-ABCG2-overexpressing cells was significantly enhanced in the presence of PSC833 {6-[(2S,4R,6E)-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)-3-oxo-6-octenoic acid]-7-L-valine-cyclosporine}, a P-gp inhibitor, or Ko143 [(3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester], a BCRP inhibitor, suggesting the inhibition of a P-gp- or BCRP-mediated efflux process, respectively. Furthermore, [(3)H]raltegravir accumulation by human cerebral microvessel endothelial hCMEC/D3 and mouse Sertoli TM4 cells was significantly increased by PSC833 and Ko143. In human intestinal Caco-2 cells grown on Transwell filters, PSC833, but not Ko143, significantly decreased the [(3)H]raltegravir efflux ratios. In rat intestinal segments, [(3)H]raltegravir in situ permeability was significantly enhanced by the concurrent administration of PSC833 and Ko143. In contrast, in the transporter inhibition assays, raltegravir (10 to 500 μM) did not increase the accumulation of substrate for P-gp (rhodamine-6G), BCRP ([(3)H]mitoxantrone), or MRP1 [2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)] by MDA-MDR1 (P-gp)-, HEK-ABCG2-, or HeLa-MRP1-overexpressing cells, respectively. Our data suggest that raltegravir is a substrate but not an inhibitor of the drug efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. These transporters might play a role in the restriction of raltegravir permeability across the blood-brain, blood-testicular, and blood-intestinal barriers, potentially contributing to its low tissue concentrations and/or low oral bioavailability observed in the clinic setting.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

In intravenous (IV) injection studies, imipenem/cilastatin, at 400/400mg/kg produced seizure discharges on electroencephalogram (EEG) accompanied with clonic convulsions in rats. Meropenem showed only wet dog shaking behavior at 200 and 400mg/kg. Doripenem caused no changes in the EEG and behavior in rats at 400mg/kg. Imipenem/cilastatin IV potentiated the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice at 250/250 mg/kg, while meropenem, panipenem/betamipron, cefazolin or doripenem did not cause any marked effects at up to 500 mg/kg. In mouse intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection studies, imipenem, panipenem and cefazolin induced clonic convulsions in a dose-dependent manner in mice. Doripenem and meropenem did not induce convulsions at up to 100 microg/mouse. In dog ICV injection studies, imipenem produced generalized seizure discharge with clonic convulsions at 100 microg/dog. Meropenem also produced spikes or seizure discharges at 100, 300 and 1,000 microg/dog. However, doripenem had no effects on the EEG and behavior in dogs at any doses. In in vitro binding studies, imipenem, panipenem, cefazolin and meropenem inhibited [(3)H]muscimol binding to the GABA(A) receptor in mouse brain homogenates while doripenem did not cause any inhibition at up to 10mM. In addition, doripenem had no influence on the anti-convulsant actions of valproic acid in the PTZ- or bicuculine-induced convulsive model.

Treatment should target multiple defects in T2DM and follow a patient-centered approach that considers factors beyond glycemic control, including cardiovascular risk reduction. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology and the American Diabetes Association recommend an initial approach consisting of lifestyle changes and monotherapy, preferably with metformin. Therapy choices are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, particularly effects on  and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost. Balancing management of hyperglycemia with the risk of hypoglycemia and consideration of the effects of pharmacotherapy on  figure prominently in US-based T2DM recommendations, whereas less emphasis has been placed on the ability of specific medications to affect cardiovascular outcomes. This is likely because, until recently, specific glucose-lowering agents have not been shown to affect cardiorenal outcomes. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, and the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes 6 (SUSTAIN-6) recently showed a reduction in overall cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin, liraglutide, and semaglutide treatment, respectively. Moreover, empagliflozin has become the first glucose-lowering agent indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. Results from cardiovascular outcomes trials have prompted an update to the 2017 American Diabetes Association standards of care, which now recommend consideration of empagliflozin or liraglutide for patients with suboptimally controlled long-standing T2DM and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because these agents have been shown to reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality when added to standard care.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

Hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (H6H, EC 1.14.11.11), a monomeric α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, converts (-)-hyoscyamine to its 6,7-epoxy derivative, scopolamine, in two sequential steps. In this study, H6H of Atropa belladonna (AbH6H) was cloned, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized. The catalytic efficiency of AbH6H, especially for the second oxidation, was found to be low, and this may be one of the reasons why Atropa belladonna produces less scopolamine than other species in the same family. 6,7-Dehydrohyoscyamine, a potential precursor for the last step of epoxidation, was shown not to be an obligatory intermediate in the biosynthesis of scopolamine using purified AbH6H with an in vitro (18)O labeling experiment.

More than 3000 geometry optimizations were performed to reveal the structural disorder and identify structures with the lowest energies.

The simulations of the absorption spectrum for three representative structures with lowest  reproduced the absorption shoulders observed in the experimental spectra. These shoulders are assigned to excitations having similar orbital characters and involving transitions between hybridized (Pb)/5p(I) orbitals and 6p(Pb) orbitals. The geometries of the three structures were analyzed and the effects of the inorganic frame and the CH NH  cations on the absorption properties were estimated. It was found that both changes in the inorganic frame and the CH NH  cations orientations impact the absorption spectra, by modifying the transitions energies and intensities.

As a MMP-9 inhibitor, ATIQCTPC inhibited the metastasis of LLC, and slowed the growth of the primary tumor of LLC implanted C57BL/6 in mice. The activities of ATIQCTPC to inhibit the ear edema and to decrease the serum levels of TNF-Î± and IL-8 of the mice treated with xylene were explored. The minimal effective dose of ATIQCTPC that can inhibit the primary tumour growth, prevent the metastasis of LLC and reduce the inflammatory response was 0.01 Î¼mol/kg. The minimal effective dose of ATIQCTPC inhibiting tumour growth and metastasis was 100-fold lower than that of (S)-3-acetyl- 4-oxo-4,6,7,12-tetrahydroindolo[2,3-a]quinolizine-6-carboxylic acid (ATIQC, parent compound). The minimal effective dose of ATIQCTPC inhibiting  was 110-fold lower than that of aspirin. These superiorities reflected the rationality of ATIQCTPC design.

Only a few sRNAs have been described for Pasteurellaceae pathogens and no in-depth analysis of sRNAs has been described for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, responsible for considerable losses in the swine industry. To search for sRNAs in A. pleuropneumoniae, we developed a strategy for the computational analysis of the bacterial genome by using four algorithms with different approaches, followed by experimental validation. The coding strand and expression of 17 out of 23 RNA candidates were confirmed by Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. Among them, two are likely riboswitches, three are housekeeping regulatory RNAs, two are the widely studied GcvB and  sRNAs, and 10 are putative novel trans-acting sRNAs, never before described for any bacteria. The latter group has several potential mRNA targets, many of which are involved with virulence, stress resistance, or , and connect the sRNAs in a complex gene regulatory network. The sRNAs identified are well conserved among the Pasteurellaceae that are evolutionarily closer to A. pleuropneumoniae and/or share the same host. Our results show that the combination of newly developed computational programs can be successfully utilized for the discovery of novel sRNAs and indicate an intricate system of gene regulation through sRNAs in A. pleuropneumoniae and in other Pasteurellaceae, thus providing clues for novel aspects of virulence that will be explored in further studies.© 2016 Rossi et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30414409>The Accumulation of Heparan Sulfate S-Domains in Kidney Transthyretin Deposits Accelerates Fibril Formation and Promotes Cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p>The highly sulfated domains of heparan sulfate (HS), alias HS S-domains, are made up of repeated trisulfated disaccharide units [iduronic acid (2S)-glucosamine (NS, )] and are selectively remodeled by extracellular endoglucosamine 6-sulfatases (Sulfs). Although HS S-domains are critical for signal transduction of several growth factors, their roles in amyloidoses are not yet fully understood. Herein, we found HS S-domains in the kidney of a patient with transthyretin amyloidosis. In in vitro assays with cells stably expressing human Sulfs, heparin, a structural analog of HS S-domains, promoted aggregation of transthyretin in an HS S-domain-dependent manner. Interactions of cells with transthyretin fibrils and cytotoxicity of these fibrils also depended on HS S-domains at the cell surface. Furthermore, glypican-5, encoded by the susceptibility gene for nephrotic syndrome GPC5, was found to be accumulated in the transthyretin amyloidosis kidney. Our study, thus, provides a novel insight into the pathologic roles of HS S-domains in amyloidoses, and we propose that enzymatic remodeling of HS chains by Sulfs may offer an effective approach to inhibiting formation and cytotoxicity of amyloid fibrils.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The HS sulfation pattern influences signaling events at the cell surface, which are critical for interactions with growth factors and their receptors. SULFs are overexpressed in several types of human tumors, but their role in  is still unclear because their molecular mechanism has not been fully explored and understood. To further investigate the functions of these sulfatases in tumorigenesis, stable overexpression models of these genes were generated in the colorectal  cells, Caco-2 and HCT-116. Importantly, mimicking overexpression of these sulfatases resulted in increased viability and proliferation, and augmented cell migration. These effects were reverted by shRNA-mediated knockdown of SULF1 or SULF2 and by the addition of unfractionated heparin. Detailed structural analysis of HS from cells overexpressing SULFs showed reduction in the trisulfated disaccharide UA(2S)-GlcNS() and corresponding increase in UA(2S)-GlcNS disaccharide, as well as an unexpected rise in less common disaccharides containing GlcNAc() residues. Moreover,  cells transfected with SULFs demonstrated increased Wnt signaling. In summary, SULF1 or SULF2 overexpression contributes to colorectal  cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.This study reveals that sulfatases have oncogenic effects in  cells, suggesting an important role for these enzymes in  progression.©2014 American Association for  Research.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22986888>One dodecahedral bismuth(III) complex derived from 2-acetylpyridine N(4)-pyridylthiosemicarbazone: synthesis, crystal structure and biological evaluation.</a></h2><p>One dodecahedral bismuth(III) complex [Bi(HL)(NO(3))(3)] (1) (HL = 2-acetylpyridine N(4)-pyridylthiosemicarbazone) has been synthesized and structurally characterized.

Ginger extract (GE) confers significant health-promoting benefits owing to complex additive and/or synergistic interactions between its bioactive constituents. Recently, we showed that preservation of natural "milieu" confers superior anticancer activity on GE over its constituent phytochemicals, 6-gingerol (6G), 8-gingerol (8 G), 10-gingerol (10 G) and 6-shogaol (), through enterohepatic recirculation. Here we further evaluate and compare the effects of GE and its major bioactive constituents on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity in human liver microsomes by monitoring metabolites of CYP-specific substrates using LC/MS/MS detection methods. Our data demonstrate that individual gingerols are potent inhibitors of CYP isozymes, whereas GE exhibits a much higher half-maximal inhibition value, indicating no possible herb-drug interactions. However, GE's inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 reflects additive interactions among the constituents. In addition, studies performed to evaluate transporter-mediated intestinal efflux using Caco-2 cells revealed that GE and its phenolics are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Intriguingly, however, 10 G and  were not detected in the receiver compartment, indicating possible biotransformation across the Caco-2 monolayer. These data strengthen the notion that an interplay of complex interactions among ginger phytochemicals when fed as whole extract dictates its bioactivity highlighting the importance of consuming whole foods over single agents.

The least follow-up time was 1 year. Medical documentations were in respect of patient's baseline characteristics, associated history, presence of comorbidities, follow-up time, and condition of wounds. Patients were divided into success group (healed or healing with wound reduction), stagnate group, and failure group (amputation or infection, need in-hospital medical service) in accordance with the treatment response of wounds. χ Test, Fisher exact test, and 1-way analysis of variance were used for variables in 3-group comparison, whereas Student t test was applied in 2-group comparison. The predictive factors with P value less than 0.1 were further investigated using the model of univariate logistic regression.With 3-group stratification according to treatment response-failure (n = 8), stagnate (n = 22), and success (n = 70)-the occurrence rate of retinopathy was higher in the treatment stagnate group (42.1%) than in the treatment failure (14.3%) and success groups (12.5%; P = 0.019); the rate of previous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) history was higher in the treatment failure group (25%) than in the treatment stagnate (4.8%) and success groups (1.5%; P = 0.020). With 2-group stratification-failure (n = 8) versus nonfailure (n = 92), and success (n = 70) versus nonsuccess (n = 30)-PTA history was strongly associated with treatment failure (odds ratio [OR], 14.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-120.32; P = 0.014), whereas retinopathy (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.65; P = 0.006) was the major negative predictor for treatment success.

Regnault grades 2 and 3 ptotic breasts feature significant mastectomy flap redundancy that may be incorporated into the reconstruction. This allows surgeons to use patients' de-epithelialized inferior dermal pedicle instead of ADM.All consecutive SSM patients with Regnault grade 2 or 3 ptosis who underwent Passot-type immediate breast reconstruction (IBBR) with tissue expanders (TEs) and de-epithelialized inferior dermal pedicle without an ADM were included.

Operative times for Passot-type IBBR was 124.3 ± 37.7 versus 92.5 ± 27.9 minutes (P = 0.0001) for submuscular TE placement with ADM. The operative technique is described in detail. There were 8 TE explantations (21.1%) included: intractable infection (10.5%; n = 4), symptomatic capsular contracture (7.9%; n = 3), and spontaneous TE deflation (2.6%; n = 1).

The gene encodes a protein of 52.9 kDa, named AmBgl-LP, which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically and structurally characterized. Although AmBgl-LP hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPβG) and the natural substrate cellobiose, it showed higher specificity for pNPβG (k/K = 6 s·mM) than cellobiose (k/K = 0.6 s·mM).

The discovery of novel intermetallic compounds can enhance understanding of the chemical principles that govern structural stability and chemical bonding as well as finding new applications. Valence electron-poor polar intermetallics with valence electron concentrations (VECs) between 2.0 and 3.0 e/atom show a plethora of unprecedented and fascinating structural motifs and bonding features. Therefore, establishing simple structure-bonding-property relationships is especially challenging for this compound class because commonly accepted valence electron counting rules are inappropriate. During our efforts to find quasicrystals and crystalline approximants by valence electron tuning near 2.0 e/atom, we observed that compositions close to those of quasicrystals are exceptional sources for unprecedented valence electron-poor polar intermetallics, e.g., CaAuIn containing (AuIn) wavy layers, LiMgCuGa adopting a type IV clathrate framework, and ScMgCuGa that is incommensurately modulated. In particular, exploratory syntheses of AAuT (A = Ca, Sr, Ba and T = Ge, Sn) phases led to interesting bonding features for Au, such as columns, layers, and lonsdaleite-type tetrahedral frameworks. Overall, the breadth of Au-rich polar intermetallics originates, in part, from significant relativistics effect on the valence electrons of Au, effects which result in greater /5d orbital mixing, a small effective metallic radius, and an enhanced Mulliken electronegativity, all leading to ultimate enhanced binding with nearly all metals including itself. Two other successful strategies to mine electron-poor polar intermetallics include lithiation and "cation-rich" phases. Along these lines, we have studied lithiated Zn-rich compounds in which structural complexity can be realized by small amounts of Li replacing Zn atoms in the parent binary compounds CaZn, CaZn, and CaZn; their phase formation and bonding schemes can be rationalized by Fermi surface-Brillouin zone interactions between nearly free-electron states. "Cation-rich", electron-poor polar intermetallics have emerged using rare earth metals as the electropositive ("cationic") component together metal/metalloid clusters that mimic the backbones of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, which give evidence of extensive electronic delocalization and multicenter bonding. Thus, we can identify three distinct, valence electron-poor, polar intermetallic systems that have yielded unprecedented phases adopting novel structures containing complex clusters and intriguing bonding characteristics. In this Account, we summarize our recent specific progress in the developments of novel Au-rich BaAl-type related structures, shown in the "gold-rich grid", lithiation-modulated Ca-Li-Zn phases stabilized by different bonding characteristics, and rare earth-rich polar intermetallics containing unprecedented hydrocarbon-like planar Co-Ge metal clusters and pronounced delocalized multicenter bonding. We will focus mainly on novel structural motifs, bonding analyses, and the role of valence electrons for phase stability.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28653377>Effects of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42 vs. Ringer's acetate on cytokine levels in severe sepsis.</a></h2><p>The Scandinavian Starch for Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock () trial showed increased 90-day mortality with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.42 vs. Ringer's acetate. To explore the underlying pathophysiology, we compared early changes in plasma cytokine concentrations between patients resuscitated with HES vs. Ringer's acetate.In a subgroup of 226 patients from the  trial, we calculated delta plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 from randomization to day 2. We used multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to assess differences between the groups and associations between delta cytokine concentrations and 90-day mortality, respectively.Baseline characteristics and day 2 mortality were comparable between the groups. We observed similar delta cytokine concentrations in the HES vs. Ringer's group (mean difference in delta TNF-α: -1.5 pg/ml (95% CI, -4.9 to 1.9), P = 0.39; IL-6: 36.0 pg/ml (-24.1 to 96.1), P = 0.24; IL-10: -3.9 pg/ml (-21.1 to 28.9), P = 0.76). In all included patients, we observed a linear relationship between increases in TNF-α and 90-day mortality (P = 0.005).Resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 vs. Ringer's acetate did not appear to affect plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 or IL-10 differently during the first days after randomization into the  trial. In the overall cohort, increases in TNF-α were associated with increased 90-day mortality. Although interpretation should be done with caution, it seems unlikely that the increased mortality observed with the use HES in the  trial is signalled by early changes in three biomarkers of systemic inflammation.© 2017 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

To tube, or not to tube, that is the question!</a></h2><p>Many standard trauma management guidelines advocate the early use of endotracheal intubation (ETI) and positive pressure ventilation as key treatment interventions in hemorrhagic shock. The evidence for using these airway and ventilation strategies to manage a circulation problem is unclear. The potentially harmful effects of drug-assisted intubation and positive pressure ventilation include reduced cardiac output, apnea, hypoxia, hypocapnea (due to inadvertent hyperventilation), and unnecessarily prolonged on-scene times. Conversely, the beneficial effects of spontaneous negative pressure ventilation on cardiac output are well described. Few studies, however, have attempted to explore the potential advantages of a strategy of delayed intubation and ventilation (together with a policy of aggressive volume replacement) in shocked trauma patients. Given the lack of evidence, the decision making around how, when, and where to subject shocked trauma patients to intubation and positive pressure ventilation remains complex. If providers choose to delay intubation, they must have the appropriate skills to safely manage the airway and recognize the need for subsequent intervention. If they decide to perform intubation and positive pressure ventilation, they must understand the potential risks and how best to minimize them. We suggest that for patients with hemorrhagic shock who do not have a compromised airway and who are able to maintain adequate  saturation (or mentation if monitoring is unreliable), a strategy of delayed intubation should be strongly encouraged.Review article, level IV.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452833>Neoadjuvant Therapy Combined With Oncoplastic Reduction for High-Stage Breast Cancer Patients.</a></h2><p>Oncoplastic surgery has been shown to be a good alternative to breast conservation surgery (BCS) alone for patients with breast cancer.

The prescription of exercise (40 min/session, 3 times/week) was tailored at workload corresponding to ∼90% individual anaerobic threshold (AT). EP improved significantly by ∼10% peak values of  consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR). Furthermore, in response to steady state workload at 90% AT, EP shortened the time constant of VO2, HR and the ratio VO2/HR (reflecting arterio-venous O2 concentration difference) by ∼. EP also decreased the elastic respiratory work due to a change in breathing pattern implying a larger contribution of respiratory rate, at the expense of tidal volume during exercise hyperventilation. In all subjects the perceived fatigue (Borg) decreased after training. This study supports a positive effect of a mild EP for the adaptive response of the  chain to face metabolic needs compatible with daily life in patients affected by metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the extent to which this altered P(O)(2)mv during contractions is associated with prolongated muscle metabolic recovery is not known. We tested the hypothesis that the aging-induced speeding of the P(O)(2)mv on-kinetics would presage slowed P(O)(2)mv off-kinetics. The spinotrapezius muscle was exposed in six young (6-8 months) and seven old (26-28 months) male Fischer 344xBrown Norway F1-hybrid rats. The P(O)(2)mv kinetic profile was measured via phosphorescence quenching at rest, during electrically stimulated contractions (1Hz, 7-9V, 2ms pulse duration, 180s), and throughout recovery (180s). Aged rats which evidenced faster P(O)(2)mv on-kinetics (reduced mean response time (MRTon), young: 27.3+/-3., old: 19.2+/-1.; P<0.05) exhibited markedly slowed P(O)(2)mv off-kinetics (increased MRToff, young: 46.5+/-5.9s, old: 84.8+/-7.9s; P<0.05). Accordingly, a greater degree of P(O)(2)mv on-off asymmetry (MRToff-MRTon) in the aged muscle was observed (young: 19.1+/-4.5s, old: 65.6+/-8.; P<0.01). We conclude that aging-induced speeding of the P(O)(2)mv on-kinetics does indeed presage a slowed P(O)(2)mv off-kinetics, which likely compromises muscle metabolic recovery and may reduce subsequent contractile performance. Moreover, the greater degree of P(O)(2)mv on-off asymmetry in the aged muscle suggests a mechanistic link between impaired microvascular oxygenation and altered muscle metabolic responses during exercise transitions.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589238>An expanded taxonomy of hepatitis C virus genotype 6: Characterization of 22 new full-length viral genomes.</a></h2><p>We characterized the full-length genomes of 22 hepatitis C virus genotype 6 (HCV-6) isolates: 10 from Vietnam (classified into subtypes 6e, 6h, 6p, 6r, , and 6u), one from China (confirmed as a new subtype 6xd), and 11 from the Lao PDR (representing a new subtype 6xe plus eight novel variants).

It is the seventh enzyme of the shikimate pathway, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic metabolites from glucose. The chorismate synthase reaction involves a 1,4-elimination with unusual anti-stereochemistry and requires a reduced flavin cofactor. The substrate analogue ()-6-fluoro-5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of Neurospora crassa chorismate synthase (Balasubramanian, S., Davies, G. M., Coggins, J. R., and Abell, C. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 8945-8946). We have shown that this analogue is converted to 6-fluorochorismate by Escherichia coli chorismate synthase at a rate 2 orders of magnitude slower than the normal substrate. The decreased rate of reaction is consistent with the destabilization of an allylic cationic intermediate. The formation of chorismate and 6-fluorochorismate involves a common protein-bound flavin intermediate although the fluoro substituent does influence the spectral characteristics of this intermediate. The fluoro substituent also decreased the rate of decay of the flavin intermediate by 280 times. These results are consistent with the antimicrobial activity of ()-6-fluoroshikimate not being mediated by the inhibition of chorismate synthase but by the inhibition of 4-aminobenzoic acid synthesis as previously proposed (Davies, G.

In addition, the increase of the anticoagulant activity was accompanied by the increasing of the carboxyl groups and the content of this acidic substituent seems to be more important than its positioning.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, for ABCG2, there is no inhibitor proven to be specific to that transporter alone at the blood-brain . Ko143 [[(3S,,12aS)-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a-octahydro-9-methoxy-6-(2-methylpropyl)-1,4-dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4- b]indole-3-propanoic acid 1,1-dimethylethyl ester], a nontoxic analog of fungal toxin fumitremorgin C, is a potent inhibitor of ABCG2, although its specificity in mouse and human systems is unclear. This study examined the selectivity of Ko143 using human embryonic kidney cell lines transfected with ABCG2, ABCB1, or ABCC1 in several in vitro assays. The stability of Ko143 in rat plasma was measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Our results show that, in addition to being a potent inhibitor of ABCG2, at higher concentrations (≥1 μM) Ko143 also has an effect on the transport activity of both ABCB1 and ABCC1. Furthermore, Ko143 was found to be unstable in rat plasma. These findings indicate that Ko143 lacks specificity for ABCG2 and this should be taken into consideration when using Ko143 for both in vitro and in vivo experiments.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526180>Introduction.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20678666>Enhanced  sensing properties of Pt(II) complex and dye entrapped core-shell silica nanoparticles embedded in sol-gel matrix.</a></h2><p>This paper presents a highly sensitive  sensor that comprises an optical fiber coated at one end with platinum(II) meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (PtTFPP) and PtTFPP entrapped core-shell silica nanoparticles embedded in an n-octyltriethoxysilane (Octyl-triEOS)/tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS) composite xerogel. The sensitivity of the optical  sensor is quantified in terms of the ratio I(0)/I(100), where I(0) and I(100) represent the detected fluorescence intensities in pure nitrogen and pure  environments, respectively. The experimental results show that the  sensor has a sensitivity (I(0)/I(100)) of 166. The response time was 1.3s when switching from pure nitrogen to pure , and 18. when switching in the reverse direction. The experimental results show that compared to  sensors based on PtTFPP, PtOEP, or Ru(dpp)(3)(2+) dyes, the proposed optical fiber  sensor has the highest sensitivity. In addition to the increased surface area per unit mass of the sensing surface, the dye entrapped in the core of silica nanoparticles also increases the sensitivity because a substantial number of aerial  molecules penetrate the porous silica shell. The dye entrapped core-shell nanoparticles is more prone to  quenching.Copyright  2010 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to simulate the deposition distribution of both components of this drug within the airways based on realistic airflow measurements. Breathing parameters of 25 healthy adults (11 females and 14 males) were acquired while inhaling through Turbuhaler(®). Individual specific emitted doses and particle size distributions of Symbicort(®) Turbuhaler(®) were determined. A self-developed particle deposition model was adapted and validated to simulate the deposition of budesonide (inhaled corticosteroid; ICS) and formoterol (long acting β2 agonist; LABA) in the upper airways and lungs of the healthy volunteers. Based on current simulations the emitted doses varied between 50.4% and 92.5% of the metered dose for the ICS, and between 38% and 96.1% in case of LABA component depending on the individual inhalation flow rate. This variability induced a notable inter-individual spread of the deposited lung doses (mean: 33.6%, range: 20.4%-48.8% for budesonide and mean: 29.8%, range: 16.4%-42.9% for formoterol). Significant inter-gender differences were also observed. Average lung dose of budesonide was 29.2% of the metered dose for females and 37% for males, while formoterol deposited with 26.4% efficiency for females and 32.5% for males. Present results also highlighted the importance of breath-holding after inhalation of the drug. About a half of the total lung deposition occurred during breath-hold at 9. average breath-hold time. Calculated depositions confirmed appropriate lung deposition of Symbicort(®) Turbuhaler(®) for both genders, however more effort for optimal inhalation technique is advised for persons with low vital capacity. This study demonstrated the possibility of personalized prediction of airway deposition of aerosol drugs by numerical simulations. The methodology developed in this study will be applicable also to other marketed drugs in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main topic of this paper was a focus on Ultrasound (US) to inhibit Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The variables of the treatment (power, duration, and pulse) were combined through a randomized design; the use of DoE theory (Design of Experiments) and its outputs (Pareto chart, 3D plots, desirability profiles) pointed out that the effect of the treatment relies upon the total  distributed into the system on E. coli O157:H7, as suggested by the significance of interactions of power, pulse and time, while power was the most important factor for L. monocytogenes. A final challenge test was done by using two combinations (H-80% of power, 8 min and pulse at 6 s- for E. coli and F-80%; 2 min; 6 s- for L. monocytogenes) and storing the samples at 4 °C for 2 weeks.

Uncertainties remain about the antigens implicated and their role in inducing rupture. Because antigens from the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been suspected, the aim of this experimental study was to characterize the role of adaptive immunity directed against antigens from the aortic ECM.In a first step, an experimental model of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture based on adaptive immunity against the ECM was developed and characterized. Forty 4-week-old male Lewis rats were divided into two groups. In the ECM group (n = 20), rats were presensitized against the guinea pig aortic ECM before implantation of a decellularized aortic xenograft (DAX). In the control group (n = 20), rats were not presensitized before DAX implantation. In each group, half the rats were sacrificed at day 3 to analyze early mechanisms involved after DAX implantation. In a second step, we aimed to assess which ECM component was most efficient in inducing rupture. For this purpose, the nonfibrillar and fibrillar ECM components were sequentially extracted from the guinea pig aortic wall. Forty Lewis rats were then divided into four groups. Each group was presensitized against one ECM component (structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans, collagen, elastin alone, and elastin-associated glycoproteins) before DAX implantation. Apart from those that experienced rupture, rats were sacrificed at day 21. Xenografts were harvested for histologic, immunofluorescence, and conditioned medium analyses.In total, early aortic rupture occurred in 80% of the ECM group vs 0% of the control group (P < .001). In the ECM group, major circumferential immunoglobulin deposits were observed in combination with the C3 complement fraction, without cell infiltration. Conditioned medium analysis revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 and myeloperoxidase levels and elastase activities were significantly increased in this group. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that myeloperoxidase co-localized with tissue-free DNA and histone H4, highlighting local neutrophil activation and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Following differential presensitization, it appeared that rats presensitized against structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans were significantly more susceptible to rupture after DAX implantation.Stimulating adaptive immunity against the aortic ECM, especially structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans, triggers rupture after DAX implantation. Further studies are needed to assess the precise proteins involved.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study is to explore the prediction value of HBV-LP in different phase of HBV infection and during antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.A retrospective study was conducted in 2033 individuals, which included 1677 HBV infected patients in different phases and 356 healthy controls. HBV-LP, HBV serum markers and HBV DNA were detected by ELISA, CMIA and qRT-PCR, respectively. 85 CHB patients receiving PegIFNα or ETV were divided into virological response (VR) and partial virological response (PVR). The dynamic changes of HBV DNA and HBV-LP were observed.The level of HBV-LP in 2033 individuals was shown as: HBeAg-positive hepatitis > HBeAg-positive infection > HBeAg-negative hepatitis > HBeAg-negative infection > healthy controls. HBV-LP was positive in all patients whose HBV DNA > 1.0E + 06 IU/ml. When HBsAg was <0.05 IU/ml or >1000 IU/ml, HBV DNAs were all negative if HBV-LP < 1.0 S/CO. When HBsAg was between 0.05 IU/ml and 1000 IU/ml, the consistency of HBV-LP with HBV DNA was 100% in case of HBV-LP > 4.0 S/CO in HBeAg-positive patients and HBV-LP > 2.0 S/CO in HBeAg-negative ones. During antiviral therapy, baseline HBV-LP was lower in VR patients than that in PVR patients. The optimal cut-off points to predict VR by baseline HBV-LP were 32.4 and 28.6 S/CO for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative hepatitis patients, respectively.HBV-LP may be a useful marker for distinguishing the different phases of HBV infection. Moreover, baseline HBV-LP level can be used for predicting VR of CHB patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the composition of GAGs present in bovine eye vitreous was characterized through disaccharide analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The interaction of GAGs with collagen type II was assessed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The percentage of hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS), of total GAG, were 96.2%, 3.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The disaccharide composition of CS consisted of 4S (49%), 0S (38%)  (12%), 2S6S (1.5%) and 2S4S (0.3%). The disaccharide composition of HS consisted of 0S (80%), NS2S (7%), NS (7%),  (4%), NS6S (2%), and TriS, 2S and 4S6S (each at 0.1%). The average molecular weights of CS and HS were 148 kDa and 204 kDa, respectively. SPR reveals that collagen type II binds to heparin (primarily composed of TriS) with a binding affinity (K ) of 755 nM and interacts with other GAGs, including CSB and CSE.

Herein, we describe our medicinal chemistry approach to discover peripheral-selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors to avert the risk of P-gp-mediated DDI at the blood-brain barrier. We observed that steric shielding of the hydrogen-bond acceptors and donors (HBA and HBD) of compound 1 reduced the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) efflux ratio; however, the resulting compound 6, a methoxyacetamide derivative, was mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in the in vitro phenotyping study, implying the risk of PK variability based on the genetic polymorphism of the CYPs. Replacement of the hydrogen atom with a deuterium atom in a strategic, metabolically hot spot led to compound 13, which was mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of the effect of deuterium replacement for a major  enzyme. The compound 13, N-{[(,7R)-7-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1,4-oxazepan-6-yl]methyl}-2-[(2H(3))methyloxy]acetamide hydrochloride, which exhibited peripheral NET selective inhibition at tested doses in rats, increased urethral resistance in a dose-dependent manner.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By Eu doping, the band gap of BiOI is slightly narrowed, while the band gaps of others (BiOF, BiOCl, and BiOBr) are slightly broadened. Importantly, there is an isolated impurity  band in the middle of the band gap, which is formed by seven spin-up  levels of Eu-4f states. Furthermore, Eu doping enhances the internal electric fields of BiOX and makes the variation of band gaps and band widths become more outstanding, especially for the band widths of X-ns, O-2s, and Bi- related bands. Taking into account the  level matching and band edge position, Eu-doped BiOCl is favorable not only for the photoluminescence application but also for the photocatalysis application.

Intervention effects estimated as risk ratios were analysed between the HES versus Ringer's acetate groups to detect subgroup heterogeneity of the effects on 90-day mortality. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for risk factors.Most baseline characteristics were comparable between the HES and Ringer's acetate groups in the different subgroups. There was no heterogeneity in the intervention effect on 90-day mortality in the following subgroups: randomisation earlier than 4 h after ICU admission versus later (test of interaction P = 0.85), surgery versus no surgery (P = 0.42), colloids given versus not given (P = 0.57), <2 l of crystalloids given prior to randomisation vs. >2 l (P = 0.88) or plasma lactate >4 mmol/l versus <4 mmol/l (P = 0.54), hypotension versus no hypotension (P = 0.32) or use of vasopressor or inotropic agents at randomisation versus no use (P = 0.10).The increased 90-day mortality observed in patients with severe sepsis resuscitated with HES 130/0.42 did not appear to depend on time course, surgery or fluids given prior to randomisation or on markers of shock at randomisation.

We sought to analyze the relationship between LVEDP and the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Between January 2006 and December 2008, a total of 254 patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome had the LVEDP assessed prior to the intervention. Contrast-induced AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine ≥25% from baseline or an absolute increase of >0.5 mg/dL from baseline. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline LVEDP (<12 mmHg, 12-20 mmHg and > 20 mmHg). Baseline clinical, angiographic and procedural characteristics, as well as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and at 24, 48 and 72 h were retrospectively collected.Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in all three groups with the exception of lower left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated LVEDP (p = 0.02). Among the 17 patients with an LVEDP < 12 mmHg, only one (5.9%) developed AKI; among the 82 patients with an LVEDP = 12-20 mmHg, 15 (18.3%) developed AKI; and among the 155 patients with an LVEDP > 20 mmHg, only 22 developed AKI (13.6%). There was no correlation between LVEDP and the change in GFR at 24 h and at 48 h. Further comparison between the group of patients that developed contrast induced AKI versus those that did not, showed a that there was a significantly lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) among patients that developed contrast induced AKI compared to those that did not (41.4% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.045, respectively).In patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, baseline LVEDP was not associated with contrast-induced AKI.
