<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2991379>Functional integrity of cytokineplasts: specific chemotactic and capping responses.</a></h1><p>Cytokineplasts (CKP) are motile, membrane-bound, anucleate, granule-poor cytoplasmic fragments that are induced from human blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) by the brief application of heat. We examined CKP with respect to specific chemotactic and capping responses, the presence of the N-formyl-peptide chemotactide receptor, and evidence of respiratory burst activity and compared them with CB-cytoplasts, which are fragments created by the centrifugation of cytochalasin B (CB)-treated PMN at high speeds. Under agarose, CKP responded chemotactically to both N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp) and zymosan-activated serum; CB-cytoplasts responded to neither chemoattractant. Despite the functional differences, both fragments retained N-formyl-peptide receptors as measured by affinity labeling with N-formyl-norleu-leu-phe-norleu-125I- and autoradiography of dried SDS-PAGE gels. For studies of capping we used a murine monoclonal antibody, PMN7C3, which binds a specific, widely distributed membrane component of intact PMN, and on warming, promptly induces capping of ligand-receptor complexes. Rhodamine-conjugated PMN7C3 at 4 degrees C labeled the surface of CKP homogeneously. As the CKP warmed to 37 degrees C, label became concentrated in small fluorescent caps at the rear of migrating fragments. Although CB-cytoplasts also bound the fluorochromed antibody homogeneously in the cold, on warming they were unable to concentrate the label normally. With respect to respiratory burst activity, the situation in the two fragments was reversed: CKP did not generate superoxide anion when stimulated either with phorbol myristate acetate or with fmlp after pretreatment with CB; CB-cytoplasts, as noted earlier by other investigators, did. These two types of cytoplasts with markedly different capabilities have complementary roles in the analysis of PMN function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134998>Peptide identification from a Porphyra dioica protein hydrolysate with antioxidant, angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory activities.</a></h1><p>A Porphyra dioica protein extract was enzymatically hydrolysed and then fractionated using semi-preparative reverse-phase high performance chromatography. The hydrolysate and its fractions were tested for their  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) along with their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activities. The most potent fraction was analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Eight peptide sequences were selected for synthesis based on their structure-activity criteria for bioactivity. Asp---Arg showed the highest ORAC activity (4.27 ± 0.15 μmol Trolox equivalent per μM). Thr--Ile-Ala had the highest ACE inhibitory activity (IC50: 89.7 ± 7.10 μM). -Leu-Val-Ala was the only peptide showing DPP-IV inhibitory activity (IC50: 439 ± 44 μM). Apart from Asp---Arg and Thr--Ile-Ala, which displayed increased ORAC activity, the bioactivities of the peptides were either maintained or decreased following in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The results indicate that P. dioica-derived peptides may have potential applications as health enhancing ingredients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8392528>Effects of monomethylfumarate on human granulocytes.</a></h1><p>Monomethylfumarate (MMF) is the most active metabolite of the new antipsoriasis drug Fumaderm. Because granulocytes play an important role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, the effects of this drug on the functional activities of these cells were investigated. MMF stimulated polarization and elastase release, and enhanced the intracellular killing of bacteria by granulocytes. This compound suppressed the formyl-Met-Nle-Phe (FMLP)-stimulated respiratory burst in these cells. MMF and dimethylfumarate but not its stereoisomer dimethylmaleate, fumaric acid, or dimethylmalate stimulated polarization of and elastase release by granulocytes, indicating that methylated fumarate derivatives interact with granulocytes in a specific fashion. MMF did not affect the binding of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein isothiocyanate to the FMLP receptor on granulocytes. This compound induced an increase in the intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) and cyclic adenosine monophsphate concentration. The agonistic effects of MMF on granulocytes are thought to be mediated by the rise in the [Ca++]i and the antagonistic effects by the increase in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration. These effects of MMF on granulocytes may in part explain the beneficial action of methylated fumarate derivatives on psoriatic skin lesions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17692291>The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam blocks ligand binding to the formyl peptide receptor but not the formyl peptide receptor like 1.</a></h1><p>The anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam has been reported to affect the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytes. This anti-inflammatory effect is thought to be mediated through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme important for prostaglandin synthesis. We have compared the effects of piroxicam on superoxide production mediated by two closely related G-protein coupled receptors expressed on neutrophils, the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and the formyl peptide receptor like 1 (FPRL1). Neutrophils were stimulated with agonists that bind specifically to FPR (the peptide ligand N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, fMLF) or FPRL1 (the peptide ligand Trp-Lys--Met-Val-L-Met-NH(2), WKYMVM) or both of these receptors (the peptide ligand Trp-Lys--Met-Val-D-Met-NH(2), WKYMVm). Piroxicam reduced the neutrophil superoxide production induced by the FPR agonist but had no significant effect on the FPRL1 induced response. Neutrophil intracellular calcium changes induced by the agonist WKYMVm (that triggers both FPR and FPRL1) were only inhibited by piroxicam when the drug was combined with the FPRL1 specific antagonist, Trp-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp-Trp (WRW(4)), and this was true also for the inhibition of superoxide anion release. Receptor-binding analysis showed that the fluorescently labelled FPR specific ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle- (fNLFNYK), was competed for in a dose-dependent manner, by the FPR ligand fMLF and as well as by piroxicam. We show that piroxicam inhibits the neutrophil responses triggered through FPR, but not through FPRL1 and this inhibition is due to a reduced binding of the activating ligand to its cell surface receptor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6603438>Phenol coupling initiated by one-electron oxidation of tyrosine units in peptides and histone.</a></h1><p>Phenoxyl radicals generated pulse radiolytically by the reaction of N.3 with Gly- decay biomolecularly (2k = 4.7 X 10(8)M-1 s-1) with efficient formation of 2,2'-dimers, which enolize rapidly (k = 2.7 X 10(4) s-1) to produce the 2,2'-biphenolic product. The build-up of the characteristic 2,2'-biphenol fluorescence (400 nm) and absorption also indicated a delayed (k = 80 s-1) process, probably involving the phenoxyl <-> phenoxy-quinol equilibrium. About 60 per cent of the Gly- phenoxyls were found to dimerize to the 2,2'-biphenol, and a similarly efficient 2,2'-coupling seems to occur with other tyrosyls, such as Lys- and histone. gamma-Radiolysis was applied to estimate relative yields of formation of 2,2'-biphenols under various conditions. Dimerization is almost completely inhibited by cysteine or , consistent with phenoxyl 'repair' by cysteine or O-.2; disproportionation of O-.2 with SOD prevents repair. The phenol 2,2'-coupling is less efficient for .OH- and inefficient for e-aq-initiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28751674>Honokiol suppresses formyl peptide-induced human neutrophil activation by blocking formyl peptide receptor 1.</a></h1><p>Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) mediates bacterial and mitochondrial N-formyl peptides-induced neutrophil activation. Therefore, FPR1 is an important therapeutic target for drugs to treat septic or sterile inflammatory diseases. Honokiol, a major bioactive compound of Magnoliaceae plants, possesses several anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we show that honokiol exhibits an inhibitory effect on FPR1 binding in human neutrophils. Honokiol inhibited superoxide anion generation, reactive oxygen species formation, and elastase release in bacterial or mitochondrial N-formyl peptides (FPR1 agonists)-activated human neutrophils. Adhesion of FPR1-induced human neutrophils to cerebral endothelial cells was also reduced by honokiol. The receptor-binding results revealed that honokiol repressed FPR1-specific ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein binding to FPR1 in human neutrophils, neutrophil-like THP-1 cells, and hFPR1-transfected HEK293 cells. However, honokiol did not inhibit FPR2-specific ligand binding to FPR2 in human neutrophils. Furthermore, honokiol inhibited FPR1 agonist-induced calcium mobilization as well as phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK in human neutrophils. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that honokiol may have therapeutic potential for treating FPR1-mediated inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22362402>Sphingomyelinase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus in mouse diaphragm muscle fibers.</a></h1><p>Diseases that result in muscle weakness, e.g., heart failure, are characterized by elevated sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity. In intact muscle, SMase increases oxidants that contribute to diminished muscle force. However, the source of oxidants, specific processes of muscle contraction that are dysfunctional, and biochemical changes underlying the weakness elicited by SMase remain unknown. We tested three hypotheses: 1) SMase-induced depression of muscle force is mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2) SMase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, and 3) SMase promotes oxidation and phosphorylation of myofibrillar proteins. Our experiments included intact muscle bundles, permeabilized single fibers, and isolated myofibrillar proteins. The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant d-Arg-2',6'-dimethyl--Phe-NH(2), decreased cytosolic oxidants and protected intact muscle bundles from weakness stimulated by SMase. SMase depressed maximal calcium-activated force by 20% in permeabilized single fibers (in kN/m(2): control 117 ± 6; SMase 93 ± 8; P < 0.05). Calcium sensitivity of permeabilized single fibers decreased from 5.98 ± 0.03 (control) to 5.91 ± 0.02 (SMase; P < 0.05). Myofibrillar protein nitrotyrosines, carbonyls, and phosphorylation were unaltered by SMase. Our study shows that the fall in specific force of intact muscle elicited by SMase is mediated by mitochondrial ROS and can be attributed largely to dysfunction of the contractile apparatus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3089286>Optimization of hydroxylation of tyrosine and tyrosine-containing peptides by mushroom tyrosinase.</a></h1><p>Free tyrosine and tyrosine residues in various peptides and proteins are converted into dopa and dopa residues by tyrosinase (monophenol,L-dopa: oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1) in the presence of reductants. The efficiency of the tyrosine-to-dopa conversion was examined under varied conditions, such as the substrate-to-tyrosine ratio, concentrations of reductant and  in the reaction solution, pH, temperature and reaction time. The highest dopa yields were achieved with the following optimal conditions for hydroxylation: 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7, 25 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM tyrosine, 50 micrograms/ml tyrosinase and 20 degrees C. Using these conditions, up to 70% of free tyrosine was converted into dopa, and tyrosine residues in several synthetic peptides were also hydroxylated to dopa residues at ratios as high as free tyrosine. The preparation of hydroxylated analogues of the decapeptide (Ala-Lys-Pro-Ser--Pro-Pro-Thr-), in particular, may contribute to a better understanding of adhesion in the dopa-containing mussel glue protein.</p></html>
