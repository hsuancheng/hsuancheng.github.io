Hochst (Marula) nut oil is a popular ingredient in cosmetics such as skin lotions, lipsticks and foundations. The demand for this African oil increased tremendously such that in 2008 almost US$ 20 million was spent on Marula oil for cosmetic product manufacturing. The ethnobotanical literature states that the Zulu people in South Africa amongst others applied the oil to maintain a healthy skin. Scientific studies to support the traditional use as well as the inclusion of Marula oil in cosmetic products is lacking. This study evaluated the irritancy potential (safety), the moisturising and hydrating effects as well occlusivity properties (efficacy) of Marula oil after topical application. In addition, the Marula oil used in this study was comprehensively characterised using two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.Quantification of the fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) was done using a LECO Pegasus 4D GC × GC-MS. To determine the safety and efficacy of Marula oil healthy caucasian adult female volunteers (n = 20) who complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the irritancy patch, moisture efficacy, hydrating and occlusivity tests were recruited for each study. A 2 × magnifying lamp (visual observation), Chromameter®, Aquaflux® and Corneometer® instruments were used to evaluate and monitor the irritancy level, skin  , transepidermal water loss, hydrating and occlusive effects of topically applied Marula oil.The GC × GC-MS analysis identified several saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids.  was the major fatty  constituting 69.0% of the oil followed by palmitic  (15.3%), linoleic  (9.2%), palmitoleic  (4.1%) and stearic  (1.5%). The clinical study revealed that Marula oil is non-irritant (p < 0.001), with moisturising and hydrating properties (p < 0.001) when applied to a lipid-dry (xerosis) skin. Additionally the oil exhibited occlusive effects (p < 0.001) when applied to normal skin. These findings may be linked to the absorption of the oil into the skin due to the high percentage of  and the presence of palmitic  which are known to disturb the stratum corneum intercellular lipids. These fatty acids present in Marula oil are very similar to those present in the epidermis, and can be considered biomimetic.Marula oil rich in fatty acids exhibits moisturising, hydrating and occlusive properties. As the oil is non-irritating and provides a moisturising effect with moderate prevention of transepidermal water loss, average moisture retention properties and noteworthy occlusive effects, its inclusion in cosmetic products based on its traditional use may be justified depending on the application.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this article, in vitro and in vivo studies of argan (Argania spinosa), avocado (Persea americana), black cumin (Nigella sativa), calophyllum (Calophyllum inophyllum), coconut (Cocos nucifera), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), grape (Vitis vinifera), green coffee (Coffea arabica), lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus), linseed (Linum usitatissimum), lucuma (Pouteria lucuma), mango (Mangifera indica), olive (Olea europaea), pomegranate (Punica granatum), pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), rapeseed (Brassica napus), sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oils were reviewed. In many cases, vegetable oils proved to be more effective than synthetic wound-healing compounds used as controls. The fatty- components of vegetable oils are assumed to play a major role in the wound-healing process, in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic . Evidence shows that oils with a higher linoleic to  ratio are more effective for lipid  repair. However, in depth studies are needed to gain knowledge about vegetable oils' effects on the skin and vice versa.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26890090>Fatty  vesicles acting as expanding horizon for transdermal delivery.</a></h2><p>The body is protected against the external environment by the skin due to its physical  nature. Stratum corneum composed of corneocytes surrounded by lipid region performs a major   as it lies in the uppermost area of skin. Alteration in  , increase in permeability, and disorganization of stratum corneum represent diseased skin. Drugs applied to the diseased skin should induce a local effect at the site of application or area close to it along with cutaneous absorption rather than percutaneous absorption. Conventional formulations like ointments, gels, and creams suffer from the drawback of limited local activity. For the enhancement of drug penetration and localization of the drug at the site of action approaches explored are liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes microparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles. Vesicles composed of fatty acids like  and linoleic  represent the new approach used for transdermal penetration and localization. In this review article, our major aim was to explore the applications of fatty  vesicles for transdermal delivery of various bioactives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28035674>The blood-brain  fatty  transport protein 1 (FATP1/SLC27A1) supplies docosahexaenoic  to the brain, and insulin facilitates transport.</a></h2><p>We purposed to clarify the contribution of fatty  transport protein 1 (FATP1/SLC 27A1) to the supply of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) to the brain across the blood-brain  in this study. Transport experiments showed that the uptake rate of [ C]-DHA in human FATP1-expressing HEK293 cells was significantly greater than that in empty vector-transfected (mock) HEK293 cells. The steady-state intracellular DHA concentration was nearly 2-fold smaller in FATP1-expressing than in mock cells, suggesting that FATP1 works as not only an influx, but also an efflux transporter for DHA. [ C]-DHA uptake by a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) increased in a time-dependent manner, and was inhibited by unlabeled DHA and a known FATP1 substrate, . Knock-down of FATP1 in hCMEC/D3 cells with specific siRNA showed that FATP1-mediated uptake accounts for 59.2-73.0% of total [ C]-DHA uptake by the cells. Insulin treatment for 30 min induced translocation of FATP1 protein to the plasma membrane in hCMEC/D3 cells and enhanced [ C]-DHA uptake. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain sections showed that FATP1 protein is preferentially localized at the basal membrane of brain microvessel endothelial cells. We found that two neuroprotective substances, taurine and biotin, in addition to DHA, undergo FATP1-mediated efflux. Overall, our results suggest that FATP1 localized at the basal membrane of brain microvessels contributes to the transport of DHA, taurine and biotin into the brain, and insulin rapidly increases DHA supply to the brain by promoting translocation of FATP1 to the membrane.

Therefore, microemulsions based on naturally derived monoacyl phosphatidylcholine (MAPL) were developed. The influence of the water, oil and surfactant content on dermal delivery of flufenamic  was systematically investigated for the first time. A water-rich microemulsion led to significantly higher in vitro skin penetration of flufenamic  compared to other microemulsions. The superiority of the water-rich microemulsion over a marketed flufenamic  containing formulation was additionally confirmed. Differences in drug delivery could be explained by alterations of the microemulsions after application. Evaporation of isopropanol led to crystal-like structures of MAPL on the skin surface from the surfactant- or -rich microemulsions. In contrast, the formation of this additional  was hindered in case of the water-rich microemulsion. The skin penetration of MAPL was additionally analyzed by combined ATR-FTIR and tape stripping experiments, where MAPL itself penetrated only into the initial layers of the stratum corneum, independent of the microemulsion composition. Since a surfactant must penetrate the skin to cause irritation, MAPL can be presumed as a skin-friendly emulsifier with the ability to stabilize pharmaceutically acceptable microemulsions.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, we and others discovered that the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] shows significant beneficial effects in preclinical models of acute lung injury (ALI). Here, we aimed to identify the best time window for Ang-(1-7) administration to protect rats from  (OA) induced ALI.The effects of i.v. infused Ang-(1-7) were examined over four different time windows before or after induction of ALI in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Haemodynamic effects were continuously monitored, and loss of  , inflammation and lung peptidase activities were measured as experimental endpoints.Ang-(1-7) infusion provided the best protection against experimental ALI when administered by continuous infusion starting immediately after 30 min OA infusion till the end of the experiment (30-240 min). Both pretreatment (-60 to 0 min before OA) and short-term therapy (30-90 min) also had beneficial effects although less pronounced than the effects achieved with the optimal therapy window. Starting infusion of Ang-(1-7) 60 min after the end of OA treatment (90-240 min) did not protect   or haemodynamics but still reduced myeloperoxidase activity and increased ACE2/ACE activity ratio respectively.Our findings indicate that early initiation of therapy after ALI and continuous drug delivery are most beneficial for optimal therapeutic efficiency of Ang-(1-7) treatment in experimental ALI and, presumably accordingly, in clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome.© 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26103450>Activation of EP receptors prevents endotoxin-induced neutrophil infiltration into the airways and enhances microvascular  .</a></h2><p>Pulmonary vascular dysfunction is a key event in acute lung injury. We recently demonstrated that PGE , via activation of E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, strongly enhances microvascular   in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of concomitant EP receptor activation in murine models of acute pulmonary inflammation.Pulmonary inflammation in male BALB/c mice was induced by LPS (20 μg per mouse intranasally) or  (0.15 μL·g , i.v ). In-vitro, endothelial   was determined by measuring electrical impedance.PGE activation of EP receptors reduced neutrophil infiltration, pulmonary vascular leakage and TNF-α concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. Similarly, pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability induced by  was counteracted by EP receptor activation. In lung  assays, the EP agonist ONO AE1-329 restored the increased resistance and reduced compliance upon methacholine challenge in mice treated with LPS or . In agreement with these findings, EP receptor activation increased the in vitro vascular   of human and mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and diminished the  disruption induced by LPS. The EP agonist ONO AE1-259 likewise reversed LPS-induced lung dysfunction without enhancing vascular  .Our results show that activation of the EP receptor strengthens the microvascular   and thereby ameliorates the pathology of acute lung inflammation, including neutrophil infiltration, vascular oedema formation and airway dysfunction.

Despite treatment advances over the last decades, ARDS patients still suffer mortality rates between 35 and 40%. There is still a need for further research to improve the outcome of patients suffering from ARDS. One problem is that no single animal model can mimic the complex pathomechanism of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, but several models exist to study different parts of it.  injection (OAI)-induced lung injury is a well-established model for studying ventilation strategies, lung mechanics and ventilation/perfusion distribution in animals. OAI leads to severely impaired gas exchange, deterioration of lung mechanics and disruption of the alveolo-capillary . The disadvantage of this model is the controversial mechanistic relevance of this model and the necessity for central venous access, which is challenging especially in smaller animal models. In summary, OAI-induced lung injury leads to reproducible results in small and large animals and hence represents a well-suited model for studying ARDS. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to find a model that mimics all parts of ARDS and lacks the problems associated with the different models existing today.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813043>Hyaluronic  tethered pH-responsive alloy-drug nanoconjugates for multimodal therapy of glioblastoma: An intranasal route approach.</a></h2><p>In the present investigation, FePt alloy nanoparticles were synthesized with controlled size and elemental composition followed by surface modification using (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES). Lenalidomide was covalently bound to FePt-NH by pH sensitive hydrazone bonding. Hyaluronic  was conjugated to amino groups of APTES while lactoferrin (Lf) was directly conjugated to excess carboxylic group present on hyaluronic  (HA) to form surface modified pH sensitive alloy-drug nanoconjugates (SPANs). The multifunctional nanoconjugates were characterized and evaluated using extensive in vitro and in vivo techniques. The nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent heating ability on exposure to alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation. The acidic microenvironment of lysozome triggered release of LND from SPANs. Owing to leaching of Fe and Pt contents, SPANs demonstrated ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87MG cell line which further enhanced therapeutic effect of SPANs. Significant difference in cell viability suppression was observed in in vitro photothermal, chemo-photothermal and chemo-magnetophotothermal killing of cancer cells using SPANs in U87MG cell lines. Significant difference in heating ability and cell cytotoxicity of SPANs in comparison to alternative magnetic field and NIR irradiation was observed for DUAL-mode exposure of SPANs. The results of cellular internalization study showed efficient internalization of SPANs inside U87MG cells. The in vivo results (both qualitative and quantitative) confirmed enhanced uptake of SPANs in brain after intranasal administration with enhanced nasal and mucus penetration owing to presence of Lf. No significant interaction was observed with ECM and mucin due to presence of carboxyl group on SPANs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, silver nanoparticles coated with  (AgNP-OA) were synthesized, characterized and incorporated in Langmuir monolayers of single phospholipids -having different chain length, saturation degree and phase state- or of a SCM mixture. The incorporation of AgNP-OA to the lipid monolayers generated an expansion of the monolayers and a decrease of the surface compressional modulus compared to the pure lipid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested that the zwitterionic choline-phospholipids can be adsorbed onto the nanoparticles' surface, which is relevant considering that phospholipids are the major constituents of the cell membrane. We also studied the changes in the topography at the mesoscale level using Brewster angle microscopy. We found the most prominent changes in the lipids with liquid-condensed phase, such as SCM, showing segregation of their components. This could have major implications in the   of the membrane, affecting for example the skin permeability towards hydrophobic nanoparticles. Finally, the capability of hydrophobic AgNP-OA for delivering Ag ions was studied in aqueous media in the absence and presence of phospholipids. In both conditions, AgNP-OA released Ag at reported-bactericidal concentrations, being double in the presence of phospholipids.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Hereto, BOECs were studied in a polarized system with 24-h treatments at Day 9: (1) control (0 µM NEFA + 0% EtOH), (2) solvent control (0 µM NEFA + 0.45% EtOH), (3) basal NEFA (720 µM NEFA + 0.45% EtOH in the basal compartment) and (4) apical NEFA (720 µM NEFA + 0.45% EtOH in the apical compartment). FITC-albumin was used for monolayer permeability assessment and related to transepithelial electric resistance (TER). Fatty  (FA), glucose, lactate and pyruvate concentrations were measured in spent medium. Intracellular lipid droplets (LD) and FA uptake were studied using Bodipy 493/503 and immunolabelling of FA transporters (FAT/CD36, FABP3 and CAV1). BOEC-mRNA was retrieved for qRT-PCR. Results revealed that apical NEFA reduced relative TER increase (46.85%) during treatment and increased FITC-albumin flux (27.59%) compared to other treatments. In basal NEFA, FAs were transferred to the apical compartment as free FAs: mostly palmitic and  increased respectively 56.0 and 33.5% of initial FA concentrations. Apical NEFA allowed no FA transfer, but induced LD accumulation and upregulated FA transporter expression (↑CD36, ↑FABP3 and ↑CAV1). Gene expression in apical NEFA indicated increased anti-apoptotic (↑) and anti-oxidative (↑) capacity, upregulated lipid metabolism (↑ ↑ and ↓) and FA uptake (↑). All treatments had similar carbohydrate metabolism and oviduct -specific gene expression (,  and ). Overall, elevated NEFAs affected BOEC metabolism and   differently depending on NEFA exposure side.

Studies of the   of the stratum corneum using l-menthol, a monocyclic monoterpene widely used in medicines and foods, have revealed an interaction between characteristic intercellular lipid structures in the stratum corneum and permeation enhancers. The variety of permeation enhancers that can be used to contribute to transdermal delivery systems beyond l-menthol is increasing. In this study, we focused on nerolidol and levulinic  and investigated their influence on stratum corneum lipid structures. Nerolidol, a sesquiterpene, has been reported to enhance the permeation of various drugs. Levulinic  is reported to enhance the permeability of buprenorphine and is used as a component of the buprenorphine patch. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform IR spectroscopy measurements revealed that nerolidol disturbs the rigidly arranged lipid structure and increases lipid fluidity. Levulinic  had a smaller effect on stratum corneum lipid structures, but did increase lipid fluidity when co-administered with nerolidol or heat.

The transport of caffeine, diazepam and mannitol across porcine buccal mucosa was studied in modified Ussing chambers with a hypotonic donor solution, in the presence of levulinic  (LA),  (OA), propylene glycol (PG) as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Subsequently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was applied to image the spatial distribution of caffeine, mannitol and SDS in cross-sections of porcine buccal mucosa. The results revealed that none of the permeation enhancing strategies improved the permeability of caffeine or diazepam, despite impact on the tissue integrity by OA and SDS, as seen by an increased permeability of mannitol. Further studies are needed with OA since PG solvent may have concealed the possible impact of OA. SDS decreased the permeability of caffeine and diazepam, a decrease which can be explained by micellar lipid extraction and encapsulation in micelles. MALDI-MSI showed that SDS permeated into approximately one-third of the epithelium, and it therefore appears that the main permeability  for mannitol is located in the outer epithelium. MALDI-MSI was shown to be a useful method for imaging spatial distribution of drugs and permeations enhancers in buccal mucosa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The main challenge for this delivery route is to overcome the  properties of skin, especially for very lipophilic compounds such as vitamin D3. In this study, the effect of different penetration enhancers, such as , dodecylamine, ethanol,  in propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, octyldodecanol, and oleyl alcohol in propylene glycol were evaluated in vitro for their effectiveness in delivering vitamin D3 through polyamide filter, polydimethylsiloxane membrane, and porcine skin. A diffusion cell was used to study the transdermal permeability of vitamin D3. Ointment formulations of vitamin D3 were prepared containing the most widely used penetration enhancers, , and dodecylamine. The ointment containing  as chemical penetration enhancer did not improve delivery compared to control. On the other hand, the formulation containing dodecylamine as a penetration enhancer did improve the transdermal delivery of vitamin D3. However, statistical significance and an amount high enough for nutritional supplementation purposes were reached only when the skin was pretreated with 50% ethanol. In these conditions, the ointment delivered an amount of 760-ng vitamin D3 per cm(2) of skin.

Dysfunction of tight junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced  impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , suppressed TNF-α and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin light chain kinase. HYA also suppressed the expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells and colonic tissue. In addition, HYA suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, HYA significantly up-regulated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40 expression in Caco-2 cells. It also induced [Ca(2+)]i responses in HEK293 cells expressing human GPR40 with higher sensitivity than linoleic , its metabolic precursor. The -recovering effects of HYA were abrogated by a GPR40 antagonist and MEK inhibitor in Caco-2 cells. Conversely, 10-hydroxyoctadacanoic , which is a gut microbial metabolite of  and lacks a carbon-carbon double bond at Δ12 position, did not show these TJ-restoring activities and down-regulated GPR40 expression. Therefore, HYA modulates TNFR2 expression, at least partially, via the GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway and may be useful in the treatment of TJ-related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29898376>A2BAR activation attenuates acute lung injury by inhibiting alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro.</a></h2><p>The epithelial  of the lung is destroyed during acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Therefore, treatments that block AEC apoptosis might be a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate ALI. Based on recent evidence, A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) plays an important role in ALI in several different animal models, but its exact  in AECs has not been clarified. We investigated the role of A2BAR in AEC apoptosis in a mouse model of  (OA)-induced ALI and in hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced AEC (A549 cells and MLE-12 cells) injury. Mice treated with BAY60-6583, a selective A2BAR agonist, showed lower AEC apoptosis rates than mice treated with OA. However, the role of BAY60-6583 in OA-induced ALI was attenuated by a specific blocker of A2BAR, PSB1115. A2BAR activation decreased HO-induced cell apoptosis in vitro, as characterized by the translocation of apoptotic proteins, the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-3 and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). In addition, apoptosis was required for the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. Importantly, compared with cells transfected with the A2BAR-siRNA, an ERK inhibitor or p38 inhibitor exhibited decreased apoptotic ratios and cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP-1 levels, whereas the JNK inhibitor displayed increases in these parameters. In conclusion, A2BAR activation effectively attenuated OA-induced ALI by inhibiting AEC apoptosis and mitigated HO-induced AEC injury by suppressing the p38 and ERK1/2-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25865705>Exogenous arachidonic  mediates permeability of human brain microvessel endothelial cells through prostaglandin E2 activation of EP3 and EP4 receptors.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain , formed by microvessel endothelial cells, is the restrictive  between the brain parenchyma and the circulating blood. Arachidonic  (ARA; 5,8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic ) is a conditionally essential polyunsaturated fatty  [20:4(n-6)] and is a major constituent of brain lipids. The current study examined the transport processes for ARA in confluent monolayers of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Addition of radioactive ARA to the apical compartment of HBMEC cultured on Transwell(®) inserts resulted in rapid incorporation of radioactivity into the basolateral medium. Knock down of fatty  transport proteins did not alter ARA passage into the basolateral medium as a result of the rapid generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ), an eicosanoid known to facilitate opening of the blood-brain . Permeability following ARA or PGE2 exposure was confirmed by an increased movement of fluorescein-labeled dextran from apical to basolateral medium. ARA-mediated permeability was attenuated by specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. EP3 and EP4 receptor antagonists attenuated the ARA-mediated permeability of HBMEC. The results indicate that ARA increases permeability of HBMEC monolayers likely via increased production of PGE2 which acts upon EP3 and EP4 receptors to mediate permeability. These observations may explain the rapid influx of ARA into the brain previously observed upon plasma infusion with ARA. The blood-brain , formed by microvessel endothelial cells, is a restrictive  between the brain parenchyma and the circulating blood. Radiolabeled arachidonic  (ARA) movement across, and monolayer permeability in the presence of ARA, was examined in confluent monolayers of primary human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) cultured on Transwell(®) plates. Incubation of HBMECs with ARA resulted in a rapid increase in HBMEC monolayer permeability. The mechanism was mediated, in part, through increased prostaglandin E2 production from ARA which acted upon EP3 and EP4 receptors to increase HBMEC monolayer permeability.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27822974>The effect of non-specific tight junction modulators on the transepithelial transport of poorly permeable drugs across airway epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The epithelial  in the respiratory system is a major obstacle for drug delivery to the systemic circulation in the lung.

Therefore, modulating tight junctions can enhance paracellular transport across epithelial . In this study, the effect of some of non-specific tight junction modulators (TJMs); (Sodium (Na) decanoate,  and ethyleneglycol-bis-(β-aminoethyl ether)-N, N'-tetraacetic  (EGTA)) with established effect on intestinal tight junctions was evaluated for its effects on bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells). It was demonstrated that the effect of TJMs especially Na decanoate resulted in a reversible opening of tight junctions evidenced by the decrease in the transepithelial resistance. It was also demonstrated that this reduction of TEER upon exposing the epithelial cells to the TJMs resulted in a significant increase in Flu-Na (paracellular marker) and PXS25 (anti-fibrotic compound) transepithelial transport through this .

However, owing to the existence of blood-brain  (BBB), the tumor accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of clinical therapeutics is still of great concerns. To this end, we present herein a prominent therapeutic strategy adopting adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) capable of carrying nanotherapeutic payloads selectively toward brain tumors for thermo/chemotherapy. The nanoparticle (NP) payload was obtained from co-assembly of poly(γ-glutamic -co-distearyl γ-glutamate) with poly(lactic-co-glycolic ), paclitaxel (PTX), and -coated superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs in aqueous solution. The particle size and drug loading content were ca 110nm and 8.4wt%, respectively. After being engulfed by ADSCs, the nanotherapeutics was found rather harmless to cellular hosts at a PTX concentration of 30μM over 48h in the absence of pertinent stimulus. Nevertheless, the ADSC-based approach combined with high frequency magnetic field exhibits a sound therapeutic performance with a 4-fold increase in therapeutic index on brain astrocytoma (ALTS1C1)-bearing mice (C57BL/6J) as compared to the typical chemotherapy using a current first-line chemodrug, temozolomide. Immunohistochemical examination of brain tumor sections confirms the successful cellular transport and pronounced cytotoxic action of therapeutics against tumor cells in vivo.

However, an understanding of the physiological mechanism of HS lactating dairy cows remains elusive. Here, a metabolomics study using LC-MS and (1)H NMR spectroscopy was performed to analyze the metabolomic differences in the milk between HS-free and HS dairy cows, and discover diagnostic biomarkers and changes in the metabolic pathway. A total of 53 discriminating metabolites were significantly up- or down-regulated in the HS group compared with the HS-free group (P < 0.05). These biomarkers were involved in pathways of carbohydrate, amino , lipid, and gut microbiome-derived metabolism. Comparing these potential biomarkers with previously identified HS candidate biomarkers in plasma, significant correlations between the levels of lactate, pyruvate, creatine, acetone, β-hydroxybutyrate, trimethylamine, , linoleic , lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, and phosphatidylcholine 42:2 in milk and plasma were found, indicating that the blood-milk  became leaky and the levels of these 10 biomarkers in milk can reflect HS-induced metabolomic alterations in blood. These novel findings can support more in-depth research to elucidate the milk-based changes in metabolic pathways in HS lactating dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012979>Establishing the importance of oil-membrane interactions on the transmembrane diffusion of physicochemically diverse compounds.</a></h2><p>The diffusion process through a non-porous  membrane depends on the properties of the drug, vehicle and membrane. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether a series of oily vehicles might have the potential to interact to varying degrees with synthetic membranes and to determine whether any such interaction might affect the permeation of co-formulated permeants: methylparaben (MP); butylparaben (BP) or caffeine (CF). The oils (isopropyl myristate (IPM), isohexadecane (IHD), hexadecane (HD),  (OA) and liquid paraffin (LP)) and membranes (silicone, high density polyethylene and polyurethane) employed in the study were selected such that they displayed a range of different structural, and physicochemical properties. Diffusion studies showed that many of the vehicles were not inert and did interact with the membranes resulting in a modification of the permeants' flux when corrected for membrane thickness (e.g. normalized flux of MP increased from 1.25±0.13μgcm(-1)h(-1) in LP to 17.94±0.25μgcm(-1)h(-1)in IPM). The oils were sorbed differently to membranes (range of weight gain: 2.2±0.2% for polyurethane with LP to 105.6±1.1% for silicone with IHD). Membrane interaction was apparently dependent upon the physicochemical properties including; size, shape, flexibility and the Hansen solubility parameter values of both the membranes and oils. Sorbed oils resulted in modified permeant diffusion through the membranes. No simple correlation was found to exist between the Hansen solubility parameters of the oils or swelling of the membrane and the normalized fluxes of the three compounds investigated. More sophisticated modelling would appear to be required to delineate and quantify the key molecular parameters of membrane, permeant and vehicle compatibility and their interactions of relevance to membrane permeation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In order to further enhance the delivery of drugs through the skin, penetration enhancers are widely used.The objective of this work was to develop an optimized formulation of lornoxicam ethosomal gels, investigate skin permeability with the addition of penetration enhancers, and evaluate the invivo pharmacodynamics of these formulations.Lornoxicam ethosomes were prepared by the ethanol injection method and optimized using the orthogonal design method. Lornoxicam ethosomal gels with enhancers were prepared and optimized using in-vitro transdermal delivery experiments. Experiments on lornoxicam ethosomal gels containing various enhancers such as azone, menthol, lauryl alcohol, and  were conducted using vertical Franz diffusion cells to measure the percutaneous permeability of the different formulations. Furthermore, the in-vivo analgesic effects of the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels were examined using the hot-plate and acetic -induced writhing tests. Anti-inflammatory activity was investigated using the dimethylbenzene-induced mouse ear swelling method.The results showed that compared to other formulations, the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels with 5 % menthol significantly increased transdermal penetration. Meanwhile, the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels showed remarkably anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity compared with the plain lornoxicam gels.These results suggest that the optimized ethosomal gel formulated in this study is a promising lornoxicam carrier in transdermal delivery systems to enhance anti-nociceptive and antiinflammatory efficiency.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247738>Fatty -Binding Protein 5 Mediates the Uptake of Fatty Acids, but not Drugs, Into Human Brain Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the involvement of fatty -binding protein 5 (FABP5), a lipid-binding protein expressed at the blood-brain  (BBB), in fatty  and drug uptake into human brain endothelial cells. Following transfection with siRNA against hFABP5, human brain endothelial cell (hCMEC/D3) uptake of lipophilic ligands with varying affinity to FABP5 was assessed with intracellular concentrations quantified by liquid scintillation counting, HPLC, or LCMS/MS. The in situ BBB transport of [H]-diazepam was also assessed in wild type and FABP5-deficient mice. hFABP5 siRNA reduced FABP5 expression in hCMEC/D3 cells by 39.9 ± 3.8% (mRNA) and 38.8 ± 6.6% (protein; mean ± SEM), leading to a reduction in uptake of [C]-lauric , [H]-, and [C]-stearic  by 37.5 ± 8.8%, 41.7 ± 11.6%, and 50.7 ± 13.6%, respectively, over 1 min. No significant changes in [C]-diazepam, pioglitazone, and troglitazone uptake were detected following FABP5 knockdown in hCMEC/D3 cells. Similarly, no difference in BBB transport of [H]-diazepam was observed between wild type and FABP5-deficient mice. Therefore, although FABP5 facilitates brain endothelial cell uptake of fatty acids, it has limited effects on brain endothelial cell uptake and BBB transport of drugs with lower affinity for FABP5.Crown Copyright © 2018.

The present study aimed to analyze precisely whether co-culture of two colon cancer cell lines, mucus-producing cells HT29-MTX and enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, ameliorate differentiation into an in vitro intestinal  model and the signaling pathways involved. Differentiated Caco-2 cells gene datasets were compared first to intestinal or cancer phenotypes and second to signaling pathway gene datasets. Experimental validations were performed in real-time experiments, immunochemistry, and gene expression analyses on Caco-2 versus co-cultures of Caco-2 and HT29-MTX (10%) cells. Partial maintenance of cancer-cell phenotype in differentiated Caco-2 cells was confirmed and fatty acids merged as potential regulators of cancer signaling pathways. HT29-MTX cells induced morphological changes in Caco-2 cells, slightly increased their proliferation rate and profoundly modified gene transcription of phenotype markers, fatty  receptors, intracellular transporters, and lipid droplet components as well as functional responses to . In vitro, enterocyte phenotype was rescued partially by co-culture of cancer cells with goblet cells and completed through  interaction with signaling pathways dysregulated in cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905315>Adipocytes as lipid sensors of  transport through a functional Caco-2/HT29-MTX intestinal .</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue  in the regulation of lipemia is highly dependent on intestinal absorption of nutrients. Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as lipid sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study  induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal  using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal lipid absorption. This model was validated using  (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal . Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to 5 μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers. Metabolism including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to  TG accumulation in adipocytes. By comparison AML12 hepatocytes found less sensitive to OA (up to 1 μM). The present study demonstrates a much better functionality for fatty  uptake and release in Caco2/HT29-MTX versus Caco-2 intestinal barriers. Taken together these results open new opportunities to study in vitro lipid transfer between intestinal barriers and either adipocytes or hepatocytes.

The rat ALI model was reproduced by injection of 0.01 mL/kg  into the tail vein, and the rats in NS control group were injected with the same amount of NS. The rats in KGF-2 pretreatment group were instilled with 5 mg/kg KGF-2 in the airway at 72 hours before the model reproduction, and the rats in the NS control group and the ALI model group were instilled with the same amount of NS. The abdominal aortic blood of rats was collected at 8 hours after model reproduction, and then the rats were sacrificed, bronchoalveolar in left lung was lavage, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for determination of protein levels in plasma and BALF, and the lung permeability index (LPI) was calculated. The lung tissues were harvested, after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the histopathological changes were observed under light microscope, and the ALI pathology score (LIS) was calculated. The lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio was determined. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the expressions of FKN and claudin-5 in the lung tissue. The correlation between two variables was analyzed by linear or curve fitting correlation analysis.In the ALI model group, the lung tissue was severely damaged, and obvious pathological changes were observed, including thickened alveolar space and inflammatory cell infiltration, and LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly higher than those of the NS control group (LIS: 3.56±0.28 vs. 0.62±0.36, lung W/D ratio: 6.37±0.29 vs. 4.39±0.33, LPI: 3.46±0.69 vs. 0.98±0.17, all P < 0.01). Compared with the NS control group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of the ALI model group was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.97±0.18 vs. 0.62±0.04, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.56±0.11 vs. 1.06±0.13, P < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.817, P = 0.025). After pretreatment with KGF-2, the degree of lung tissue damage was significantly reduced, and the pathological changes were significantly improved, and the LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly lower than those of the ALI model group (LIS: 2.41±0.17 vs. 3.56±0.28, lung W/D ratio: 5.45±0.55 vs. 6.37±0.29, LPI: 2.42±0.19 vs. 3.46±0.69, all P < 0.01). Compared with the ALI model group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of KGF-2 pretreatment group was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.79±0.03 vs. 0.97±0.18, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.80±0.05 vs. 0.56±0.11, P < 0.01). There was still a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.847, P = 0.012).KGF-2 may restore the expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 by down-regulating the expression of chemokine FKN, thereby reducing the damage of blood  in ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29864475>Predicting drug permeability through skin using molecular dynamics simulation.</a></h2><p>Understanding and predicting permeability of compounds through skin is of interest for transdermal delivery of drugs and for toxicity predictions of chemicals. We show, using a new atomistic molecular dynamics model of the skin's  structure, itself validated against near-native cryo-electron microscopy data from human skin, that skin permeability to the reference compounds benzene, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), ethanol, codeine, naproxen, nicotine, testosterone and water can be predicted. The permeability results were validated against skin permeability data in the literature. We have investigated the relation between skin  molecular organization and permeability using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, it is shown that the calculated mechanism of action differs between the five skin penetration enhancers Azone, DMSO, , stearic  and water. The permeability enhancing effect of a given penetration enhancer depends on the permeating compound and on the concentration of penetration enhancer inside the skin's  structure. The presented method may open the door for computer based screening of the permeation of drugs and toxic compounds through skin.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut   were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , , linoleic , squalene, and arachidonic , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal  dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28707186>Natural Oils for Skin- Repair: Ancient Compounds Now Backed by Modern Science.</a></h2><p>Natural plant oils are commonly used as topical therapy worldwide. They are usually easily accessible and are relatively inexpensive options for skin care. Many natural oils possess specific compounds with antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-itch properties, making them attractive alternative and complementary treatments for xerotic and inflammatory dermatoses associated with skin- disruption. Unique characteristics of various oils are important when considering their use for topical skin care. Differing ratios of essential fatty acids are major determinants of the  repair benefits of natural oils. Oils with a higher linoleic  to  ratio have better  repair potential, whereas oils with higher amounts of irritating  may be detrimental to skin- . Various extraction methods for oils exist, including cold pressing to make unrefined oils, heat and chemical distillation to make essential oils, and the addition of various chemicals to simulate a specific scent to make fragranced oils. The method of oil processing and refinement is an important component of selecting oil for skin care, and cold pressing is the preferred method of oil extraction as the heat- and chemical-free process preserves beneficial lipids and limits irritating byproducts.

Irsogladine maleate (IM) is an enhancer of gastric mucosal protective factors via upregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). GJIC is thought to participate in the formation of functional tight junctions. However, the effects of IM on GJIC and the epithelial  in human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) remain unknown. To investigate the effects of IM on GJIC and the tight junctional  in HNECs, primary cultures of HNECs transfected with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT-HNECs) were treated with IM and the GJIC inhibitors oleamide and 18β-GA. Some cells were pretreated with IM before treatment with TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) to examine whether IM prevented the changes via TLR3-mediated signal pathways. In hTERT-HNECs, GJIC blockers reduced the expression of tight junction molecules claudin-1, -4, -7, occludin, tricellulin, and JAM-A. IM induced GJIC activity and enhanced the expression of claudin-1, -4, and JAM-A at the protein and mRNA levels with an increase of  . GJIC blockers prevented the increase of the tight junction proteins induced by IM. Furthermore, IM prevented the reduction of JAM-A but not induction of IL-8 and TNF-α induced by poly(I:C). In conclusion, IM can maintain the GJIC-dependent tight junctional  via regulation of GJIC in upper airway nasal epithelium. Therefore, it is possible that IM may be useful as a nasal spray to prevent the disruption of the epithelial  by viral infections and exposure to allergens in human nasal mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376617>Antimicrobial packaging based on a LAE containing zein coating to control foodborne pathogens in chicken soup.</a></h2><p>In this study, zein coatings containing Lauroyl-l-arginine ethyl ester monohydrochloride (LAE) were developed to be applied on polypropylene films and manufacture an active food packaging. The concentration of LAE and the addition of a suitable plasticizer (glycerol or  (OA)) were the main variables considered. Active plasticized zein films, with glycerol or  were characterized in terms of release kinetics, mechanical, , optical, and antimicrobial properties. Results showed that active agent concentration, (5 and 10%), had no-significant effect on mechanical and WVP properties of the plasticized films. Films plasticized with OA presented greater water resistance, UV-light opacity, and water  properties than glycerol-plasticized films. On the contrary, the latter had better antimicrobial properties. The analysis of LAE release kinetics from films to different food simulants revealed different behaviours, depending on both film formulation and food simulant. Despite the lower water resistance of coatings containing glycerol, bags based on polypropylene/glycerol plasticized zein containing 10% of LAE presented a great antimicrobial activity in tests with chicken soup (real food system) contaminated with pathogen bacteria, concretely, the films showed 3.21 Log reduction against Listeria monocytogenes and 3.07 log reductions against Escherichia coli. These results suggest a promising strategy on the use of LAE-containing zein in active food packaging to control foodborne pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, rat pups underwent oral administration of oil (palm, rapeseed, or sunflower oil) or water (10 μL/g body weight, postnatal days 10-15). Subsequently, colon goblet cells were studied by Western blotting, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry and colonic transmucosal electrical resistance was measured by using Ussing chambers.In vitro, palmitic  enhanced MUC2 production (140% of control) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α expression, whereas , linoleic, γ-linolenic, α-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic acids reduced MUC2 expression (at least -50% of control). All unsaturated LCFAs decreased the expression of human atonal homolog 1, a transcription factor controlling goblet cell differentiation (at least -31% vs. control). In vivo, rats fed palm oil had higher palmitic  concentrations (3-fold) in their colonic contents and increased mucus granule surfaces in their goblet cells (>2-fold) than did all other groups. Palm oil also increased colonic transmucosal electrical resistance (245% of control), yet had no effect on occludin and zonula occludens-1 expression. In contrast, sunflower and rapeseed oils decreased goblet cell number when compared with control (at least -10%) and palm oil (at least -14%) groups.Palm oil in rat pups and palmitic  in HT29-MTX cells increase the production of MUC2 and strengthen the intestinal .

Certain chemical functionality such as the carboxylic  is a general liability for BBB permeability preventing significant CNS distribution of a drug from a systemic dose. Here, we report a strategy for CNS-selective distribution of the carboxylic  containing thyromimetic sobetirome using prodrugs targeted to fatty- amide hydrolase (FAAH), which is expressed in the brain. Two amide prodrugs of sobetirome were shown to be efficient substrates of FAAH with V/K values comparable to the natural endocannabinoid FAAH substrate anandamide. In mice, a systemic dose of sobetirome prodrug leads to a substantial ∼60-fold increase in brain distribution (K) of sobetirome compared to an equimolar systemic dose of the parent drug. The increased delivery of sobetirome to the brain from the prodrug was diminished by both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of FAAH in vivo. The increased brain exposure of sobetirome arising from the prodrug corresponds to ∼30-fold increased potency in brain target engagement compared to the parent drug. These results suggest that FAAH-targeted prodrugs can considerably increase drug exposure to the CNS with a concomitant decrease in systemic drug levels generating a desirable distribution profile for CNS acting drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913425>CD36 mediates H2O2-induced calcium influx in lung microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and intracellular Ca play a key role in endothelial  dysfunction in acute lung injury. We previously showed that HO-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca]) in lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) involve the membrane Ca channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) and that inhibiting this channel attenuated HO-induced  disruption in vitro. We also showed that phosphorylation of TRPV4 by the Src family kinase, Fyn, contributes to HO-induced Ca influx in LMVEC. In endothelial cells, Fyn is tethered to the cell membrane by CD36, a fatty  transporter. In this study, we assessed the effect of genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of CD36 on Ca responses to HO HO-induced Ca influx was attenuated in LMVEC isolated from mice lacking CD36 (CD36). TRPV4 expression and  was unchanged in LMVEC isolated from wild-type (WT) and CD36 mice, as well as mice with deficiency for Fyn (Fyn). TRPV4 immunoprecipitated with Fyn, but this interaction was decreased in CD36 LMVEC. The amount of phosphorylated TRPV4 was decreased in LMVEC from CD36 mice compared with WT controls. Loss of CD36 altered subcellular localization of Fyn, while inhibition of CD36 fatty  transport with succinimidyl oleate did not attenuate HO-induced Ca influx. Lastly, we found that CD36 mice were protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD36 plays an important role in HO-mediated lung injury and that the mechanism may involve CD36-dependent scaffolding of Fyn to the cell membrane to facilitate TRPV4 phosphorylation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30508486>-Induced Activated Cell-Penetrating Peptide-Modified Cholesterol-Conjugated Polyoxyethylene Sorbitol Oleate Mixed Micelles for pH-Triggered Drug Release and Efficient Brain Tumor Targeting Based on a Charge Reversal Mechanism.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma multiforme is the most devastating malignant brain tumor in adults.

A cell-penetrating peptide, arginine-glycine repeats (RG), was incorporated into the micelles to improve cellular uptake, while a pH-sensitive masking sequence, histidine-glutamic  repeats (HE), was introduced for charge shielding to minimize nonspecific binding and uptake at physiological pH. Results demonstrated that (RG)- and (HE)-modified mixed micelles were optimized using this strategy to effectively mask the cationic charges of the activated cell-penetrating peptide (RG) at physiological pH, i.e., limiting internalization, and were selectively triggered in response to a mildly acidic microenvironment in vitro based on a charge reversal mechanism. In vivo results further confirmed that such micelles preferentially accumulated in both brain and tumor tissues in both xenograft and orthotropic glioma mouse models. Furthermore, micelles significantly inhibited tumor growth with limited toxicity to peripheral tissues. The combination of BBB penetration, tumor targeting, potent efficacy, and high tolerance of these micelles strongly suggests that they could be a promising candidate for safe and effective drug delivery to the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29885472>Neurotoxicity assessment of -coated iron oxide nanoparticles in SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h2><p>Iron oxide nanoparticles (ION) awaken a particular interest for biomedical applications due to their unique physicochemical properties, especially superparamagnetism, and ability to cross the blood-brain . ION surface can be coated to improve their properties and facilitate functionalization. Still, coating may affect toxicity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possible effects of -coated ION (O-ION) on human neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y). A set of assays was conducted in complete and serum-free culture media for 3 and 24 h to assess O-ION cytotoxic effects - cell membrane disruption, cell cycle alteration and cell death induction -, and genotoxic effects - primary DNA damage, H2AX phosphorylation and micronuclei induction -, considering also DNA repair competence and iron ion release. Results obtained show that O-ION exhibit a moderate cytotoxicity related to cell membrane impairment, cell cycle disruption and cell death induction, especially notable in serum-free medium. Iron ion release was only observed in complete medium, indicating that cytotoxicity observed was not related to the presence of ions in the medium. However, O-ION genotoxic effects were limited to the induction of primary DNA damage, not related to double strand breaks, and this damage did not become fixed in cells in most conditions. Alterations in repair ability (DNA repair competence assay) were observed when cells where treated with O-ION before or during the challenge with HO, but not during the repair period. Further investigation is needed to clarify the possible role of oxidative stress and protein corona on observed O-ION toxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-based emulsion coating (CNFC: 0.3% CNF/1% /1% sucrose ester fatty  (w/w wet base)) had low contact angle, high spread coefficient onto banana surfaces, and lower surface tension (ST, 25.4mN/m) than the critical ST (35.2mN/m) of banana peels, and exhibited good wettability onto banana surfaces. CNFC coating delayed the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and reduced ethylene and CO production, thus delaying fruit ripening. As the result, CNFC coating minimized chlorophyll degradation, weight loss, and firmness of bananas while ensuring the properly fruit ripening during 10d of ambient storage. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of CNF based emulsion coatings for improving the storability of postharvest bananas.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed its contribution in disease progression using three different ALI mouse models. The administration of hydrochloric  (HCl) or  (OA)+ lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused tissue edema and neutrophil infiltration with TXA2 production in the lungs of the experimental mice. The administration of LPS induced only neutrophil accumulation without TXA2 production. Pretreatment with T prostanoid receptor (TP) antagonist attenuated the tissue edema but not neutrophil infiltration in these models. Intravital imaging and immunostaining demonstrated that administration of TP agonist caused vascular hyper-permeability by disrupting the endothelial  formation in the mouse ear. In vitro experiments showed that TP-stimulation disrupted the endothelial adherens junction, and it was inhibited by Ca(2+) channel blockade or Rho kinase inhibition. Thus endogenous TXA2 exacerbates ALI, and its blockade attenuates it by modulating the extent of lung edema. This can be explained by the endothelial hyper-permeability caused by the activation of TXA2-TP axis, via Ca(2+)- and Rho kinase-dependent signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28646583>Sebum lipids influence macrophage polarization and activation.</a></h2><p>As lipids are known to regulate macrophage functions, it is reasonable to suppose that a sebocyte-macrophage axis mediated by sebum lipids may exist.To investigate if sebocytes could contribute to the differentiation, polarization and  of macrophages with their secreted lipids.Oil Red O lipid staining and Raman spectroscopy were used to assess the dermal lipid content and penetration.

Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this activation were examined. Role of a four-amino  PKA activation site, RGET, of hClC-2 was investigated using wild-type (WT) and mutant (AGET, RGEA, and AGAA) hClC-2 expressed in 293EBNA cells as well as involvement of PKA, intracellular cAMP concentration ([cAMP]), EP, or EP receptor agonist activity. All fatty acids [lubiprostone, cobiprostone, eicosatetraynoic  (ETYA), , and elaidic ] caused significant rightward shifts in concentration-dependent Cl current activation (increasing ECs) with mutant compared with WT hClC-2 channels, without changing time and voltage dependence, current-voltage rectification, or methadone inhibition of the channel. As with lubiprostone, cobiprostone activation of hClC-2 occurred with PKA inhibitor (myristoylated protein kinase inhibitor) present or when using double PKA activation site (RRAA/RGEA) mutant. Cobiprostone did not activate human CFTR. Fatty acids did not increase [cAMP] in hClC-2/293EBNA or T84 cells. Using T84 CFTR knockdown cells, cobiprostone increased hClC-2 Cl currents without increasing [cAMP] while PGE and forskolin-IBMX increased both. Fatty acids were not agonists of EP or EP receptors. L-161,982, a supposed EP-selective inhibitor, had no effect on lubiprostone-activated hClC-2 Cl currents but significantly decreased T84 cell   measured by transepithelial resistance and fluorescent dextran transepithelial movement. The present findings show that RGET of hClC-2 (possible binding site) plays an important functional role in fatty  activation of hClC-2. PKA, [cAMP], and EP or EP receptors are not involved.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the cellular uptake and binding processes of free and protein-bound unesterified DHA in retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) line ARPE-19 as a model of the human outer blood-retinal  and isolated porcine RPE cell fractions. Uptake of free [C]DHA by ARPE-19 cells was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 283 µM, and was significantly inhibited by eicosapentaenoic , arachidonic , and linoleic , but not by . Further, the uptakes of [C]DHA associated with retinol-binding protein ([C]DHA-RBP), [C]DHA associated with low-density lipoprotein ([C]DHA-LDL) and [C]DHA associated with bovine serum albumin ([C]DHA-BSA) in ARPE-19 cells increased time-dependently at 37°C, and were significantly reduced at 4°C, suggesting the involvement of energy-dependent transport processes. [C]DHA-LDL uptake by ARPE-19 cells was significantly inhibited by excess unlabeled LDL, but not by an inhibitor of scavenger receptor B type I. Fatty  transport protein (FATP) 2 and 4 mRNAs were expressed in ARPE-19 cells, and [C]DHA uptake was observed in FATP2- and FATP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Photo-reactive crosslinking and mass spectrometry analyses identified 65-kDa retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein (RPE65) as a DHA-binding protein in porcine RPE cell membrane fractions. Thus, RPE cells possess multiple cellular transport/binding processes for unesterified DHA, involving at least partly FATP2, FATP4, LDL, RBP, and RPE65.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478159>Simultaneous lipolysis/permeation in vitro model, for the estimation of bioavailability of lipid based drug delivery systems.</a></h2><p>The simultaneous processes of lipid digestion and absorption together determine the oral bioavailability of drugs incorporated into lipid based drug delivery systems (LBDDS). A number of slightly different protocols for in vitro lipolysis are widely accepted; however, the permeation process has so far not been included into the models due to the harsh conditions of lipid digestion compromising permeation barriers. The present study for the first time combines biomimetic permeation and lipolysis of LBDDS. The focus of the current work was on the functional stability of the  - Permeapad during lipid digestion. Using calcein as a marker molecule the investigations demonstrated that the  was able to maintain its permeation properties in the presence of the SNEDDS (self-emulsifying drug delivery system) formulation, the lipolysis medium, and the lipolysis medium while digesting the SNEDDS. Furthermore, the permeation of cinnarizine (CINN) from SNEDDS was demonstrated to be lower, if the formulation as such was applied as compared to the digested formulation. This support the general perception that meaningful in vitro evaluation of lipid based formulations requires consideration of both, the digestion and absorption, i.e. lipolysis and permeation.Copyright © 2017.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty   did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty  palmitic  accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a   of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, it was suggested that acne subjects may have also impaired skin . We hypothesized that excess unsaturated free fatty acids (UFFA) present in the sebum may cause  impairment associated with increased follicular stratum corneum (SC) thickening and inflammation seen in acne. Therefore, epidermal and sebaceous lipid profiles from acne and healthy subjects were analyzed and an in vitro epidermal tissue model was developed to validate this hypothesis. Significantly increased levels of free fatty acids (p < 0.05) were observed in skin lipids of human acne vs. healthy subjects. Exposure of human epidermal equivalents (HEEs) to the UFFA  (OA), also present in sebum, led to  impairment associated with increased SC lipid disorder, increased secretion of interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and excessive SC thickening. Furthermore, the expression of genes encoding for inflammatory cytokines and epidermal differentiation proteins was also increased both in acne lesions and in OA-treated HEEs. Taken together, these data are in agreement with the hypothesis that excess UFFAs in sebum of acne subjects may contribute to impaired skin  associated with the increased follicular SC thickness and inflammation seen in acne. Moreover, OA induces similar molecular and phenotypic changes in HEEs as those seen in acne lesions and suggests that an UFFA-treated epidermal tissue model can be used to study the UFFA-mediated pathways involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne and for the development of appropriate therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883076>[Dexamethasone acetate microemulsions: formulation and effect on skin permeability].</a></h2><p>The present project was designed to optimize the microemulsion (ME) formulation of oil in water (O/W) for dexamethasone acetate (DA), and examine its impact on DA percutaneous permeation. The saturated solubility of DA in different oils, surfactants and co-surfactants was tested. The ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant was selected by constructing pseudo three phase diagrams to investigate the maximal microemulsion area. In vitro permeation studies of DA from microemulsion and suspension were performed to optimize the formulation further. Differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) and attenuated total reflection flourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were performed to investigate the mechanism of microemulsion action on skin. The optimized formulation was composed of /Labrasol/propylene glycol/water with 8/45/15/32 (w/w), and the DA loading was 0.75% (w/w). The permeation enhancement of microemusion was 6.00-fold as that of suspension, and the DA from microemulsion retained in the skin was 4.79-fold as that of suspension. DSC and ATR-FTIR results suggested that microemulsion could affect the intercellular lipid lamellae and keratin of the stratum corneum. The   of stratum corneum was disordered by the microemulsion so that the dermal drug delivery was enhanced. Therefore, the optimized microemulsion enhanced DA percutaneous permeation significantly through the interaction of microemulsion with skin, microemulsion is a promising approach for DA percutaneous delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28681186> Derivatives of Dopamine and Respiration.</a></h2><p>Ventilatory inhibition is considered an undesirable pharmacological side effect of pharmacotherapy in neurodegenerative conditions underlain by brain dopamine deficiency. In this context,  derivatives of dopamine or N-acyl-dopamines are novel substances that may be of high therapeutic interest as having the ability to cross the blood-brain  and acting in dopamine-like manner. In the present study we seek to define the influence of N-acyl-dopamines on lung ventilation and its hypoxic responses in the rat. We found that N-oleoyl-dopamine decreased both normoxic and peak hypoxic ventilation in response to 8% acute hypoxia, on average, by 31% and 41%, respectively. Its metabolite, 3'-O-methyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine, caused a 15% ventilatory decrease each, whereas an  ester derivative, 3'-O-oleoyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine, caused 11% and 19% ventilatory decreases, respectively. All three N-acyl-dopamines investigated displayed an inhibitory effect on ventilation. The findings indicate that 3'-O-methyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine and 3'-O-oleoyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine performed better than N-oleoyl-dopamine in term of less ventilatory suppression, albeit the differences among the three compounds were modest. We conclude that N-acyl-dopamines are worthy of intensified explorations as potential carriers of dopamine molecule in view of the lack of clinically effective methods of dopamine delivery into the brain in neurodegenerative conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899364>A bacterial metabolite ameliorates periodontal pathogen-induced gingival epithelial  disruption via GPR40 signaling.</a></h2><p>Several studies have demonstrated the remarkable properties of microbiota and their metabolites in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a bioactive metabolite generated by probiotic microorganisms during the process of fatty  metabolism, has been studied for its protective effects against epithelial  impairment in the intestines. Herein, we examined the effect of HYA on gingival epithelial   and its possible application for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. We found that GPR40, a fatty  receptor, was expressed on gingival epithelial cells; activation of GPR40 by HYA significantly inhibited  impairment induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, a representative periodontopathic bacterium. The degradation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, basic components of the epithelial , was prevented in a GPR40-dependent manner in vitro. Oral inoculation of HYA in a mouse experimental periodontitis model suppressed the bacteria-induced degradation of E-cadherin and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production in the gingival tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that HYA exerts a protective , through GPR40 signaling, against periodontopathic bacteria-induced gingival epithelial  impairment and contributes to the suppression of inflammatory responses in periodontal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28253633>Fatty acids penetration into human skin ex vivo: A TOF-SIMS analysis approach.</a></h2><p>Linoleic, , palmitoleic, palmitic, and stearic fatty acids (FAs) are commonly used in dermatological formulations. They differ by their structure, presence in the skin, and mode of application in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics compounding. These FAs are also known as chemical penetration enhancers, but their mechanisms of penetration enhancement and effect on  characteristics of the skin require additional study. In this study, the authors conducted an ex vivo analysis of the distribution of lipid components in the epidermis and dermis of human skin after applying individual FAs. The goal was to elucidate possible mechanisms of penetration enhancement and FA effects on  characteristics of the skin. FA penetration studies were conducted ex vivo on human skin and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) bioimaging analysis was performed to visualize and analyze distribution of FAs in skin sections. The current study demonstrated that TOF-SIMS imaging was effective in visualizing the distribution of linoleic, , palmitoleic, palmitic, and stearic  in the human skin ex vivo after the skin penetration experiment of individual FAs. The integration of the obtained TOF-SIMS images allowed a semiquantitative comparison of the effects induced by individual FA applications on the human skin ex vivo. FAs showed varying abilities to penetrate the skin and disorder the FAs within the skin, based on their structures and physicochemical properties. Linoleic  penetrated the skin and changed the distribution of all the analyzed FAs. Skin treatment with palmitoleic or  increased the amounts of singular FAs in the skin. Penetration of saturated FAs was low, but it increased the detected amounts of linoleic  in both skin layers. The results indicate that application of FAs on the skin surface induce redistribution of native FAs not only in the stratum corneum layer of epidermis but also in the lipid content of full epidermis and dermis layers. The results indicate that topically applied pharmaceutical products should be evaluated for potential chemical penetration enhancement and lipid component redistribution effects during formulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29426257>Lipid-based nanocarrier efficiently delivers highly water soluble drug across the blood-brain  into brain.</a></h2><p>Delivering highly water soluble drugs across blood-brain  (BBB) is a crucial challenge for the formulation scientists. A successful therapeutic intervention by developing a suitable drug delivery system may revolutionize treatment across BBB. Efforts were given here to unravel the capability of a newly developed fatty  combination (stearic ::palmitic  = 8.08:4.13:1) (ML) as fundamental component of nanocarrier to deliver highly water soluble zidovudine (AZT) as a model drug into brain across BBB. A comparison was made with an experimentally developed standard phospholipid-based nanocarrier containing AZT. Both the formulations had nanosize spherical unilamellar vesicular structure with highly negative zeta potential along with sustained drug release profiles. Gamma scintigraphic images showed both the radiolabeled formulations successfully crossed BBB, but longer retention in brain was observed for ML-based formulation (MGF) as compared to soya lecithin (SL)-based drug carrier (SYF). Plasma and brain pharmacokinetic data showed less clearance, prolonged residence time, more bioavailability and sustained release of AZT from MGF in rats compared to those data of the rats treated with SYF/AZT suspension. Thus, ML may be utilized to successfully develop drug nanocarrier to deliver drug into brain across BBB, in a sustained manner for a prolong period of time and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy for many diseases of brain. Further, many anti-HIV drugs cannot cross BBB sufficiently. Hence, the developed formulation may be a suitable option to carry those drugs into brain for better therapeutic management of HIV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095531>Low-level red LED light inhibits hyperkeratinization and inflammation induced by unsaturated fatty  in an in vitro model mimicking acne.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units (PSU), associated with increased sebum production, abnormal follicular keratinization (hyperkeratinization), follicular overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), and increased inflammatory mediator release. Light therapy has attracted medical interests as a safe alternative treatment for acne. Both blue and red light therapies at high doses >10 J/cm have demonstrated marked effects on inflammatory acne lesions. However, few studies have investigated the effects of lower doses of light. The aim of this study is to investigate the biological effects of lower doses of red light at 0.2-1.2 J/cm for acne using an in vitro model previously developed to mimic the inflammation and hyperkeratinization observed clinically in acne.Human epidermal equivalents were topically exposed to an unsaturated fatty ,  (OA), followed by red light-emitting diode (LED) light treatments (light-plus-OA treatments). Endpoints evaluated included the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1α, epidermal  integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and stratum corneum (SC) thickness to monitor hyperkeratinization.OA-induced IL-1α release was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced following red LED light at 0.2, 0.5, and 1.2 J/cm , from 266 ± 11 pg/ml of no-light-plus-OA-treated (OA treatment without light) controls to 216 ± 9, 231 ± 8, and 212 ± 7 pg/ml, respectively. Histological examination showed that SC thickening following OA treatment was reduced from 43% of total epidermis for no-light-plus-OA treatment to 37% and 38% of total epidermis following 0.5 and 1.1 J/cm red light plus OA treatment, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, 1.1 J/cm red-light-plus-OA treatment improved OA-induced TEER changes from 29% of baseline for no-light-plus-OA treatment, to 36% of baseline.Low level red LED light therapy could provide beneficial effects of anti-inflammation, normalizing pilosebaceous hyperkeratinization, and improving  impairment in Acne vulgaris.

Differential tape stripping was performed, followed by cyanoacrylate skin surface biopsies to determine the amount of caffeine in the hair follicles, and skin extraction to determine the retention of caffeine in the skin.Nanoemulsions significantly increased caffeine permeation through open and untreated skin over control (untreated: 36- and 42-fold for OA and EU, respectively; open: 40- and 49-fold). The follicular route contributed 53.7% of caffeine permeation for the OA nanoemulsion and 51% for EU when follicles were opened. Nanoemulsions promoted 4- and 3.4-fold increases in caffeine retention in open follicles, for OA and EU, respectively. Retention of caffeine in the stratum corneum and skin was almost equal in all cases.This study demonstrated effective delivery of caffeine as a hydrophilic model drug into and through hair follicles and showed that follicles and surrounding regions may be targeted by optimised formulations for specific treatments.© 2018 S.

In this study, we demonstrated the role of 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl) methane (DIM-D) in the prevention of skin photocarcinogenesis using an in vivo UVB-induced skin cancer model. We also evaluated the efficiency of -modified nanostructured lipid carriers to deliver DIM-D across the skin  into the epidermis for chemopreventive activity. Nanocarriers were 203.00 ± 21.21 nm in diameter with polydispersity, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of 0.33 ± 0.01, 37.17 ± 0.90 mV and 93.64 ± 0.65%, respectively. -modified nanocarriers were incorporated into Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose to form DIM-D-Nanogel (DIM-D-N). DIM-D-N pretreatment prior to UVB exposure delayed tumor initiation and reduced tumor multiplicity (p < 0.05) at the end of the study compared to Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) gel pretreatment. DIM-D-N pretreatment decreased UVB-induced damage to skin lipids and proteins (p < 0.05), respectively by 7.63 and 2.56-fold less than EGCG gel pretreatment and by 17.86 and 11.92-fold less than UVB-only treatment. Histology showed rete-ridge extension, epidermal thickening and hyperkeratosis for UVB-only treatment and EGCG gel pretreatment; DIM-D-N pretreatment showed similar features as the negative control. Western blot analysis showed increased Nurr1 expression (p < 0.05) for DIM-D-N pretreated group compared to EGCG gel (4.68-fold). DIM-D-N pretreatment reduced BCI-2 expression (p < 0.05) but increased Bax and cPARP. Knock down studies with Nurr1 siRNA reduced the expressions of Nurr1 and cPARP by 8.18 and 1.45-fold, respectively (p < 0.05).
