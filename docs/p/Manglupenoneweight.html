Changes in microbiome composition are implicated in virulence adaptation by herbivores to host plant species or host populations (including crop varieties). We examined patterns in adaptation by the green leafhopper, , to near-isogenic rice lines (NILs) with one or two resistance genes and the recurrent parent T65, without resistance genes. Only the line with two resistance genes was effective in reducing leafhopper fitness. After 20 generations on the resistant line, selected leafhoppers attained similar survival,  gain, and egg laying to leafhoppers that were continually reared on the susceptible recurrent parent, indicating that they had adapted to the resistant host. By sequencing the 16s rRNA gene, we described the microbiome of leafhoppers from colonies associated with five collection sites, and continually reared or switched between NILs. The microbiomes included 69-119 OTUs of which 44 occurred in ≥90% of samples. Of these, 14 OTUs were assigned to the obligate symbiont  clade. After 20 generations of selection, collection site had a greater effect than host plant on microbiome composition. Six bacteria genera, including , were associated with leafhopper virulence. However, there was significant within-treatment, site-related variability in the prevalence of these taxa such that the mechanisms underlying their association with virulence remain to be determined. Our results imply that these taxa are associated with leafhopper nutrition. Ours is the first study to describe microbiome diversity and composition in rice leafhoppers. We discuss our results in light of the multiple functions of herbivore microbiomes during virulence adaptation in insect herbivores.© 2019 The Authors.

Accurate assessment to quantify the severity of these deformities by clinical examination alone can be challenging. Radiographs are a valuable adjunct for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. However, static radiographs during relaxed standing may not reflect the dynamic changes in the foot skeleton during functional activities such as walking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to predict dynamic foot movements during walking from planar standing radiographs to reveal the significance of the radiographic analysis for the assessment of foot function.Patients 8-17 years with flexible flatfeet (FFF, n=217) recurrent clubfeet (RCF n=38) and overcorrected clubfeet (OCCF, n=71) of non-neurogenic or syndromic origin and pes cavovarus due to peripheral neuropathy (PNP, n=48) were retrospectively included. Patients underwent gait analysis with the Oxford Foot Model and radiographic examination in anterior-posterior and lateral view during standing. Multilinear predictor analysis of selected gait parameters was performed based on radiographic .The variance that was explained by radiography was greatest for the transverse plane forefoot abduction with 33% for OCCF, 50% for RCF and 59% for PNP. Flatfeet and foot kinematics in the other planes or between rearfoot and tibia showed little or no relation.The static  of foot deformities by radiography could explain only a small amount of variance in foot kinematics during walking, in particular for FFF. An explanation may be that the forces during  bearing bear little resemblance to those during gait in terms of neither magnitude nor direction. These findings suggest that foot function cannot be accurately assessed solely from static radiographic observations of the foot, commonly undertaken in clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 European Foot and Ankle Society.

In liver transplantation, liver graft arterial supply depends on the recipient's hepatic artery, as the gastro-duodenal artery has generally been ligated. A decreased graft arterial flow caused by coeliac trunk stenosis might induce hepatic artery thrombosis leading to graft loss. In this short report the authors describe a liver transplant procedure during which recipient's hepatic artery pressure was dramatically decreased after ligature of the gastro-duodenal artery. Dissection and division of the median arcuate ligament allowed to restore an excellent blood flow through the hepatic artery. This report reminds how important it is to be able to recognize and how to manage a stenosing median arcuate ligament in liver transplantation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695277>High tibial osteotomy in obese patients: Is successful surgery enough for a good outcome?</a></h1><p>Knee osteoarthritis is the most common articular pathology. High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a frequently used treatment procedure in medial osteoarthritis of the knee joint. We aimed to reveal factors that affect clinical and radiologic outcomes by evaluating the efficacy of HTO in patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 who were not appropriate for prostheses considering their activity, degree of pain, and age.HTO was performed using the medial open wedge technique who presented to the orthopedics polyclinic with symptoms of knee pain, whose BMI was over 30 kg/m2. All patients were diagnosed as having mechanical axis deviation and isolated medial compartmental arthrosis between 2013 and 2015.The clinical and radiologic follow-ups of patients were performed on day 45, at month 3, month 6, and after 1 year. The knee scoring system from the American Knee Society (AKS), and range of motion (ROM) were used in the functional evaluation of the patients.Eighteen patients were included in the study. Thirteen patients (72.2%) were women and 5 (27.8%) were men. Preop axis score was found significantly lower compared with the axis scores at postop month 6 and in final follow-up, the postoperative final follow-up axis score was found significantly lower than the axis score at month 6 (p < 0.05).We anticipated in our study that the better outcomes obtained in the early period might be maintained for longer in parallel with  loss and decreased BMI in the postoperative period. We believe that it is important to perform complication-free HTO with the correct technique, and by organizing a rapid and systematic  loss process.© 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695075>Mapping quantitative trait loci for yield-related traits and predicting candidate genes for grain  in maize.</a></h1><p>Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapped in different genetic populations are of great significance for marker-assisted breeding. In this study, an F population were developed from the crossing of two maize inbred lines SG-5 and SG-7 and applied to QTL mapping for seven yield-related traits. The seven traits included 100-kernel , ear length, ear diameter, cob diameter, kernel row number, ear , and grain  per plant. Based on an ultra-high density linkage map, a total of thirty-three QTLs were detected for the seven studied traits with composite interval mapping (CIM) method, and fifty-four QTLs were indentified with genome-wide composite interval mapping (GCIM) methods. For these QTLs, Fourteen were both detected by CIM and GCIM methods. Besides, eight of the thirty QTLs detected by CIM were identical to those previously mapped using a F population (generating from the same cross as the mapping population in this study), and fifteen were identical to the reported QTLs in other recent studies. For the fifty-four QTLs detected by GCIM, five of them were consistent with the QTLs mapped in the F population of SG-5 × SG-7, and twenty one had been reported in other recent studies. The stable QTLs associated with grain  were located on maize chromosomes 2, 5, 7, and 9. In addition, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SG-5 and SG-7 were obtained from the transcriptomic profiling of grain at different developmental stages and overlaid onto the stable QTLs intervals to predict candidate genes for grain  in maize. In the physical intervals of confirmed QTLs qKW-7, qEW-9, qEW-10, qGWP-6, qGWP-8, qGWP-10, qGWP-11 and qGWP-12, there were 213 DEGs in total. Finally, eight genes were predicted as candidate genes for grain size/. In summary, the stable QTLs would be reliable and the candidate genes predicted would be benefit for maker assisted breeding or cloning.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697893>Tailoring Kidney Transport of Organic Dyes with Low Molecular- PEGylation.</a></h1><p>Subtle changes in size can induce distinct responses of the  to hard nanomaterials; however, it is largely unknown whether just few ethylene oxide-unit differences in soft poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules could significantly alter the renal clearance of small molecules. By systematically investigating in vivo transport of the representative renal clearable organic dyes, IRDye800CW after being conjugated with a series of PEG molecules with molecular  (MW) below 10 kDa, we found a MW-dependent scaling law: PEG45 (MW=2100 Da) is an optimized MW to generate the most efficient renal clearance for IRDye800CW by expediting the glomerular filtration of organic dyes and reducing their nonspecific interactions with background tissue. Moreover, the uniqueness of PEG45 can be generalized to other organic dyes such as ZW800-1 and fluorescein. This finding highlights the importance of low-MW PEGylation in tailoring in vivo transport of organic fluorophores, which would broaden their biomedical applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696541>Differences in ocular biometry between urban and rural children matched by refractive error: the Shandong Children Eye Study.</a></h1><p>To determine the differences in mean ocular dimensions between urban and rural children and identify possible influencing factors.This work uses previously published data from the Shandong Children Eye Study, which was based on a random cluster sampling applied to a cross-sectional school-based study design in the rural Guanxian County and Weihai city. All children underwent auto-refractometry and biometry under cycloplegia.The study included 3290 children (aged 9.35 ± 2.93 years), consisting of 888 pairs of boys and 757 pairs of girls matched by sex, age and refractive error (each pair matching one child from urban cohort with one from the rural cohort). Overall urban children were significantly taller and heavier than rural children (t-test; p < 0.001), which was confirmed for all age groups for . Urban ocular axial lengths were significantly longer by 0.23 mm compared to the rural population (t-test; p < 0.001), mostly in younger children and boys. Meanwhile, corneal curvatures were flatter in the urban cohort by 0.08 mm (p < 0.001). This association of axial length with urban vs rural region was reduced in magnitude by 69.7% after accounting for height.For the same, matched refractive error, children from urban regions had significantly longer eyes and flatter corneal curvature than rural children. Since corneal curvature is defined during the first 2 years of life, early environmental factors may be the source of these differences in ocular dimensions.© 2019 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2019 College of Optometrists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694632>Heritabilities for the puppy  at birth in Labrador retrievers.</a></h1><p> at birth is an important predictor of neonatal mortality and morbidity in dogs. In addition, the birthweight of the puppies in a litter influences the decision to perform a cesarean section. The goal of the present study was to estimate heritabilities for the puppy birth  in Labrador retrievers.Of the 1138 Labrador retriever litters whelped at the Guiding Eye for the Blind between September 2001 and February 2018, 1013 were included in the analyses after data editing. Puppy  at birth was the target trait, measured on a continuous scale in pounds, and converted to grams. Linear mixed models were used to identify factors influencing puppy  at birth. The analyses showed that the sex of the puppy, litter size, length of gestation, adult  of the dam, parity, year of birth and inbreeding coefficient of the puppies and dams contributed to the variance of the puppy birth . Dam and litter effects were included as random effects. A multiple trait derivative free restricted maximum likelihood approach was used to estimate variance components and genetic parameters with two animal models, one without covariates (Model 1) and one with covariates (Model 2). Sex of the puppy and litter size had moderate effects, whereas gestation length, adult  of the dam, parity, year of birth and inbreeding coefficients of the dam and the puppies had minor effects. Estimates for Model 1 and Model 2 were 0.21 and 0.17 for the direct heritabilities, 0.22 and 0.22 for the maternal additive genetic heritabilities, 0.07 and 0.07 for the maternal permanent environmental proportions, and 0.14 and 0.08 for the environmental proportion of the litter.In order to estimate reliable breeding values for puppy  at birth, sex of puppy, litter size, length of gestation and the adult  of the dam should be included. Estimates could benefit from weighing the dams prior to each mating.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695289>Arthroscopic ankle fusion to manage sequel of loss of lateral malleoli in compound crushed ankle injury.</a></h1><p>Defect in the lateral malleolus along with lateral ligamentous injury of ankle is rare. It occurs mainly due to resection of distal fibula tumors and severe trauma leading to loss of lateral malleolus. Lateral malleoli has the major contribution in  transmission to foot and ankle stability. To avoid persistent pain and gait abnormality due to ankle instability, reconstruction of bony defect is inevitable. Methods to address these defects are iliac crest bone grafting, vascular and nonvascular proximal fibula transfer, patella tendon bone graft and allograft. Donor site morbidity, allograft related problems are not rare. Arthrodesis of ankle gives painless stable joint. Arthrodesis can be performed by open and arthroscopic methods. Open method has more soft tissue dissection and too difficult in scenario with previous skin grafting with adherent skin to bone. We managed a case of compound ankle injury with loss of lateral malleolus with loss of lateral ligament in stages, first management of compound crushed ankle followed by arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis. Even after 6 year of follow patient has stable pain less ankle with satisfactory gait.© 2018 Delhi Orthopedic Association.

A well-established linear relationship exists between hypertension and obesity. The combined burden of hypertension and obesity poses significant health and economic challenges. Many environmental factors and genetic traits interact to contribute to obesity-linked hypertension. These include excess sodium re-absorption or secretion by the kidneys, a hypertensive shift of renal-pressure and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Most individuals suffering from hypertension need drugs in order to treat their raised blood pressure, and while a number of antihypertensive therapeutic agents are currently available, 50% of cases remain uncontrolled. In order to develop new and effective therapeutic agents combating obesity-induced hypertension, a thorough understanding of the molecular events leading to adipogenesis is critical. With the advent of whole genome and exome sequencing techniques, new genes and variants which can be used as markers for obesity and hypertension are being identified. This review examines the role played by alternative splicing (AS) as a contributing factor to the metabolic regulation of obesity-induced hypertension. Splicing mutations constitute at least 14% of the disease-causing mutations, thus implicating polymorphisms that effect splicing as indicators of disease susceptibility. The unique transcripts resulting from the alternate splicing of mRNA encoding proteins that play a key role in contributing to obesity would be vital to gain a proper understanding of the genetic causes of obesity. A greater knowledge of the genetic basis for obesity-linked hypertension will assist in the development of appropriate diagnostic tests as well as the identification of new personalized therapeutic targets against obesity-induced hypertension.© 2019 Dlamini et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697267>[Ten questions on venous thromboembolism].</a></h1><p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Childhood obesity prevention is therefore of primary importance; hence it is mandatory to understand its main causes and identify the mechanisms associated with  gain. Although its etiology can be partly attributed to genetic and behavioral factors, evidence from existing literature indicates that the perinatal environment may also increase the risk of childhood obesity; the latter, however, has not been thoroughly investigated and discussed.A literature search was conducted in scientific databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) in order to reveal recent epidemiologic studies, with emphasis on works from the last decade. Studies whose primary or secondary object was the association between type of delivery, breastfeeding and/or gestational diabetes mellitus with overweight and obesity in childhood and preadolescence were taken into account. Studies that did not meet the aim of the current review were excluded.The retrieved information revealed that there is a noteworthy association between perinatal factors and childhood and preadolescence overweight/obesity occurrence, though the exact pathways still need to be elucidated.Public health professionals should take into account perinatal determinants when estimating a child's risk of overweight and obesity development.

We aimed to study the different effects of FO versus soybean oil (SO) on growth, intestinal health and immune function of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) using a weaned piglet model. Forty pairs of male IUGR and normal birth  piglets, weaned at 21 ± 1 d, were fed diets containing either 4% FO or SO for 3 weeks consecutively. Growth performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal function parameters, immunology and microbiota composition were determined. IUGR led to a poor growth rate, nutrient digestibility and abnormal immunology variables, whereas feeding FO diet improved systemic and gut immunity, as indicated by increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G and decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and down-regulated intestinal expression of genes (MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-10). Although IUGR tended to decrease villous height, feeding FO diet tended to increase the villi-crypt ratio and up-regulated expressions of tight junction genes (Claudin-1 and ZO-1), together with increased mucosa contents of n-3 PUFAs and a lower Σn-6/Σn-3 ratio. Besides, FO diet decreased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria Spirochaetes, and increased phylum Actinobacteria, and genera Blautia and Bifidobacterium in colonic digesta. Our findings indicate that IUGR impairs growth rate, nutrient digestibility, and partly immunology variables, whereas feeding FO-supplemented diet could improve intestinal function and immunity of both IUGR and NBW pigs, associated with the altered gut microbiome and mucosal fatty acid profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697059>Tailoring different molecular  phenylene-polybenzimidazole membranes with remarkable oxidative stability and conductive properties for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells.</a></h1><p>Polybenzimidazole (ph-PBI) polymer was synthesized with different molecular  (MWs), and casted into conductive films for high temperature fuel cell (FC) uses.

We aimed to construct a measure of mental health competence (MHC), a skills-based assessment of positive mental health, using existing survey items in a representative sample of UK children, and to investigate its overlap with mental health difficulties (MHD), socio-demographic patterning, and relationships with physical health and cognitive development.We analysed the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) when children were aged 11 years. Maternal (n = 12,082) and teacher (n = 6739) reports of prosocial behaviours (PS) and learning skills (LS) were entered into latent class models to create MHC . Using descriptive statistics, we examined relationships between MHC and MHD, and the socio-demographic patterning of MHC. Associations between MHC and physical health and cognitive development were examined with relative risk ratios [RRR] (from multinomial models): BMI status (healthy , overweight, obesity); unintentional injuries since age 7 (none, 1, 2+); asthma symptoms (none, 1, 2+); and tertiles of test scores for verbal ability, spatial working memory and risk-taking. Models were adjusted for potential confounding.Four MHC classes were identified [percentages for maternal and teacher reports, respectively]: high MHC (high PS, high LS) [37%; 39%], high-moderate MHC (high PS, moderate LS) [36%; 26%]; moderate MHC (moderate PS, moderate LS) [19%; 19%]; low MHC (moderate PS, low LS) [8%; 16%]. Higher MHC was less common in socially disadvantaged children. While MHC and MHD were associated, there was sufficient separation to indicate that MHC captures more than the absence of MHD. Compared to children with high MHC, those in other MHC classes tended to have poorer physical health and cognitive development, particularly those with low MHC or high-moderate MHC. For example, children with maternal-report Low MHC were more likely to have experienced 2+ unintentional injuries (RRR: 1.5 [1.1-2.1]) and to have lower verbal ability scores (RRR: 2.5 [1.9-3.2]). Patterns of results were similar for maternal- and teacher-report MHC.MHC is not simply the inverse of MHD, and high MHC is associated with better physical health and cognitive development. Findings suggest that interventions to improve MHC may support healthy development, although they require replication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697926>Pregnane X receptor activation by its natural ligand Ginkgolide-A improves tight junction proteins expression and attenuates bacterial translocation in cirrhosis.</a></h1><p>Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and nuclear receptor expressed ubiquitously along gut-liver-axis. Inflammatory bowel disorders have been reported to implicate PXR in maintaining tight junction (TJ) integrity and countering inflammation. However, the hepatoprotective role of PXR activation in soothing bacterial translocation in liver cirrhosis has not been explored. Ginkgolide A (GA), a terpene trilactone from Ginkgo Biloba extract, is a natural ligand of rodent and human PXR. This study aims to investigate the effect of GA in activating PXR and improving associated tight junction integrity and reducing bacterial translocation in gut-liver axis of CCl induced cirrhosis model.Swiss albino mice were administered with CCl (0.5 ml/kg , i.p) in corn oil for 12 weeks at an interval of two times a week. Following ascites induction, mice were randomized & administered 100 mg/kg  of GA through oral gavage every day. At termination, blood, gut and liver tissues were collected for biochemical and molecular studies.When compared to naïve mice, protein expression of hepatic and small intestinal PXR, CYP3A, ZO-1 and occludin were found to be significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in CCl induced cirrhotic mice. Treatment with GA to cirrhotic mice significantly (p < 0.05) induced the expression of both hepatic and small intestinal PXR, CYP3A, ZO-1 and Occludin. Furthermore, increased (p < 0.01) hepatic and small intestinal NFκB was observed in CCl induced cirrhotic mice that was significantly (p < 0.05) lowered following GA treatment. Over expression of TLR4/MyD88/NFκB axis and its downstream pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL6 and IFN-γ were observed in CCl induced mice, and these indices were abrogated significantly after GA treatment. Furthermore, significantly increased plasma levels of bacterial translocation markers LBP and procalcitonin were found in CCl mice, which were reduced significantly (p < 0.05 & p < 0.0001) after GA treatment.In conclusion, our data supports the hypothesis that, GA treatment to CCl induced cirrhotic mice, activated hepatic and small intestinal PXR and diminished inflammation, thereby improving tight junction integrity and attenuating bacterial translocation.Copyright © 2019.

Secondly, it examines whether the presence of disturbed eating behaviours at enrolment is associated with the degree of  loss after 12 months of treatment.A total of 3621 patients aged 3-18 years enrolled in a multidisciplinary obesity treatment programme were studied. Follow-up data after a median of 12.4 months were available for 2055 patients. Upon entry, patients were assessed for the following disturbed eating behaviours: meal skipping, emotional eating, overeating and rapid eating. Height and  were measured at baseline and follow-up.At enrolment, median age was 11.4 years, median BMI SDS was 2.87, and 82.2% of patients exhibited one or more disturbed eating behaviours. The prevalence of meal skipping, emotional eating and rapid eating increased with age (P < 0.01). Patients who reported overeating or rapid eating exhibited a 0.06-0.11 higher BMI SDS at enrolment than patients without these disturbed eating behaviours (P < 0.02). After 1 year of treatment, BMI SDS was reduced in 75.7% of patients, and the median reduction was 0.24 (95% confidence interval: 0.22-0.27). Overeating was associated with a higher degree of  loss, while meal skipping, emotional eating and rapid eating did not associate with the degree of  loss at follow-up.Disturbed eating behaviours were highly prevalent in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, and varied with age and sex. After 1 year of treatment, the degree of obesity improved, regardless of the presence of disturbed eating behaviours at treatment initiation.© 2019 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695328>Silibinin attenuates high-fat diet-induced renal fibrosis of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Silibinin is a flavonoid compound which has medicinal value. Previous studies revealed that silibinin exhibited an anti-fibrotic effect. However, whether silibinin could attenuate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced renal fibrosis remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism by which silibinin regulated renal fibrosis induced by HFD.In the present study, human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) were treated with various concentrations of silibinin. Then, cell viability and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. In addition, HRGECs were exposed to 100 nM TGF-β1 for mimicking in vitro renal fibrosis. The expressions of collagen I, fibronectin, and α-SMA were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Protein levels of p-IκB and p-p65 were examined by Western blot; meanwhile, level of NF-κB was measured by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, HFD-induced mouse model of renal fibrosis was established. The mouse , fasting glucose, kidney /, microalbuminuria, kidney histopathology, and fibrotic area were measured to assess the severity of renal fibrosis.Low concentration of silibinin (≤50 μM) had no cytotoxicity, while high concentration of silibinin (≥75 μM) exhibited significant cytotoxicity. Additionally, TGF-β1 increased the expressions of collagen I, fibronectin, α-SMA, p-IκB, and p-p65 and decreased the level NF-κB, while these effects were notably reversed by 50 μM silibinin. Moreover, both 50 and 100 mg/kg silibinin greatly decreased HFD-induced the upregulation of kidney /, microalbuminuria, and fibrotic area. 100 mg/kg silibinin markedly reduced collagen I, fibronectin, and p-p65 expressions in mice renal tissues.Silibinin was able to attenuate renal fibrosis in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of NF-κB. These data suggested that silibinin may serve as a potential agent to alleviate the renal fibrosis of DN.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693836>Purification and characterization of an antibacterial substance from  strain HS36.</a></h1><p>A bacterial strain inhibiting the growth of , the causative agent of vibriosis, was isolated from fish intestines.

The amino acid composition of RIP was determined by a non-derivative method developed by our research group.RIP significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and total antioxidant capability (TAOC) but decreased the MDA level in the serum, kidney and liver. H&E stained sections of liver and kidney revealed D-galactose could cause serious injury and RIP could substantially attenuate the injury. The analysis of SDS-PAGE showed that four bands with molecular  of 19.2 kDa, 21.5 kDa, 24.8 kDa and 40.0 kDa were the main protein components of RIP.The results suggested that RIP had excellent antioxidant activity, which could be explored as a health-care product to retard aging and a good source of protein nutrition for human consumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698036>Bacterial overexpression and purification of soluble recombinant human serum albumin using maltose-binding protein and protein disulphide isomerase.</a></h1><p>Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant serum protein in healthy humans, plays important roles in many physiological processes and has wide clinical and research applications. Despite several efforts to obtain recombinant HSA (rHSA) from bacterial and eukaryotic expression systems, a low-cost and high-yield method for rHSA production is not available. The large molecular  and high disulphide content hamper the expression and production of rHSA using bacterial hosts. Hence, a strategy that uses a fusion technique and engineered Escherichia coli strains was employed to improve the expression of soluble rHSA in the bacterial cytoplasm. The solubilities of the b'a' domain of human protein disulphide isomerase (PDIb'a')- and maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged rHSA expressed in Origami 2 at 18 °C were notably increased by up to 90.1% and 96%, respectively. A simple and efficient protocol for rHSA purification was established and approximately 9.46 mg rHSA was successfully obtained from a 500-mL culture at 97% purity. However, rHSA was mostly obtained in soluble oligomeric form. By introducing a simple refolding and size-exclusion chromatography step, monomeric rHSA was obtained at 34% yield. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the similarity in the molecular  between E. coli-derived monomeric rHSA and commercial monomeric HSA.Copyright © 2019.

Bariatric surgery is a proven, effective method for sustained  loss. However, there is a relative paucity of data on the impact of bariatric surgery on renal outcomes.The primary objective was to evaluate the change in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery, at 12 months after the procedure. Secondary objectives were to determine the changes in ACR at (6 and 24 months), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 6, 12, and 24 months), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); 12 and 24 months) after the procedure.This observational retrospective cohort study included consecutive obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery.Provincial Bariatric Surgery Clinic at the Regina General Hospital, Saskatchewan.This study includes 471 consecutive obese adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery between 2008 and 2015.We studied the impact of bariatric surgery on  mass index (BMI), renal outcomes (urine ACR and eGFR) and metabolic outcomes (fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and HbA1c) in 471 patients.Patients were followed for 2 years postsurgery in the bariatric clinic. Mixed linear models that accounted for the repeated nature of the data were used to access changes in outcomes over time.Patients were predominantly female (81%) with a mean age (±SD) of 46 ± 10 years. Most patients (87%) had a BMI > 40 kg/m and 81% of the patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean BMI decreased from 47.7 ± 7.8 kg/m at baseline to 37.1 ± 7.9 kg/m at 6 months and 34.8 ± 8.8 kg/m at 12 months. In a subcohort of patients with microalbuminuria, ACR showed an improvement from a median [interquartile] value of 5.1 [3.7-7.5] mg/mmol at baseline to 2.3 [1.2-3.6] mg/mmol at 6 months ( = .007), to 1.4 [0.9-3.7] mg/mmol at 2-year follow-up ( < .001). Similarly, eGFR increased in patients with microalbuminuria from 109 ± 10 mL/min/1.73 m at baseline to 120 ± 36 mL/min/1.73 m at 2-year follow-up ( = .013). There were statistically significant reductions in triglycerides, fasting glucose, and HbA1c.This was a retrospective chart review, with the lack of a control group. Patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m were not considered for surgery, and we had to measure renal outcomes predominantly on the presence of proteinuria.Our results suggest bariatric surgery significantly decreased  and consequently improved renal and metabolic outcomes (eGFR, ACR, fasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides) in patients with elevated BMI.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695710>Evaluation and Identification of Promising Introgression Lines Derived From Wild  Species for Broadening the Genetic Base of Cultivated Pigeonpea [ (L.) Millsp.].</a></h1><p>Pigeonpea [ (L.) Millsp.], a multipurpose and nutritious grain legume crop, is cultivated for its protein-rich seeds mainly in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa. In spite of large breeding efforts for pigeonpea improvement in India and elsewhere, genetic enhancement is inadequate largely due to its narrow genetic base and crop susceptibility to stresses. Wild  species are novel source of genetic variations for the genetic upgradation of pigeonpea cultivars. In the present study, 75 introgression lines (ILs), derived from crosses involving cultivated pigeonpea variety ICPL 87119 and wild  and  from the secondary gene pool, were evaluated for yield and yield-attributing traits in diverse environments across locations and years. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis revealed large genetic variations for days to 50% flower, days to maturity, plant height, primary branches per plant, pods per plant, pod  per plant, 100-seed , and grain yield per plant. Superior ILs with mid-early to medium maturity duration identified in this study are useful genetic resources for use in pigeonpea breeding. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis unfolded large influence of environment and genotype × environment interaction for variations in yield. A few lines such as ICPL 15023 and ICPL 15072 with yield stability were identified, while a number of lines were completely resistant (0%) to sterility mosaic diseases and/or  wilt. These lines are novel genetic resources for broadening the genetic base of pigeonpea and bring yield stability and stress tolerance. High-yielding lines ICPL 15010, ICPL 15062, and ICPL 15072 have been included in the initial varietal trials (IVTs) of the All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on pigeonpea for wider evaluation across different agro-ecological zones in India for possible release as variety(ies).Copyright © 2019 Sharma, Paul, Kumar, Rao, Prashanti, Muniswamy and Sharma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696557>Analytical performance of canine acylated and unacylated ghrelin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.</a></h1><p>Ghrelin is a major appetite-stimulating hormone. It circulates as acylated ghrelin (AG) and unacylated ghrelin (UAG), which could have different metabolic actions in obesity. Our objective was to study the analytical performance of two new canine AG and UAG ELISAs using blood samples from healthy, normal- dogs. Additionally, the effect of a protease inhibitor (PI) on short-term sample storage was analyzed.The intra- and inter-assay precision for low, intermediate, and high AG and UAG concentrations, accuracy, limits of quantification (LQ), and detection limit (DL) of a blank sample were determined in ten healthy dogs. To study the effects of a PI on ghrelin concentrations, and AG and UAG concentrations were compared in five canine plasma samples stored for 1 month with (PI+), without (PI-), and with PI added at sample thawing (PI+th).The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 1.8%-5.7% and 2.9%-6.4% for the AG assay, and 0.8%-7.5% and 2.8%-13.4% for the UAG assay, respectively. Accuracy analyses showed nonsignificant deviation from linearity for the AG (R  = .99; Runs test: P = .37) and UAG (R  = .99; Runs test: P = .42) assays. For the AG assay, the upper LQ was >1261 pg/mL, the lower LQ was 6.2 pg/mL, and the DL was 0.3 pg/mL. For the UAG assay, the upper LQ was >1785 pg/mL, the lower LQ was 16.3 pg/mL, and the DL was 1.8 pg/mL. No differences in the AG (P = .54) and UAG (P = .95) concentrations were detected in the plasma samples subjected to PI+, PI-, and PI+th.The AG and UAG ELISA assays had acceptable precision, accuracy, lower LQ, and DLs, but upper LQ could not be established. An influence of the PI on short-term storage was not detectable. Long-term storage ± PI was not evaluated and should be investigated further.© 2019 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698208>Cadmium, mercury, and selenium in muscle of the scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini from the tropical Eastern Pacific: Variation with age, molar ratios and human health risk.</a></h1><p>With the aim of assessing health risk to shark consumers, cadmium, mercury, and selenium were measured in muscle of Sphyrna lewini from four coastal states (Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Colima) in western Mexico. According to length of specimens, three age modes were found: juveniles and neonates (the majority of the individuals), preadults and adults. Average concentrations (μg g dry ) in all the studied individuals followed the order cadmium (0.06), selenium (0.94), and mercury (1.56). The mean concentrations of cadmium and mercury increased significantly (p < 0.001) with mean length of specimens. Overall, hazard quotient and hazard index values were below one so there is no health risk to consumers.

Red-legged kittiwakes (), a specialist predator, forage on fish and invertebrates from the mesopelagic zone, a part of the ocean with elevated methylmercury concentrations. We used kittiwakes as bioindicators of MeHg concentrations in remote mesopelagic systems by examining how wintering distribution and habitat affected kittiwakes' mercury exposure. In 2011-2017, we sampled winter-grown feathers on St. George Island, Alaska, from birds equipped with geolocation loggers. We measured total mercury (THg) and nitrogen stable isotopes in nape and head feathers grown during winter, respectively. THg concentration of kittiwake nape feathers averaged 4.61 ± 0.97 μg/g dry . Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify winter habitats with remotely sensed environmental variables along each bird's track. Five habitat clusters were identified. Birds that spent more time in the Western Subarctic Gyre and those that wintered further south had elevated THg concentrations. In contrast to THg, trophic level varied annually but did not show strong spatial patterns. Our results documented spatial variability in THg exposure based on the oceanic wintering locations of red-legged kittiwakes and highlight their use as a bioindicator of MeHg across ocean basins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695063>Global transcriptome analysis of rat hypothalamic arcuate nucleus demonstrates reversal of hypothalamic gliosis following surgically and diet induced  loss.</a></h1><p>The central mechanisms underlying the marked beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery are unclear. Here, we characterized global gene expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). 60 days post-RYGB, the Arc was isolated by laser-capture microdissection and global gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing. RYGB lowered  and adiposity as compared to sham-operated DIO rats. Discrete transcriptome changes were observed in the Arc following RYGB, including differential expression of genes associated with inflammation and neuropeptide signaling. RYGB reduced gene expression of glial cell markers, including Gfap, Aif1 and Timp1, confirmed by a lower number of GFAP immunopositive astrocyte profiles in the Arc. Sham-operated -matched rats demonstrated a similar glial gene expression signature, suggesting that RYGB and dietary restriction have common effects on hypothalamic gliosis. Considering that RYGB surgery also led to increased orexigenic and decreased anorexigenic gene expression, this may signify increased hunger-associated signaling at the level of the Arc. Hence, induction of counterregulatory molecular mechanisms downstream from the Arc may play an important role in RYGB-induced  loss.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697304>Secondary 12-Month Ocular Outcomes of a Phase 1 Dosing Study of Bevacizumab for Retinopathy of Prematurity.</a></h1><p>Lower bevacizumab dosages are being used for type 1 retinopathy of prematurity, but there are limited data on long-term ocular outcomes with lower doses.To evaluate ocular outcomes at 12 months' corrected age for eyes that received a dose of 0.625 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.125 mg, 0.063 mg, or 0.031 mg of bevacizumab for type 1 retinopathy of prematurity.This prospective cohort study used a masked, multicenter, phase 1 dose de-escalation study design and was conducted from April 2016 to October 2017. Study eyes were treated with a dose of 0.25, 0.125, 0.063, or 0.031 mg of bevacizumab; fellow eyes were treated with a dosage 1 level higher than the study eye. Additional treatment after 4 weeks was at investigator discretion. Data analysis occurred from November 2018 to March 2019.Intravitreous bevacizumab injections of 0.625 mg to 0.031 mg.Visual fixation, amblyopia, alignment, nystagmus, cycloplegic refraction, and ocular examinations were assessed at 12 months' corrected age as preplanned secondary outcomes. The primary outcome 4 weeks after treatment and secondary outcomes after 6 months' corrected age have been previously reported.Forty-six of 61 infants (75%) had a 12-month follow-up examination (46 study eyes and 43 fellow eyes; median [interquartile range] birth , 650 [590-760] g). Of 87 eyes with a cycloplegic refraction, 12 (14% [95% CI, 7%-27%]) had myopia of more than -5.00 D spherical equivalent; 2 (2%; [95% CI, 0%-8%]) had hyperopia greater than 5.00 D spherical equivalent; and 5 infants (11% [95% CI, 4%-24%]) had anisometropia greater than 1.50 D spherical equivalent. Abnormalities of the cornea, lens, or anterior segment were reported in 1 eye (1% [95% CI, 0%-6%]), 3 eyes (3% [95% CI, 1%-10%]), and 3 eyes (3% [95% CI, 1%-10%]), respectively. Optic nerve atrophy was identified in 11 eyes (13% [95% CI, 6%-26%]), and 1 eye (1% [95% CI, 0%-6%]) had total retinal detachment. Strabismus was reported in 13 infants (30% [95% CI, 17%-45%]), manifest nystagmus in 7 infants (15% [95% CI, 6%-29%]), and amblyopia in 3 infants (7% [95% CI, 1%-18%]). Overall, 98% of infants had central fixation in each eye (44 of 45 eyes).In this study of low-dose bevacizumab, the secondary outcomes of high myopia, strabismus, retinal detachment, nystagmus, and other ocular abnormalities at 1 year were consistent with rates reported in other studies with higher dosages.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695649>No Differential Reward Responsivity and Drive, Punishment Sensitivity or Attention for Cues Signaling Reward or Punishment in Adolescents With Obesity.</a></h1><p>Although it has been proposed that obese and healthy  individuals might differ in their reward and punishment sensitivity, the literature shows diverse and inconsistent findings. The current study was set out to examine the role of reward and punishment sensitivity in adolescent obesity by differentiating between reward responsivity and reward drive, and by complementing self-report  with performance-based  indexing attention for cues signaling reward and punishment as well as effort to approach reward and avoid punishment. Participants were adolescents aged 12-23, with obesity ( = 51, adjusted BMI [(actual BMI/Percentile 50 of BMI for age and gender) × 100) between 143 and 313%], and with a healthy  ( = 51, adjusted BMI between 75 and 129%). Individuals with obesity did not significantly differ from adolescents with a healthy  in reward responsivity, reward drive or attention to cues signaling reward. Further, no differences in self-reported punishment sensitivity or attention for cues signaling punishment were found between obese and healthy  adolescents. The current study thus does not corroborate the theories that general reward and punishment sensitivity play a role in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Jonker, van Malderen, Glashouwer, Vervoort, Braet, Goossens and de Jong.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696340>The synergistic effect between adult  changes and CYP24A1 polymorphisms is associated with pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D (VD) metabolism regulates adipose tissue, lipogenesis inflammation, and tumor growth. CYP24A1 is the key enzyme for metabolic inactivation of active VD (1,25(OH)D). We examined whether common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 gene could affect the association between adult  gain and breast cancer (BC) risk.The population-based case-control study included 818 patients with primary BC and 935 residence and age matched healthy controls. We studied the relationships between CYP24A1 gene SNPs (rs2209314, rs2585428, rs2762941, rs3787555, rs4809959, rs73913757, rs912505, and rs927a650), adult  change and BC risk. Gene- change interactions were analyzed.Neither of CYP24A1 gene SNPs was associated with BC risk in the study participants. However, we found consistent gene- interactions with increasing adult  gain for CYP24A1-rs2762941 (P-interaction = 0.0089) and CYP24A1-rs927650 (P-interaction = 0.0283). Adult  gain has a higher premenopausal BC risk with double variant T alleles of rs927650 compared to women carrying at least one wild-type C allele (OR for TT = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01; for CT = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14; for CC = 1.12 95% CI 0.93-1.35). Women with double wild-type A alleles were at a higher postmenopausal BC risk compared to those carrying at least one variant-type G allele (OR for AA = 1.51, 95% CI 1.29-1.76; for AG = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30; for GG = 1.22 95% CI 0.95-1.57). When stratified by CYP24A1 SNPs genotypes,  gain in adulthood increased postmenopausal BC risk of women with homozygous allele compared to women with heterozygotes allele.Significant interactions of  change with CYP24A1 polymorphisms suggest CYP24A1 as a potential link between  change and BC risk and the possibility that the impact of adult  gain on postmenopausal BC risk may be enhanced by homozygous alleles of CYP24A1 SNPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696368>The impact of neuropsychiatric disease on fetal growth: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>To determine the impact of depression, epilepsy and drug abuse during pregnancy on delivery and fetal outcome.

However, even with high-dose treatment (ie, > 8 mg/kg), the safety of daptomycin treatment is widely demonstrated with low or no significant incidence of CPK elevation or other adverse effects, despite the possibility of C above 24.3 μg/mL. Therefore, we questioned the clinical significance of C levels of 24.3 μg/mL. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the significance of C in the clinical setting, in addition to completing a retrospective safety assessment of daptomycin utilizing electronic health records.Patients who had received daptomycin treatment for > 4 days from July 2011 to June 2015 were enrolled. Serum daptomycin levels, including C and peak (C ), were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a photodiode array. To evaluate the safety, patients' characteristics and relevant laboratory test values were reviewed retrospectively using an electronic medical record system.A total of 52 therapeutic cases for 46 patients were identified; of these, C and C levels were measured in 27 and 28 cases, respectively, and 6 patients received multiple courses of daptomycin treatment. The median age of the 52 patients was 68 years (range: 19-88 years), and 14 patients initially had an estimated creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. Seven cases indicated a C of above 24.3 μg/mL; however, none of these presented CPK elevation, which meets with the study definition for abnormality. Furthermore, of the two patients with abnormal CPK elevations, only one patient had a measured C (of 10.9 μg/mL). Their CPK abnormalities were temporal and did not result in treatment discontinuation. The other four patients discontinued daptomycin treatment due to suspicions of adverse effects. Of the discontinued patients, two had measured C levels; these were 8.6 and 8.1 μg/mL. All patients with abnormal CPK elevation or treatment discontinuation exhibited C levels lower than 24.3 μg/mL. In this study, two patients receiving high-dose daptomycin (ie, 9.4 and 10.0 mg/kg) had observed C levels similar to patients who received doses of daptomycin < 9 mg/kg.The safety of daptomycin treatment was suggested in this study. C level of 24.3 μg/mL was not suggested as a significant clinical index for the incidence of CPK elevation, adverse effects or treatment discontinuation. Thus, acceptable tolerability towards higher C levels than 24.3 μg/mL was also suggested, though further studies are required. On the other hand, low levels of daptomycin in blood were unexpectedly observed in two cases, despite the high-dose treatments. Accordingly, the monitoring of serum daptomycin levels may also be useful to assess cases in which subtherapeutic levels were achieved.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694621>Cost of incorrect application of antithrombotic prophylaxis prior to invasive procedures.</a></h1><p>We analyze the cost of an incorrect application, by the haematologist, of bridging anticoagulation in patients with low-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) needing interruption of treatment prior to a scheduled invasive procedure.

The aim of this study was to investigate time trends in dietary patterns and nutrient intake in an older population, in order to increase the understanding of whether dietary recommendations are followed and if nutrient needs are met.Cross-sectional data was derived from five samples of 70-year-olds examined 1971-72, 1981-83, 1992-93, 2000-02 and 2014-16 from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort studies in Sweden. A total of 2246 individuals (56% women) participated. Dietary intake was determined by the diet history method, which is an interview including questions on usual frequencies and portion sizes of food intake during the preceding three months. Recommended values of nutrient intake and determinants of healthful dietary patterns were based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012. Statistical analyses were performed using general linear models, student's t-test and chi-square test, stratified by sex.The intake of fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood, whole grain products and nuts and seeds increased during the study period (p < 0.0001), among both sexes. However, there was also an increase in alcohol intake (p < 0.0001), especially from wine and beer, and in 2014-16 more than 30% had an alcohol intake above recommendations. Protein intake increased (p < 0.0001 for women and p = 0.0004 for men), and 48% of the women and 37% of the men had a protein intake above recommended 1.2 g/kg  and day in 2014-16. The proportion of participants at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins C, D and folate decreased during the study period, among both sexes (p < 0.0001). However, vitamin D intake from diet was still below average requirement level of 7.5 μg/day for 49% of the women and 32% of the men in 2014-16.Dietary patterns have changed among 70-year-olds during the past five decades, with an increase in healthful foods and a higher nutrient density in later born birth cohorts.

For 149 patients, the imaging results could be correlated to those at surgery and histopathology.The median adenoma  was 330 mg. The addition of contrast-enhanced CT increased the sensitivity from 81.1% to 89.9% (P = 0.003). The specificity of nonenhanced SPECT/CT was similar to contrast-enhanced CT (96.1% vs 97.9%; P = 0.077). For patients with uniglandular disease (n = 140, 94.0%), the sensitivity increased from 86.4% to 93.6% (P = 0.021) and the specificity from 96.2% to 97.9% (P = 0.118) by adding contrast-enhanced CT. In patients with multiglandular disease (n = 9, 6.0%), adding contrast-enhanced CT improved detection sensitivity from 42.1% to 63.2%. However, these patients were few and significance was not reached (P = 0.125).In this cohort, with generally small parathyroid adenomas, the sensitivity in preoperative localization was greatly improved by adding contrast-enhanced CT to Tc-MIBI SPECT/CT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695462>Difference Analysis Of Related Factors In Macrovascular And Microvascular Complications In Chinese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Case-Control Study Protocol.</a></h1><p>Despite the increasingly young age at diabetes onset and the increasing number of deaths caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), why some patients develop macrovascular complications but others develop microvascular complications remains controversial and unclear. Notably, some patients have good glucose control but still develop vascular complications, whereas some patients have retinopathy with neither nephropathy nor neuropathy. This study will be performed to explore the risk factors for T2DM complications in Chinese patients.Patients with T2DM and healthy people will be recruited from Hebei General Hospital from September 2019 to September 2020. The subjects will be grouped into a control group, T2DM without vascular complications group, T2DM with macrovascular complications group, and T2DM with microvascular complications group; they will then be further subgrouped. The following data will be collected after admission: demographic information such as age, sex, and education; relevant medical history such as duration of diabetes, family history of first-degree relatives with diabetes, and age at diagnosis of diabetes; and anthropometric and blood indicators such as , waist circumference, fasting blood glucose level, C-peptide level, total cholesterol level, and triglyceride level. The statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A  value of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The χ test, one-way analysis of variance and the rank sum test will be used to analyze differences between the groups. Logistic regression will be used to analyze the risk factors for macrovascular and microvascular complications of T2DM.© 2019 Zhao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697507>Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of the Chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa Phase Transition with a Single Dirac Cone.</a></h1><p>We present quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa quantum phase transition of relativistic fermions with N=4 Dirac spinor components subject to a repulsive, local four fermion interaction in (2+1)D. Here we employ a two-dimensional lattice Hamiltonian with a single, spin-degenerate Dirac cone, which exactly reproduces a linear energy-momentum relation for all finite size lattice momenta in the absence of interactions. This allows us to significantly reduce finite size corrections compared to the widely studied honeycomb and π-flux lattices. A Hubbard term dynamically generates a mass beyond a critical coupling of U_{c}=6.76(1) as the system acquires antiferromagnetic order and SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. At the quantum phase transition, we extract a self-consistent set of critical exponents ν=0.98(1), η_{ϕ}=0.53(1), η_{ψ}=0.18(1), and β=0.75(1). We provide evidence for the continuous degradation of the quasiparticle  of the fermionic excitations as the critical point is approached from the semimetallic phase. Finally, we study the effective "speed of light" of the low-energy relativistic description, which depends on the interaction U, but is expected to be regular across the quantum phase transition. We illustrate that the strongly coupled bosonic and fermionic excitations share a common velocity at the critical point.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693749>Ivermectin use in children below 15 kg: potential benefits for onchocerciasis and scabies elimination programs.</a></h1><p>We read with interest the paper by M Levy et al about the treatment of scabies with ivermectin in infants and children under 15kg of  .

We sought to determine the factors that held the most prognostic  in the pre- and postoperative setting for each BCLC stage by applying a machine learning method.Patients who underwent resection for BCLC-0, A and B HCC between 2000 and 2017 were identified from an international multi-institutional database. A Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model was used to generate homogeneous groups of patients relative to overall survival (OS) based on pre- and postoperative factors.Among 976 patients, 63 (6.5%) had BCLC-0, 745 (76.3%) had BCLC-A, and 168 (17.2%) had BCLC-B HCC. Five-year OS among BCLC-0/A and BCLC-B patients was 64.2% versus 50.2%, respectively (p = 0.011). The preoperative CART model selected α-fetoprotein (AFP) and Charlson comorbidity score (CCS) as the first and second most important preoperative factors of OS among BCLC-0/A patients, whereas radiologic tumor burden score (TBS) was the best predictor of OS among BCLC-B patients. The postoperative CART model revealed lymphovascular invasion as the best postoperative predictor of OS among BCLC-0/A patients, whereas TBS remained the best predictor of long-term outcomes among BCLC-B patients in the postoperative setting. On multivariable analysis, pathologic TBS independently predicted worse OS among BCLC-0/A (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.07) and BCLC-B patients (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.19) undergoing resection.Prognostic stratification of patients undergoing resection for HCC within and beyond the BCLC resection criteria should include assessment of AFP and comorbidities for BCLC-0/A patients, as well as tumor burden for BCLC-B patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695662>Food-Specific Inhibitory Control Mediates the Effect of Disgust Sensitivity on  Mass Index.</a></h1><p>Disgust is an emotion that drives food avoidance. People vary in their responses to disgust, which is captured by their disgust sensitivity. Disgust sensitivity is clinically significant because it can influence eating behaviors, and indirectly people's  mass index (BMI). Inhibitory control can also influence BMI through the role that such reflective abilities play in governing food intake. In this study, we relied on neural models of disgust to suggest that disgust and inhibitory control are intertwined, and that inhibitory control facilitates the translation of disgust sensitivity into BMI. Mediation analyses applied to 46 subjects, including 29 normal  [BMI = 18.34 kg/m (SD = 1.58)] and 17 overweight/obese [BMI = 26.03 kg/m (SD = 2.58)] subjects, were used to test the hypothesis. Subjects completed the Chinese version of the Disgust Scale-Revised, and an inhibition control test (Food-Specific Stop-Signal Task). There were negative correlations between the disgust sensitivity score (DS) and  mass index (BMI), and between DS and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). Moreover, BMI was positively correlated with SSRT. The mediation model results showed that disgust sensitivity was associated with BMI and that this relationship was mediated  inhibition control. There was no significant effect of DS on BMI, while the effect of SSRT on BMI was significant. This suggested that the effect of disgust sensitivity on BMI was fully mediated through food-specific inhibitory control. This supports our hypothesis that BMI is affected by disgust sensitivity and that this relationship is mediated by inhibition control. These findings reveal a key mechanism that underlies disgust sensitivity-BMI association and point to future research and potential interventions aimed at food intake management.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Li, Turel, Chen and He.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697707>Sildenafil citrate long-term treatment effects on cardiovascular reactivity in a SHR experimental model of metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Much evidence indicates that metabolic syndrome is strongly correlated with a decrease in nitric oxide and an increase in oxidative stress leading to cardiovascular alterations. In recent years, gut microbiota has emerged as a new contributor to the metabolic syndrome establishment and associated cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that a positive modulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, through phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition could prevent cardiovascular alterations and gut dysbiosis that may be associated to metabolic syndrome. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, cafeteria diet (CD) and sildenafil citrate treated groups (5mg/kg per os) were given either a CD or a standard chow diet for 10 weeks. , arterial blood pressure and glucose tolerance test were monitored. At the 10th week, cardiac inotropy and coronary perfusion pressure were evaluated on isolated heart according to Langendorff method. Cumulative concentration response curves to phenylephrine and acetylcholine were determined on thoracic aorta rings for vascular reactivity evaluation. Faecal samples were collected for the gut microbiota analysis. Compared to the control group, CD-fed rats showed a significant increase in  gain, arterial blood pressure and were glucose intolerant. This group showed also a decrease in β-adrenoceptor-induced cardiac inotropy and coronary vasodilation. Gut microbiota analysis revealed a significant reduction in the abundance of Lactobocillus spp in cafeteria diet-fed rats when compared to the control ones. Sildenafil citrate long-term treatment decreased  gain and arterial blood pressure, improved coronary vasodilation and reduced α1-adrenoceptor-induced vasoconstriction in CD group. However, it did not reverse gut dysbiosis induced by chronic CD feeding. These results suggest that cGMP pathway targeting may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of the metabolic syndrome and associated cardiovascular disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693950>Organophosphate di- and tri-esters in indoor and outdoor dust from China and its implications for human exposure.</a></h1><p>Organophosphate (OP) esters are emerging environmental contaminants, but little is known about their occurrence in dust. In this study, 19 OP triesters and their 11 diester degradation products were measured in indoor dust and outdoor dust collected from China. ∑OP triester concentrations in indoor dust (median: 2380 ng/g dry  [dw]) were an order of magnitude higher than those in outdoor dust (446 ng/g dw). The median concentrations of ∑OP diesters in indoor and outdoor dust were 260 and 96.8 ng/g dw, respectively. Dust samples collected from eastern and southern China contained higher concentrations of ∑OP di- and tri-esters than those from the other regions. Dust from the most urbanized areas in China including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou exhibited the highest concentrations of ∑OP di- (>1000 ng/g dw) and triesters (>4000 ng/g dw). We also found notable concentrations of emerging aryl-OP triesters in dust (3.85-10.6 ng/g dw). Significant correlations existed between the concentrations of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (BEHP) and tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) (rho = 0.672-0.691, p < 0.01), as well as DPHP and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) (rho = 0.537-0.766, p < 0.01) in dust samples, indicating that OP diesters originated from the degradation of triesters. High molar concentration ratios of DEP to triethyl phosphate (TEP) and DPHP to TPHP/ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) suggested that these OP triesters degrade readily. Significant correlations were found between the concentrations of ∑OP di- (R = 0.390, p < 0.05) and tri-esters (R = 0.475, p < 0.01) in paired indoor-outdoor dust samples, which suggested that indoor dust was the source of OP esters to the outdoor environment. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of ∑OP diesters through dust ingestion was 0.21 ng/kg bw/d for adults and 2.59 ng/kg bw/d for children. The exposure levels of OP diesters, DEP and DPHP, were comparable to those of their parent triester compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control, control + isorhamnetin, diabetic, diabetic + isorhamnetin. Isorhamnetin at a dose of 10 mg/kg  was intraperitoneally administrated once a day for 12 weeks. Formalin and tail immersion tests were performed to evaluate the severity of pain. Astrogliosis markers such as GFAP and APO-E4, DNA fragments, MDA level, and TNFα expressions were evaluated using ELISA assay. Neuronal density in the hippocampus region was evaluated using Nissl staining. The method of Ellman and fluorescent probe 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to measure brain acetyl-cholinesterase activity and detect reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS), respectively.Isorhamnetin reduced pain, blood glucose levels, and increased  significantly compared to control. Moreover, isorhamnetin inhibited astroglial activation, acetyl-cholinesterase activity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation.These findings suggested that isorhamnetin has potential effects as neuroprotective agents against diabetes-related changes in the brain.Copyright © 2019.

Thirty-five patients with SV physiology were assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID) II or III at 3 years and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC) at 8 years. Whether the children were receiving special education services was also determined. Factors associated with the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) of the BSID, the full-scale IQ (FSIQ) of the WISC, and special education services were also analyzed. The MDI and FSIQ of children with SV physiology were significantly lower than the values in healthy children (P < 0.01). The MDI at 3 years was moderately correlated with FSIQ at 8 years (P < 0.01, R = 0.41). Ten patients (28.6%) received special education services in their school. Children with MDI < 85 were more likely than those with MDI ≥ 85 to require special education services at school age (53% and 10%, respectively, p < 0.01).  at birth and Stage II were correlated with the MDI, extracorporeal circulation time at stage II was correlated with FSIQ, and age at Fontan operation was correlated with FSIQ and special education services. The toddler neurodevelopment index may predict not only IQ levels, but also the need for special education services in school-age children. Children with low neurodevelopmental scores need to be followed closely for a long time.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The scarcity of efficient resistance sources within adapted germplasm is particularly alarming for DW, mainly utilized for human consumption, which is therefore at high risk of kernel contamination by health-dangerous mycotoxins (e.g., deoxynivalenol = DON). To cope with this scenario, we looked outside the wheat primary gene pool and recently transferred an exceptionally effective FHB resistance QTL () from  7EL chromosome arm onto a  7elL arm segment, containing additional valuable genes (including  for leaf rust resistance and  for yellow pigment content), distally inserted onto 7DL of BW lines. Two such lines were crossed with two previously developed DW- recombinants, having 7elL distal portions on 7AL arms. Genomic  hybridization (GISH) analysis showed homologous pairing, which is enabled by 7elL segments common to the BW and DW recombinant chromosomes, to occur with 42-78% frequency, depending on the shared 7elL amount. Aided by 7EL/7elL-linked markers, 7EL+7elL tetraploid recombinant types were isolated in BC progenies to DW of all cross combinations. Homozygous 7EL+7elL recombinant plants and null segregates selected in BCF progenies were challenged by  spike inoculation to verify the  efficacy in DW. Infection outcomes confirmed previous observations in BW, with >90% reduction of disease severity associated with  presence . its absence. The same differential effect was detected on seed set and  of inoculated spikes, with genotypes lacking  having ∼80% reduction compared with unaffected values of  carriers. In parallel, DON content in flour extracts of resistant recombinants averaged 0.67 ppm, a value >800 times lower than that of susceptible controls. Furthermore, as observed in BW, the same  also provided the novel DW recombinants with resistance to  crown rot (∼60% symptom reduction) as from seedling infection with . Through alien segment stacking, we succeeded in equipping DW with a very effective barrier against different  diseases and other positive attributes for crop security and safety.Copyright © 2019 Kuzmanović, Mandalà, Tundo, Ciorba, Frangella, Ruggeri, Rossini, Gevi, Rinalducci and Ceoloni.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695703>TCR Fingerprinting and Off-Target Peptide Identification.</a></h1><p>Adoptive T cell therapy using patient T cells redirected to recognize tumor-specific antigens by expressing genetically engineered high-affinity T-cell receptors (TCRs) has therapeutic potential for melanoma and other solid tumors. Clinical trials implementing genetically modified TCRs in melanoma patients have raised concerns regarding off-target toxicities resulting in lethal destruction of healthy tissue, highlighting the urgency of assessing which off-target peptides can be recognized by a TCR. As a model system we used the clinically efficacious NY-ESO-1-specific TCR C, which recognizes the peptide epitope SLLMWITQC presented by HLA-A02:01. We investigated which amino acids at each position enable a TCR interaction by sequentially replacing every amino acid position outside of anchor positions 2 and 9 with all 19 possible alternative amino acids, resulting in 134 peptides (133 altered peptides plus epitope peptide). Each peptide was individually evaluated using three different  assays: binding of the NY-ESO TCR to the peptide, peptide-dependent activation of TCR-expressing cells, and killing of peptide-presenting target cells. To represent the TCR recognition kernel, we defined Position  Matrices (PWMs) for each assay by assigning normalized measurements to each of the 20 amino acids in each position. To predict potential off-target peptides, we applied a novel algorithm projecting the PWM-defined kernel into the human proteome, scoring NY-ESO TCR recognition of 336,921 predicted human HLA-A02:01 binding 9-mer peptides. Of the 12 peptides with high predicted score, we confirmed 7 (including NY-ESO-1 antigen SLLMWITQC) strongly activate human primary NY-ESO-expressing T cells. These off-target peptides include peptides with up to 7 amino acid changes (of 9 possible), which could not be predicted using the recognition motif as determined by alanine scans. Thus, this replacement scan assay determines the "TCR fingerprint" and, when coupled with the algorithm applied to the database of human 9-mer peptides binding to HLA-A02:01, enables the identification of potential off-target antigens and the tissues where they are expressed. This platform enables both screening of multiple TCRs to identify the best candidate for clinical development and identification of TCR-specific cross-reactive peptide recognition and constitutes an improved methodology for the identification of potential off-target peptides presented on MHC class I molecules.Copyright © 2019 Karapetyan, Chaipan, Winkelbach, Wimberger, Jeong, Joshi, Stein, Underwood, Castle, van Dijk and Seibert.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696587>Microporous carbon nanofibers derived from poly(acrylonitrile-co-acrylic acid) for high performance supercapacitors.</a></h1><p>Carbon nanofiber (CNF)-based supercapacitors have promising applications in the field of energy storage. It is desirable but remains challenging to develop CNF electrode materials with a large specific surface area (SSA), high specific capacitance (SC) and high power density, as well as excellent cycling stability and high reliability. In this study, we synthesize the acrylonitrile-acrylic acid copolymer P(AN- co -AA) for the preparation of nitrogen-doped microporous CNFs. The thermal degradation of the AA segment leads to the formation of micropores that are distributed not only on the CNF surface but also inside the material. The microporous structure and nitrogen content can be manipulated at the molecular level by adjusting the  ratio between the AN and AA, and the SSA and SC could reach as high as 1099 m 2 g -1 and 156 F g -1 , respectively. After KOH activation, the Activated Carbon nanofiber (ACNF) possesses an extremely high SSA of 2117 m 2 g -1 and SC of 320 F g -1 , which are almost the highest values ever reported for electric double layer supercapacitors with an alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the capacitance retention can be maintained at 99% even after 16,000 cyclic tests, exhibiting outstanding durability and repeatability.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

So far, there are no treatments to reverse it. Exploring novel strategies to prevent VC is important and necessary for VC-related disease intervention.In this study, we evaluated whether MOTS-c, a novel mitochondria-related 16-aa peptide, can reduce vitamin D3 and nicotine-induced VC in rats.Vitamin D3 plus nicotine-treated rats were injected with MOTS-c at a dose of 5 mg/kg once a day for 4 weeks.

We tested the hypothesis that the chemical composition as well as shape and size of particles in suspensions of natural origin affect the density and functional diversity of zooplankton. The suspensions were analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy. Elements found in the beidellite clays were also identified in the mineral structure of the particles. As the size of the microparticles decreased, the  proportions of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine increased in the suspensions. These conditions facilitated the biomass growth of large and small microphages and raptorials. As the size of the nanoparticles decreased, the shares of silicon, aluminum, iron, and magnesium increased. These conditions inhibited raptorials the most. Ecosystem functionality was the highest with intermediate suspension parameters, which were at the lower range of the microphase and the upper range of the nanophase. The functional traits of zooplankton demonstrate their potential for use as sensitive indicators of disruptions in aquatic ecosystems that are linked with the presence of suspensions, and they facilitate gaining an understanding of the causes and scales of the impact of suspensions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693212>Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and childhood behavioural problems: Discrepancies between mother- and teacher-reported outcomes.</a></h1><p>Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is common and has been associated with childhood behavioural problems among offspring, specifically hyperactivity and conduct problems.Assessments of child behaviour in many previous studies have relied on maternal or parent report. Acknowledging that results of behavioural assessments vary between informants, we examined the association between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and behaviour problems in childhood based on mother- and teacher-report.A longitudinal study of 560 mother-child pairs with data on illnesses and medication use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental assessments during childhood was conducted. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was captured using a standardised maternal interview, completed 1 year after delivery on average.  of childhood (6-12 years of age) behaviour were obtained via mother- and teacher-report, using the Child Behaviour Checklist and Teacher Report Form. Linear and log-binomial models were used to calculate adjusted mean differences (MD) and risk ratios (RR), respectively and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for internalising, externalising, and total behaviour problems comparing acetaminophen users to non-users. Stabilized inverse probability  were used to account for loss to follow-up, and adjustments for indication were made.Approximately 60% (n = 354) of women reported use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.

NIOSH publishes a list of drugs it defines as hazardous where it may be appropriate for healthcare workers to take protective  to reduce the potential for occupational exposure. Recent updates and proposed updates to this list have included large molecule biological products with oncology indications. Both NIOSH and USP <800> recommend the use of closed system transfer devices (CSTDs) during compounding. CSTDs are required for administration of prepared solution in NIOSH. However, USP has suggested that the principles of <800> are broadly applicable to hazardous drug handling activities across all facility types. USP encourages the widespread adoption and use of <800> across all healthcare settings, which many health care workers have interpreted beyond compounding to include administration and preparation of conventionally manufactured sterile products per approved labeling. While the use of CSTDs may reduce exposure of healthcare personnel to chemotherapy agents in healthcare setting, the impact of CSTDs on quality of biologic drug products, including monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, is not fully understood. To complicate this issue further, there are several commercially available CSTDs in the market which have different fluid paths and material of construction that comes in contact with the drug. Testing every combination of CSTD and drug product for potential incompatibilities can be a labor intensive and impractical approach and cause delay in getting essential drugs to patients. A panel discussion was held at a recent American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) 2018 PharmSci 360 conference to discuss the impact of CSTDs on biologics. Impact on subvisible and visible particulates and impact to other product quality attributes such as high molecular  species formation upon contact with CSTDs were reported in AAPS meeting. Impact to deliverable dose, holdup volumes of various CSTDs, and stopper coring were also reported that has significant impact to patient safety. Given the fact that USP chapter <800> will be implemented in December 2019, feedback from health authorities regarding the use of CSTDs for biological drug products is needed to provide an appropriate risk/benefit balance to ensure patient safety and quality of the biologic drug product while also protecting the healthcare worker and the environment. The purpose of this commentary is to provide an industry perspective on the challenges during the use of CSTDs for biologic drug products and is intended to raise caution and awareness on the benefits and shortcomings of these devices.Copyright © 2019.

Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin is associated with stem-like phenotypes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process which confers resistance to endocrine therapy. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) can be a vital source of proangiogenic factors including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) which drives angiogenesis and leads to tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, targeting Wnt and FGF2 may provide effective treatment for endocrine resistant breast cancer. Our previous in vitro study reported that plumbagin (PLB) was a potent anticancer agent and was able to inhibit EMT in endocrine-resistant cells. This study aimed to further investigate the inhibitory effects of PLB on cancer stem-like phenotypes, tumorigenicity and angiogenesis. The results demonstrated Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated and was able to form mammospheres with increased cancer stem cell markers (ALDH1, NANOG, and OCT4) in endocrine-resistant cells. PLB significantly inhibited colony-forming, mammosphere formation and decreased cancer stem cell markers. The inhibitory effects of PLB on cell proliferation and invasion were mediated by Wnt signaling pathway. PLB also significantly reduced Wnt responsive genes and β-catenin. Moreover, PLB treatment at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis without any adverse effects on  and blood coagulation in orthotopic xenograft nude mice. In conclusion, PLB exerted anti-cancer activity and eliminated stem-like properties by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and FGF2 expression. These findings suggest that PLB could be a promising agent to treat endocrine resistant breast cancer.Copyright © 2019.

The efficacy and safety of dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody, approved for treatment in adolescent patients with inadequately controlled AD, remain unknown in this patient population.To assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab monotherapy in adolescents with moderate to severe inadequately controlled AD.A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 45 US and Canadian centers between March 21, 2017, and June 5, 2018. A total of 251 adolescents with moderate to severe AD inadequately controlled by topical medications or for whom topical therapy was inadvisable were included.Patients were randomized (1:1:1; interactive-response system; stratified by severity and ) to 16-week treatment with dupilumab, 200 mg (n = 43; baseline  <60 kg), or dupilumab, 300 mg (n = 39; baseline  ≥60 kg), every 2 weeks; dupilumab, 300 mg, every 4 weeks (n = 84); or placebo (n = 85).Proportion of patients with 75% or more improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) (scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater severity) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1 on a 5-point scale (scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater severity) at week 16.A total of 251 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age, 14.5 [1.7] years; 148 [59.0%] male). Of 250 patients with data available on concurrent allergic conditions, most had comorbid type 2 diseases (asthma, 134 [53.6%]; food allergies, 60.8%; allergic rhinitis, 65.6%). A total of 240 patients (95.6%) completed the study. Dupilumab achieved both coprimary end points at week 16. The proportion of patients with EASI-75 improvement from baseline increased (every 2 weeks, 41.5%; every 4 weeks, 38.1%; placebo, 8.2%) with differences vs placebo of 33.2% (95% CI, 21.1%-45.4%) for every 2 weeks and 29.9% (95% CI, 17.9%-41.8%) for every 4 weeks (P < .001). Efficacy of the every-2-week regimen was generally superior to the every-4-week regimen. Patients in the dupilumab arms had higher percentage values of conjunctivitis (every 2 weeks, 9.8%; every 4 weeks, 10.8%; placebo, 4.7%) and injection-site reactions (every 2 weeks, 8.5%; every 4 weeks, 6.0%; placebo, 3.5%), and lower nonherpetic skin infections (every 2 weeks, 9.8%; every 4 weeks, 9.6%; placebo, 18.8%).In this study, dupilumab significantly improved AD signs, symptoms, and quality of life in adolescents with moderate to severe AD, with an acceptable safety profile. Placebo-corrected efficacy and safety of dupilumab were similar in adolescents and adults.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693881>A Gut Check Explains Improved Glucose Metabolism after Surgery.</a></h1><p>Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) surgery leads to more frequent diabetes remission than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).

In literature, it has been demonstrated that muscle activity during walking can be described via the activation of a small set of muscle synergies. The analysis of the composition and the time activation profiles of such synergies have been found to be a valid tool for the description of the motor control schemes in pathological subjects.In this study, we used muscle synergy analysis techniques to characterize the differences in the modular motor control schemes between a population of 14 people with trans-femoral amputation and 12 healthy subjects walking at two different (slow and normal self-selected) speeds. Muscle synergies were extracted from a 12 lower-limb muscles sEMG recording via non-negative matrix factorization. Equivalence of the synergy vectors was quantified by a cross-validation procedure, while differences in terms of time activation coefficients were evaluated through the analysis of the activity in the different gait sub-phases.Four synergies were able to reconstruct the muscle activity in all subjects. The spatial component of the synergy vectors did not change in all the analysed populations, while differences were present in the activity during the sound limb's stance phase. Main features of people with trans-femoral amputation's muscle synergy recruitment are a prolonged activation of the module composed of calf muscles and an additional activity of the hamstrings' module before and after the prosthetic heel strike.Synergy-based results highlight how, although the complexity and the spatial organization of motor control schemes are the same found in healthy subjects, substantial differences are present in the synergies' recruitment of people with trans femoral amputation. In particular, the most critical task during the gait cycle is the  transfer from the sound limb to the prosthetic one. Future studies will integrate these results with the dynamics of movement, aiming to a complete neuro-mechanical characterization of people with trans-femoral amputation's walking strategies that can be used to improve the rehabilitation therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694320>Older Adults' Awareness and Knowledge of Beans in Relation to Their Nutrient Content and Role in Chronic Disease Risk.</a></h1><p>Awareness and knowledge of nutrient-dense foods are important for older adults to help them make dietary choices that support a food-first approach to healthy aging. This is especially important since age is a major risk factor for chronic disease and the proportion of older adults in North America is increasing. Beans can contribute to a food-first approach to healthy aging as they are nutrient-dense and can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. However, studies exploring awareness and knowledge of beans in older adults are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore older adults' awareness of beans in relation to their nutrient content and role in chronic disease risk. Community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years old) were recruited and completed a validated researcher-administered questionnaire ( = 250), which was followed by 10 focus groups ( = 49). Results showed that the majority of older adults considered beans as a healthy food and thought consuming them could improve their health (99.2% and 98.0%, respectively); however, only 51.2% were bean consumers. While the majority (83.6%) of older adults were aware that a serving of beans is high in dietary fibre, bean consumers were significantly more likely to think that consuming beans could improve health areas related to dietary fibre including  management and constipation. Furthermore, most (84.8%) older adults thought consuming beans could improve heart health; however, bean consumers were significantly more likely to be aware that one serving of beans is low in nutrients relevant to heart health including total fat, saturated and  fat as well as cholesterol. This research can help to inform healthcare professionals and public health agencies to create specific dietary strategies focusing on increasing older adults' awareness and knowledge of beans in relation to their nutrient profile and role in promoting health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697833>Serotonin regulates maternal calcium homeostasis during the perinatal period of sheep.</a></h1><p>The goal of this experiment was to demonstrate the ability of an infusion of serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) precursors to increase 5-HT production during the transition from pregnancy to lactation and its effects on gene expression related to calcium (Ca) transporters in the mammary gland and bone resorption markers in the femur. Thirty pregnant Bamei mutton sheep were randomly assigned to three experimental groups. All groups received a daily intravenous (i.v.) infusion of saline (Control group; n = 10), saline containing 0.178 mg of L-tryptophan/kg  (BW) (TRP group, n = 10) or 0.178 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan/kg BW (5-HTP group, n = 10), beginning on day 7 of prepartum and continuing until delivery. Serum (pre- and post-partum), milk (post-partum), and femur and mammary gland tissue (day 9) were collected. Sheep infused with 5-HTP had a larger total serum Ca concentration on days 3, 6, 15, and 30 of lactation and total milk Ca concentration on days 3, 6,12, and 15 of lactation compared with that of the control group. Sheep infused with 5-HTP and TRP increased blood and milk concentrations of 5-HT on days 3, 6, 9, and 30 of lactation and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) on day 3 of prepartum and on days 3, 6, and 15 of lactation (P < 0.05). In addition, compared to that of the control group, the TRP or 5-HTP infusion up-regulated PTHrP, a sodium/calcium exchanger, plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase 2, secretory pathway Ca2+ ATPase 1, and Calcium sensing receptor mRNA expression in mammary gland and receptor-activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand mRNA expression in the femur, but had no effect on receptor-activated nuclear factor kappa-B and osteoprotegerin mRNA expression in the femur (P < 0.05). This suggests that 5-HT and PTHrP may be involved in regulating maternal Ca homeostasis during the transition from pregnancy to lactation in the sheep.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, the specific regulatory role of lncRNA ezrin antisense RNA 1 (EZR-AS1) on CRC was investigated. The expression of LncRNA EZR-AS1 was significantly up-regulated in CRC cell lines (HCT8, HCT116, HT29 and SW620 cells), which was significantly different from that of normal human fetal colonic mucosa cells (FHC cells) (P &lt; 0.01). HCT116 and HT29 cells were then transfected with EZR-AS1 shRNA (sh-EZR-AS1) to silence lncRNA EZR-AS1 (P &lt; 0.01).When compared with the Control, after transfection of SH-EZR-AS1, E-cadherin was up-regulated, Vimentin was down-regulated, the apoptosis rate was increased, the cell viability, wound healing rate, and the number of invasive cells were decreased in HCT116 and HT29 cells (P &lt; 0.05). Silencing of lncRNA EZR-AS also significantly reduced the tumor volume and  in mice injected with sh-EZR-AS1-transfectedHCT116 and HT29 cells (P &lt; 0.05). The regulatory relationship between lncRNA EZR-AS1 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling was further identified in CRC cells. Silencing of lncRNA EZR-AS1 significantly down-regulated TGF-β, Smad2, and α-SMA expression in HCT116 and HT29 cells at the protein level (P &lt; 0.05). The intervention of SB431542 (a TGF-β receptor blocker) and silencing of Smad2 both significantly down-regulated lncRNA EZR-AS1 expression in HCT116 and HT29 cells (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, silencing of lncRNA EZR-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and promoted the apoptosis of CRC cells through blocking TGF-β signaling.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696697>Double-Network Nanogel as a Nonviral Vector for DNA Delivery.</a></h1><p>A double-network nanogel, composed of a silane-cross-linked polyethylenimine (PEI) network (i.e., PEI-S) and a pH-responsive poly(2-(hexamethyleneimino) ethyl methacrylate) (PC7A) polymer, was developed for efficient DNA transfection. The chemical cross-linking and hydrophobic interactions in the two networks led to improved stability outside the cell and also pH-triggered intracellular release of DNA. The nanogel with an optimal PEI-S and PC7A  ratio of 1.3:1 exhibited significantly higher transfection efficiency than Lipofectamine 2000 in multiple cell lines. The nanogel also possessed a small size with a hydrodynamic diameter of 55 nm, low cytotoxicity, and superior stability in serum-containing media. Moreover, besides the PEI-based gene delivery system, we have also demonstrated that addition of the PC7A polymer to several types of cationic polymers commonly used for gene delivery also led to significant transfection enhancement of the resulting nanoparticles, suggesting that the PC7A polymer may be a universal additive that can benefit versatile cationic polymer-based gene delivery systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696324>Quality of life in chronic conditions using patient-reported  and biomarkers: a DEA analysis in type 1 diabetes.</a></h1><p>A chronic disease impacts a patient's daily life, with the burden of symptoms and managing the condition, and concerns of progression and disease complications. Such aspects are captured by Patient-Reported Outcomes  (PROM), assessments of e.g. wellbeing. Patient-Reported Experience  (PREM) assess patients' experiences of healthcare and address patient preferences. Biomarkers are useful for monitoring disease activity and treatment effect and determining risks of progression and complications, and they provide information on current and future health. Individuals may differ in which among these aspects they consider important. We aimed to develop a measure of quality of life using biomarkers, PROM and PREM, that would provide an unambiguous ranking of individuals, without presuming any specific set of importance . We anticipated it would be useful for studying needs and room for improvement, estimating the effects of interventions and comparing alternatives, and for developing healthcare with a broad focus on the individual. We wished to examine if efficiency analysis could be used for this purpose, in an application to individuals with type 1 diabetes.We used PROM and PREM data linked to registry data on risk factors, in a large sample selected from the National Diabetes Registry in Sweden. Efficiency analysis appears useful for evaluating the situation of individuals with type 1 diabetes. Quality of life was estimated as efficiency, which differed by age. The contribution of different components to quality of life was heterogeneous, and differed by gender, age and duration of diabetes. Observed quality of life shortfall was mainly due to inefficiency, and to some extent due to the level of available inputs.The efficiency analysis approach can use patient-reported outcomes , patient-reported experience  and comorbidity risk factors to estimate quality of life with a broad focus on the individual, in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The approach enables ranking and comparisons using all these aspects in parallel, and allows each individual to express their own view of which aspects are important to them. The approach can be used for policy regarding interventions on inefficiency as well as healthcare resource allocation, although currently limited to type 1 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697760>Grain filling of early-season rice cultivars grown under mechanical transplanting.</a></h1><p>High yields of mechanized intensive rice-based cropping systems, e.g. double-season cropping using early- and late-season rice, are important to ensure national food security in China. However, few studies addressing the relationship between grain  and grain yield of early-season rice under machine-transplanted conditions. A field experiment was conducted to determine the critical grain-filling characteristics and related physiological aspects that contribute to high grain  in machine-transplanted early-season rice. The results showed that grain yield was significantly positively correlated with grain  but not with panicles per m2, spikelets per panicle, and spikelet-filling percentage. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that there was a significant positive correlation between grain  and mean grain-filling rate, which was significantly positively correlated with harvest index and grain cytokinin content. These results indicate that high grain-filling rate driven by good transport of assimilates to grains and strong grain sink strength is responsible for high grain  in machine-transplanted early-season rice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693504>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of  Loss, Comorbidities, and Biochemical Outcomes From Randomized Controlled Trials.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to compare  loss, obesity-related comorbidities, and biochemical outcomes of LSG versus LRYGB through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).LSG and LRYGB are the 2 most commonly performed bariatric surgeries for the treatment of obesity. The comparative outcomes of the 2 surgeries is a topic of ongoing debate and medium-term outcomes remain uncertain.A search for RCTs comparing LRYGB versus LSG was conducted. Pooled outcomes between 2 procedures were compared using pairwise random-effects meta-analysis at 1, 3, and 5-year follow-up time points. Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation was used to assess certainty of evidence.Thirty-three studies involving 2475 patients were included. LRYGB resulted in greater loss of  mass index compared to LSG at 1 year [mean difference -1.25 kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.01 to -0.49, P = 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence] which persisted at 3 years, but there was insufficient evidence at 5 years. Resolution of dyslipidemia was higher for LRYGB than LSG at 1 year (risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73, P < 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence) and 5 years (risk ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.04; low certainty of evidence). There was no difference between LRYGB and LSG for remission of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, high-density lipoprotein, and the rate of 30-day major and minor complications.There are insufficient data from RCTs to draw any conclusions regarding the long-term comparative effectiveness beyond 3 years between LRYGB and LSG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696871>Topology-assisted, photo-strengthened DNA/siRNA delivery mediated by branched poly(β-amino ester)s via synchronized intracellular kinetics.</a></h1><p>The performance of non-viral gene delivery vehicles, especially cationic polymers, is often challenged by the multiple cellular barriers that pose inconsistent requirements for material properties. A most pronounced inconsistency is exemplified by the molecular  (MW)-related transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity. In this study, we report the development of photo-degradable, branched poly(β-amino ester)s (BPAE-NB) to realize efficient and photo-controlled DNA and siRNA delivery. BPAE-NB possessing built-in light-responsive 2-nitrobenzene moieties in the polymer backbone was synthesized via the A2 (amine) + B3 (triacrylate) + C2 (diacrylate) polycondensation reaction from 4-amino-1-butanol (A2), trimethylolpropane triacrylate (B3), and (2-nitro-1,3-phenylene)bis(methylene) diacrylate (NPBMDA, C2). The highly branched BPAE-NB with the multivalent arrangement of cationic groups provides stronger nucleic acid binding capacity than its linear analogue LPAE-NB, and thus features stronger trans-membrane gene delivery capabilities and higher transfection efficiencies. Upon UV light irradiation, the backbone of BPAE-NB can quickly degrade into low-MW fragments as a consequence of the cleavage of the light-responsive 2-nitrobenzene, thus promoting intracellular gene release and diminishing the toxicity of materials at the post-transfection state. As such, in multiple mammalian cells, BPAE-NB exhibited remarkably higher DNA/siRNA transfection efficiency yet lower cytotoxicity than its non-responsive analogue BPAE-CC upon light irradiation, notably outperforming commercial reagents PEI 25k and Lipofectamine 2000. This study therefore provides an effective topology- and photo-controlled approach to precisely manipulate the transfection efficiency and toxicity of polycationic gene vectors, and may also provide promising additions to the existing non-viral gene delivery vectors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696087>Comparing serum concentration of spexin among patients with metabolic syndrome, healthy overweight/obese, and normal- individuals.</a></h1><p> There are many factors related to etiology of metabolic syndrome (MetS) including obesity. Spexin, a peptide hormone released from adipose tissue, is the most down-regulated gene in obese, compared to non-obese adipose tissue. Hence, it potentially contributes to the progression and development of metabolic diseases. This study was designed to evaluate serum concentration of spexin in patients with MetS compared to -matched and normal- controls.  In this case-control study, 153 participants (51 per group) were collected from October 2014 to June 2016. The study groups were all matched for age and sex and included overweight/obese individuals with MetS and 2 control groups without MetS (including -matched and normal- participants).  composition and serum concentration of spexin and leptin were measured.  Serum leptin and spexin levels were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in normal- compared to overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p< 0.02). No significant difference was observed in serum leptin and spexin concentrations between the overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p≥ 0.05). Also, spexin, with cutoff value of 4.6, had 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity for diagnosing overweight/obese from normal- participants. Spexin had 78% sensitivity and specificity, with cutoff value of 4.35, in diagnosing MetS participants from normal- group.  This study found no correlation between the circulating level of spexin and MetS development. Higher serum concentration of spexin in normal- adults compared to the obese participants illustrated the potential role of this novel peptide in obesity.© 2019 Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694135>[An animal model of bladder reconstruction by autologous peritoneum transplantation].</a></h1><p> To establish experimental porcine model of reconstruction the neobladder by ileal seromuscular with transplantation of autologous peritoneum.  This was an animal experiment carried out from January to April 2018 at animal center of Guizhou Medical University. Randomly 6 experimental female porcines were chosen, and their  was 28 to 33 kg. By intravenous anesthesia, the transplantation of autologous peritoneum for bladder reconstruction operation was carried out by transplanting the peritoneum onto an ileum segment which mucosa and submucosa had been removed. These flaps were used to mend and reconstruct the neobladder by suturing with edge of the detective bladder. After removal of ureteral catheters and balloon catheter at day 5 and day 7 respectively, voiding behavior was monitored, and animals were euthanized at week 12 for routine pathology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopic examinations.  Six porcines underwent reconstruction, but no one lost to complications such as peritonitis, ileus and urinary fistula. Voiding behavior was normal, and urine was clear in all animals after removal of catheters. At autopsy, reconstructed bladders were healthy. Pathological examination showed the part of reconstruction had been covered by continuous urothelium while the peritoneum disappeared and showed no ileal mucosa regrowth and residual. Scanning electron microscope showed that the transitional cells of neobladder were complete and orderly, and urothelium around suture border was continuous and no malposition.  In this experimental porcine model, reconstruction bladder by autologous peritoneum and ileal seromuscular flaps is an ideal approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695954>Dansameum regulates hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation in vitro and in vivo.</a></h1><p>Although the clinical guidelines for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) therapy recommended hepato-protection and exercise to reduce , no established medication exists for NAFLD treatment. Thus, the effect of a candidate substance, dansameum (DSE), using an in vitro and NAFLD mouse model (that is, apolipoprotein E-Knockout mice), were investigated. The molecular pathways for lipogenesis and inflammation were evaluated using Nile staining, Western blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. It was shown that DSE significantly ameliorated the production of lipogenesis-related factors, including liver X receptor-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and CD36. In addition, DSE significantly reduced the production of inflammation factors, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and nuclear factor kappa B. Furthermore, DSE significantly reduced the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase. Taken together, this suggests that DSE may be a functional food candidate for regulating NAFLD, based on its effects.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694493>Magnitude and predictors of normal- central obesity- the AWI-Gen study findings.</a></h1><p>: Normal- central obesity is associated with higher mortality than general obesity as defined by  mass index, particularly in the absence of central fat distribution.: The aim of this study was to examine the magnitude and predictors of normal- central obesity in an urban informal settlement setting in Kenya.: We used data from the AWI-Gen study, a cross-sectional survey targeting randomly selected consenting adults between the ages of 40-60 in two urban informal settlements of Nairobi between 2014 and 2016.

The prevalence of normal- central obesity in the study population was highest when measured by waist to hip ratio (38.1%) and lowest when measured by visceral fat thickness (18.1%). Factors associated with normal- central obesity as assesses by waist circumference were being female, of older age, and in full-time employment. Older age was associated with normal- central obesity as assessed by waist to hip ratio.: The findings highlight a significant prevalence of normal- central obesity among adults in a poor urban setting in Kenya, pointing to women as a key target group for focused interventions.

Reasons for this variability are unclear and may be influenced by genes that regulate iron metabolism. We evaluated the association of the copy number of the glutathione S-transferase M1 () gene and degree of iron overload among patients with SCA. We compared LIC in 38 children with SCA and ≥12 lifetime erythrocyte transfusions stratified by  genotype. Baseline LIC was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), R2*MRI within 3 months prior to, and again after, starting iron unloading therapy. After controlling for -corrected transfusion burden (mL/kg) and splenectomy, mean pre-chelation LIC (mg/g dry liver dry ) was similar in all groups:  wild-type (WT) (11.45, SD±6.8), heterozygous (8.2, SD±4.52), and homozygous  deletion (-null; 7.8, SD±6.9,  = 0.09). However, after >12 months of chelation, -null genotype subjects had the least decrease in LIC compared to non-null genotype subjects (mean LIC change for -null = 0.1 (SD±3.3); versus -0.3 (SD±3.0) and -1.9 (SD±4.9) mg/g liver dry  for heterozygous and WT, respectively,  = 0.047).  homozygous deletion may prevent effective chelation in children with SCA and iron overload.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696323>Pelargonidin 3-glucoside-enriched strawberry attenuates symptoms of DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease and diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.</a></h1><p>To determine whether the anthocyanin, pelargonidin 3-glucoside (P3G), attenuates symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome in rats.We tested P3G-enriched strawberry in two models of chronic inflammation in rats, chronic IBD induced by 0.5% dextran sodium sulphate in the drinking water for 12 weeks (D) and metabolic syndrome induced by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (H) for 16 weeks. P3G-enriched strawberry was added to the diet for the final 6 weeks in IBD rats (DP) or 8 weeks in H rats (HP) to provide a dose of 8 mg P3G/kg/day.D rats had marked diarrhoea, bloody stools, erosion of mucosal epithelium, crypt atrophy, loss of villi and goblet cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. These symptoms were reversed by P3G with healthy stools and mucosal lining of ileum and colon including increased villi, crypts and goblet cells and reduced inflammation. H rats developed hypertension, dyslipidaemia, central obesity, increased ventricular stiffness, cardiac and liver inflammation, and steatosis. P3G treatment in H rats improved systolic blood pressure, ventricular stiffness, and cardiac and liver structure, and reduced abdominal fat, abdominal circumference and  gain.Our study indicates that dietary P3G decreased inflammation to decrease the symptoms of IBD, and to improve cardiovascular, liver and metabolic functions in metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697767>Prevalence and correlates of low serum calcium in late pregnancy: A cross sectional study in the Nkongsamba Regional Hospital; Littoral Region of Cameroon.</a></h1><p>Women from low and middle income countries are generally more likely to have sub-optimal calcium intake. The objective of this study was to assess serum calcium disorders and correlates in late pregnancy.We conducted from December 2018 to April 2019, a cross-sectional hospital-based study targeting pregnant women in late pregnancy in the Nkongsamba Regional Hospital. Data were collected by measurement of parameters (, height, blood pressure and foetal birthweight), administration of a semi-structured questionnaire and analysis of blood samples collected from each participant. Absorption spectrophotometry was used to measure serum calcium and albumin concentrations and corrected serum calcium calculated from the Payne's equation. With a statistical significant threshold set at p-value = 0.05, the odds ratio was used as a measure of the strength of association between hypocalcaemia and maternofoetal variables.We enrolled a total of 354 consenting participants with a mean age of 27.41±5.84 years. The prevalence of hypocalcaemia in late pregnancy was 58.76 [53.42-63.90]%. The rate of calcium supplementation in pregnancy was 57.63[52.28-62.80]% with a mean duration of supplementation of 3.69±1.47 months. When controlled for marital status, age, level of education, and gestational age at delivery, pregnant women with systolic blood pressures below 130 mmHg were significantly less likely to have hypocalcaemia than their counterparts with higher systolic blood pressures (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.41[0.18-0.89], p-value = 0.020). No statistically significant associations were found between diastolic blood pressure,  mass index, foetal birth  and hypocalcaemia.Hypocalcaemia in late pregnancy is highly prevalent (59%) among women accessing reproductive services at the Nkongsamba Regional Hospital. There is also a wide gap in calcium supplementation compared to World Health Organization recommendations. Hypocalcaemia is significantly associated to higher systolic blood pressure in pregnancy.

The aim of the study was to evaluate eating behaviours and knowledge on the potential risks of RM-PM consumption among gym users.In 2018, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 20 gyms in Turin using a 48-item questionnaire assessing sociodemographic, sports, dietary information and knowledge about RM-PM (sample size = 298). Multivariable logistic and linear regressions were performed. The significance level was  ⩽ 0.05.Around 75% of the sample consumed RM and PM at least once a week, with an average of 240.55 ± 435.99 g and 106.50 ± 157.88 g consumed weekly, respectively. Only 7.69% exceeded 700 g of raw RM weekly. Females, those with higher education, those who practise sport outside gyms and those who declared to practise sport to stay healthy, declared to consume less RM. Those who practise sport at a competitive level, those who are on a diet for athletic needs, those with higher  mass index (BMI) and those who consume more eggs and alcohol had a higher RM intake. The association with PM consumption was negative for females and positive for those living without a partner. The likelihood of answering incorrectly to one of the knowledge outcomes was lower for those who had a healthcare-related background and declared to practise sport to stay healthy, while it was higher for participants who stated to have a sport-related background, to be on a diet to lose , to read rarely/never the RM-PM nutrition labels and to consume <400 g of fruit and vegetables daily.Given the relatively low knowledge of the potential risks of RM-PM consumption, it would be advisable to implement campaigns specifically focused on male athletes and people with lower socioeconomic status, in order to raise awareness about this topic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698093>Influence of the interaction between cysticercosis and obesity on rabbit behavior and productive parameters.</a></h1><p>Parasites induce behavioral changes in the host and obesity is a health problem affecting different animal species. Cysticercosis caused by Taenia pisiformis affects some behavior of rabbits and reproductive behavior of does. Rabbits do not escape from metabolic disorders, being long-live animals useful in breeding, research and companion animals. Here, we addressed the interaction between parasitosis and obesity, and studied how these conditions or the comorbidity affect behavioral and productive parameters in bucks infected with 3000 T. pisiformis eggs. We found that the chronic infection reduced locomotor activity by 28.5% in obese, 18.5% in infected and 47% in obese-infected group (comorbid). The exploratory activity reduced by 42% in obese, 48% in infected and 68% in comorbid rabbits (P ≤ 0.001). Chinning was not affected by obesity, while infection decreased it by 25%. Behavioral reproductive parameters like response time, the mount latency and number of ejaculates were affected by infection and obesity. Furthermore, obesity seems to increase the parasite load promoting the formation of liver granulomas (16% granulomas compared with normal ), with a higher number of cysticerci in obese animals (86% more than normal ). Infection decreases ,  mass index and the zoometric index BW/LV in obese and normal  rabbits. In conclusion, infection with T. pisiformis altered behavioral and productive parameters, and obesity magnifies the impact caused by the infection. Also, obesity leads to major susceptibility to infection with T. pisiformis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, experimental datasets in the polymer-science field are typically limited and they are expensive to build. Their size (< 100 samples) limits the development of chemical intuition from experimentalists, as it constrains the use of machine-learning algorithms for extracting relevant information. We tackle this issue to predict and optimize adhesive materials by combining laboratory experimental design, an active learning pipeline and Bayesian optimization. We start from an initial dataset of 32 adhesive samples that were prepared from various molecular- bisphenol A-based epoxy resins and polyetheramine curing agents, mixing ratios and curing temperatures, and our data-driven method allows us to propose an optimal preparation of an adhesive material with a very high adhesive joint strength measured at 35.8 ± 1.1 MPa after three active learning cycles (five proposed preparations per cycle). A Gradient boosting machine learning model was used for the successive prediction of the adhesive joint strength in the active learning pipeline, and the model achieved a respectable accuracy with a coefficient of determination, root mean square error and mean absolute error of 0.85, 4.0 MPa and 3.0 MPa, respectively. This study demonstrates the important impact of active learning to accelerate the design and development of tailored highly functional materials from very small datasets.© 2019 The Author(s).

Then, Huh7 cells were transfected with shERβ lentivirus to knock down ERβ expression. The Huh7 cells were divided into three groups including Blank, experimental group (shERβ) and negative group (shLuc). Then, qRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK-8 assay, cell scratch assay, Transwell assay, Annexin V-FITC and PI double staining were performed based on these groups. Finally, a mouse xenograft model was constructed to verify the regulation of ERβ on Notch signaling pathway in liver cancer.In HepG2 cells, the ERβ expression in Pbi-EGFP-E group was higher than that in Blank and Bi-EGFP-C group. Overexpression of ERβ inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation, migration, invasion and Ki67 protein expression, as well as promoted apoptosis, Bcl-2 and Bax expression. Overexpression of ERβ decreased Notch1, Notch2 and Hes1 expression. In Huh7 cells, the effect of low ERβ expression was contrary to that of high ERβ expression. The shERβ + DAPT group reversed the effect of shERβ on the volume and  of transplanted tumors.ERβ may inhibit the development of liver cancer and promote apoptosis via inhibiting the Notch pathway.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694290>Impact of Donor Human Milk in the Preterm Very Low Birth  Gut Transcriptome Profile by Use of Exfoliated Intestinal Cells.</a></h1><p>Own mother's milk (OMM) is the optimal nutrition for preterm infants. However, pasteurized donor human milk (DHM) is a valid alternative. We explored the differences of the transcriptome in exfoliated epithelial intestinal cells (EEIC) of preterm infants receiving full feed with OMM or DHM.The prospective observational study included preterm infants ≤ 32 weeks' gestation and/or ≤1500 g birthweight. Total RNA from EEIC were processed for genome-wide expression analysis.Principal component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two clustered groups corresponding to the OMM and DHM groups that showed differences in the gene expression profile in 1629 transcripts. The OMM group overexpressed lactalbumin alpha gene (), Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene () and caseins kappa gene (), beta gene () and alpha gene () and underexpressed Neutrophil Cytosolic Factor 1 gene () compared to the DHM group.The transcriptomic analysis of EEIC showed that OMM induced a differential expression of specific genes that may contribute to a more efficient response to a pro-oxidant challenge early in the postnatal period when preterm infants are at a higher risk of oxidative stress.

Despite the occurrence of diverse therapies in recent years, the survival rate of patients with high-risk NB is still unpredictable due to the high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Therefore, it is urgent to study the molecular mechanism of NB metastasis. SNHG1 has been reported to be closely related to the development, metastasis, and prognosis of many cancers. The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of the role of SNHG1 in NB tumors.The expression levels of SNHG1, miR-338-3p, and PLK4 were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The functional targets between miR-338-3p and SNHG1 or PLK4 were predicted by online software Diana tools and observed by Luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Cell migration and invasion were operated through flow cytometry. The expression of p-AKT was quantified by Western blot. Xenograft tumor model was established to confirm the biological role of SNHG1 in NB in vivo.The expression levels of SNHG1 and PLK4 were increased in NB tissues and cells, and miR-338-3p expression was on the contrary. PLK4 was verified as a direct target of miR-338-3p and miR-338-3p could specially bind to SNHG1. The negative effect of SNHG1 down-regulation on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion could be rescued by miR-338-3p inhibition. The suppression of miR-338-3p mimics on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion could be reversed by PLK4 overexpression. In addition, SNHG1 knockdown weakened the volume and  of tumor in vivo.SNHG1 conduced to tumorigenesis and mechanism by upregulating PLK4 and by acting as miR-338-3p sponge in neuroblastoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695601>Observation of Both Skilled and Erroneous Object Lifting Can Improve Predictive Force Scaling in the Observer.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have highlighted that the observation of hand-object interactions can influence perceptual  judgments made by an observer. Moreover, observing salient motor errors during object lifting allows individuals to update their internal sensorimotor representation about object . Embodying observed visuomotor cues for the planning of a motor command further enables individuals to accurately scale their fingertip forces when subsequently lifting the same object. However, it is still unknown whether the observation of a skilled lift is equally able to mediate predictive motor control in the observer. Here, we tested this hypothesis by asking participants to grasp and lift a manipulandum after observing an actor's lift. The object  changed unpredictably (light or heavy) every fourth to sixth trial performed by the actor. Participants were informed that they would always lift the same  as the actor and that, based on the experimental condition, they would have to observe skilled or erroneously performed lifts. Our results revealed that the observation of both skilled and erroneously performed lifts allows participants to update their internal sensorimotor object representation, in turn enabling them to predict force scaling accurately. These findings suggest that the observation of salient motor errors, as well as subtle features of skilled motor performance, are embodied in the observer's motor repertoire and can drive changes in predictive motor control.Copyright © 2019 Rens and Davare.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696650>Total and trimester-specific gestational  gain and infant anthropometric outcomes at birth and 6 months in low-income Hispanic families.</a></h1><p>To describe total and trimester-specific gestational  gain (GWG) among low-income Hispanic women and determine whether these GWG exposures are associated with infant anthropometric outcomes at birth and 6 months.Data were from 448 mother-infant pairs enrolled in the Starting Early child obesity prevention trial.

The diatom was further subjected to stress conditions by altering the nutrient components such as nitrate, phosphate, silicate, and temperature. Silicon deprivation resulted in the highest lipid percentage of 28.78% of  at the end of the 18th day of the second stage. A significant increase in lipid content was observed on the complete removal of the nutrients silicon and urea one at a time, while the biomass showed a considerable reduction. The application of multiple nutrient stress conditions had a profound influence on the increased rate of lipid production. A combination of phosphate deprivation, silicate limitation and temperature reduction resulted in a significant increase in lipid percentage of 32.13% at the cost of reduced biomass (1.1 g L), whereas phosphate deprivation, urea limitation, and temperature reduction resulted in lipid percentage of 27.58% with a biomass of 1.44 g L at the end of the second stage. Further, the results were supported by Nile red staining, FTIR, fatty acid profile and oxidative stress marker analyses. The changes in biochemical composition and oxidative stress parameters within the various stress conditions demonstrated the profound influence of the selected stress factors on the biodiesel productivity of the diatom, besides its stress tolerance. A two-phase culturing system, with multifactor stress application, especially nitrogen limitation along with phosphate starvation and temperature stress, would be the suitable method for gaining maximum biomass productivity and lipid content in diatom  MACC8 towards biofuel production.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697638>Effects of Er:YAG Laser Treatment on the Mineral Content and Morphology of Primary Tooth Enamel.</a></h1><p> The aim of this study was to evaluate the mineral content and morphology of primary tooth enamel prepared using an Er:YAG laser at different power settings.

The surfaces were cleaned and the teeth were randomly divided into nine groups ( = 5 each) to evaluate the effects of Er:YAG laser treatment at different energy levels: 200 mJ, 2 Hz; 200 mJ, 3 Hz; 200 mJ, 10 Hz; 250 mJ, 2 Hz; 250 mJ, 3 Hz; 250 mJ, 10 Hz; 300 mJ, 2 Hz; 300 mJ, 3 Hz; and 300 mJ, 10 Hz. The mean percentage  (wt%) of calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), fluoride (F), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) in the primary tooth enamel was calculated for each group using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy before and after laser application. The enamel morphology was also evaluated using SEM. The obtained data were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honest significant difference test.  The mean wt% of Ca, P, and F in the enamel exhibited a significant change after laser treatment ( < 0.05); the wt% of Mg, K, and Na remained unchanged ( > 0.05). There was no association between the power setting of the laser and changes in the wt% of minerals in the enamel ( > 0.05).

In August 2018, the electronic databases searched were PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Science Direct, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. The eligibility criteria were defined according to the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design. In relation to the population, only studies with children or adolescents with overweight or obesity and without any other comorbidities were analyzed. Only publications in English were considered. Nine studies were selected. The comparisons identified were in relation to , type of activity, and play style versus control and preintervention. The magnitude of effect size suggests that the practice of exergaming has a small effect on psychological outcomes. Furthermore, cooperative games produced greater attraction to the game ( = 4.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.23-6.19) and greater intrinsic motivation ( = 5.29; 95% CI = 3.68-6.90).

Sesamol, a natural bioactive substance extracted from sesame oil, has shown multiple physiological functions, and it might have an effect on the treatment of obesity.This study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of sesamol on the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.C57BL/6J male mice were fed HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity, followed by supplementation with sesamol (100 mg/kg  [b.w.]/day [d] by gavage) for another 4 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe lipid accumulation in adipose tissues and liver. Chemistry reagent kits were used to measure serum lipids, hepatic lipids, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. ELISA kits were used to determine the serum insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels involved in lipid metabolism in the liver.Sesamol significantly reduced the  gain of obese mice and suppressed lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and liver. Sesamol also improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles, and increased insulin sensitivity. In the sesamol-treated group, the levels of serum ALT and AST decreased significantly. Furthermore, after sesamol treatment, the hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c) decreased, while the phosphorylated hormone sensitive lipase (p-HSL), the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC1α) increased, which were responsible for the fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid β-oxidation, respectively.Sesamol had a positive effect on anti-obesity and ameliorated the metabolic disorders of obese mice. The possible mechanism of sesamol might be the regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver.© 2019 Hong Qin et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698046>17α-Estradiol promotes ovarian aging in growth hormone receptor knockout mice, but not wild-type littermates.</a></h1><p>Growth hormone receptor knockout mice (GHRKO) have reduced  size and increased insulin sensitivity. These mice are known for having extended lifespan, healthspan and female reproductive longevity. Seventeen α-estradiol (17α-E2) is reported to increase insulin sensitivity and extend lifespan in male mice, with less robust effects in female mice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ovarian reserve in wild type and GHRKO mice treated with 17α-E2. The mice were divided into four groups, GHRKO mice receiving a standard chow diet, GHRKO mice treated 17α-E2, wild type mice receiving a standard chow diet and WT mice treated with 17α-E2. 17α-E2 was provided in the diet for four months. IGF1 plasma concentrations and changes in  were assessed. Histological slides were prepared from the ovaries and the number of follicles was counted. GHRKO mice receiving the control diet had a greater number of primordial follicles and lower numbers of primary follicles compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). 17α-E2 treatment decreased the number of primordial follicles in GHRKO mice (p < 0.05), however had no effect in wild type mice. Treatment with 17α-E2 had no significant effect on the change in  during the experiment (p = 0.75). Plasma IGF1 concentrations were significantly lower in GHRKO mice as compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that GHRKO mice displayed lesser primordial follicle activation as compared to wild type mice, but this phenotype was reversed by 17α-E2 administration, suggesting that ovarian aging is increased by 17α-E2 in long-living mice with extended reproductive longevity.Copyright © 2018.

Lung function could potentially be restored with exogenous surfactant therapy, but clinical trials have so far been disappointing. These negative results may be explained by inactivation and/or too low doses of the administered surfactant. Surfactant based on a recombinant surfactant protein C analogue (rSP-C33Leu) is easy to produce and in this study we compared its effects on lung function and inflammation with a commercial surfactant preparation in an adult rabbit model of ARDS.ARDS was induced in adult New Zealand rabbits by mild lung-lavages followed by injurious ventilation (V 20 m/kg ) until P/F ratio < 26.7 kPa. The animals were treated with two intratracheal boluses of 2.5 mL/kg of 2% rSP-C33Leu in DPPC/egg PC/POPG, 50:40:10 or poractant alfa (Curosurf®), both surfactants containing 80 mg phospholipids/mL, or air as control. The animals were subsequently ventilated (V 8-9 m/kg ) for an additional 3 h and lung function parameters were recorded. Histological appearance of the lungs, degree of lung oedema and levels of the cytokines TNFα IL-6 and IL-8 in lung homogenates were evaluated.Both surfactant preparations improved lung function vs. the control group and also reduced inflammation scores, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and formation of lung oedema to similar degrees. Poractant alfa improved compliance at 1 h, P/F ratio and PaO at 1.5 h compared to rSP-C33Leu surfactant.This study indicates that treatment of experimental ARDS with synthetic lung surfactant based on rSP-C33Leu improves lung function and attenuates inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693926>Vaporized perfluorocarbon inhalation attenuates primary blast lung injury in canines by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-κB activation and inducing nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 pathway.</a></h1><p>Blast lung injury is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Vaporized perfluorocarbon (PFC) inhalation has been reported to attenuate acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans and animal models. However, the effect of vaporized PFC on blast lung injury is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the protective effects and potential underlying mechanisms of action of vaporized PFC on blast lung injury in a canine model. This was a prospective, controlled, animal study in adult male hybrid dogs randomized to sham, blast (B), blast plus mechanical ventilation (B + M), and blast plus PFC (B + P) groups. All groups except for the sham were exposed to blast wave. The B + P group was treated with vaporized PFC for 1.5 h followed by 5.5 h mechanical ventilation. B + M group received 7.5 h mechanical ventilation and B group was observed for 7.5 h. Blast lung injury was induced using a shock tube. Blood gas, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress were measured. Expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2) were measured using western blot. Lung injury observed after blast exposure was marked by increased histopathological scores, ratio of lung wet to dry . PFC treatment attenuated blast lung injury as indicated by histopathological scores and ratio of lung wet to dry . PFC treatment downregulated interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and malondialdehyde (MDA), and upregulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. PFC also suppressed expression of MAPK/NF-κB and Nrf2 protein levels. Our results suggest that PFC attenuated blast-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting MAPK/NF-κB activation and inducing Nrf2 expression in dogs.Copyright © 2019.

By imposing temporal and thermal control of the orthogonal gelation methods, the system either forms an extended inter-penetrating network or core-shell structured gel beads - a rare example of a supramolecular gel formulated inside discrete gel spheres. The self-assembled LMWG retains its unique properties within the beads, such as remediating Pd(II) and reducing it in situ to yield catalytically-active Pd(0) nanoparticles. A single PdNP-loaded gel bead can catalyse the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, constituting a simple and easy-to-use reaction dosing form.

Lettuce ( L.) is sensitive to salinity, which reduces plant biomass, and causes leaf burn and early senescence. We sought to identify physiological traits important in salt tolerance that allows lettuce adaptation to high salinity while maintaining its productivity. Based on previous salinity tolerance studies, one sensitive and one tolerant genotype each was selected from crisphead, butterhead, and romaine, as well as leaf types of cultivated lettuce and its wild relative,  L. Physiological parameters were measured four weeks after transplanting two-day old seedlings into 350 mL volume pots filled with sand, hydrated with Hoagland nutrient solution and grown in a growth chamber. Salinity treatment consisted of gradually increasing concentrations of NaCl and CaCl from 0 mM/0 mM at the time of transplanting, to 30 mM/15 mM at the beginning of week three, and maintaining it until harvest. Across the 10 genotypes, leaf area and fresh  decreased 0-64% and 16-67%, respectively, under salinity compared to the control. Salinity stress increased the chlorophyll index by 4-26% in the cultivated genotypes, while decreasing it by 5-14% in the two wild accessions. Tolerant lines less affected by elevated salinity were characterized by high values of the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Fv/Fm and instantaneous photosystem II quantum yield (QY), and lower leaf transpiration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695584>Recommendations on Measurement Units - Why and How.</a></h1><p>Globally, laboratories are producing, communicating, and exchanging millions of laboratory examination values to multiple parties every day. For most values, 'measurement units' are required to make the numerical values comparable and meaningful. However, a non-systematic use of 'measurement units' can create errors in communication between health care providers and become a risk to patient safety. Therefore, the Committee of Nomenclature for Properties and Units (C-NPU) recommends using an unambiguous terminology of 'measurement units', for daily patient care and scientific publications. In this work, C-NPU summarizes the recommendations on 'measurement units', explaining the reasons and the principles of the 'measurement units' used in laboratory medicine.Copyright © 2019 International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC).

We report a case of a 66-year-old immigrant male from Haiti who presented with complaints of diarrhea and an unintentional 80-lb  loss over the past 5 years. Stool examination was positive for strongyloidiasis. Following albendazole therapy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a unique ampullary lesion. Histopathology of the ampullary lesion showed reactive epithelium with  larva. In addition, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) detected a large pancreatic cyst. Both these findings were absent on EGD 5 years previously, prior to the onset of his symptoms. This paper documents a rare case of an ampullary lesion and pancreatic cyst secondary to hepatobiliary strongyloidiasis in a non-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patient.

However, the mechanism through which RSV improves insulin resistance is not fully understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism through which RSV ameliorates insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model, as well as palmitic acid (PA) treated L6 cells, with a specific focus on the response of RSV on fatty acid oxidation.Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet-fed mice (ND), the high-fat diet-fed mice (HFD), HFD supplemented with RSV (100 mg/kg  [BW]/day orally; n = 10). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid levels were determined. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was used to measure blood glucose and area under the curve. The quantitative insulin sensitivity index was calculated to assess insulin resistance. Skeletal muscles were collected for histology study and protein expression measurement. L6 cells were cultured with PA and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, and the intracellular TG levels were tested. RSV, chloroquine, palmitoyltransferase and Ku-55933 were administered to differentiate L6 cells.The HFD fed mice showed increased BW, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The expressions of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV protein were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscles of HFD fed mice and PA-treated L6 cells. All these effects induced by HFD and PA were reversed by RSV treatment.ATM is a key factor to improve HFD-induced lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. The effects of RSV on ameliorating HFD-induced abnormal lipid metabolism and insulin resistance mediated through ATM-AMPK pathway may due to its improvement in fatty acid oxidation efficiency and sequential reduction in ROS production in skeletal muscle. These results provide important theoretical evidence for the application of RSV in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus and related metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692759>Acute effect of a cod protein hydrolysate on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration and sensations associated with appetite in healthy subjects: a double-blind crossover trial.</a></h1><p>Fish protein hydrolysates are suggested to contain bioactive sequences capable of affecting metabolic pathways involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and  when consumed in low doses. Modulation of the appetite-regulating hormone ghrelin may explain suppression of insulin secretion and  loss observed in previous studies with fish protein hydrolysates.This study aimed to assess the effect of a single, low dose of cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) before a breakfast meal on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration and sensations associated with appetite in healthy subjects.In this explorative trial with a crossover design, 41 healthy individuals (15 males and 26 females, age 51 ± 6 years) completed 2 study days separated by 4-7 days of washout. On both study days, a test drink containing 20 mg CPH or casein (control) per kg  was given immediately before a standardized breakfast meal. Acylated ghrelin concentrations were measured before test drink/breakfast (baseline) and at time 0, 20, 40, 80, and 180 min postprandially. Sensations associated with appetite were measured by a Visual Analog Scale (100 mm) at baseline and 0, 20, 40, and 180 min postprandially.Statistically, no difference was observed between CPH and control for postprandial acylated ghrelin concentrations (mean difference geometric mean: 1.05 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97-1.13,  = 0.266), or between the total area under the curve (tAUC) for acylated ghrelin after CPH (tAUC = 17518 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-47941) and control (tAUC = 17272 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-48048,  = 0.991). No differences were found between CPH and control for sensation of appetite, according to tAUC of postprandial scores for satiety ( = 0.794) and the feeling of fullness ( = 0.996).We did not find an effect of a single dose of CPH on postprandial concentrations of acylated ghrelin or sensations related to feeling of hunger, compared to control.

Osmolality, pH, viscosity, and sodium concentration were determined using an osmometer, pH meter, rheometer, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, respectively.The MW of HA varied considerably between formulations. The PDI was >2.0 in two formulations (2.28 and 4.94), suggesting the presence of a copolymer and/or HA size variability. Three formulations exhibited viscosity exceeding the blur threshold at different shear rates. Viscosity at low shear rates was generally highest in formulations containing high-MW HA. Correlations were found between observed viscosity and a predictive/calculated value, except for four copolymer-containing formulations, and osmolality (range, 154-335 mOsm/kg) and sodium concentration (range, 22-183 mM), with two exceptions. Compared with organic osmolytes, adding sodium decreased viscosity, particularly at lower shear rates.In the context of the literature, our findings suggest that for most patients with dry eye disease, the ideal HA-based artificial tear should include high-MW HA with a low PDI and exhibit enhanced viscosity at low shear rate (without exceeding the blur threshold). The inclusion of synergistic copolymers and a low sodium concentration may increase viscosity, but whether any of these physicochemical properties or correlations can predict clinical efficacy will require further investigation.Understanding the properties of HA-based artificial tears will support the development of unique formulations that target specific ocular surface conditions.Copyright 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694658>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids status and cognitive function in young women.</a></h1><p>Research indicates that low omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) may be associated with decreased cognitive function. This study examined the association between n-3 PUFA status and cognitive function in young Australian women.This was a secondary outcome analysis of a cross-sectional study that recruited 300 healthy women (18-35 y) of normal  (NW: BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m) or obese  (OB: BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Participants completed a computer-based cognition testing battery (IntegNeuro™) evaluating the domains of impulsivity, attention, information processing, memory and executive function. The Omega-3 Index (O3I) was used to determine n-3 PUFA status (percentage of EPA (20:5n-3) plus DHA (22:6n3) in the red cell membrane) and the participants were divided into O3I tertile groups: T1 < 5.47%, T2 = 5.47-6.75%, T3 > 6.75%. Potential confounding factors of BMI, inflammatory status (C-reactive Protein), physical activity (total MET-min/wk), alpha1-acid glycoprotein, serum ferritin and hemoglobin, were assessed. Data reported as z-scores (mean ± SD), analyses via ANOVA and ANCOVA.Two hundred ninety-nine women (26.9 ± 5.4 y) completed the study (O3I data, n = 288). The ANOVA showed no overall group differences but a significant group × cognition domain interaction (p < 0.01). Post hoc tests showed that participants in the low O3I tertile group scored significantly lower on attention than the middle group (p = 0.01; ES = 0.45 [0.15-0.74]), while the difference with the high group was borderline significant (p = 0.052; ES = 0.38 [0.09-0.68]). After confounder adjustments, the low group had lower attention scores than both the middle (p = 0.01) and high (p = 0.048) groups. These findings were supported by univariate analyses which found significant group differences for the attention domain only (p = 0.004).Cognitive function in the attention domain was lower in women with lower O3I, but still within normal range. This reduced but normal level of cognition potentially provides a lower baseline from which cognition would decline with age. Further investigation of individuals with low n-3 PUFA status is warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693123>Association of Chorioamnionitis With Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Among Preterm Infants: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Metaregression.</a></h1><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity, remains one of the major and most common complications of very preterm birth. Insight into factors associated with the pathogenesis of BPD is key to improving its prevention and treatment.To perform a systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression of clinical studies exploring the association between chorioamnionitis (CA) and BPD in preterm infants.PubMed and Embase were searched without language restriction (last search, October 1, 2018). Key search terms included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chorioamnionitis, and risk factors.Included studies were peer-reviewed studies examining preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) or very low-birth- (<1500 g) infants and reporting primary data that could be used to measure the association between exposure to CA and the development of BPD.The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline was followed. Data were independently extracted by 2 researchers. A random-effects model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity in effect size across studies was studied using multivariate, random-effects metaregression analysis.The primary outcome was BPD, defined as supplemental oxygen requirement on postnatal day 28 (BPD28) or at the postmenstrual age of 36 weeks (BPD36). Covariates considered as potential confounders included differences between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and rates of early- and late-onset sepsis.A total of 3170 potentially relevant studies were found, of which 158 met the inclusion criteria (244 096 preterm infants, 20 971 CA cases, and 24 335 BPD cases). Meta-analysis showed that CA exposure was significantly associated with BPD28 (65 studies; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.88-2.86; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 84%; P < .001) and BPD36 (108 studies; OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < .001; heterogeneity: I2 = 63%; P < .001). The association between CA and BPD remained significant for both clinical and histologic CA. In addition, significant differences were found between CA-exposed and CA-unexposed infants in gestational age, birth , odds of being small for gestational age, exposure to antenatal corticosteroids, and early- and late-onset sepsis. Chorioamnionitis was not significantly associated with RDS (48 studies; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.92-1.34; P = .24; heterogeneity: I2 = 90%; P < .001), but multivariate metaregression analysis with backward elimination revealed that a model combining the difference in gestational age and the odds of RDS was associated with 64% of the variance in the association between CA and BPD36 across studies.The results of this study confirm that among preterm infants, exposure to CA is associated with a higher risk of developing BPD, but this association may be modulated by gestational age and risk of RDS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696098>Intraventricular Hemorrhage: Risk Factors and Association With Patent Ductus Arteriosus Treatment in Extremely Preterm Neonates.</a></h1><p> To assess maternal and neonatal risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). To examine the association of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its treatment, with IVH and its severity.  In this retrospective cohort study, we included preterm neonates born at <29 weeks, admitted to a tertiary level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Calgary, Canada, between 2013 and 2016, who had a head ultrasound in the first 7 days of life. A subset analysis included neonates who also had cardiac ultrasound in the first 3 days of life.  Of the 495 neonates, 121 (24.4%) had IVH of any grade and 48 (9.7%) had severe IVH. Identified risk factors were small birth gestation and , lack of antenatal corticosteroids, maternal chorioamnionitis, Apgar score <5 at 5 min, umbilical cord pH < 7, respiratory distress syndrome, early onset sepsis, hypercapnia, pCO fluctuations, prolonged intubation, inhaled nitric oxide, inotropes or normal saline boluses, metabolic derangements, opioids infusions, and bicarbonate/THAM therapy. In a primary analysis of the total cohort, when the decision to treat a PDA was used as a surrogate marker of its clinical significance, a PDA requiring treatment was associated with a higher risk of IVH. There was no significant difference in the incidence of IVH between neonates with early treatment of a clinically significant PDA compared to late, however early indomethacin treatment was associated with reduced severity of IVH. In the subset analysis, the presence of a hemodynamically significant PDA (hs-PDA) was not associated with a higher probability of IVH. Of those with severe IVH, 18 (55%) had a hs-PDA; this is clinically but not statistically significant.  Identified risk factors should be the target of IVH reduction bundles. Early indomethacin treatment for a clinically significant PDA may reduce IVH severity.Copyright © 2019 Khanafer-Larocque, Soraisham, Stritzke, Al Awad, Thomas, Murthy, Kamaluddeen, Scott and Mohammad.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695426>S100 Calcium Binding Protein A11 (S100A11) Promotes The Proliferation, Migration And Invasion Of Cervical Cancer Cells, And Activates Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.</a></h1><p>This study is aimed to investigate the specific regulatory role of S100 calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11) on cervical cancer (CC), and reveal the potential mechanisms relating to Wnt/β-catenin signaling.The expression of S100A11 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), adjacent non-cancerous, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and normal cervical tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and/or immunohistochemistry.

Whether this predisposes these individuals to long-term adverse outcomes is still unresolved.To describe the association of  mass index (BMI, calculated as  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) with long-term outcomes in patients with HCM in terms of overall disease progression, heart failure symptoms, and arrhythmias.In this cohort study, retrospective data were analyzed from the ongoing prospective Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry, an international database created by 8 high-volume HCM centers that includes more than 6000 patients who have been observed longitudinally for decades. Records from database inception up to the first quarter of 2018 were analyzed. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to BMI class (normal  group, <25; preobesity group, 25-30; and obesity group, >30). Patients with 1 or more follow-up visits were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from April to October 2018.Association of baseline BMI with outcome was assessed.Outcome was measured against overall and cardiovascular mortality, a heart failure outcome (ejection fraction less than 35%, New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms, cardiac transplant, or assist device implantation), a ventricular arrhythmic outcome (sudden cardiac death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy), and an overall composite outcome (first occurrence of any component of the ventricular arrhythmic or heart failure composite end point, all-cause mortality, atrial fibrillation, or stroke).Of the 3282 included patients, 2019 (61.5%) were male, and the mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 47 (15) years.

There were 962 patients in the normal  group (29.3%), 1280 patients in the preobesity group (39.0%), and 1040 patients in the obesity group (31.7%). Patients with obesity were more symptomatic (New York Heart Association class of III/IV: normal , 87 [9.0%]; preobesity, 138 [10.8%]; obesity, 215 [20.7%]; P < .001) and more often had obstructive physiology (normal , 201 [20.9%]; preobesity, 327 [25.5%]; obesity, 337 [32.4%]; P < .001). At follow-up, obesity was independently associated with the HCM-related overall composite outcome (preobesity vs normal : hazard ratio [HR], 1.102; 95% CI, 0.920-1.322; P = .29; obesity vs normal : HR, 1.634; 95% CI, 1.332-1.919; P < .001) and the heart failure composite outcome (preobesity vs normal : HR, 1.192; 95% CI, 0.930-1.1530; P = .20; obesity vs normal : HR, 1.885; 95% CI, 1.485-2.393; P < .001) irrespective of age, sex, left atrium diameter, obstruction, and genetic status. Obesity increased the likelihood of atrial fibrillation but not of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.Obesity is highly prevalent among patients with HCM and is associated with increased likelihood of obstructive physiology and adverse outcomes. Strategies aimed at preventing obesity and  increase may play an important role in management and prevention of disease-related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697966>Postprandial Regulation of Prouroguanylin in humans of a Healthy  and those who are Overweight or with Obesity.</a></h1><p>Uroguanylin is a peptide gut hormone proposed to have a role in signalling post meal satiety. Uroguanylin circulates as its pro-hormone, prouroguanylin. There has been limited investigation of the regulation of prouroguanylin by food; therefore we investigated prouroguanylin regulation following meals. In separate experiments we investigated the effects of high calorie (1451 kcal) and medium calorie (725 kcal), high fat meals, on plasma prouroguanylin concentrations. We then examined the effect of a 722.5 kcal high carbohydrate breakfast on prouroguanylin concentrations, comparing the response in healthy  adults versus those who are overweight/ with obesity. The 1451 kcal meal increased prouroguanylin concentrations, versus fasting at 60 (P < 0.05), 90 (P < 0.01) and 120 (P < 0.001) minutes. After the 725 kcal meal hormone concentrations rose more slowly and were significant versus fasting concentrations at 120 minutes (P < 0.01). The high carbohydrate breakfast 722.5 kcal, led to an initial suppression of hormone concentrations at 30 min. post meal (P < 0.05) followed by an increase in concentrations until they were significant versus fasting at 120 min. (P < 0.01). Participants overweight/ with obesity had lower fasting prouroguanylin concentrations (P < 0.05), but post meal concentrations did not differ between the groups. Our results suggest there is a delayed increase in prouroguanylin concentrations following, large and regular sized mixed macronutrient meals rich in fat or carbohydrate. Fasting levels are suppressed in people who are overweight/ with obesity, but the post meal response remains intact. There may be potential to target post meal release of prouroguanylin in obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) comprise populations of immature myeloid cells in tumor-bearing hosts with a highly immunosuppressive capacity. We could previously identify RIG-I-like helicases (RLH) as targets for the immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer inducing immunogenic tumor cell death and type I interferons (IFN) as key mediators linking innate with adaptive immunity.Mice with orthotopically implanted Kras p53 Ptf1a-Cre (KPC) pancreatic tumors were treated intravenously with the RLH ligand polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), and the immune cell environment in tumor and spleen was characterized. A comprehensive analysis of the suppressive capacity as well as the whole transcriptomic profile of isolated MDSC subsets was performed. Antigen presentation capability of MDSC from mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumors was investigated in T cell proliferation assays. The role of IFN in MDSC function was investigated in Ifnar1 mice.MDSC were strongly induced in orthotopic KPC-derived pancreatic cancer, and frequencies of MDSC subsets correlated with tumor  and G-CSF serum levels, whereas other immune cell populations decreased. Administration of the RLH-ligand induced a IFN-driven immune response, with increased activation of T cells and dendritic cells (DC), and a reduced suppressive capacity of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSC and monocytic (M)-MDSC fractions. Whole transcriptomic analysis confirmed an IFN-driven gene signature of MDSC, a switch from a M2/G2- towards a M1/G1-polarized phenotype, and the induction of genes involved in the antigen presentation machinery. Nevertheless, MDSC failed to present tumor antigen to T cells. Interestingly, we found MDSC with reduced suppressive function in Ifnar1-deficient hosts; however, there was a common flaw in immune cell activation, which was reflected by defective immune cell activation and tumor control.We provide evidence that the treatment with immunostimulatory RNA reprograms the TME of pancreatic cancer by reducing the suppressive activity of MDSC, polarizing myeloid cells into a M1-like state and recruiting DC. We postulate that tumor cell-targeting combination strategies may benefit from RLH-based TME remodeling. In addition, we provide novel insights into the dual role of IFN signaling in MDSC's suppressive function and provide evidence that host-intrinsic IFN signaling may be critical for MDSC to gain suppressive function during tumor development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698074>Lepidosaur ß-Keratin Chains With Four 34-Residue Repeats: Modelling Reveals A Potential Filament-Crosslinking Role.</a></h1><p>ß-keratin chains contain a characteristic and homologous 34-residue sequence, which is believed to adopt a twisted ß-sheet conformation that assembles in an antiparallel manner with a similar sheet in a second chain to form a ß-sandwich. These sandwiches are, in turn, related to one another by a left-handed four-fold screw axis to generate a helical structure that forms the core of the 3.4 nm diameter filaments observed by electron microscopy and deduced from X-ray fibre diffraction. Recently, it has been shown that one ß-keratin chain, with a molecular  approximately twice that of the majority of ß-keratin chains, is conserved across the lepidosaurs (lizards, snakes and tuatara). Uniquely, it contains four 34-residue repeats. Although this chain is a minor component the observation that the entire chain shows a high degree of sequence conservation between species suggests an important structural/functional role in vivo. Modelling shows that only six families of structures are physically possible. In three of these the repeats exist within a single filament and might therefore act in a filament nucleation role. In the second three families the repeats exist in two, three or four filaments, implying that their function may be to act as an inter-filament crosslinker, thereby providing lateral reinforcement to the epidermal appendage. The favoured model is one in which the first two repeats form a β-sandwich in one filament and the second two repeats form a β-sandwich in a neighbouring filament. Links between alternating up- and down-pointing β-sheets would provide optimum connectivity.Copyright © 2019.

Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) surgery is given little  in medical school curricula, despite ENT problems being extremely common. Our objective is to assess whether a specialty showcase day was sufficient to boost informed consideration of this career.We designed a half-day course involving an interactive careers workshop exploring ENT as a specialty choice, alongside simulation stations of commonly presenting ENT problems led by ENT doctors. We used pre- and post-course evaluation sheets to explore factors that encourage and discourage students from surgical careers and perceptions of ENT.A large proportion of UK medical schools do not offer ENT placements, and of those that do, nearly half are not compulsory. This leaves students unaware of ENT as a career option and unclear about what an ENT career comprises. Our half-day course took place in the simulation suite at St Mary's Hospital, London.Medical students were mainly in their third year of study and had aspirations towards a variety of surgical and non-surgical careers, with a minority aspiring towards ENT before the course.Our results demonstrate that all students found the session useful and had a much better understanding of ENT practice, with almost all students leaving more likely to consider a career in ENT.We would like to repeat this session in different student year groups and compare their perceptions with our results. We find our results a good case for including informative careers workshops as part of medical school teaching. We pose that interactive workshops exploring specialist surgical careers are a valid way to enable students in making informed career decisions - particularly in specialties that are under-represented at medical school.© 2019 Arwyn-Jones et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695236>El receptor soluble de insulina y el síndrome metabólico.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome describes a group of signs that increase the likelihood for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer. The action of insulin depends on its binding to membrane receptors on its target cells. We wonder if blood insulin could travel bound to proteins and if, in the presence of hyperinsulinemia, a soluble insulin receptor might be generated. We used young adult Wistar rats (which have no predisposition to obesity or diabetes), whose drinking water was added 20 % of sugar and that were fed a standard diet ad libitum for two and six months. They were compared with control rats under the same conditions, but that had running water for consumption. At two months, the rats developed central obesity, moderate hypertension, high triglyceride levels, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, i.e. metabolic syndrome. Electrophoresis of the rats' plasma proteins was performed, followed by Western Blot (WB) for insulin and for the outer portion of the insulin receptor. The bands corresponding to insulin and to the receptor external part were at the same molecular  level, 25-fold higher than that of free insulin. We demonstrated that insulin, both in control animals and in those with hyperinsulinemia, travels bound to the receptor outer portion (ectodomain), which we called soluble insulin receptor, and that is released al higher amounts in response to plasma insulin increase; in rats with metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia, plasma levels are much higher than in controls. Soluble insulin receptor increase in blood might be an early sign of metabolic syndrome.Copyright: © 2019 Permanyer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695948>Effect of agave fructans on the production of short chain fatty acid in mice.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of agave fructans on short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in mice (C57BL/6).

The model describes growth and lipid deposition in tissues of fast- (FG) and slow- (SG) growing broilers from hatching to slaughter and simulates the exposure through the ingestion of contaminated feed or expanded polystyrene insulation material. Growth parameters were obtained from the literature while parameters relative to uptake, distribution, and elimination of α-HBCDD were adjusted using results of a previous experiment involving broilers exposed through feed throughout the rearing period or allowed to depurate before slaughter. The model was used to compare the two main edible tissues, breast and leg meat, as well as skin, and to investigate the variability within strain. Between strains and within strain, α-HBCDD assimilation efficiency (AE) is higher when the animals are slaughtered young or heavy. However, increasing slaughter age will lower α-HBCDD concentration in tissues, due to dilution. Based on fresh , the concentration of α-HBCDD in breast muscles and skin tends to be lower in SG than in FG broilers (-30 to +10%), while it is 10% to 80% higher in leg muscles. Compared to breast muscles, consuming leg muscles would elicit an exposure 9 and 16 times higher in FG and SG broilers, respectively. The consumption of skin together with muscles would multiply the exposure by up to 36 times compared to breast muscle alone. In case of acute exposure, the α-HBCDD concentration in tissues increased sharply, all the more since the animals are lighter in , and then decreased rapidly. In FG broilers, dilution through growth contributed for up to 37%, 28% and 97% to the decontamination of breast muscles, leg muscles and skin, respectively, depending on the duration of depuration before slaughter.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697385>Juvenile toxicity rodent model to study toxicological effects of Bisphenol A (BPA) at dose levels derived from Italian children biomonitoring study.</a></h1><p>Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a plasticizer with endocrine disrupting properties particularly relevant for children health. Recently BPA has been associated with metabolic dysfunctions but no data are yet available in specific, long-term studies. This study aimed to evaluate BPA modes of action and hazards during animal juvenile life-stage, corresponding to childhood. Immature Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were orally treated with 0 (vehicle only - olive oil), 2, 6 and 18 mg/kg bw per day of BPA for 28 days, from weaning to sexual maturity. Dose levels were obtained from the PERSUADED biomonitoring study in Italian children. Both No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level [NOAEL]/Low-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level [LOAEL] and estimated Benchmark Dose (BMD) approaches were applied. General toxicity, parameters of sexual development, endocrine/reproductive/functional liver and kidney biomarkers, histopathology of target tissues, and gene expression in hypothalamic-pituitary area and liver were studied. No mortality or general toxicity occurred. Sex-specific alterations were observed in liver, thyroid, spleen, leptin/adiponectin serum levels and hypothalamic-pituitary gene expression. Thyroid homeostasis and liver were the most sensitive targets of BPA exposure in the peripubertal phase. The proposed LOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw, considering as critical effect the liver endpoints, kidney  in male and adrenal histomorphometrical alterations and osteopontin up-regulation in female rats. The BMD lower bounds were 0.05 and 1.33 mg/kg bw in males and females, considering liver and thyroid biomarkers, respectively. Overall, BPA evaluation at dose levels derived from children biomonitoring study allowed to identify sex-specific targeted toxicological effects that may have significant impact on risk assessment for children.© The Author(s) 2019.

Identifying and predicting these diseases in patients is the first step towards stopping their progression. We evaluate the capabilities of machine learning models in detecting at-risk patients using survey data (and laboratory results), and identify key variables within the data contributing to these diseases among the patients.Our research explores data-driven approaches which utilize supervised machine learning models to identify patients with such diseases. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, we conduct an exhaustive search of all available feature variables within the data to develop models for cardiovascular, prediabetes, and diabetes detection. Using different time-frames and feature sets for the data (based on laboratory data), multiple machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and gradient boosting) were evaluated on their classification performance. The models were then combined to develop a weighted ensemble model, capable of leveraging the performance of the disparate models to improve detection accuracy. Information gain of tree-based models was used to identify the key variables within the patient data that contributed to the detection of at-risk patients in each of the diseases classes by the data-learned models.The developed ensemble model for cardiovascular disease (based on 131 variables) achieved an Area Under - Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) score of 83.1% using no laboratory results, and 83.9% accuracy with laboratory results. In diabetes classification (based on 123 variables), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model achieved an AU-ROC score of 86.2% (without laboratory data) and 95.7% (with laboratory data). For pre-diabetic patients, the ensemble model had the top AU-ROC score of 73.7% (without laboratory data), and for laboratory based data XGBoost performed the best at 84.4%. Top five predictors in diabetes patients were 1) waist size, 2) age, 3) self-reported , 4) leg length, and 5) sodium intake. For cardiovascular diseases the models identified 1) age, 2) systolic blood pressure, 3) self-reported , 4) occurrence of chest pain, and 5) diastolic blood pressure as key contributors.We conclude machine learned models based on survey questionnaire can provide an automated identification mechanism for patients at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We also identify key contributors to the prediction, which can be further explored for their implications on electronic health records.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693732>Inhibition of human lung adenocarcinoma growth and metastasis by JC polyomavirus-like particles packaged with an SP-B promoter-driven CD59-specific shRNA.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer ranks first in both incidence and mortality and is a major health concern worldwide. Upon recognition of specific antigens on tumor cells, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is activated, arresting cell growth or inducing apoptosis. However, by overexpressing CD59, a membrane complement regulatory protein (mCRP), lung cancer cells develop resistance to CDC. We previously showed that virus-like particles (VLPs) of human JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) could be used as a gene therapy vector to carry a suicide gene expression plasmid with a lung-specific promoter (SP-B (surfactant protein B)) for lung adenocarcinomas. Herein, we designed a CD59-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmid driven by SP-B (pSPB-shCD59) to effectively and specifically inhibit CD59 overexpression in lung cancer cells. Treatment of lung cancer cells in vitro with JCPyV VLPs containing pSPB-shCD59 (pSPB-shCD59/VLPs) induces CDC and death of cancer cells. Mice that were subcutaneously injected with human lung cancer cells showed an 87% inhibition in tumor growth after tail vein injection of pSPB-shCD59/VLPs. Moreover, in a mouse model of lung cancer metastasis, a reduction in the lung  by 39%, compared with the control group, was observed in mice treated with pSPB-shCD59/VLPs after tail vein injection of human lung cancer cells. Furthermore, tissue sectioning showed that the number and size of tumors produced was significantly reduced in the lungs of mice in the treatment group than those of the untreated group, indicating inhibition of metastasis by pSPB-shCD59/VLPs. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of pSPB-shCD59/VLPs as a therapeutic agent for CD59 overexpressed lung cancer.© 2019 The Author(s).

Although adverse health effects gradually emerge, research determining individual vulnerability is limited. This study estimated the relationship between air pollution and obesity. Individual information of 13,414 respondents from 125 cities is used in the analysis. This study employs ordinary least squares (OLS) and multinomial logit model (m-logit) to estimate the impact of air pollution on obesity. We choose different air pollution and  Mass Index (BMI) indicators for estimation. Empirical results show Air Quality Index (AQI) is significantly positively associated with the BMI score. As AQI adds one unit, the BMI score increases 0.031 (SE = 0.002;  < 0.001). The influence coefficients of particle size smaller than 2.5 μm (PM), particle size smaller than 10 μm (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO), ozone (O), and sulfur dioxide (SO) to the BMI score are 0.034 (SE = 0.002;  < 0.001), 0.023 (SE = 0.001;  < 0.001), 0.52 (SE = 0.095;  < 0.001), 0.045 (SE = 0.004;  < 0.001), 0.021 (SE = 0.002;  < 0.001), 0.008 (SE = 0.003;  = 0.015), respectively. Generally, air pollution has an adverse effect on . CO is the most influential pollutant, and female, middle-aged, and low-education populations are more severely affected.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is common in obese individuals is associated with a greater incidence of NAFLD, which in turn, increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear how obesity, OSA and NAFLD interrelate nor how they collectively contribute to an increased risk for developing HCC.Male BALB/c mice were exposed to diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital followed by 48 weeks of either standard chow diet (chow), chow with hypoxia, high-fat diet, or a combination of hypoxia and high-fat diet. We noninvasively monitored tumor development using micro-CT imaging. We tracked the total  gained throughout the study. We evaluated liver histology, fat accumulation, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) expression, as well as, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).A high-fat diet without hypoxia led to the development of obesity that induced hepatic steatosis and promoted tumorigenesis. Animals on a high-fat diet and that were also exposed to hypoxia had lower total  gain, lower steatosis, lower serum AST and ALT levels, and fewer number of hepatic adenomas than a high-fat diet without hypoxia.These findings suggest that hypoxia abrogates obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic tumorigenesis related to a high-fat diet.© 2019 Sweeney et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693468>Low Ouabain Doses and AMP-Activated Protein Kinase as Factors Supporting Electrogenesis in Skeletal Muscle.</a></h1><p>Many motor disorders are associated with depolarization of the membrane of skeletal muscle fibers due to the impaired functioning of Na,K-ATPase. Here, we studied the role of ouabain (specific Na,K-ATPase ligand) and AMP-activated protein kinase (key regulator of muscle metabolism) in the maintenance of muscle electrogenesis; the levels of these endogenous factors are directly related to the motor activity. After 4-day intraperitoneal administration of ouabain (1 µg/kg daily), a hyperpolarization of sarcolemma was registered in isolated rat diaphragm muscles due to an increase in the electrogenic activity of Na,K-ATPase. In acute experiments, addition of nanomolar ouabain concentrations to the bathing solution resulted in the muscle membrane hyperpolarization within 15 min. The effect of ouabain reversed to membrane depolarization with the increase in the external potassium concentration. It is possible that Na,K-ATPase activation by ouabain may be regulated by such factors as specific subcellular location, interaction with molecular partners, and changes in the ionic balance. Preventive administration of the AMP-activated protein kinase activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside; 400 mg/kg  daily for 7 days) in chronic experiments resulted in the stabilization of the endplate structure and abolishment of depolarization of the rat soleus muscle membrane caused by the motor activity cessation. The obtained data can be useful for creating approaches for correction of muscle dysfunction, especially at the early stages, prior to the development of muscle atrophy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692992>Low-Voltage Oscillatory Neurons for Memristor-Based Neuromorphic Systems.</a></h1><p>Neuromorphic systems consisting of artificial neurons and synapses can process complex information with high efficiency to overcome the bottleneck of von Neumann architecture. Artificial neurons are essentially required to possess functions such as leaky integrate-and-fire and output spike. However, previous reported artificial neurons typically have high operation voltage and large leakage current, leading to significant power consumption, which is contrary to the energy-efficient biological model. Here, an oscillatory neuron based on Ag filamentary threshold switching memristor (TS) that has a low operation voltage (<0.6 V) with ultralow power consumption (<1.8 µW) is presented. It can trigger neuronal functions, including leaky integrate-and-fire and threshold-driven spiking output, with high endurance (>10 cycles). Being connected to an external resistor or a resistive switching memristor (RS) as synaptic , the TS clearly demonstrates self-oscillation behavior once the input pulse voltage exceeds the threshold voltage. Meanwhile, the oscillation frequency is proportional to the input pulse voltage and the conductance of RS synapse, which can be used to integrate the weighted sum current. As an energy-efficient memristor-based spiking neural network, this combination of TS oscillatory neuron with RS synapse is further evaluated for image recognition achieving an accuracy of 79.2 ± 2.4% for CIFAR-10 subset.© 2019 The Authors.

We assessed the association of 5-year changes in commuting mode with  mass index (BMI) and the indicators of abdominal obesity in Japanese working adults.In this longitudinal study, we studied 29,758 participants (25,808 men and 3950 women) in Japan aged 30 to 64 years at baseline who underwent further health examination 5 years after the baseline examination. Changes in BMI were calculated from objectively measured  height and  at baseline and follow-up examination. Visceral and subcutaneous fat areas and waist circumference measured by computed tomography scans were used as indicators for abdominal adiposity. Linear regression was applied to estimate the association of changes in commuting mode with the obesity outcomes.Within the 5-year study period, adults who maintained inactive commuting gained , and compared with this group, adults who switched to inactive commuting had higher  gain; conversely, adults who switched to active or public transportation commuting and especially those who maintained active or public transportation commuting experienced less  gain. Subgroup analysis showed similar tendency across the different transitions of leisure-time exercise or occupational physical activity. For example, among adults who maintained no exercise (n = 16,087), the adjusted mean (95% confidence intervals) of the BMI change over 5 years in kg/m were 0.27 (0.24 to 0.30) for maintained inactive commuting group (reference), 0.34 (0.30 to 0.38) for switching to inactive commuting group (P = 0.046), 0.20 (0.18 to 0.22) for switching to active commuting or public transportation group (P = 0.001), and 0.09 (0.06 to 0.13) for maintained active commuting or public transportation group (P < 0.001). Maintained inactive commuting tended to be associated with larger gain in abdominal adiposity indicators.Switching from inactive commuting mode to more physically active commuting mode and maintaining active commuting can promote  control among working adults across different levels of occupational or leisure-time physical activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695811>Temporal changes in slipped upper femoral epiphysis at a regional level: a declining incidence and literature review.</a></h1><p>Slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE) is one of the most common adolescent hip pathologies in children with potential for life-long morbidity secondary to avascular necrosis (AVN). The primary aim is to determine an up-to-date demographic of SUFE, as well as current trends in presentation and radiological characteristics. Secondary aims are to quantify prophylactic fixation and subsequent contralateral SUFE.Between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2015, all cases of SUFE were identified in Northern Ireland. Patient demographics, slip characteristics and outcomes are presented and the incidence rates were calculated using census data. Temporal changes in incidence, compared with a previous cohort, are demonstrated.A total of 56 patients (80 hips) were identified. Based on census data, SUFE incidence has declined from 7.14 to 4.69/100,000 population aged < 16 years. Male cases predominated by > 2:1 ratio, and tended to be older than female cases. Approximately 75% of patients were above the 75th centile for age-sex adjusted . Knee pain as a presenting symptom led to a delay in diagnosis. Prophylactic fixation was performed in 25.9%, with contralateral slips occurring in 27.5%. AVN occurred in 7.4% and remained static.The incidence of SUFE has declined ~34% in our region. When SUFE occurs, knee pain often results in a delay in definitive diagnosis, and commands clinical vigilance to avoid delays in diagnosis. Patients in our region should be aware of a 1-in-4 contralateral slip rate. Overall, AVN rates remain static and are acceptable, despite the declining incidence of SUFE.Level III - Retrospective Cohort Study.Copyright © 2019, The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697751>Maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations at delivery.</a></h1><p>Studies have demonstrated leptin involvement in the physiology and pathophysiology of pregnancy and suggest that leptin may be a prognostic marker for some complications of pregnancy although the association remains unclear. To date no studies have reported leptin reference intervals established in normal pregnancy, which could be used for interpreting the differences in leptin levels found in normal and pathological pregnancies.To determine leptin concentrations at delivery, in maternal serum in normal pregnancy and in cord blood and to establish reference intervals for leptin.The study was performed in 194 pregnant women without any comorbid health conditions. Leptin concentrations in maternal serum and in cord blood were measured by ELISA and subsequently analyzed by gestational age (weeks), maternal  Mass Index (BMI), mode of delivery and infant gender and birth . For comparative analyses of normally distributed variables, parametric tests such as the Student-t were used to test the assumption of homogeneity or non-homogeneity of variance and a One-Way ANOVA when more than two groups were compared. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between normally distributed variables (p<0.05). The reference intervals for leptin were obtained by referring to the central 95% of laboratory test values.In normal pregnant women, the mean serum leptin concentration at delivery was 37.17 ± 28.07 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 33.19-41.14 ng/mL. The mean leptin concentration in cord blood was 14.78 ± 15.97 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 12.32-17.67 ng/mL. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations (r = 0.37; p = 0.00). Mean leptin concentrations in cord blood increased with gestational age (p = 0.00). No statistically significant differences in maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations were found in regard to mode of delivery and neonatal gender. A statistically significant correlation was found between maternal serum leptin and third-trimester BMI (r = 0.22; p = 0.00), but there was no association between maternal BMI and cord blood leptin concentration. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between cord blood leptin concentration and birth  (r = 0.23; p = 0.00).Reference intervals for leptin in maternal serum and in cord blood established in normal pregnancy could be used in clinical practice for interpreting the differences in leptin concentrations found in normal pregnancy and in complications of pregnancy. The results indicate a strong association between maternal serum leptin levels and obesity and between cord blood leptin levels and birth .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695393>The potential risk factors of cortical visual impairment following cerebral angiography: a retrospective study.</a></h1><p>Cortical visual impairment is an uncommon complication after cerebral angiography with an incidence of 0.3%-1.0%. Here we would like to investigate and discuss the potential risk factors of cortical visual impairment after cerebral angiography.Based on the presence of post-operative cortical visual impairment, 4,528 patients who received cerebral angiography were split into two groups. The relevant risk factors were compared and analyzed between the groups.In the patient cohort, 11 cases exhibited post-operative cortical visual impairment (0.24%). In particular, seven patients presented with blurred vision and four presented with binocular blindness. Visual sensation of these patients recovered after the treatment. Our univariate analysis revealed that differences in age, , sex ratios, proportions of patients with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipemia, and operation time were not statistically significant between the two groups (>0.05). The multivariate analysis indicated that the dosage of contrast medium was the independent risk factor for post-operative cortical visual impairment.Clinically, cortical visual impairment following cerebral angiography typically presented as blurred vision or complete blindness. We have identified the dosage of contrast medium as the most critical independent risk factor based on our study. Preventive strategies need to be implemented to avoid post-operative cortical visual impairment in this regard.© 2019 Yang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695344>The effects of exercise and diet program in overweight people - Nordic walking versus walking.</a></h1><p>Nordic walking (NW) has been recommended as a form of exercise for clinical populations. Despite intervention programs designed to face a clinical status may last several months, no longitudinal studies have compared the effect of NW to another usual form of exercise, like walking (W). We evaluated the effects of diet combined with a long-supervised NW versus W training on  composition, aerobic capacity and strength in overweight adults.Thirty-eight participants, randomized into a NW (n=19, 66±7 years,  mass index (BMI) 33±5)) and a W (n=19, 66±8 years, BMI 32±5) group, followed a diet and a supervised training routine 3 times/week for 6 months. The variables assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months were: anthropometric indexes (ie, BMI and waist circumference (WC)),  composition, aerobic capacity (oxygen consumption (VO), peak power output (PPO), 6-min walking test (6MWT)) and strength (maximal voluntary contraction of biceps brachialis (MVC) and quadriceps femoris (MVC), chair stand and arm curl (AC)).After 6 months both NW and W group decreased significantly BMI (6% and 4%, respectively) and WC (8% and 4%, respectively), but only the NW group reduced (<0.05) total  fat (8%), android fat (14%) and leg fat (9%). After 6 months, PPO increased (<0.05) in both groups, but VO improved (<0.05) only in the NW group (8%). After 6 months, 6MWT increased (<0.001) in both groups and only the NW group improved (<0.05) in MVC (14%), MVC (17%) and AC (35%).Our results suggest that NW can give in some relevant health parameters, greater and faster benefits than W. Thus, NW can be a primary tool to counteract the obesity and overweight state in middle-aged adults.© 2019 Muollo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696659>Bone ingrowth comparison of irregular titanium and cobalt-chromium coatings in a translational cancellous bone model.</a></h1><p>The use of cobalt-chromium (CoCr)-bearing surfaces in total joint replacement (TJR) remains the predominate bearing surface. The conundrum with using this biomaterial has been selecting an ideal porous coating to assure reproducible skeletal attachment. There has been evidence that smooth CoCr beads may be inferior for skeletal attachment compared to identically shaped titanium (Ti) beads. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that an increased surface area and roughness favors osteoblast adhesion to metallic biomaterials. Therefore, we hypothesized that an irregular shape CoCr bead with an increased surface texture would help correct the negative bone responses that have been reported with smooth beaded CoCr coatings and thus allowing for bone ingrowth equivalently as an irregular commercially pure Ti porous coating with similar porosity. This investigation employed a -bearing translational sheep cancellous bone model to accurately simulate a cancellous bone response as it would be clinically in a human TJR. The data analyses obtained from this investigation revealed similar bone responses between the porous coatings. By 12 weeks the irregular shape CoCr coating was able to achieve similar bone ingrowth with skeletal interlock when compared to a clinically proven Ti porous coating.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694660>Fishers and groupers (Epinephelus marginatus and E. morio) in the coast of Brazil: integrating information for conservation.</a></h1><p>Groupers are a vulnerable but economically important group of fish, especially for small-scale fisheries. We investigated catches and local ecological knowledge (LEK) of diet, habitat, and past fishing experiences.Landings, prices, interviews, and restaurants demand for two species, Epinephelus marginatus (dusky grouper) and Epinephelus morio (red grouper), were registered.We visited 74 markets and 79 sites on the coast of Brazil in 2017-2018, and we interviewed 71 fishers: Bahia (NE), Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (SE), and Santa Catarina (S). The landings sampled of dusky grouper (2016-2017) in Rio de Janeiro were: n = 222, size 38-109 cm,  1-24 kg, average 3.84 kg; in São Paulo, São Sebastião were: n = 47, size 39-106 cm,  2-8 kg, average of 2.77 kg; and at Santos: n = 80, 26-120 cm,  0.36-15 kg, average 2.72 kg. Red grouper was observed in markets in the northeastern Brazil. We did not observe Epinephelus marginatus from Bahia northward; a maximum size of 200 cm was reported south of the Bahia, besides Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo coasts, 20 years ago (or longer) by 12 fishers. Local knowledge of fishers was important for grouper data of habitat and diet; the reproduction period was identified by fishers as September to March.Groupers can be considered as a cultural and ecological keystone species. We suggest protective : 1) fishing zoning, 2) islands (MPAs) with the surveillance of fishers, 3) late Spring and early Summer as key periods for management (grouper reproduction), 4) studies on grouper larvae, 5) mapping of fishing spots, 6) studies on local knowledge. Collaboration with small-scale fishers and local knowledge could contribute to low-conflict management . In that regard, integrative models of management from Latin America, by using local knowledge and citizen science, could produce successful grouper management for Brazilian data-poor fisheries, a contrasting reality to the Mediterranean areas. Finally, the distribution of E. marginatus in Brazil leave us with questions: a) Have dusky groupers disappeared from Bahia because of a decline in the population? b) Was it uncommon in Northeast Brazil? c) Did changes in water temperatures forced a movement southward?</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696260>Vitamin E-blended versus conventional polyethylene liners in prostheses : Prospective, randomized trial with 3-year follow-up.</a></h1><p>Despite continuous technical improvements, polyethylene wear debris induced periprosthetic osteolysis remains the main cause for failure of hip arthroplasty. Progressive oxidation of polyethylene was identified as another risk factor for material failure. To overcome this problem, antioxidants such as vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) were supplemented by diffusion into the latest generation of polyethylene liners.The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical outcome of patients treated with vitamin E blended highly cross-linked ultra-high molecular  polyethylene liners (UHMWPE-XE) in comparison with conventional UHMWPE‑X liners by evaluating patient-reported outcome  (PROM's) at 3‑year follow-up.A total of 143 patients were recruited into this prospective, randomized trial in our academic center. Three years after implantation, 101 patients were examined in the outpatient clinic for follow-up. Of these, 51 (50.5%) received UHMWPE-XE and 50 (49.5%) UHMWPE‑X liners. Clinical outcome was evaluated using Harris-Hip-Score (HHS) UCLA-Score and Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS).There was a significant improvement in all PROM's at one- and three-year follow-up compared to the status before implantation. PROM's did not differ significantly between the first and third year follow-up. Both liner groups showed an equal clinical outcome.The present study demonstrates that the supplementation of vitamin E to polyethylene liners is reliable and safe without showing higher complication rates compared with conventional polyethylene liners. The shortterm clinical outcome of vitamin E-blended (UHMWPE‑XE) is equivalent to those of conventional highly cross-linked polyethylene liners.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695782>Thymopentin ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes.</a></h1><p> Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease, notoriously challenging to treat. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between thymic atrophy and colitis severity. It was, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the effect of thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active domain of the thymopoietin, on colitis.  Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice were treated with TP5 by subcutaneous injection. , colon length, colon , immune organ index, disease activity index (DAI) score, and the peripheral blood profile were examined. The immune cells of the spleen and colon were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histology was performed on isolated colon tissues for cytokine analysis. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse colonic feces to assess the intestinal microbiota. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), HCT116, CT26, and splenocytes were cultured and treated with TP5.  TP5 treatment increased the  and colon length, decreased the DAI score, and restored colon architecture of colitic mice. TP5 also decreased the infiltration of immune cells and expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Importantly, the damaged thymus and compromised lymphocytes in peripheral blood were significantly restored by TP5. Also, the production of IL-22, both in innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, was triggered by TP5. Given the critical role of IL-22 in mucosal host defense, we tested the effect of TP5 on mucus barrier and gut microbiota and found that the number of goblet cells and the level of Mucin-2 expression were restored, and the composition of the gut microbiome was normalized after TP5 treatment. The critical role of IL-22 in the protective effect of TP5 on colitis was further confirmed by administering the anti-IL-22 antibody (αIL-22), which completely abolished the effect of TP5. Furthermore, TP5 significantly increased the expression level of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), a transcription factor for IL-22. Consistent with this, RORγt inhibitor abrogated the upregulation of IL-22 induced by TP5.  TP5 exerts a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. This study delineates TP5 as an immunomodulator that may be a potential drug for the treatment of UC.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694661>Determinants of nutritional status among children under age 5 in Ethiopia: further analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia demographic and health survey.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to examine the determinants of nutritional status among children under age 5 (0-59 months) in Ethiopia. Child malnutrition is an underlying cause of almost half (45%) of child deaths, particularly in low socioeconomic communities of developing countries. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of stunting decreased from 47% in 2005 to 39% in 2016, but the prevalence of wasting changed little over the same time period (from 11 to 10%). Despite improvements in reducing the prevalence of malnutrition, the current rate of progress is not fast enough to reach the World Health Organization global target for reducing malnutrition 40% by 2025.This study used data from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Heath Survey (EDHS). The analysis used stunting and wasting as dependent variables, while the independent variables were characteristics of children, mothers, and households. Logistic regression was used to analyze the determinants of nutritional status among children. Bivariate analysis was also used to analyze the association between the dependent and independent variables.Study results show that child's age, sex, and perceived birth , mother's educational status,  mass index (BMI), and maternal stature, region, wealth quintile, type of toilet facility, and type of cooking fuel had significant associations with stunting. Child's age, sex, and perceived birth , mother's BMI, and residence and region showed significant associations with wasting. The study found that child, maternal, and household characteristics were significantly associated with stunting and wasting among children under age 5.These findings imply that a multi-sectorial and multidimensional approach is important to address malnutrition in Ethiopia. The education sector should promote reduction of cultural and gender barriers that contribute to childhood malnutrition. The health sector should encourage positive behaviors toward childcare and infant feeding practices. More should be done to help households adopt improved types of toilet facilities and modern types of cooking fuels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695423>Nitrogen Permease Regulator-Like-2 Exhibited Anti-Tumor Effects And Enhanced The Sensitivity Of Colorectal Cancer Cells To Oxaliplatin And 5-Fluorouracil.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Our previous study revealed that nitrogen permease regulator-like-2 (NPRL2), a promising anti-tumor gene, was downregulated at both the blood and tissue levels in CRC patients compared with that in healthy individuals.This study aims to explore the role of NPRL2 in CRC.Herein, we constructed NPRL2 overexpression lentivirus vectors and transfected them into HT29 cells. The transfected cells were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth, pathology, apoptosis, and the protein expression of caspase-3, caspase-7, Bax, Bcl-2, and phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) were evaluated. To further explore whether NPRL2 could reduce drug resistance of CRC cells against oxaliplatin (L-OHP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), we constructed a tumor model using HT29 cells. The tumor model was treated with lentiviral particles assembled with vectors encoding NPRL2 and exposed to L-OHP and 5-FU. Tumor growth, pathology, apoptosis, and the protein expression of caspase-3, caspase-7, Bax, Bcl-2, p-Akt, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) were evaluated.The results indicated that in the in vivo CRC xenograft model, NPRL2 reduced the tumor volume and  and enhanced apoptosis. Our results also confirmed that NPRL2 enhanced the sensitivity of CRC cells to L-OHP and 5-FU. Our studies further demonstrated that NPRL2 exerted anti-tumor and anti-drug resistance effects through the caspase-3, caspase-7, Bax, Bcl-2, Akt, P-gp, and MRP1 pathways.Our present work demonstrated that NPRL2 exhibited anti-tumor effects and enhanced the sensitivities of CRC cells to L-OHP and 5-FU through the P-gp and MRP1 pathways.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695379>Administration of troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate injection alleviates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by down-regulating caspase molecules.</a></h1><p>Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R injury) is an important pathological process for nervous system. The I/R injury usually causes cerebral hypoxia, infarct or stroke. This study aimed to evaluate effects of troxerutin and cerebroprotein hydrolysate injection (TC) on I/R injury in rat models.Middle-cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat models were established. Rats were divided into normal control (NC), MCAO/R rat model (injecting saline) and MCAO/R rats administrating with TC group (injecting with TC at concentration of 2 mL/100 g ). Neurological scores were evaluated with Garcia scale. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed to observe infarct area, contralateral area and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Cerebral infarct size was examined and visualized by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Western blotting assay was used to determine caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression.The infarct size of mice in MCAO/R+TC group was smaller significantly compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). The infarct/contralateral area ratio of T2 and T2 Flair signals in MCAO/R+TC group were lower significantly compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). ADC values in MCAO/R+TC group were significantly enhanced compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). The troxerutin and cerebroprotein treatment significantly increased neurological scores compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05). Troxerutin and cerebroprotein treatment significantly decreased expression of caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-8 compared to that in MCAO/R group (<0.05).Troxerutin and cerebroprotein administration alleviated cerebral I/R injury by down-regulating caspase molecules.© 2019 Sui et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695621>Two Weeks of High-Intensity Interval Training in Combination With a Non-thermal Diffuse Ultrasound Device Improves Lipid Profile and Reduces  Fat Percentage in Overweight Women.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative strategy which combined low-frequency ultra sound (LOFU) with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve physical fitness and promote  fat loss in overweight sedentary women. A placebo controlled, parallel group randomized experimental design was used to investigate the efficacy of a 2-week combined LOFU and HIIT program (3 sessions per week). Participants were allocated into either the Experimental HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10) or Placebo HIIT group (HIIT,  = 10). Baseline exercise testing (maximal oxygen uptake, lower limb strength and substrate oxidation test), dietary assessment, anthropometric  and blood sampling were completed in week 1 and repeated in week 4 to determine changes following the program (Post-HIIT). During each training session, the HIIT and HIIT groups wore a non-thermal diffuse ultrasound belt. However, the belt was only switched on for the HIIT group. Delta change scores were calculated for ,  fat percentage (Fat%), muscle mass,  O , hip and waist circumferences, and all lipid variables from Baseline to Post-HIIT. Statistical analysis was completed using a repeated- factorial analysis of variance by group (HIIT and HIIT) and time (Baseline and Post-HIIT). Results showed significant improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (HIIT; Baseline 24.7 ± 5.4 mL kg min, Post-HIIT 28.1 ± 5.5 mL kg min and HIIT; Baseline 28.4 ± 5.9 mL kg min, Post-HIIT 31.4 ± 5.5 mL kg min) for both groups. Significant decreases in Fat% (HIIT; Baseline 32.7 ± 3.2%, Post-HIIT 28.9 ± 3.5% and HIIT; Baseline 28.9 ± 3.5%, Post-HIIT 28.9 ± 3.4% kg), waist circumference (HIIT; Baseline 95.8 ± 9.6 cm, Post-HIIT 89.3 ± 8.9 cm and HIIT; Baseline 104.3 ± 3.5 cm, Post-HIIT 103.6 ± 3.4 cm) and triglycerides (HIIT; -29.2%, HIIT; -6.7%) were observed in the HIIT group only. These results show that HIIT combined with LOFU was an effective intervention to improve  composition, lipid profile, and fitness. This combined strategy allowed overweight, sedentary women to achieve positive health outcomes in as little as 2 weeks.Copyright © 2019 Hausswirth, Marquet, Nesi and Slattery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698488>Functional donor-site morbidity after soleus muscle-flap procedure in the treatment of lower limb severe injuries.</a></h1><p>The gastrocnemius and soleus muscle flaps are the most commonly used transfer flaps to treat lower limb severe lesions. The use of the muscle as coverage tissuemay incur in functionality loss and motor control deficits. The aim of this study is to assess whether functional deficits are present during gait, posture and heel rise test (HRT).From 2008-2013 we treated 9 patients suffering from complex injury of the lower third of the leg (Gustilo III B). A population of 9 patients (group A) was examined after reconstruction with a soleus muscle flap. The results were compared with a control population (group B: 9 patients). Each patient performed at least 3 gait tests at a fast pace, 2 posture tests and 2 HRT on an inclined plane.Gait parameters for group A: Spatio-temporal parameters such as step length, cadence were reduced compared to the homolateral leg (p < 0.05). The initial double support phase was shorter in relation to the final phase and the first peak in the vertical ground reaction component was reduced compared to the contralateral leg.Posture for the group A: the mediolateral excursion (during open- and closed-eyes test) and the related mean velocity (in the open-eyes test) were significantly lower compared to the control group (p < 0.05).HRT for group A: the number of rises and relative height and angular excursion were reduced in the operated leg in relation to the control group (p < 0.05) and to the contralateral leg.The patients treated with the soleus muscle used as tissue defect coverage completely recovered the ability to walk but showed some deficits in kinetic parameters during the -loading phase. During gait prolonged muscle activity compared to controls was observed. The absence of soleus (group A) revealed no significant alterations in postural control. However, the HRT remained the most relevant test to measure patients' performance when treated with soleus flap in relation to the control group.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692868>X-ray fluorescence analysis of selected micronutrients in ten African indigenous leafy vegetables cultivated in Nairobi, Kenya.</a></h1><p>There is a growing interest on vital roles of micronutrients in the maintenance of good health and enhancement of the immune system for prevention of diseases.Energy dispersive X-Ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometer was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of selected micronutrients Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca) and Potassium (K) in ten African indigenous leafy vegetables (AILVs) (Corchorus olitorius, Cucurbita moschata, Amaranthus blitum, Brassica carinata , Cleome gynandra, Solanum scabrum , Crotalaria ochroleuca, Urticadioica, Manihot esculenta, Vigna unguiculata) which are cultivated, marketed and consumed in Kenya and across East and West Africa.In this study, the highest levels of Calcium, Zinc and Iron were found in Urticadioica leaves (75.0 mg/g), Manihot esculenta leaves (0.1 mg/g) and Cucurbita moschata leaves (1.0 mg/g). Amaranthus blitum leaves exhibited the highest content of Magnesium (9.5 mg/g) and Potassium (36.5 mg/g) respectively.

The objective cure rate determined using the 1-hour pad test revealed that 11 women (42.3%) were cured and 15 (57.7%) had improved in the normal  group, respectively, compared with 16 (51.6%) and 15 (48.4%) in the overweight group and 6 (46.2%) and 7 (53.8%) in the obese group, respectively (p=0.78). One year after surgery, the subjective success rate was 91.5% in the normal  group, 93.5% in the overweight group and 92.3% in the obese group. A total of 84.7%, 77.4%, and 77.0% of normal , overweight and obese women were very satisfied or satisfied 1 year after surgery, respectively. All groups showed similar success rates and satisfaction.The REMEEX procedure is equally effective in obese and normal  women with ISD-type SUI or recurrent SUI.© The Korean Urological Association, 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696603>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of a Fixed-Dose Combination of Phentermine/Topiramate in Adolescents with Obesity.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VI-0521, a fixed-dose combination of immediate-release phentermine (PHEN) and extended-release (ER) topiramate (TPM) in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with obesity.  loss and adverse events using this drug combination are also reported.This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled study in adolescents with obesity. 42 adolescents were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, mid-dose (PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg), or top-dose (PHEN/TPM 15 mg/92 mg) of VI-0521. A total of 26 adolescents were included in the PK analysis (14 from the mid-dose group and 12 from the top-dose group).At Day 56, arithmetic means of terminal elimination half-life (T ), apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) were consistent across dose levels for both PHEN and TPM. Arithmetic means of CL/F and Vc/F for PHEN and TPM administered as a combination in adolescents with obesity were within 10%-30% of those previously assessed in adults with obesity enrolled in Phase II and III studies. A higher proportion of adolescents in both the mid- and top-dose groups (13.3% and 50.0%, respectively) compared with placebo (0.0%) reached ≥5%  loss at Day 56. The least square (LS) mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to Week 56 was -5.2 mmHg for the placebo group, -2.5 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and -5.5 mmHg for the top-dose group. The LS mean change in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to Day 56 was -2.4 mmHg for the placebo group, +3.8 mmHg for the mid-dose group, and +2.0 mmHg for the top-dose group. Participants in the top-dose group had increases in heart rate from baseline of 4.1 bpm while participants in the mid-dose group experienced a mean decrease in heart rate of 4.5 bpm at Day 56. Both PHEN/TPM dose combinations were safe and well tolerated.Treatment of adolescents with obesity using a fixed-dose combination of phentermine/topiramate for 8 weeks resulted in exposure to PHEN and TPM that was comparable to that observed in adults, statistically significant  loss, and a tolerable safety profile. These data indicate that both mid- and top-doses are appropriate for longer term safety and efficacy studies in adolescents. This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, two series of stimuli-responsive amphiphilic 3-miktoarm star hybrid terpolypeptides and their corresponding linear analogues were synthesized and exhibited the same overall composition and molecular  but different macromolecular architecture. The macromolecular architecture was found to be a key parameter in defining the morphology of the nanostructures formed in aqueous solutions as well as to alter the self-assembly behavior of the polymers independently of the composition. In addition, it was found that the assemblies prepared from the star-shaped polymers showed superior tolerance over enzymatic degradation due to the increased corona block density on the surface of the nanoparticles. Encapsulation of the hydrophobic anticancer drug Everolimus resulted in the formation of intriguing non-spherical and non-symmetric pH-responsive nanostructures, such as "stomatocytes" and "multi-compartmentalized suprapolymersomes", while the pH-triggered release of the drug was also investigated. Owing to the similarities of the developed "stomatocytes" with red blood cells, in combination with their pH-responsiveness and superior stability over enzymatic degradation, they are expected to present advanced drug delivery properties and have the ability to bypass several extra- and intracellular barriers to reach and effectively treat cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698014>Greater analgesic effects of sucrose in the neonate predict greater  gain to age 18 months.</a></h1><p>Intraoral sucrose has analgesic effects in the newborn period. The hedonic and analgesic effects of sucrose overlap and hedonic response to sweet food is associated with adiposity. The potential association between the analgesic effects of intraoral sucrose in the newborn period and subsequent  gain has not been examined. Healthy, term newborns received 25% intraoral sucrose or water prior to metabolic screen heel stick. Negative affect, quiet alert behavior, and sleepiness were coded during heel stick.  and length were measured and z-score (WLZ) calculated at birth, 9, and 18 months. Mixed models tested associations of behavioral response to heel stick with WLZ trajectory among infants receiving sucrose (n = 154) versus water (n = 117). Among infants receiving sucrose prior to heel stick with birth WLZ ≥ the median, less negative affect and more sleepiness during heel stick were each associated with greater increases in WLZ. These associations were not present among infants receiving water only prior to heel stick. Greater analgesic effects of sucrose in the neonate were associated with greater future increases in WLZ, especially among infants with higher birth WLZ. Greater opioid-mediated newborn behavioral response to intraoral sucrose may be a marker for future obesity risk. CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: .Copyright © 2019.

Lorcaserin is a serotonergic agonist specific to the 5HT2C receptor that is FDA-approved for the long-term management of obesity in adults with BMI>30 kg/m2 or BMI>27 kg/m2 and at least one -related comorbidity.: The authors review the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties of lorcaserin alongside updates on serotonin's mechanism of action in the central nervous system. The efficacy of lorcaserin in the management of obesity, its related comorbidities, and potential therapeutic applications are also discussed.: The future of obesity management requires a multimodal and personalized approach. The high medical complexity of patients warrants polypharmacotherapy to achieve their metabolic goals. Lorcaserin has proven efficacy and safety in the treatment of obesity and its -related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. New evidence elucidating its effects on dopaminergic pathways and on glucose homeostasis expands its prospective uses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693343>Bioaccumulation and Trophic Transfer of Emerging Organophosphate Flame Retardants in the Marine Food Webs of Laizhou Bay, North China.</a></h1><p>Despite the increase in production, usage, and discharge of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), little information is available about their bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in the marine food web. In this study, seawater, sediment, and marine species (10 fish and 9 invertebrate species) collected from Laizhou Bay, North China, were analyzed to investigate the levels, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification of OPFRs in a marine food web. Of 20 OPFRs screened for, 17 were quantifiable in seawater, sediment, and organisms. The ∑OPFRs concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 28.4 ng/L in seawater, 0.1-96.9 ng/g dry  in sediment, and 21.1-3510 ng/g lipid  in organisms. Benthic fish accumulated more OPFRs than pelagic fish and invertebrates. A linear and significant increase of bioaccumulation factors with increasing lipophilicity of OPFRs was observed ( = 0.63,  < 0.05), and the biota-sediment accumulation factors increased with hydrophobicity up to log  = 4.59 and then decreased with increase in log . Trophic magnification factors of OPFRs ranged from 1.06 to 2.52, indicating biomagnification potential of OPFRs in a marine food web. This study provides important insight into the biomagnification potential of OPFRs and suggests further investigation on this group of chemicals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694362>The effects of both jump/land phases and direction on Achilles tendon loading.</a></h1><p>Athletes in jumping and running sports have a high incidence of Achilles tendon (AT) injuries. We compared AT loading during jumping and landing phases in anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions.Sixteen males (age: 21.6±1.8 years, height: 178.4±6.4 cm, : 76.4±11.2 kg) performed single leg AP and ML jump-landings during both propulsive (jump) and braking (land) phases. Inverse dynamics and static optimization were used to determine muscle forces. AT cross sectional area was measured with ultrasound. AT force was divided by cross sectional area to determine stress while strain was determined from previous data. Two-way repeated  analysis of variance (α=0.05) compared several variables (vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), ankle and knee angle, ankle joint muscle moment arm, external ankle moment arm, AT tendon force, stress, and strain) between movements (jump-landings) and directions (AP/ML).AT loading was higher during jump than land in the ML compared to AP direction. VGRF was higher during land versus jump with no direction effect (AP/ML). An interaction showed a higher VGRF during the AP land and ML jump. The ankle joint moment arm was lower in jump and AP direction at peak tendon stress. External ankle moment arm at peak tendon stress was higher in jump and ML direction with an interaction. A larger external ankle moment arm occurred in ML but the change was less in the jump.Higher tendon loading occurred during the jump and ML direction. This may provide insight into both injuries and rehabilitation efforts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694439>COPD patients need more information about self-management: a cross-sectional study in Swedish primary care.</a></h1><p> In Sweden, patients with chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), often receive education at specialized nurse-led clinics at primary health care centers (PHCCs). Identifying patients' needs for information about COPD is the key to individualized care. This study aimed to assess self-reported needs for information about COPD in primary care patients with either moderate (GOLD 2) or severe (GOLD 3) COPD and identify patient characteristics and exacerbation patterns associated with the findings. A cross-sectional study. Twenty-four PHCCs in Stockholm, Sweden. Randomly selected primary care patients with COPD in GOLD stages 2 and 3 ( = 542). The Lung Information Needs Questionnaire (LINQ) was used to assess perceived information needs. Spirometry results and descriptive, self-reported data on patient factors such as exacerbation history, treatment, smoking, /height, comorbidities, health care contacts, education and symptoms were collected. Overall, the greatest reported needs were for information about self-management and diet. GOLD 2 patients (68%) expressed greater needs for information than GOLD 3 patients (32%). We found significant associations between high information needs and patient-related factors such as 'No assigned GP' (OR = 4.32 [95% CI 2.65-7.05]) and 'No contact with COPD nurse in the past 12 months' (OR = 1.83 [95% CI 1.19-2.81]). COPD patients felt they knew too little about self-management of their disease. Low information needs were strongly associated with continuity in patient-GP consultations and moderately associated with contact with a COPD nurse. These associations were strongest in patients with moderate COPD. As patients with COPD often have multimorbidity, identifying patients' needs for information about COPD is essential to providing individualized patient education and care. In this study of 542 patients from 24 Swedish primary care centers, we found that:Patients with COPD, particularly those with moderate airflow limitation (i.e. GOLD 2) felt they needed more information about COPD than currently provided by health care professionals in primary care.Low information needs were strongly associated with continuity in patient-GP consultations and moderately associated with contact with a COPD nurse. GPs' part in COPD patient education should not be overlooked, as individualized COPD care relies on GPs' expertise in managing patients with multimorbidity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695914>Associations between self-reported diabetes mellitus, disordered eating behaviours, /shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life.</a></h1><p>Eating disorders (ED) and disordered eating behaviours (DEB) have been found to be common in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, findings have been inconsistent.This study investigated the association between self-reported diabetes (Type 1 or 2) with ED/DEB (binge eating, subjective binge eating or loss of control overeating, severe dieting and purging) /shape overvaluation, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a household survey in South Australia.In 2017 2977 people aged ≥15 years, who were representative of the general population, were interviewed. Participants reported their gender, age, household income, highest educational attainment, area of residence, presence of DM, ED/DEB, level of overvaluation, current HRQoL and height and . For the analyses between ED/DEB, self-reported DM and HRQoL, a grouping variable was created: 1) people without ED/DEB or self-reported DM; 2) people without ED/DEB and with self-reported DM; 3) people with ED/DEB and without self-reported DM; and 4) people with ED/DEB and self-reported DM. Analyses were stratified by sex and age group.Subjective binge eating prevalence was higher in people with self-reported DM (6.6% vs 2.8%,  = 0.016), and overvaluation was lower in those with DM (36% vs 43.8%,  = 0.007). In analyses stratified by sex and age group, subjective binge eating was higher in women and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM and overvaluation was lower in men and in people over 45 years with self-reported DM. However, these differences were not significant on tests of gender and age interaction. People in both DM groups scored significantly lower than people without DM groups on physical HRQoL. In contrast, people in both ED/DEB groups scored lower than people without ED/BEB on mental HRQoL.People with self-reported DM had a higher prevalence of subjective binge eating, a lower prevalence of overvaluation and there were no significant effects of age or gender. Furthermore, participants with self-reported DM and comorbid ED or DEB had impairments of both mental and physical HRQoL. Assessing an individual's sense of control over eating along with other DEB is likely important for identification of these mental health problems.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698015>Feeding styles among mothers of low-income children identified using a person-centered multi-method approach.</a></h1><p>Maternal feeding styles have been associated with children's eating behaviors and obesity risk. Few works have identified maternal feeding styles using a multi-method person-centered approach.(1) To identify maternal feeding styles using a person-centered multi-method approach, and (2) to examine the association of child  status with maternal feeding styles.Participants were low-income mother-child dyads (N = 255) (mean child age 5.9 years) from the United States. Mothers completed questionnaires and participated in a semi-structured interview. Interview transcripts were reliably coded for constructs of child feeding including beliefs, goals, and concerns. Family mealtime video recordings were reliably coded for feeding behaviors. Child anthropometrics were measured. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to determine empirically-driven typologies of maternal feeding styles. Chi-square analyses tested the association of maternal feeding styles with child overweight or obese (vs. not)  status.Two maternal feeding styles were identified by LCA which we term "High Coercive Control" (27% child overweight/obese) and "Low Coercive Control" (55% child overweight/obese). High Coercive Control mothers were more likely to believe their child was too thin, self-reported being more demanding in feeding and pressuring the child to eat, worried more about their child not eating enough and were observed to use more bribery. Low Coercive Control mothers were concerned about their child eating too much, and were less likely to self-report engaging in pressuring or restricting feeding behaviors.The findings suggest that although there is a "feeding style" characterized by substantial control, this style was most common among mothers of thinner children. The mothers of children with overweight/obesity were primarily characterized by engaging in the "recommended" feeding behaviors and being appropriately concerned about their child's risk for excess .Copyright © 2019.

The aims of this study were to investigate how nylon (polyamide) microplastics may affect PBDE accumulation in snails, and the acute effects of nylon particles and PBDEs on survival,  change and inherent microbiome diversity and community composition of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Snails were exposed for 96 h to BDEs-47, 99, 100 and 153 in the presence and absence of 1% w/w nylon microplastics in quartz sand sediment. No mortality was observed over the exposure period. Snails not exposed to microplastics lost significantly more  compared to those exposed to microplastics. Increasing PBDE concentration in the sediment resulted in an increased PBDE  burden in the snails, however microplastics did not significantly influence total PBDE uptake. Based on individual congeners, uptake of BDE 47 by snails was significantly reduced in the presence of microplastics. The diversity and composition of the snail microbiome was not significantly altered by the presence of PBDEs nor by the microplastics, singly or combined. Significant effects on a few individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurred when comparing the highest PBDE concentration with the control treatment, but in the absence of microplastics only. Overall within these acute experiments, only subtle effects on  loss and slight microbiome alterations occurred. These results therefore highlight that L. stagnalis are resilient to acute exposures to microplastics and PBDEs, and that microplastics are unlikely to influence HOC accumulation or the microbiome of this species over short timescales.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ginger plants were grown in soil containing 500 mg/kg Pb(NO) without (CK) or with Si, Se, or microorganism fertilizer (T1, T2, T3) as soil conditioners. Morphology indexes, Pb accumulation and distribution rates, and antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated. The Pb transfer and Pb absorption coefficients were calculated, and Pb accumulation in plant organs at various developmental stages were determined. All three soil conditioners alleviated Pb stress in ginger plants. The rhizome fresh  in T1, T2, and T3 was increased by 96.06, 85.81, and 41.58%, respectively, compared with CK. The accumulation of Pb in organs was lower in all treatments than in CK. The chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in leaves, and root activity, root length, and the tolerance index, were higher in the treatments than in CK. The reactive oxygen species content in ginger leaves and roots was significantly lower in all treatments than in CK. Soil conditioners alleviated the negative effects of Pb stress on ginger plants: Si was the most effective, followed by Se, and then the microorganism fertilizer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Throughout the season, injuries were registered continuously by the (para-)medical staff of the included clubs. We analyzed the injury risk using multilevel Poisson regression models, accounting for club and team clustering.Of the included 314 players (11.7±1.7 years of age), 160 players sustained 133 overuse and 163 acute injuries (i.e. 106 injuries in 69 players of the younger group, 190 in 91 players of the older group). In the younger group, risk of overuse injuries was associated with an increase in leg length over the season (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.620 [95% CI 1.230-2.117]) and risk of acute injuries with relatively younger age (IRR 1.003 [95% CI 1.000-1.006]). In the older group, a higher leg length was associated with an increased risk of overuse injuries (IRR 1.055 [95% CI 1.011-1.108]), and a higher  and a lower growth rate with an increased risk of acute injuries (IRR 1.043 [95% CI 1.021-1.067] and 0.903 [95% CI 0.831-0.981], respectively).Injury risk factors differ by age group and type of injury. The age-specific anthropometric and growth-related risk factors should be monitored and these risk profiles should be considered to manage injury risk effectively.Copyright © 2019 Sports Medicine Australia.

We restricted the analysis to nonsmoking, nonwhite women and adjusted for maternal characteristics. Among women with antenatal Zika virus infection, we used modified Poisson regression to assess risks of having an SGA neonate and of delivering preterm, and linear regression to assess the association of infection with mean birth  of term neonates.Of 116,034 deliveries of singleton neonates in New York City in 2016, 251 (0.2%) were to women with antenatal Zika virus infection. A higher percentage of women with Zika virus infection delivered an SGA neonate compared with those without (11.2% vs 5.8%; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). There was no difference in preterm birth prevalence for women with and without Zika virus infection (adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.6). Mean birth  of term neonates born to women with Zika virus infection was 47 g less (95% CI -105 to 11 g); this difference was not statistically significant in crude or adjusted analyses.For a cohort of New York City women, antenatal Zika virus infection was associated with an increased risk of having an SGA neonate, but not preterm birth or lower mean birth  of term neonates.

TKA may lead to several perioperative complications. These include anesthesia-related risks, exacerbation of comorbid medical issues and complications of surgical procedure. We have no studies reporting medical complications following TKA among our population. This study aimed to evaluate perioperative complications of TKA and to identify the related risk factors.It was a monocentric retrospective including 410 observations in the local TKA registry. Data of patients operated for primary unilateral TKA during the period from January 2014 to December 2017 were reviewed. All patients had standardized protocols of anesthesia and post operative care for three days following surgery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the predicting factors for complications.Incidence of perioperative complications was 37.1%. The most frequent were per operative hypotension (14.1%) and postoperative desaturation (21.7%, including pulmonary embolism in 2.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified: age ≥ 65 years (OR=1.9; p=0.006), respiratory diseases (OR=1.8; p=0.042) and general anesthesia (OR=2.8; p=0.009) as significant risk factors for any complications. Loss of autonomy (OR=4.8; p <0.001) and general anesthesia (OR=2.6; p=0.03) were significant risk factors for hypotension. Age ≥ 65 years (OR=2.6;p<0.001), female gender (OR=4.3;p=0.006) and respiratory diseases(OR=1.9;p=0.02) were associated with postoperative desaturation.This study highlighted hemodynamic and respiratory complications as the most common early complications in TKA.

This prospective study enrolled Japanese individuals in the general population. Participants were divided into eight phenotypes according to the BMI classification and metabolic status. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a Cox regression hazard model. In total, 10,824 individuals with a mean age of 55.3 years were evaluated. During a mean follow-up of 18.4 years (198,776 person-years), 2,274 participants died. Among the metabolically unhealthy, the association between BMI and mortality was J-shaped after adjustment for various confounders (multivariable HR [95% CI] for all-cause mortality: underweight, 2.0 [1.5-2.7]; obesity 2.8 [2.1-3.6]). The association remained the same in metabolically unhealthy participants aged <65 years and ≥65 years. The results were compatible in the analyses restricted to subjects who never smoked. Regardless of age, metabolically unhealthy underweight (MUHU) have approximately a 3-fold higher risk of CVD mortality, compared with metabolically healthy normal . Not only metabolically unhealthy obesity, but also MUHU was strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality.

In the parent study, all women were treated with aspirin and then randomized to receive either low-molecular- (LMW) heparin or aspirin alone. For this substudy we measured urinary levels of PlGF and urinary creatinine at the following gestational windows: 10-13 6/7, 14-17 6/7, 18-21 6/7, 22-25 6/7, 26-29 6/7, 30-33 6/7, and 34-37 6/7 weeks of gestation.Urine samples were available from 187 patients: LMW heparin plus aspirin (n=93) and aspirin alone (n=94). The two groups had comparable baseline characteristics and had similar adverse composite outcomes at less than 34 weeks of gestation (14/93 [15.1%] vs 11/94 [11.7%]; P=.50). There were no significant differences in urine PlGF levels in the patients who received LMW heparin plus aspirin compared with those who received aspirin alone. However, median [interquartile range] urinary PlGF/creatinine concentrations (pg/mg) measured at mid-pregnancy (22-26 weeks of gestation) were significantly lower among women who developed composite adverse outcome at less than 34 weeks of gestation (42.7 [32.4-80.8] vs 255.6 [118.7-391.8] P<.001) and significantly lower among women who developed preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks of gestation (42.7 [27.5-80.7] vs 244.6 [112.9-390.6] P<.001). For a fixed false-positive rate of 10% the sensitivity of urinary PlGF concentrations at mid-pregnancy was 75.2% (area under the curve 0.93) for the subsequent development of composite adverse outcomes.Decreased urinary PlGF at mid-gestation (22-26 weeks of gestation) is associated with the subsequent development of preeclampsia-related adverse outcomes at less than 34 weeks of gestation.ClinicalTrials.gov, .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693552>Review of Mixed-Methods Research in Nursing.</a></h1><p>Inadequate justification for using mixed-methods and inadequate data integration compromises the rigor of mixed-methods studies, and data integration remains a challenge for nurse researchers.The aim of the study was to determine the 5-year prevalence of mixed-methods research in nursing journals and to determine the extent of integration of qualitative and quantitative findings.Ten journals were hand-searched, and additional search was conducted within three databases. Prevalence was calculated by counting the number of published mixed-methods studies divided by the number of published studies over 5 years. Three reviewers independently performed methodological assessment using a checklist based on guidelines by expert methodologists.Prevalence of mixed-methods studies was 1.89%. Concerning methodological assessment, of 175 studies, 29% did not provide an explicit label of the study design and four studies incorrectly labeled the design.

The extent of data integration was 73%, but 83% of studies integrated data using narrative summaries with integration occurring at the interpretation (69.8%). Few studies used joint displays (10.9%), transformation (3.1%), and triangulation (1.6%) for data integration.Mixed-methods research is still in its infancy in nursing, and researchers encounter challenges during its conduct, analysis, and reporting. There is a need to determine researchers' attitudes and challenges toward using mixed methods and educate them about advanced mixed methods. Emphasis should be placed on use of advanced data integration methods so that the rigor and quality of mixed research can be enhanced in nursing research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695123>Physiological and economic benefits of abandoning invasive surgical procedures and enhancing animal welfare in swine production.</a></h1><p>Food-animal welfare is a major ethical and social concern. Pork is the most consumed meat worldwide, with over a billion pigs slaughtered annually. Most of these pigs routinely undergo painful surgical procedures (surgical castration, tail docking, teeth clipping), which farmers often reluctant to avoid, claiming it would increase cost and reduce production efficiency. Herein, this study indicates that these procedures compromise pigs' health and condition. Replacing surgical castration with immunocastration, avoiding tail docking and teeth clipping, and providing environmental enrichment, resulted in significant increase in  gain, lowered risks for injuries and death, and reduced saliva and hair cortisol, both biomarkers for stress. Testosterone and DHEA analyses confirmed that immunocastration was an effective alternative to surgical castration. Economic models for the entire US swine market revealed that following across-the-board acceptance of this management, pork meat price is expected to drop, while the total annual social welfare (combined consumer and producer surplus) is expected to increase by $US 1.48 to 1.92 billion. In conclusion, sustainable swine farming management can be beneficial for both animals and farmers. Applying such welfare-friendly management is expected to reduce stress, enhance piglet/pig welfare and production, and improve the economics of swine operations in the global agro-food system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698349>A collection input based support tensor machine for lesion malignancy classification in digital breast tomosynthesis.</a></h1><p>Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with improved lesion conspicuity and characterization has been adopted in screening practice. DBT-based diagnosis strongly depends on physicians' experience, so an automatic lesion malignancy classification model using DBT could improve the consistency of diagnosis among different physicians. Tensor-based approaches that use the original imaging data as input have shown promising results for many classification tasks. However, DBT data are pseudo-3D volumetric imaging as the slice spacing of DBT is much coarser than that of the in-plane resolution. Thus, directly constructing DBT as the third-order tensor in a conventional tensor-based classifier with introducing additional information to the original DBT data along the slice-spacing dimension will lead to inconsistency across all three dimensions. To avoid such inconsistency, we introduce a collection input based support tensor machine (CISTM)-based classifier that uses the tensor collection as input for classifying lesion malignancy in DBT. In CISTM, instead of introducing the third dimension directly into the geometry construction, the third-dimension structural relationship is related by  parameters in the decision function, which is dynamically and automatically constructed during the classifier training process and is more consistent with the pseudo-3D nature of DBT. We tested our method on a DBT dataset of 926 images among which 262 were malignant and 664 were benign. We compared our method with the latest tensor-based method, KSTM (kernelled support tensor machine), which does not consider the unique non-uniform resolution property of DBT. Experimental results illustrate that the CISTM-based classifier is effective for classifying breast lesion malignancy in DBT and that it outperforms the KSTM-based classifier.© 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693787>Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated with Malnutrition among Adolescents in Rural Tanzania.</a></h1><p>To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with malnutrition among adolescents in a rural Tanzanian community.Cross-sectional survey of 1,226 randomly selected adolescents from the Dodoma Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Chamwino district in the Dodoma region. Anthropometric measurements for  and height were collected. Height-for-age-z-scores (HAZs) and  Mass Index (BMI)-for-age-z-scores (BAZs) were computed. Descriptive estimates were documented in graphs and tables, and weighted linear regression models were used to examine predictors of malnutrition.Stunting prevalence was 18% and thinness prevalence was 14%. Overweight and obesity affected 5.23% of participants. Girls had higher HAZs (β: 0.46, 95% CI 0.33, 0.59, p<.0001) and BAZs (β: 0.20, 95% CI 0.05, 0.35, p=0.0098) than boys. Age was inversely associated with HAZs (β: -0.13, 95% CI -0.17, -0.08, p<.0001) and BAZs (β: -0.05, 95% CI -0.10, -0.004, p=0.0327). Wealth score (β: 0.10, 95% CI 0.04, 0.16, p=0.0009) and dietary diversity score (β: 0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.07, p=0.0080) were positively associated with HAZs and BAZs. Out-of-school adolescents had higher HAZs (β: -0.49, 95% CI -0.75, -0.23, p=0.0003) and BAZs (β: -0.68, 95% CI -0.99, -0.37, p<.0001) than adolescents who attended school.There are substantial variations of HAZs and BAZs across gender, age, education, and wealth, with an emerging burden of overweight and obesity among adolescents in this rural population.

Here, we investigated mechanisms by which a destabilizing HA mutation, Y17H (activation pH 6.0), attenuates virus replication and pathogenicity in DBA/2 mice, compared to wild-type (WT; activation pH 5.5). Extracellular lung pH was measured to be near neutral (pH 6.9-7.5). WT and Y17H viruses had similar environmental stability at pH 7.0; thus, extracellular inactivation was unlikely to attenuate Y17H virus. The Y17H virus had accelerated replication kinetics in MDCK, A549, and Raw264.7 cells when inoculated at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell. The destabilizing mutation also increased early infectivity and type I interferon (IFN) responses in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs). In contrast, the HA-Y17H mutation reduced replication in murine airway mNEC and mTEC cultures and attenuated virus replication, virus spread, severity of infection, and cellular infiltration in the lungs of mice. Normalizing virus infection and  loss in mice by inoculating them with Y17H virus at a dose 500-fold higher than that of WT virus revealed that the destabilized mutant virus triggered the upregulation of more host genes and increased type I IFN responses and cytokine expression in DBA/2 mouse lungs. Overall, HA destabilization decreased virulence in mice by boosting early infection in DCs, resulting in greater activation of antiviral responses, including type I IFN. These studies reveal HA stability may regulate pathogenicity by modulating IFN responses. Diverse influenza A viruses circulate in wild aquatic birds, occasionally infecting farm animals. Rarely, an avian- or swine-origin influenza virus adapts to humans and starts a pandemic. Seasonal and many universal influenza vaccines target the HA surface protein, which is a key component of pandemic influenza. Understanding HA properties needed for replication and pathogenicity in mammals may guide response efforts to control influenza. Some antiviral drugs and broadly reactive influenza vaccines that target the HA protein have suffered resistance due to destabilizing HA mutations that do not compromise replicative fitness in cell culture. Here, we show that despite not compromising fitness in standard cell cultures, a destabilizing H1N1 HA stalk mutation greatly diminishes viral replication and pathogenicity in vivo by modulating type I IFN responses. This encourages targeting the HA stalk with antiviral drugs and vaccines as well as reevaluating previous candidates that were susceptible to destabilizing resistance mutations.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693022>Multi-component supramolecular fibers with elastomeric properties and controlled drug release.</a></h1><p>Supramolecular materials based on hydrogen bonding ureido-pyrimidinones (UPy) are highly versatile substrates for tissue engineering, as they provide a platform in which specific functions can be introduced in a modular fashion by means of components with matching supramolecular motifs. In this work, a core-shell fiber mesh is generated by coaxial electrospinning of a robust elastomeric UPy-poly(hexamethylene carbonate) (UPy-PC) core with a hydrophilic shell of poly(ethylene glycol) (UPy-PEG), which is exploited to confer drug release properties to the load-bearing core. The effect of PEG chain length and supramolecular crosslink density on mechanical properties and drug elution profiles is investigated. Hydrated UPy-PC/UPy-PEG meshes containing 30 mol% of UPy-PEG have a Young's modulus matching that of UPy-PC meshes of approximately 0.5 MPa, and elongation at break of 600%. Drug release experiments with low molecular  drugs encapsulated in the UPy-PEG shell during electrospinning reveal a combined role of drug and matrix hydrophilicity on the elution profile. Our results indicate that a hydrophobic drug is retained in the UPy-PEG shell for several days with a maximum drug release of 56 ± 8% after 14 days, a highly water soluble drug undergoes burst release within one day, and the UPy-modification of a highly water soluble compound increases its retention in the UPy-PEG shell up to multiple weeks. Taken together, our results indicate that the proposed multi-component system is a drug delivery vehicle of excellent versatility for applications requiring strong and durable materials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697330>Individual Risk Prediction for Sight-Threatening Retinopathy of Prematurity Using Birth Characteristics.</a></h1><p>To prevent blindness, repeated infant eye examinations are performed to detect severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), yet only a small fraction of those screened need treatment. Early individual risk stratification would improve screening timing and efficiency and potentially reduce the risk of blindness.To create and validate an easy-to-use prediction model using only birth characteristics and to describe a continuous hazard function for ROP treatment.In this retrospective cohort study, Swedish National Patient Registry data from infants screened for ROP (born between January 1, 2007, and August 7, 2018) were analyzed with Poisson regression for time-varying data (postnatal age, gestational age [GA], sex, birth , and important interactions) to develop an individualized predictive model for ROP treatment (called DIGIROP-Birth [Digital ROP]). The model was validated internally and externally (in US and European cohorts) and compared with 4 published prediction models.The study outcome was ROP treatment. The  were estimated momentary and cumulative risks, hazard ratios with 95% CIs, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (hereinafter referred to as AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).Among 7609 infants (54.6% boys; mean [SD] GA, 28.1 [2.1] weeks; mean [SD] birth , 1119 [353] g), 442 (5.8%) were treated for ROP, including 142 (40.1%) treated of 354 born at less than 24 gestational weeks. Irrespective of GA, the risk for receiving ROP treatment increased during postnatal weeks 8 through 12 and decreased thereafter. Validations of DIGIROP-Birth for 24 to 30 weeks' GA showed high predictive ability for the model overall (AUC, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.89-0.92] for internal validation, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.98] for temporal validation, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.84-0.89] for US external validation, and 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85-0.95] for European external validation) by calendar periods and by race/ethnicity. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were numerically at least as high as those obtained from CHOP-ROP (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia-ROP), OMA-ROP (Omaha-ROP), WINROP (, insulinlike growth factor 1, neonatal, ROP), and CO-ROP (Colorado-ROP), models requiring more complex postnatal data.This study validated an individualized prediction model for infants born at 24 to 30 weeks' GA, enabling early risk prediction of ROP treatment based on birth characteristics data. Postnatal age rather than postmenstrual age was a better predictive variable for the temporal risk of ROP treatment. The model is an accessible online application that appears to be generalizable and to have at least as good test statistics as other models requiring longitudinal neonatal data not always readily available to ophthalmologists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693630>Resuscitation Fluids in Septic Shock: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of various resuscitation fluids in septic shock by adopting a network meta-analysis (NMA). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing resuscitation fluids in septic shock were carried out by retrieving electronic databases. NMAs of 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) were conducted using the STATA 15.0 software. Probability-based ranking and surface under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) were performed to identify the optimal resuscitation fluid. Inconsistencies were evaluated by node-splitting analysis and a loop-specific approach. Furthermore, publication bias was analyzed by funnel plots. A total of 13 RCTs were enrolled in the analysis. The NMA results revealed that no significant differences were detected in the outcomes of 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality among various resuscitation fluids. The SUCRAs (the first indicates the best) of 28-day mortality showed that the hypertonic sodium chloride/hydroxyethyl starch 40 solution ranked the highest (93.8%), followed by the balanced solution (BS) (69.6%), and albumin (61.9%). On the other hand, the SUCRAs of 90-day mortality revealed that gelatin (GEL) ranked the highest (75.1%), followed by BS (55.1%), and NS (52.4%). The NMA results of AKI demonstrated that high-molecular- hydroxyethyl starch (H-HES) was associated with increased risk of AKI in comparison with GEL, BS, and L-HES. The SUCRAs of AKI showed that GEL ranked the highest (74.4%), followed by NS (64.9%), and BS (58.3%). In addition, the NMA results of RRT revealed that H-HES was associated with an increased need for RRT in comparison with BS and NS, and L-HES was associated with increased need of RRT in comparison with BS. The SUCRAs of RRT revealed that NS ranked the highest (91.6%), followed by BS (74.4%) and L-HES (36.1%). No significant inconsistencies were shown by the node-splitting analysis and no publication bias was demonstrated in the funnel plots. In conclusion, BS was determined as the preferred resuscitation fluid for septic shock. Moreover, the use of GEL requires further evaluation. H-HES was associated with a significant risk of AKI and RRT, whereas L-HES with an increased need for RRT compared with BS. Thus, both resuscitation fluids should be avoided for septic shock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695269>Bisphosphonate associated femoral stress fracture distal to an orthopaedic implant: They are predictable!</a></h1><p>Stress fractures are uncommon and often occur in young athletes with high intensity physical activity. These stress fractures occur in  bearing long bones. Recent literature suggests association of thigh pain, tension side cortical thickening of femoral shaft or a femoral subtrochanteric atypical stress fractures in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy. The reports of peri-implant bisphosphonate associated atypical stress fractures are very rare. We describe a series of three cases of femoral shaft stress phenomenon around orthopaedic implants who presented with similar prodromal thigh pain and tension side cortical thickening. Two patients sustained fractures as the condition was not recognised despite presenting with prodromal symptoms and one patient with a stress riser who was treated prophylactically. Thus this series aims to highlight the importance of identifying the stress phenomenon around orthopaedic implants, be it intra or extra-medullary implants. The location of these fractures is just distal to the implants and are classically transverse fractures. The treatment of peri-implant stress fractures needs a personalised approach in every case with appropriate choice of implants.© 2019 Delhi Orthopedic Association.

However, there are very few studies reporting the physiological effects of cold with rain or wet-cold exposure on humans during exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of rain on physiological responses during running exercise at 80% V̇Omax in the cold.Twelve healthy men (age: 21.7±3.3 years; height: 1.760±0.085 m; : 68.8±7.1 kg; maximal oxygen consumption: 67.3±5.00 mL/kg/min) exercised on a treadmill at 80% V̇Omax intensity for 60 minutes with rain (RAIN) or not (CON) at 5 °C.Rectal temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON at 10, 40, 50, and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Mean weighted skin temperature was significantly lower in RAIN than in CON during exercise (P<0.05). Oxygen consumption and rating of perceived exertion were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 50 and 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma lactate was significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05). Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly higher in RAIN than in CON at 10 minutes and from 40 to 60 minutes (P<0.05).These results suggest that rain increased heat loss during the early phase of exercise in the cold, then heat production increased and transiently suppressed cold stress. However, with time,  heat loss intensified due to increasing wet area, and then energy expenditure and plasma lactate increased due to cold stress. Therefore, rain may decrease exercise performance and affect sport safety.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695730>A potential relation between premenstrual symptoms and subjective perception of health and stress among college students: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>A majority of women from all cultures and socioeconomic levels experience myriad symptoms known as premenstrual syndrome during the days prior to menstruation. The present study investigated commonly reported symptoms in the premenstrual phase among college students. The authors further scrutinized potential factors, including subjective perceptions of health, which may be related to the premenstrual-symptom constellation.We conducted a cross-sectional survey, which included 200 participants (mean age: 19.8 ± 0.1 years old). The subjects completed a rating of their premenstrual experiences relative to 46 symptoms in eight categories of the self-reporting menstrual distress questionnaire (MDQ) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of premenstrual symptoms. The participants also answered a standardized health questionnaire regarding subjective perceptions of health, self-rating stress, lifestyle, and demographic variables.Regardless of severity, the 10 symptoms most often occurring among the participants included skin disorders, irritability, fatigue, mood swings, general aches and pains, lowered school or work performance, backache, painful breasts,  gain, and swelling. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed subjective perception of health (β = 0.28;  <  0.001) and self-rating stress (β = 0.18;  = 0.008) as the factors most strongly related to the MDQ total scores. In addition, the 19 women who evaluated themselves as "unhealthy and stressed" had greater prevalence of severe or extremely severe physical (general aches and pains) and psychosocial symptoms (confusion, lowered school or work performance, decreased efficiency, loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, mood swings, and depression), compared to the healthy and non-stressed women.The present study indicates the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms, regardless of severity and number, among college students and suggests that negative subjective perceptions of health and stress may be related to the intensity of premenstrual symptomatology.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694176>Oxaliplatin-Fluoropyrimidine Combination (XELOX) Therapy Does Not Affect Plasma Amino Acid Levels and Plasma Markers of Oxidative Stress in Colorectal Cancer Surgery Patients: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Chemotherapy for colorectal cancer may lower muscle protein synthesis and increase oxidative stress. We hypothesize that chemotherapy may worsen plasma amino acids (AAs) and markers of oxidative stress (MOS). Therefore, this study aimed to document plasma AAs and MOS before, during and after chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery patients. Fourteen normal- CRC patients were enrolled one month after surgery and scheduled for oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combination (XELOX) therapy. Venous blood samples for AA and MOS (malondialdehyde, MDA; 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG) measurements were drawn in fasting patients before each oxaliplatin infusion at initiation (A), 1 month (B) and 3 months (C) of the therapy, and after XELOX had finished (6 months, D). The results showed that during XELOX therapy (from phase B to phase D), in comparison to baseline (phase A), the branched chain amino acid/essential amino acid ratio, branched chain amino acids expressed as a percentage of total AAs, and arginine expressed as a percentage of total AAs significantly decreased ( = 0.017,  = 0.028,  = 0.028, respectively).

Ten 30-day-old male yak calves were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The maternal grazing (MG) group was maternally nursed and grazed, and the early weaning (EW) group was supplied milk replacer, starter feed, and alfalfa hay twice per day. Compared with the yak calves in the MG group, the yak calves in the EW group showed significantly increased ,  height,  length, and chest girth. When suffering to the potential mechanism of improved growth of yak calves, except for the enhanced ruminal fermentation, the significantly increased total volatile fatty acids, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and valerate in the caecum in the EW group could also serve to promote the growth of calves. By using 16S rDNA sequencing, some significantly increased caecal phylum and genera, which were all related to the enhanced caecal fermentation by utilizing both the fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates, were identified in the EW group. In conclusion, early weaning of yak calves by supplying them with alfalfa hay, starter feed, and milk replacer is more beneficial to the growth of yak calves when compared with maternal grazing and nursing, in part due to alterations in caecal microbiota and fermentation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695526>A qualitative study of patient perspectives related to glucocorticoid therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis.</a></h1><p>To determine patient experiences of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA).Patients with a diagnosis of PMR or GCA were invited to participate in this qualitative study that used focus groups to explore: symptoms onset, process of diagnosis, treatment, adverse effects (AEs), and ongoing condition/s management.

Sepsis is a life-threatening dysfunction that arises when the 's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Diffuse sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP) in ICR mice. 0.2 mg/kg  of atorvastatin was administrated intraperitoneally at 12 h before surgery. The survival of mice was calculated 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after CLP surgery. Two weeks later, open-field test and Morris water maze test were conducted to evaluate the protective effect of atorvastatin. Inflammatory cytokines in plasma, oxidative stress parameters, number of astrocytes, and neuronal cell deaths in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. The results indicate that pretreatment with atorvastatin can increase survival percentage and improve cognitive function. Atorvastatin reversed all these alterations in parallel with a decrease in circulating levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) in plasma, inhibited the activities of oxidative stress parameters (lower TBARS levels, ratio of GSH/GSSH, and activities of SOD and CAT), enhanced the activity of citrate synthase in brain, and reduced the number of astrocytes and neuronal cell deaths in CA3 region of hippocampus. Overall, our results indicated that atorvastatin exhibited protective effects on survival rate and cognitive disorders after sepsis by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis in brain tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693231>A Pyrene-Poly(acrylic acid)-Polyrotaxane Supramolecular Binder Network for High-Performance Silicon Negative Electrodes.</a></h1><p>Although being incorporated in commercial lithium-ion batteries for a while, the  portion of silicon monoxide (SiO , x ≈ 1) is only less than 10 wt% due to the insufficient cycle life. Along this line, polymeric binders that can assist in maintaining the mechanical integrity and interfacial stability of SiO electrodes are desired to realize higher contents of SiO . Herein, a pyrene-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-polyrotaxane (PR) supramolecular network is reported as a polymeric binder for SiO with 100 wt%. The noncovalent functionalization of a carbon coating layer on the SiO is achieved by using a hydroxylated pyrene derivative via the π-π stacking interaction, which simultaneously enables hydrogen bonding interactions with the PR-PAA network through its hydroxyl moiety. Moreover, the PR's ring sliding while being crosslinked to PAA endows a high elasticity to the entire polymer network, effectively buffering the volume expansion of SiO and largely mitigating the electrode swelling. Based on these extraordinary physicochemical properties of the pyrene-PAA-PR supramolecular binder, the robust cycling of SiO electrodes is demonstrated at commercial levels of areal loading in both half-cell and full-cell configurations.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The authors sought to determine how arthrograms affect management of these fractures. They reviewed all lateral condyle fractures treated surgically at a pediatric level I trauma center from 2008 to 2014. They stratified patients managed with and without an arthrogram as well as by timing of arthrogram. The authors compared injury parameters, initial and postoperative fracture displacement, and complications between groups. They identified 107 patients who were taken to the operating room for attempted closed reduction, which they classified as either CRPP without arthrogram or arthrogram first and then a decision to treat open or with CRPP. Fifty-eight (54.21%) underwent CRPP without arthrogram and 49 (45.79%) underwent arthrogram. Of those who had arthrograms, 27 (25.23%) were prior to fixation and 22 (20.56%) were after fixation. There was no difference in age, , or preoperative displacement among the groups. Mean postoperative displacement was significantly lower in the no arthrogram group vs the arthrogram group (0.91 mm vs 1.68 mm; P<.0001), but it did not differ based on timing of arthrogram (P=.836). Arthrograms changed management in 4 (8%) of 49 patients who had them. There was no statistical difference in the rate of changed management by timing of arthrogram (before vs after fixation, 14.8% vs 0%; P=.060). The authors demonstrated that arthrograms may be useful for assessing final fracture alignment after CRPP, but are unlikely to result in a treatment change and are not associated with improved postoperative alignment.

Neonates born prematurely to HIV positive mothers are underdeveloped not only in anatomical terms but also in their physiological systems. Zidovudine, the first antiretroviral drug in clinical therapy for treatment of HIV has been approved for the use in preterm neonates both prophylactically and therapeutically. The present work shows whole  physiologically based pharmacokinetic (WB-PBPK) WB-PBPK model development for Zidovudine in preterm neonates of varying gestational ages to observe the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug in this vulnerable group of population. Along with the height, , post-natal and gestational ages of the preterm neonates; metabolic enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2C8 etc. were incorporated in each neonate. Different organs' composition in terms of water and lipid components, blood flow rates etc. were specified during simulations according to the gestational ages of these neonates. The following PK parameters were estimated for preterm neonates using simulated plasma profiles: AUC 2686.41 ± 123.49 μmol·min/l, Cmax 6.46 ± 0.74 μmol/l, half-life 8.98 ± 2.36 h, Mean residence time 12.23 ± 3.43 h and total plasma clearance 1.48 ± 0.19 ml /min/kg in comparison to the observed PK parameters of Mirochknic et.al clinical study in preterm neonates with AUC 2020.04 μmol· min/l, Cmax 6.10 μmol/l and total plasma clearance 1.62 ml/min/kg. PBPK simulations provide an opportunity to visualize the possible impact of physiological maturity levels at varying gestational age on the pharmacokinetic behavior of zidovudine in preterm neonates.This article is protected by copyright.

Inter-laboratory variability in behaviour-based severity assessment.</a></h1><p>Evidence-based severity assessment is essential as a basis for ethical evaluation in animal experimentation to ensure animal welfare, legal compliance and scientific quality. To fulfil these tasks scientists, animal care and veterinary personnel need assessment tools that provide species-relevant measurements of the animals' physical and affective state. In a three-centre study inter-laboratory robustness of  monitoring, mouse grimace scale (MGS) and burrowing test were evaluated. The parameters were assessed in naïve and tramadol treated female C57BL/6J mice. During tramadol treatment a  loss followed by an increase, when treatment was terminated, was observed in all laboratories. Tramadol treatment did not affect the MGS or burrowing performance. Results were qualitatively comparable between the laboratories, but quantitatively significantly different (inter-laboratory analysis). Burrowing behaviour seems to be highly sensitive to inter-laboratory differences in testing protocol. All locations obtained comparable information regarding the qualitative effect of tramadol treatment in C57BL/6J mice, however, datasets differed as a result of differences in test and housing conditions. In conclusion, our study confirms that results of behavioural testing can be affected by many factors and may differ between laboratories. Nevertheless, the evaluated parameters appeared relatively robust even when conditions were not harmonized extensively and present useful tools for severity assessment. However, analgesia-related side effects on parameters have to be considered carefully.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696598>Liraglutide reduces hyperglycaemia and  in overweight, dysregulated insulin-pump-treated patients with type 1 diabetes: The Lira Pump trial - a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.</a></h1><p>To investigate the efficacy of adding the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in overweight or obese persons with type 1 diabetes and non-optimal glycaemic control.A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 44 overweight or obese adults with type 1 diabetes randomized 1:1 to liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily (QD) or placebo added to CSII treatment.

CD11c+ antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) have been reported in human AAA samples but their role is unclear. The effect of conditional depletion of CD11c+ cells on experimental AAA was investigated in the angiotensin II (AngII)-infused apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mouse model.CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR), ovalbumin (OVA) fragment aa 140-386, and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-ApoE-/- (CD11c.DOG.ApoE-/-) mice were generated and CD11c+ cell depletion achieved with Diphtheria toxin (D.tox) injections (8 ng/g , i.p., every-other-day). AAA formation and growth were assessed by measurement of supra-renal aortic (SRA) diameter in vivo by serial ultrasound and by morphometry assessment of harvested aortas at the end of the study.Depletion of CD11chigh MHC Class II+ cells by administration of D.tox on alternative days was shown to reduce the maximum diameter of AAAs induced by 28 days AngII infusion compared to controls (D.tox, 1.58{plus minus}0.03mm vs Vehicle control, 1.81{plus minus}0.06mm, p&lt;0.001). CD11c+ depletion commencing after AAA establishment by 14 days of AngII infusion, was also shown to lead to smaller AAAs than controls after a further 14 days (D.tox, 1.54{plus minus}0.04mm vs Vehicle control, 1.80{plus minus}0.03mm, p&lt;0.001). Flow cytometry revealed significantly lower numbers of circulating CD44hi CD62Llo effector CD4 T cells, CD44hi CD62Llo effector CD8 T cells and B220+ B cells in CD11c+ cell-depleted mice versus controls.

Drying-off typically comprises dietary changes as well as gradual or abrupt changes in daily milking frequency, which may challenge the welfare of high-yielding cows. This study investigated the isolated and combined effects of different feed energy densities (normal lactation diet versus energy-reduced diet, both offered ad libitum) and daily milking frequencies (twice versus once) on the feeding motivation of dairy cows on two separate days prior to dry-off (i.e. the day of last milking) using a push-gate feeder. During both days, cows on the energy-reduced diet pushed more than five times more  to earn the final feed reward and were nearly ten times faster to feed on the first reward than cows on the normal lactation diet. Illustrating the importance of developing more animal welfare-friendly dry-off management, these results illustrate that cows show signs of hunger prior to dry-off when provided a diet with reduced energy density, although offered for ad libitum intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696228>Treatment with JQ1, a BET bromodomain inhibitor, is selectively detrimental to R6/2 Huntington's disease mice.</a></h1><p>Transcriptional and epigenetic alterations occur early in Huntington's disease (HD) and treatment with epigenetic modulators are beneficial in several HD animal models. The drug JQ1, which inhibits histone acetyl-lysine reader bromodomains, has shown promise in multiple cancers and in neurodegenerative disease. We tested whether JQ1 could improve behavioral phenotypes in the R6/2 mouse model of HD and modulate HD-associated changes in transcription and epigenomics. R6/2 and non-transgenic (NT) mice were treated with JQ1 daily from 5-11 weeks of age and behavioral phenotypes evaluated over this period. Following the trial, cortex and striatum were isolated and subjected to mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq for the histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Initially, JQ1 enhanced motor performance in NT mice. In R6/2 mice, however, JQ1 had no effect on rotarod or grip strength but exacerbated  loss and worsened performance on the pole test. JQ1-induced gene expression changes in NT mice were distinct from those in R6/2 and primarily involved protein translation and bioenergetics pathways. Dysregulation of HD-related pathways in striatum was exacerbated by JQ1 in R6/2 mice, but not in NTs, and JQ1 caused a corresponding increase in the formation of a mutant huntingtin protein-dependent High Molecular  (HMW) species associated with pathogenesis. This study suggests that drugs predicted to be beneficial based on their mode of action and effects in wild-type or in other neurodegenerative disease models may have an altered impact in the HD context. These observations have important implications in the development of epigenetic modulators as therapies for HD.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The biochemical indicators closely related to fatigue, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactic acid (LD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) in the serum; liver glycogen (LG) in the liver tissue; muscle glycogen (MG); inorganic phosphate (Pi) and Annexin V in the gastrocnemius; superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities; malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); and the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in both serum and the gastrocnemius were detected. Morphological changes were also observed. The anti-fatigue-related proteins of the NRF2/ARE, Bcl2, and PGC-1α pathways in the gastrocnemius of the mice were detected by western blot.Anwulignan significantly increased the exercise tolerance by decreasing BUN, LD, LDH, CK, Pi, MDA, TBARS, 8-OHdG, ROS, and Annexin V levels and increasing LG, MG, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels, significantly upregulated the expression of NRF2 and Bcl2 proteins, which are anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis regulators, and also activated the p38MAPK-PGC-1α pathway.Anwulignan can increase exercise tolerance and relieve fatigue in an excessive fatigue mouse model. The underlying mechanism may be through its regulatory effect on the NRF2 and PGC-1α signaling pathway. This study will provide scientific data for anwulignan to be developed as a novel and efficient component in anti-oxidant or anti-fatigue health food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695709>Impact of Within-Tree Organ Distances on Floral Induction and Fruit Growth in Apple Tree: Implication of Carbohydrate and Gibberellin Organ Contents.</a></h1><p>In plants, organs are inter-dependent for growth and development. Here, we aimed to investigate the distance at which interaction between organs operates and the relative contribution of within-tree variation in carbohydrate and hormonal contents on floral induction and fruit growth, in a fruit tree case study. Manipulations of leaf and fruit numbers were performed in two years on "Golden delicious" apple trees, at the shoot or branch scale or one side of Y-shape trees. For each treatment, floral induction proportion and mean fruit  were recorded. Gibberellins content in shoot apical meristems, photosynthesis, and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations in organs were measured. Floral induction was promoted by leaf presence and fruit absence but was not associated with non-structural content in meristems. This suggests a combined action of promoting and inhibiting signals originating from leaves and fruit, and involving gibberellins. Nevertheless, these signals act at short distance only since leaf or fruit presence at long distances had no effect on floral induction. Conversely, fruit growth was affected by leaf presence even at long distances when sink demands were imbalanced within the tree, suggesting long distance transport of carbohydrates. We thus clarified the inter-dependence and distance effect among organs, therefore their degree of autonomy that appeared dependent on the process considered, floral induction or fruit growth.Copyright © 2019 Belhassine, Martinez, Bluy, Fumey, Kelner, Costes and Pallas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695912>Observational study of the effects of upper respiratory tract infection on hydration status.</a></h1><p>A frequent treatment recommendation during acute respiratory infection is to increase fluid intake. This is the first study to investigate whether upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) such as common cold can lead to dehydration, as commonly believed by the public.This was an exploratory, noninterventional, observational, single-center study. Subjects made 2 visits to a UK study center for assessments of dehydration, once during URTI and then 2-3 weeks later when fully recovered. The primary endpoint was a comparison of serum osmolality during vs after URTI. Complete blood count, serum urea, serum electrolytes, urine parameters (eg, osmolality, specific gravity, color), /BMI, subjective assessment of thirst, and physician assessment of dehydration were additional outcomes. Only descriptive statistics and shift tables were used.Fifty-five otherwise healthy adults with moderate to severe URTI of < 120 h in duration were enrolled (63.6% female, 94.5% white, mean [SD] age 21.0 [6.8] years). There was no evidence of dehydration based on serum osmolality (mean [SD] 287.63 [4.83] mosm/kg during URTI; 288.60 [5.99] mosm/kg after recovery). With only a few exceptions, complete blood count, serum urea, serum electrolytes, urine specific gravity, urine color, and physician ratings of hydration remained stable.  decreased > 1% in 34.0% of subjects and increased > 1% in 17.0% between visits, with similar changes in BMI.

Subjects perceived greater thirst during URTI.In this pilot observational study, we found no evidence that URTIs such as common cold are associated with dehydration, contrary to popular belief.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697283>One-pot green and simple synthesis of actinian nickel-doped carbon nanoflowers for ultrasensitive sensing of quercetin.</a></h1><p>In this contribution, a one-pot method possessing the advantages of easy preparation, rapidness, efficiency and environmental friendliness has been developed for the first time for the facile synthesis of highly fluorescent actinian nickel-doped carbon nanoflowers (Ni-CNFWs) by using nickel(ii)acetylacetonate as a metal-carbon source. Various characterization studies indicate that metal nickel atoms have been successfully doped into carbon nanoflower frameworks with a  percentage of 1.46 wt%. The Ni-CNFWs showed a "shell-core" actinian structure with ∼400 nm diameter and highly efficient fluorescence quenching ability in the presence of quercetin (Qut) due to the formed Meisenheimer complexes via the conjugation effect of p, π-electrons between Ni-CNFWs and Qut, which allowed the analysis of Qut in a very facile method. Under the optimal conditions, the decreased fluorescence of Ni-CNFWs showed a good linear relationship with the concentration of Qut ranging from 0.5 to 300.0 μM, and the limit of detection was 0.137 μM (3σ/k). Finally, the content of Qut in bovine serum was successfully detected with the novel on-off sensor, and the recoveries were 97.3-101.9%, which indicate that the constructed on-off sensor has a high selectivity and accuracy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694205>Structural Analysis of Gluco-Oligosaccharides Produced by  and Their Prebiotic Effect.</a></h1><p> CCK940, which exhibits glycosyltransferase activity, produces oligosaccharides using sucrose and maltose as donor and receptor molecules, respectively.

Collated data were assessed, integrated, and analyzed to establish continuous mathematical functions describing their growth trends with fetal age and .Data were available from 14 studies for blood, ten studies for hematocrit, 12 studies for albumin, and four studies for alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, while plasma and red blood cell volumes were described based on blood and hematocrit data. Fetal physiologically based pharmacokinetic parameters, including blood, plasma and red blood cell volumes, hematocrit, serum albumin, and acid glycoprotein were quantified as a function of fetal age and . Variability around the mean parameters at different fetal ages was also investigated. The growth of each of these parameters was different (with respect to direction and monotonicity).Despite the limitations identified in the availability of some values, the collected data presented in this article provide a useful resource for fetal physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.

If routine imaging examinations cannot identify the source of ACTH production, long-term follow-up observation is necessary to determine the etiology. We present the case of a middle-aged male with gradual  gain and a Cushingoid appearance over 4 years; he provided written informed consent. Laboratory and endocrine tests strongly suggested EAS, although the origin was not detected by multiple imaging methods. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed to prevent severe complications in the patient. Two and a half years later, a cardiac mass 18 × 23 × 27 mm in size at the junction between the anterior wall of the left ventricle and the middle septum was found together with multiple bone metastases by F-FDG PET/CT, while the Ga-DOTATE PET/CT findings were negative. Biopsy of the lumbar vertebrae revealed a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with positive ACTH staining. The patient underwent chemotherapy by CAPTEM, resulting in shrinkage of the cardiac mass and a significant decrease in the ACTH level. In the case of EAS with an unusual cause, long-term follow-up observation is necessary to determine the source of ACTH production. Cardiac NETs are quite rare in EAS, so treatment selection was also challenging. CAPTEM chemotherapy proved effective in controlling the progression of tumor growth and decreasing the ACTH level in this patient.Copyright © 2019 Lu, Meng, Xing, Yuan, Zhang, Li, Wang, Cheng, Bai, Wang, Cheng, Xiao, Pan, Li, Sun, Liang, Zhu, Wang and Lu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694213>Early Hepatic Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Changes Following Western Diet in Middle Aged Rats.</a></h1><p>To assess the effect of 4 weeks of high fat-high fructose feeding on whole  composition, energy balance, specific markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and insulin sensitivity in the liver of middle-aged rats, rats (1 year) were fed a diet rich in saturated fatty acids and fructose (HFF rats), mimicking the "Western diet", and compared with rats of the same age that were fed a low fat diet (LF rats). HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of , energy, and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic insulin resistance, together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, insulin resistance, and early mitochondrial alterations in the liver. Therefore, this type of dietary habits should be drastically limited to pursue a "healthy aging".</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697726>Impact of negative tuberculin skin test on growth among disadvantaged Bangladeshi children.</a></h1><p>Millions of children are suffering from tuberculosis (TB) worldwide and often end-up with fatal outcome especially in resource-poor settings. Tuberculin skin test (TST) is a conventionally used diagnostic test, less sensitive but highly specific for the diagnosis of clinical TB especially in undernourished children. However, we do not have any data on the role of TST positivity among the children who received nutritional intervention. Our aim was to examine the growth differences between TST-positive and TST-negative undernourished children aged 12 to 18 months who received nutritional intervention prospectively for 90 feeding days. Our further aim was to explore the determinants of TST positivity at enrollment. TB screening as one of the secondary causes of malnutrition was performed on 243 stunted [length for age Z score (LAZ) <-2 standard deviations] or at-risk of stunting (LAZ score between <-1 and -2 standard deviations) children in a community-based intervention study designed to improve their growth parameters. Differences of growth between TST-positives (n = 29) and TST-negatives (n = 214) were compared using paired samples t-test and multivariable linear regression from anthropometric data collected before and after nutritional intervention. Multivariable logistic regression was used to find out possible predictors of TST positivity using baseline sociodemographic data. Of the 243 children screened, 29 (11.9%) were TST-positive and 11 (4.5%) had clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB. Statistically significant improvement of LAZ and  for age Z-score (WAZ) were observed among the TST-negative participants at the end of intervention period (p = 0.03 for LAZ and p = 0.01 for WAZ). However, we did not find any association between TST status and response to nutritional intervention in our multivariable linear regression models.

The incorporation of genomic tools may help to accelerate selection. We genotyped 529 individuals using a high-density SNP chip (600 K, Affymetrix®) to estimate genomic heritability of performance traits and to identify genomic regions and their positional candidate genes associated with performance traits in a Brazilian F Chicken Resource population. Regions exhibiting selection signatures and a SNP dataset from resequencing were integrated with the genomic regions identified using the chip to refine the list of positional candidate genes and identify potential causative mutations.Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FC), feed efficiency (FE) and  gain (WG) exhibited low genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.0002 to 0.13), while  at hatch (BW1), 35 days-of-age (BW35), and 41 days-of-age (BW41) exhibited high genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.60 to 0.73) in this F population. Twenty unique 1-Mb genomic windows were associated with BW1, BW35 or BW41, located on GGA1-4, 6-7, 10, 14, 24, 27 and 28. Thirty-eight positional candidate genes were identified within these windows, and three of them overlapped with selection signature regions. Thirteen predicted deleterious and three high impact sequence SNPs in these QTL regions were annotated in 11 positional candidate genes related to osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, growth, energy metabolism and lipid metabolism, which may be associated with  in chickens.The use of a high-density SNP array to identify QTL which were integrated with whole genome sequence signatures of selection allowed the identification of candidate genes and candidate causal variants.

Independent of admission , lower HR (β = -0.492 [confidence interval (CI) -0.883 to -0.100];  = .01) was associated with faster loss; lower serum phosphorus was associated with a greater amount (β = -0.005 [CI -0.010 to 0.000];  = .04) and longer duration (β = -0.011 [CI -0.017 to 0.005];  = .001).  and menstrual history explained 28% of the variance in HR and 36% of the variance in serum phosphorus. history was independently associated with markers of malnutrition in inpatients with restrictive eating disorders across a range of   and should be considered when assessing illness severity on hospital admission.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696014>Minimally Invasive Lumbopelvic Fixation for Unstable U-Type Sacral Fractures.</a></h1><p>Multi-planar transverse, U-type, and vertical sacral fractures occur from high energy trauma or as pathologic fractures and often have associated neurologic and extremity injuries. Modern treatment algorithms fall into two broad categories: 1) percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation (iliosacral or transiliac-transsacral screws) or 2) lumbopelvic fixation. Posterior pelvic screw fixation is minimally invasive but typically requires restricted  bearing until fracture union. In many cases, lumbopelvic fixation allows for a closed reduction and provides stability to allow full  bearing immediately after surgery; however, this fixation is often removed in a second surgery after fracture healing. Lumbopelvic fixation was originally described as an open procedure, minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a recent variation and has shown promising results with less morbidity. We present a case series of unstable U-type sacral fractures treated with minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation with staged hardware removal to illustrate the advantages and complications associated with this new technique. Ten patients with U-type sacral fractures underwent minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation from 2016 to 2019. Six patients underwent scheduled hardware removal an average of 3.5 (range 1.9-5.5) months after index surgery. Two patients did not undergo hardware removal due to short life expectancy and diagnosis of pathologic fractures. One patient was lost to follow-up. One patient had failed fracture reduction and went on to sacral malunion that required a late sacral extension osteotomy to restore her ability to stand upright. Final disposition of all nine patients with follow-up was normal standing upright posture and normal ambulation without assistive device. There were no late displacements on postoperative upright radiographs. Complex sacral fractures are a challenging injury that can be treated with percutaneous posterior pelvic or lumbopelvic fixation. Lumbopelvic fixation offers the advantages of closed reduction to restore pelvic incidence and immediate  bearing but has greater surgical morbidity than percutaneous posterior pelvic fixation and often requires hardware removal. The morbidity of lumbopelvic fixation may be reduced with minimally invasive techniques. Minimally invasive lumbopelvic fixation is a treatment option to be considered for complex sacral fractures.Copyright © 2019, Shah et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693385>Low calorie sweeteners cause only limited metabolic effects in mice.</a></h1><p>There are widespread concerns that low calorie sweeteners (LCSs) cause metabolic derangement. These concerns stem in part from prior studies linking LCS consumption to impaired glucose tolerance in humans and rodents. Here, we examined this linkage in mice. In Experiment 1, we provided mice with chow, water and an LCS-sweetened solution (saccharin, sucralose or acesulfame K) for 28 days, and measured glucose tolerance and  across the exposure period. Exposure to the LCS solutions did not impair glucose tolerance or alter  gain. In Experiment 2, we provided mice with chow, water and a solution containing saccharin, glucose, or a mixture of both for 28 days, and tested for metabolic changes. Exposure to the saccharin solution increased the insulinemic response of mice to the glucose challenge, and exposure to the saccharin + glucose solution increased the rate of glucose uptake during the glucose challenge. However, neither of these test solutions altered glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, plasma triglycerides or percent  fat. In contrast, exposure to the glucose solution increased glucose tolerance, early insulin response, insulin sensitivity and percent  fat. We conclude that while the LCS-containing solutions induced a few metabolic changes, they were modest compared to those induced by the glucose solution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697646>Catalpol induces autophagy and attenuates liver steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Impaired autophagy has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Catalpol (CAT), a bioactive compound from  (Di Huang) , is known to ameliorate insulin resistance and the histological NAFLD spectrum in obese mice. Here, we investigated the effects of CAT on hepatic steatosis and autophagy in ob/ob and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, as well as in hepatocytes. In ob/ob mice, CAT reduced liver , liver triglyceride and cholesterol content, and hepatic lipogenic enzyme levels and increased fatty acid oxidase levels. In addition, CAT administration increased LC3-II levels and decreased SQSTM1/P62 levels in ob/ob mice. Similar effects on hepatic steatosis and autophagy were observed in high-fat diet-induced mice after administration of CAT. Additionally, we found that CAT stimulated AMPK and increased nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in obese mice and hepatocytes. Inhibition of AMPK completely blocked the effects of CAT on TFEB nuclear localization, hepatic autophagy, and liver steatosis. These findings revealed that diminished AMPK/TFEB-dependent autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of liver steatosis in obesity, and that CAT might be a novel therapeutic candidate for treatment of this condition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693435>Adaptation to Slope in Locomotor Trained Spinal Cats with Intact and Self-Reinnervated Lateral Gastrocnemius and Soleus Muscles.</a></h1><p>Sensorimotor training providing motion-dependent somatosensory feedback to spinal locomotor networks restores treadmill  bearing stepping on flat surface in spinal cats. In this study, we examined if locomotor ability on flat transfers to sloped surfaces and the contribution of length-dependent sensory feedback from  (LG) and  (Sol) to locomotor recovery after spinal transection and locomotor training. We compared kinematics and muscle activity at different slopes (±10° and ±25°) in spinalized cats (n=8) trained to walk on a flat treadmill. Half of those animals had their right hindlimb LG/Sol nerve cut and re-attached prior to spinal transection and locomotor training, a procedure called muscle self-reinnervation that leads to elimination of autogenic monosynaptic length feedback in spinal intact animals. All spinal animals trained on a flat surface were able to walk on slopes with minimal differences in walking kinematics and muscle activity between animals with/without LG/Sol self-reinnervation. We found minimal changes in kinematics and muscle activity at lower slopes (±10°), indicating that walking patterns obtained on flat are robust enough to accommodate low slopes. Contrary to results in spinal intact animals, force responses to muscle stretch largely returned in both self-re-innervated muscles for the trained spinalized animals. Overall our results indicate that the locomotor patterns acquired with training on a level surface transfer to walking on low slopes and that spinalization may allow the recovery of autogenic monosynaptic length feedback following muscle self-reinnervation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698206>Maternal employment and childcare during infancy and childhood overweight.</a></h1><p>This paper examines the joint impact of maternal employment and childcare during infancy on childhood  at ages three and five in the context of weak social support for early childhood care and education.Using three waves of longitudinal data from the Growing-Up in Ireland survey (n = 8,393 age three, n = 8,039 age five), propensity score matching is used to address the endogeneity of employment and childcare decisions. Selection on observables is used to assess potential bias arising from selection on unobservables whereby unobserved characteristics of the mother or child may jointly influence child  and maternal employment and childcare.Full-time maternal employment at nine months combined with either formal or informal childcare increases the likelihood of being overweight at three years by 8.1% and 5.9% respectively, but only for children of highly educated mothers. Similar results are observed for part-time employment coupled with informal (7.5%) or parental (8.0%) care. The results for mothers with lower levels of education are either not significant or favourable. While the majority of the effects dissipate by age five, there is some evidence that full-time maternal employment coupled with informal care increases the risk of being overweight at both ages three and five for children of higher-educated mothers. An assessment of selection bias finds that the estimates of full-time employment combined with formal childcare by well-educated mothers are a lower bound, such that the true effect on child  may be understated.The findings for Ireland are consistent with studies from the United States and the United Kingdom, and are in contrast to findings from the rest of Europe, suggesting the role of institutional factors, such as the lack of subsidised, universal, high-quality childcare.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Triplicate groups of Nile tilapia (initial  24.1 ± 2.6 g) were fed with either of four diets (Diets 1 to 4) designed to contain 0, 20, 200 and 2000 μg AFB kg diets for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks of AFB exposure, growth was significantly (0.05) different between the control and the AFB exposed treatments in both sexes. No significant differences were observed in 17β-oestradiol, absolute fecundity, oocytes volume and diameters between AFB exposure groups and the control group. However, we observed a significant reduction in relative fecundity and gonad somatic index (GSI) in females fed 2000 μg AFB kg diet. On the other hand, we observed significant differences (0.05) in gonadosomatic index (GSI), testosterone, milt count and motility between males in the control group and AFB treatments. We conclude that rearing Nile tilapia with aflatoxin-contaminated diets for a prolonged period affects milt quality, fecundity (at higher doses) and growth performance. This implies that for optimal seed production, provision of aflatoxin free diets should be part of the management practices in Nile tilapia hatcheries.© 2019 The Author(s).

Dehydrated children aged 6 to 60 months with ≥1 diarrheal (ie, loose or liquid) stool and ≥1 vomiting episode within the preceding 4 hours were eligible to participate. Participants received a single -based dose of oral ondansetron (8-15 kg: 2 mg; >15 kg: 4 mg) or identical placebo. The primary outcome was intravenous administration of ≥20 mL/kg over 4 hours of an isotonic fluid within 72 hours of random assignment.All 918 (100%) randomly assigned children completed follow-up. Intravenous rehydration was administered to 14.7% (68 of 462) and 19.5% (89 of 456) of those administered ondansetron and placebo, respectively (difference: -4.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.7% to 0.0%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for other antiemetic agents, antibiotics, zinc, and the number of vomiting episodes in the preceding 24 hours, children administered ondansetron had lower odds of the primary outcome (odds ratio: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.00). Fewer children in the ondansetron, relative to the placebo group vomited during the observation period (difference: -12.9%; 95% CI, -18.0% to -7.8%). The median number of vomiting episodes ( < .001) was lower in the ondansetron group.Among children with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting and dehydration, oral ondansetron administration reduced vomiting and intravenous rehydration use. Ondansetron use may be considered to promote oral rehydration therapy success among dehydrated children in low- and middle-income countries.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694560>Non-adherence to Haemodialysis, Interdialytic  gain and cardiovascular mortality: a cohort study.</a></h1><p>Patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) on haemodialysis (HD) have high morbidity and mortality rates, which are also due to the inherent risks associated with nephropathy. Non-adherence (NA) to the different demands of the treatment can have consequences for the outcome of patients undergoing HD; nevertheless, there are still doubts about such repercussions. This study was conducted to evaluate the association between NA to conventional HD and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.We prospectively evaluated mortality in a 6-year period in a cohort of 255 patients on HD in northeast Brazil. The evaluated parameters of NA to HD were interdialytic  gain (IDWG) ≥ 4% of dry  (DW), hyperphosphatemia and regular attendance at treatment, assessed as the correlation between the periods on HD completed and those prescribed. We used the Cox multivariate regression model to analyse survival and the predictors of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.With a median follow-up period of 1493 days and a mortality rate of 9.1 per 100 people-years, there were 87 deaths, of which 54% were cardiovascular deaths. IDWG ≥4% of DW was associated with a risk of all-cause mortality however presenting a borderline outcome for cardiovascular mortality, with hazard ratios of 2.02 (CI 95% 1.17-3.49, p = 0.012) and 2.09 (CI 95% 1.01-4.35, p = 0.047), respectively. No significant association was found between other parameters of NA and mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that for patients with IDWG ≥4% of DW, malnutrition, age and diagnosis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were associated with higher all-cause mortality.IDWG ≥4% of DW was identified as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and demonstrated a borderline outcome for cardiovascular mortality in patients on conventional HD. The occurrence of excessive IDWG in the presence of malnutrition represented a significant increase in the risk of death, indicating a subgroup of patients with a worse prognosis.</p></html>
