<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098796>Updates to IEC/AAMI ECG standards, a new hybrid standard.</a></h2><p>The current set of IEC particular standards that pertain to electrocardiograph (ECG) devices, namely, 60601-2-25, 60601-2-27, and 60601-2-47, which define requirements and testing for the essential performance and basic safety of diagnostic ECG, ECG monitoring and ambulatory ECG systems, respectively. These standards have been harmonized with the corresponding AAMI standards, namely EC11, EC13 and EC38. Together these standards have been in existence for decades and have evolved separately even though the technology used in these three clinical applications is very similar. A work proposal was initiated in the ISO/IEC Joint Work Group 22 (JWG22), which over sees the revision of these standards, to update the standards by creating a single new hybrid standard. The goal of this work is a joint endeavor between ISO and IEC to combine the three separate particular standards that cover ECG device and to harmonize the similar requirements that are common across all three types of devices into one set of general requirements. The requirements that separate specific to meeting the intended use and essential performance for each of the 3 types of devices (diagnostic, patient monitoring, and ambulatory ECG recording) will continue to remain as separate requirements. Furthermore, manufactures of ECG devices have also been required to meet standards for disposable electrodes (AAMI EC12), ECG cables and leadwires (AAMI EC53), and arrhythmia analysis performance reporting (AAMI EC57). In addition to the primary goal, a secondary goal for the JW22 work is to also incorporate these three AAMI standards into the ECG hybrid standard. This paper describes the work being done and highlights key updates, and explains the rationale for approaches and changes being made. The Joint Work Group is currently in the process of updating the committee draft of the new hybrid standard before requesting comments from National Standard Committees participating in JWG22.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In that study four sward types were investigated: a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) only sward receiving 163 kg nitrogen per hectare per year (N/ha/yr) (PRG); a perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens) sward receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (PRGWC); a six species sward (two grasses (perennial ryegrass and timothy (Phleum pratense)), two legumes (white and red clover (Trifolium pratense)) and two herbs (ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and chicory (Cichorium intybus)) receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (); and a nine species sward containing cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), greater birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus pedunculatus) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium) in addition to the six species listed above, receiving 90 kg N/ha/yr (9S). Each sward type was managed as a separate farmlet and stocked with 30 twin-rearing ewes at a stocking rate of 12.5 ewes/ha under rotational grazing management from turnout post-lambing until housing. Lamb live  was recorded fortnightly and lambs were drafted for slaughter at 45 kg. Ewe live  and  condition score (BCS) were recorded on five occasions annually. Lamb faecal egg count (FEC) was recorded fortnightly and lambs were treated with anthelmintics when mean lamb FEC per sward type was above 400 eggs per gram. Ewes grazing the  and 9S swards had heavier (P &lt; 0.01) live  and BCS throughout the study than the ewes grazing the PRG sward. Lambs grazing the  sward were heavier than lambs grazing all other sward types of 14 weeks old (P &lt; 0.05). Lambs grazing the PRG sward required more days to reach slaughter  than lambs grazing all other sward types (P &lt; 0.001). Lambs grazing the  and 9S swards required fewer anthelmintic treatments than lambs grazing the PRG or PRGWC swards. In conclusion, grazing multispecies swards improved ewe and lamb performance and reduced the requirement for chemical anthelmintics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523746>Cartridge-Based Thromboelastography Can Be Used to Monitor and Quantify the Activity of Unfractionated and Low-Molecular- Heparins.</a></h2><p>Thromboelastography is increasingly utilized in the management of bleeding and thrombotic complications where heparin management remains a cornerstone. This study assessed the feasibility of the cartridge-based TEG   system (Haemonetics Corp., Braintree, Massachusetts, United States) to monitor and quantify the effect of unfractionated and low-molecular- heparin (UFH and LMWH). Blood samples from healthy donors were spiked with UFH (   = 23; 0-1.0 IU/mL) or LMWH (enoxaparin;   = 22; 0-1.5 IU/mL). Functional fibrinogen maximum amplitude (CFF.MA), RapidTEG activated clotting time (CRT.ACT), and kaolin and kaolin with heparinase reaction time (CK.R and CKH.R) were evaluated for their correlation with heparin concentrations, as well as the combination parameters ΔCK.R - CKH.R, ratio CK.R/CKH.R, and ratio CKH.R/CK.R. Nonlinear mixed-effect modelling was used to study the relationship between concentrations and parameters, and Bayesian classification modelling for the prediction of therapeutic ranges. CK.R and CRT.ACT strongly correlated with the activity of LMWH and UFH (   < 0.001). Using combination parameters, heparin activity could be accurately quantified in the range of 0.05 to 0.8 IU/mL for UFH and 0.1 to 1.5 IU/mL for LMWH. CRT.ACT was able to quantify heparin activity at higher concentrations but was only different from the reference range (   < 0.05) at >0.5 IU/mL for UFH and >1.5 IU/mL for LMWH. Combination parameters classified blood samples into subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic heparin ranges, with an accuracy of >90% for UFH, and >78% for LMWH. This study suggests that TEG  can effectively monitor and quantify heparin activity for LMWH and UFH. Additionally, combination parameters can be used to classify blood samples into therapeutic ranges based on heparin activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205240>RSV, Antibodies and the Developing World.</a></h2><p>Respiratory syncytial virus remains a major cause of infantile respiratory illness globally.

We present a 2 direction (2D) accelerated MP2RAGE, which provides an increased flip angle while maintaining similar dynamic recovery as 1D accelerated MP2RAGE.Simulations were conducted to optimize 2D accelerated MP2RAGE parameters and healthy subjects were scanned with 1D and 2D accelerated MP2RAGE at 7T. Images were compared visually and contrast to noise (CNR) between brain tissues was measured.Simulations showed that CNR is primarly determined by the TR, followed by the number of the first partition encoding steps in MP2RAGE. Keeping TR constant, a smaller number of partition encoding steps increases the achievable maximal CNR. In-vivo 2D MP2RAGE improves CNR between white and gray matters by 9% when compared to 1D accelerated MP2RAGE with identical voxel size.We presented 2D accelated MP2RAGE at 7T with the increased flip angle. We show that this leads to CNR improvement, and consequently a reduction of scan time to be compared to 1D accelerated MP2RAGE.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Subjects ingested a beverage (7 mL·kg ) containing 25 ppm phenol red as quickly as possible (≤1.0 min), and subsequent gastric and blood samples were collected every 10 min for 40 min. A linear regression and a repeated- ANOVA were used for statistical analysis.The gastric secretion volume was not significantly different among beverages across time. Gastric residual beverage volume (GRBV) at each sampling time point was not different among 2S, 4S, , 8S, and water (P > 0.05). The 8G resulted in a significantly greater GRBV compared with other beverages at 20, 30, and 40 min (P < 0.05). GRBV from 6G was significantly higher than 2G at 30 min, but no other statistical differences were found among W, 2G, 4G, and 6G. The 8S had a greater GRBV compared with W at 40 min (P < 0.05). Mean gastric osmolality positively correlated to mean GRBV (r = 0.93). Gastric emptying rate was negatively correlated to the calories emptied (r = 0.84) with a greater effect from glucose beverages compared with sucrose beverages.These data suggest that glucose exerts a stronger inhibitory stimulus compared with sucrose on gastric emptying and that a physiological threshold exists for the combined influence of glucose concentration and beverage osmolality to trigger the feedback inhibition of gastric emptying.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935293>Frequent sit-to-stand transitions and several short standing periods measured by hip-worn accelerometer are associated with smaller waist circumference among adults.</a></h2><p>This cross-sectional study analysed the association of sedentary behaviour (SB) and standing with waist circumference. Finnish adults aged 30-75 years from a sub-sample of population-based Health 2011 Study used a hip-worn tri-axial accelerometer (Hookie AM20, Traxmeet, Ltd, Espoo, Finland) for seven days. Those 1405 participants (57% women) who used accelerometer at least four days, minimum of 10 hours/day, were included. SB and standing were analysed in  epochs using validated algorithm. Daily total time, daily number and accumulated time from bouts (30s-5min,30s-10min,30s-15min,30s 30min,>5min,>10min,>15min, >30min) as well as daily number of sit-to-stand transitions were determined. Waist circumference (cm) was measured in standardized way. Participants' mean age was 52 years (SD 12.2). Mean waist circumference was 97cm (SD 12.3) in men and 87cm (SD 12.7) in women. According to multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis, sit-to-stand transitions [standardised regression coefficient (β)= -0.14, 95%CI -0.20 to -0.09], standing bouts of 30s-5min (β= -0.21, 95%CI -0.26 to -0.15) and number of 30s-30min SB bouts (β=0.12, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.17) were most strongly associated with waist circumference. Besides assessing total SB time, future studies should assess also different bout lengths of SB and sit-to-stand transitions and standing times should be assessed separately.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697074>Repair of Bimalleolar Ankle Fracture.</a></h2><p>The incidence of ankle fractures is rapidly increasing in geriatric populations. Of the 4 fracture patterns described by the Lauge-Hansen classification system, supination-external rotation (SER) accounts for most ankle fractures. This video demonstrates surgical repair of a SER type 4 ankle fracture in a geriatric patient.SER type 4 ankle fractures are considered unstable and are generally treated with surgical fixation. After placement of plate and screws, intraoperative stress tests can be used to assess for syndesmotic widening. If necessary, the syndesmosis can be reduced open, with screw fixation placed parallel to the joint. Patients are kept non--bearing for 6 weeks after surgery.This video, shot on an iPhone , shows the case of a 66-year-old female status after a fall with twisting mechanism resulting in an unstable SER type 4 fracture requiring operative repair. Intraoperative stress test revealed medial clear space widening requiring syndesmotic reduction.SER type 4 ankle fractures are a common injury that must be properly managed to return patients to baseline functional status. The surgical technique described in this video provides for good stabilization and allows for early range of motion with advancement to -bearing as tolerated at 6 weeks postoperatively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29428503>The Athletic Skills Track: Age- and gender-related normative values of a motor skills test for 4- to 12-year-old children.</a></h2><p>The aim of the presented study is to provide age- and gender-related normative values and MQ values for a motor skills test, the Athletic Skills Track, among 4- to 12-year-old children.Cross-sectional.In 2016, a total of 7977 Dutch children, 4036 boys (mean age 8.6 years, SD 2.1) and 3941 girls (mean age 8.6 years, SD 2.1), performed an age-related version of the Athletic Skills Track (AST). The AST is a track consisting of 5-7 fundamental movement skill tasks that should be completed as fast as possible. The children performed the test during a regular physical education (PE) lesson under the supervision of their own PE teacher. For each version of the AST (AST-1: n=917; AST-2: n=3947; AST-3: n=3213) age- and gender-related reference centiles were derived from the gathered data using the Lambda, Mu, Sigma (LMS) method.All children completed the AST within 60s (mean 29., SD 7.7). An independent samples t-test showed that boys were significantly faster in completing the track than girls, except for the 4-year-old boys. Therefore, age- and gender-related reference centiles were derived. The reference curves demonstrate an almost linear decrease in time to complete AST-1 and AST-2 with increasing age.The present study provides age- and gender-related normative values and MQ values for the AST among 4- to 12-year-old Dutch children. With these normative values PE teachers can interpret children's performance on the AST.Copyright © 2018 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We recently reported novel pyridine-2(1H)-ones as aliphatic amine-free MCHR1 antagonists that structurally featured an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-based bicyclic motif. To investigate imidazopyridine variants with lower basicity and less potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), we designed pyridine-2(1H)-ones bearing various less basic bicyclic motifs. Among these, a lead compound 6a bearing a 1H-benzimidazole motif showed comparable binding affinity to MCHR1 to the corresponding imidazopyridine derivative 1. Optimization of 6a afforded a series of potent thiophene derivatives (6q-u); however, most of these were found to cause time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4. As bioactivation of thiophenes to form sulfoxide or epoxide species was considered to be a major cause of CYP3A4 TDI, we introduced electron withdrawing groups on the thiophene and found that a CF3 group on the ring or a Cl adjacent to the sulfur atom helped prevent CYP3A4 TDI. Consequently, 4-[(5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)methoxy]-1-(2-cyclopropyl-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-6-yl)pyridin-2(1H)-one () was identified as a potent MCHR1 antagonist without the risk of CYP3A4 TDI, which exhibited a promising safety profile including low CYP3A4 inhibition and exerted significant antiobesity effects in diet-induced obese F344 rats.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparisons were made with results obtained with a laboratory-based computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system.None.Sperm concentration; sperm motility.Sperm concentration counted with a ball lens and each smartphone showed a very strong correlation with the CASA results. Likewise, sperm motility calculated with our device showed significant correlations to CASA. If eight spermatozoa or fewer were found on the field of view of an iPhone , the semen specimens were considered to be below the lower reference limit for sperm concentration of World Health Organization 2010 guidelines (15 × 10(6) spermatozoa/mL). The sensitivity was 87.5%, and specificity was 90.9%.Smartphones have great potential to analyze semen because they are portable, contain excellent digital cameras, and can be easily attached to a microscope. A single-ball lens microscope is inexpensive and easy to use for acquiring digital microscopic movies. Given its small size and , the device can support testing for male fertility at home or in the field, making it much more convenient and economical than current practice.

The therapeutic properties of GAGs are related to their ability to interact with proteins, which is very much influenced by sulfation position and patterns. Since currently GAGs cannot be chemically synthesized, they are sourced from natural products, with high intra- but also inter-species variability, in terms of chain length, disaccharide composition and sulfation pattern. Consequently, sulfated GAGs are the most interesting molecules in the marine environment and constitute the focus of the present review. In particular, chondroitin sulfate (CS) appears as the most promising compound. CS-E chains [GlcA-GalNAc(4S,)] extracted from squid possess antiviral and anti-metastatic activities and seem to impart signalling properties and improve the mechanical performance of cartilage engineering constructs; Squid CS-E and octopus CS-K [GlcA(3S)-GalNAc(4S)], dermatan sulfate (DS) from sea squirts [-iK units, IdoA(3S)-GalNAc(4S)] and sea urchins [-iE units, IdoA-GalNAc(4S,)] and hybrids CS/DS from sharks (-B/iB [GlcA/IdoA(2S)-GalNAc(4S)], -D/iD [GlcA/IdoA(2S)-GalNAc()] and -E/iE units [GlcA/IdoA-GalNAc(4S,)]) promote neurite outgrowth and could be valuable materials for nerve regeneration. Also displaying antiviral and anti-metastatic properties, a rare CS with fucosylated branches isolated from sea cucumbers is an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agent. In this same line, marine heparin extracted from shrimp and sea squirt has proven anti-inflammatory properties, with the added advantage of decreased risk of bleeding because of its low anticoagulant activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Specific sulfation pattern, termed as sulfation code plays critical roles in regulating the binding mode between GAG and proteins. As a structural analogue of chondroitin sulfate (CS), sHA bears much higher molecular  and is nearly free of other proteoglycan contaminants. These properties make sHA a better bioscaffold to build safer and more functionalized material. However, chemical sulfonation process on naked HA polysaccharide produces random sulfation patterns which makes it difficult in disclosing the SAR. Herein, we utilized sHA and CS oligosaccharides with defined sulfation pattern to unravel the SAR between sHA and neurogenesis. We demonstrate sHA tetrasaccharide bearing 6-O-sulfation (sHA-) but not other sulfation patterns bind to growth factors at nanomolar range and promote the neurite outgrowth of rat E18 hippocampal neurons in vitro. Furthermore, synthetic sHA polysaccharide enriched in 6-O-sulfation also promote the hippocampal neurite outgrowth in vitro. Our work provides an effective method to disclose the bioactive sulfation pattern of sHA. Our results indicate that a specific sHA sulfation pattern could direct important physiological processes and open the way for the application of sHA- in neuroscience and medicine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The first true point-of-care TEG, the TEG6s system, uses resonance-frequency viscoelasticity measurements and a disposable multi-channel microfluidic cartridge to assess hemostasis and response to antiplatelet therapy. TEG assays (n = 5,100) were performed on the blood of healthy volunteers (n = 157) and patients undergoing coronary revascularization at three hospitals (n = 300). The results from the TEG6s were compared with the conventional TEG5000 in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and FDA recommendations. Precision testing was conducted using blood from healthy donors, all assays were run for 5 consecutive days in duplicate using multiple operators, lots, and instruments. Reference ranges were comparable between the TEG systems. Deming regression analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between the two systems for the standard hemostasis tests (R r = 0.932, MA r = 0.972, LY30 r = 0.938). Method comparison analysis showed an acceptable agreement between PlateletMapping (PM) assays for measuring arachidonic acid (indicator of aspirin response)- and adenosine diphosphate (indicator of P2Y inhibitor response)-induced platelet aggregation (total agreement = 90%, and 72%, respectively). TEG6s precision testing yielded low variability (CV 0-13%) in all . The new point-of-care TEG6s is associated with greater ease of use than the TEG5000 and provides precise results. The results correlated between methods for all variables.

Patients with chronic liver disease can have comorbidities that limit their ability to breath-hold (BH) for the required acquisition time. Our aim was to evaluate whether stiffness measurements obtained from a navigator-triggered MRE acquisition are comparable to standard expiratory breath-hold, inspiratory breath-hold or free-breathing in healthy participants.Twelve healthy participants were imaged using the four methods on a clinical 1.5T MR system equipped with a product MRE system. Mean liver stiffness, and measurable area of stiffness (with a confidence threshold >95%) were compared between sequences using the concordance correlation coefficient. Repeatability of each sequence between two acquisitions was also assessed.The standard BH expiratory technique had high concordance with the navigated technique (r=0.716), and low concordance with the BH inspiration (r=0.165) and free-breathing (r=0.105) techniques. The navigator-triggered technique showed no statistical difference in measurable area of liver or in repeatability compared with the standard expiratory acquisition (p=0.997 and p=0.407 respectively). The free-breathing technique produced less measurable liver area and was less repeatable than the alternative techniques. The increase in acquisition time for navigator techniques was 3min  compared to standard expiratory breath-hold.Navigator-based hepatic MRE measurements are comparable to the reference standard expiratory breath-hold acquisition in healthy participants.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Their diagnostic and therapeutic management remains a challenge. A nationwide survey was conducted among 13 of the largest pediatric units in the United Kingdom, to obtain insight in the current management of IFD in neonates and children. All responding centers were tertiary teaching centers. The use of fungal diagnostic tools and imaging modalities varied among centers. Antifungal prophylaxis was prescribed in most centers for extreme-low birth  (LBW) infants and high-risk hemato-oncologic patients, but with a huge variety in antifungals given. An empirical treatment was favored by most centers in case of febrile neutropenia. First line therapy for candidemia consists of either fluconazole or liposomal amphotericin B, with voriconazole being first-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Disseminated invasive aspergillosis was most often mentioned as a reason to prescribe combination antifungal therapy. In conclusion, this survey reinforces the fact that there are still important aspects in the management of pediatric IFD which should ideally be addressed in pediatric clinical trials.

Speech processing relies heavily on the integration of auditory and visual information, and it has been suggested that the ability to detect correspondence between auditory and visual signals helps to lay the foundation for successful language development. The goal of the present study was to examine whether young children with ASD show reduced sensitivity to temporal asynchronies in a speech processing task when compared to typically developing controls, and to examine how this sensitivity might relate to language proficiency. Using automated eye tracking methods, we found that children with ASD failed to demonstrate sensitivity to asynchronies of 0.3s, 0., or 1.0s between a video of a woman speaking and the corresponding audio track. In contrast, typically developing children who were language-matched to the ASD group, were sensitive to both 0. and 1.0s asynchronies. We also demonstrated that individual differences in sensitivity to audiovisual asynchronies and individual differences in orientation to relevant facial features were both correlated with scores on a standardized measure of language abilities. Results are discussed in the context of attention to visual language and audio-visual processing as potential precursors to language impairment in ASD. Autism Res 2018, 11: 645-653. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Speech processing relies heavily on the integration of auditory and visual information, and it has been suggested that the ability to detect correspondence between auditory and visual signals helps to lay the foundation for successful language development. The goal of the present study was to explore whether children with ASD process audio-visual synchrony in ways comparable to their typically developing peers, and the relationship between preference for synchrony and language ability. Results showed that there are differences in attention to audiovisual synchrony between typically developing children and children with ASD. Preference for synchrony was related to the language abilities of children across groups.© 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25196633>Growth restriction, leptin, and the programming of adult behavior in mice.</a></h2><p>Prematurity and neonatal growth restriction (GR) are risk factors for autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Leptin production is suppressed during periods of undernutrition, and we have shown that isolated neonatal leptin deficiency leads to adult hyperactivity while neonatal leptin supplementation normalizes the brain morphology of GR mice. We hypothesized that neonatal leptin would prevent the development of GR-associated behavioral abnormalities. From postnatal day 4-14, C57BL/6 mice were randomized to daily injections of saline or leptin (80ng/g), and GR was identified by a weanling  below the tenth percentile. The behavioral phenotypes of GR and control mice were assessed beginning at 4 months. Within the tripartite chamber, GR mice had significantly impaired social interaction. Baseline escape times from the Barnes maze were faster for GR mice (65+/- vs 87+/-7s for controls, p<0.05), but GR mice exhibited regression in their escape times on days 2 and 3 (56% regressed vs 22% of control saline mice, p<0.05). Compared to controls, GR mice entered the open arms of the elevated plus maze more often and stayed there longer (72+/-10s vs 36+/-5s, p<0.01). Neonatal leptin supplementation normalized the behavior of GR mice across all behavioral assays. In conclusion, GR alters the social interactions, learning and activity of mice, and supplementation with the neurotrophic hormone leptin mitigates these effects. We speculate neonatal leptin deficiency may contribute to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with postnatal growth restriction, and postnatal leptin therapy may be protective.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Only certain particular drowsy/distracted driving behaviors have been studied by previous studies, which are mainly based on dedicated sensor devices such as bio and visual sensors. The objective of this study is to extract the common features for identifying drowsy/distracted driving through a set of common vehicle motion parameters. An intelligent vehicle was used to collect vehicle motion parameters. Fifty licensed drivers (37 males and 13 females, M=32.5 years, SD=6.2) were recruited to carry out road experiments in Wuhan, China and collecting vehicle motion data under four driving scenarios including talking, watching roadside, drinking and under the influence of drowsiness. For the first scenario, the drivers were exposed to a set of questions and asked to repeat a few sentences that had been proved valid in inducing driving distraction. Watching roadside, drinking and driving under drowsiness were assessed by an observer and self-reporting from the drivers. The common features of vehicle motions under four types of drowsy/distracted driving were analyzed using descriptive statistics and then Wilcoxon rank sum test. The results indicated that there was a significant difference of lateral acceleration rates and yaw rate acceleration between "normal driving" and drowsy/distracted driving. Study results also shown that, under drowsy/distracted driving, the lateral acceleration rates and yaw rate acceleration were significantly larger from the normal driving. The lateral acceleration rates were shown to suddenly increase or decrease by more than 2.0m/s(3) and the yaw rate acceleration by more than 2.5°/s(2). The standard deviation of acceleration rate (SDA) and standard deviation of yaw rate acceleration (SDY) were identified to as the common features of vehicle motion for distinguishing the drowsy/distracted driving from the normal driving. In order to identify a time window for effectively extracting the two common features, a double-window method was used and the optimized "Parent Window" and "Child Window" were found to be 55s and , respectively. The study results can be used to develop a driving assistant system, which can warn drivers when any one of the four types of drowsy/distracted driving is detected.Copyright © 2015.

Among these, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate, side chains of PGs, are widely distributed in animal kingdom and show structural variations, such as sulfation patterns and degree of epimerization, which are responsible for their physiological functions through interactions with growth factors, chemokines and adhesion molecules. However, structural changes in CS, particularly the ratio of 4--sulfation to 6--sulfation (4S/) and CS chain length that occur during the aging process, are not fully understood. We found that 4S/ ratio and molecular  of CS were decreased in polyamine-depleted cells. In addition, decreased levels of chondroitin synthase 1 (CHSY1) and chondroitin 4--sulfotransferase 2 proteins were also observed on polyamine depletion. Interestingly, the translation initiation of CHSY1 was suppressed by a highly structured sequence (positions -202 to -117 relative to the initiation codon) containing RNA G-quadruplex (G4) structures in 5'-untranslated region. The formation of the G4s was influenced by the neighboring sequences to the G4s and polyamine stimulation of CHSY1 synthesis disappeared when the formation of the G4s was inhibited by site-directed mutagenesis. These results suggest that the destabilization of G4 structures by polyamines stimulates CHSY1 synthesis and, at least in part, contribute to the maturation of CS chains.© 2018 The Author(s).

For a majority of techniques, the most common long-term complication is pseudoptosis. It has previously been proposed that upper breast suspensory ligaments (SL) are weaker than lower breast SL. We tested this hypothesis through anthropometry of the proxies for upper and lower SL strength: the sternal notch-nipple (SN-N) distance and the nipple-inframammary fold (N-IMF) distance, respectively.An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty in an academic faculty practice between 2008 and 2015 was conducted. Patient demographics included age, race, and  mass index (BMI); patient comorbidities included smoking status, diabetes, and hypertension. Breast anthropometric measurements included SN-N and N-IMF. Sternal notch-nipple was used as the primary metric of the upper SL strength, whereas N-IMF was used as the primary metric of the lower SL strength. Intraoperative details included reduction technique and resection mass. Postoperative complications were recorded, including nipple areola complex necrosis and hematoma. Linear regression analysis was performed with the primary endpoint of the relationship between SN-N and N-IMF distance in macromastia.Data from 208 patients, totaling 400 individual breast measurements, were collected. The mean SN-N length was 35.1 cm, mean N-IMF length was 16.0 cm, and mean resection  was 1094 g. Linear regression found that N-IMF distance could be predicted as 45% of the SN-N distance (N-IMF = 0.454 * SN-N). This was a strong relationship, demonstrated by univariate analysis of SN-N and N-IMF (R, 0.624; P < 0.001). A Wise pattern was used in 89.9% of cases; an inferior pedicle was used in 83.7% of cases. Nipple areola complex necrosis occurred in 15 breasts (3.75%). Sternal notch-nipple (R, 0.127; P = 0.011) and N-IMF (R, 0.119; P = 0.017) were both predictive of nipple areola complex necrosis (Table 4).In our series, the N-IMF distance increased 0.45 cm for every 1 cm increase in the SN-N distance. This relationship strengthens our primary hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. Taking this into consideration, we suggest that surgeons seeking to minimize pseudoptosis rates should favor techniques that minimally disrupt the lower SL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28156029>Cationic imprinting of Pb(II) within composite networks based on bovine or fish chondroitin sulfate.</a></h2><p>Imprinting chondroitin sulfate (CS)/silica composites with Pb(II) and Cu(II) cations was explored with CS of bovine and different fish species origin. The process was based on the assumption that particular arrangements of the linear CS chains in aqueous solution, induced so as to accommodate cross complexation with the cations, would be embodied into a tridimensional matrix created through an organoalkoxysilane sol-gel scheme. The presence of Cu(II) in the synthesis of the composites did not result in the production of significantly stronger Cu(II)-oriented binding arrangements, and therefore, the imprinting was not successful. Inversely, for Pb(II), the materials obtained exhibited a "memory" effect for the Pb(II) ions, expressed in the observation of stronger (13%-44%) binding as compared to the nonimprinted counterparts, and increased selectivity (1.5-2 folds) against Cd(II). The imprinting features observed were dependent on the CS source. However, it was not possible to identify, among a set of their properties (carboxylate and sulfate abundance, percent of disulfated units, 4S/ ratio, and molecular ), any that correlated directly with the observed imprinting features. The augmented selectivity provided by the cation-imprinting process may be advantageous in areas such as analytical separation, remediation, purification, sensing, and others, particularly in those cases where a certain cation is of special interest within a mixture of them.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27987932>By-products of Scyliorhinus canicula, Prionace glauca and Raja clavata: A valuable source of predominantly  sulfated chondroitin sulfate.</a></h2><p>Chondroitin sulfate (CS) was isolated from Scyliorhinus canicula (fin, head and skeleton), Prionace glauca (head), and Raja clavata (skeleton) by-products from fish processing industry using environmentally friendly processes.

Miniaturization has allowed the design of small, compact monitoring systems that can record physiological signals over longer periods of time. Thus, the potential for these devices to expand the understanding of disease progression and patients' clinical status is very high. The accuracy of these devices, however, is dependent upon the computer algorithms utilized in the analysis of the large volume of physiological data monitored and/or recorded by the devices. Automated interpretation of the data by these new technologies, therefore, necessitates closer examination by regulatory organizations. The current requirements for the validation of novel Ambulatory ECG (A-ECG) annotation algorithms are based on the AAMI/ANSI-EC57 and IEC60601-2-47 Standard. These standards are being updated, but they rely on a very limited set of digitized ECG recordings from a couple of ECG databases built in the first half of the 70's. These reference signals are obsolete. We are developing a validation tool for computerized methods designed to detect and monitor cardiac activities based on -surface ECGs. We will rely on a set of existing digital high-resolution 12‑lead A-ECG recordings acquired in cardiac patients and healthy individuals. These ECG signals include a large and unique set of electrocardiographic events.

Practice patterns in pediatric resuscitation likely have changed as well; however, this evolution has not been quantified. We evaluated pediatric resuscitation practices over time within a combat trauma system.The Department of Defense Trauma Registry was queried from 2001 to 2013 for pediatric patients (<18 years). Patients with burns, drowning, and missing injury severity score were excluded. Volumes of crystalloid, packed red blood cells (PRBC), whole blood, plasma, and platelets (PLT) given in the first 24 hours were calculated per kilogram . Tranexamic acid use was also determined. Patients were divided into Early (2001-2005) and Late (2006-2013) cohorts, and subgroups of transfused (TX+) and massively transfused (MT+) patients were created. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay and 24-hour and in-hospital mortality rates were compared.A total of 4,358 patients met inclusion criteria. Comparing Early versus Late, injuries from explosions, isolated or predominant head injuries, and injury severity score all increased. The proportion of TX+ patients also increased significantly (13.6% vs 37.4%, p < 0.001) as did the number of MT+ patients (2.1% vs 15.5%, p < 0.001). Transfusion of high plasma:RBC and PLT:RBC ratios increased in both the TX+ and MT+ subgroups, although overall, PLT and whole blood use was low. After adjusting for differences between groups, the odds of death was no different Early versus Late but decreased significantly in the MT+ patients with time as a continuous variable.Transfusion practice in pediatric combat casualty care shifted toward a more hemostatic approach over time. All-cause mortality was low and remained stable overall and even decreased in MT+ patients despite more injuries due to explosions, more head injuries, and greater injury severity.

Fish maws (the dried swim bladders of fish) have been used over many centuries as traditional medicines, tonics and a luxurious gourmet food in China and Southeast Asia. Little is known about the structural information of polysaccharides comprising this important functional material of fish tissue. In the present study, the total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) from fish maw was characterized. Two GAGs were identified, chondroitin sulfate (CS, having a molecular  of 18-40 kDa) and heparan sulfate (HS), corresponding to 95% and 5% of the total GAG, respectively. Chondroitinase digestion showed that the major CS GAG was composed of ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc4S (59.7%), ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc4, (36.5%), ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc6S (2.2%) and ΔUA-1 → 3-GalNAc (1.6%) disaccharide units.

Retention index has been approved to be helpful for compound identification in one-dimensional gas chromatography, which is also true for two-dimensional gas chromatography. In this work, a novel regression model was proposed for calculating the second dimension retention index of target components where n-alkanes were used as reference compounds. This model was developed to depict the relationship among adjusted second dimension retention time, temperature of the second dimension column and carbon number of n-alkanes by an exponential nonlinear function with only five parameters. Three different criteria were introduced to find the optimal values of parameters. The performance of this model was evaluated using experimental data of n-alkanes (C7-C31) at 24 temperatures which can cover all 0- adjusted retention time area. The experimental results show that the mean relative error between predicted adjusted retention time and experimental data of n-alkanes was only 2%. Furthermore, our proposed model demonstrates a good extrapolation capability for predicting adjusted retention time of target compounds which located out of the range of the reference compounds in the second dimension adjusted retention time space. Our work shows the deviation was less than 9 retention index units (iu) while the number of alkanes were added up to 5. The performance of our proposed model has also been demonstrated by analyzing a mixture of compounds in temperature programmed experiments.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An experimental investigation of the pathogenesis in mice.</a></h2><p>Moderate mechanical stress generated by normal joint loading and movement is essential for the maintenance of healthy articular cartilage. However, the effects of reduced loading caused by the absence of  bearing or joint motion on articular cartilage and subchondral bone is still poorly understood. We aimed to characterize morphological and metabolic responses of articular cartilage and subchondral bone to decreased mechanical stress in vivo.Mice were subjected to periods of hindlimb unloading by tail suspension or external fixation of the knee joints. The articular surface was observed with digital microscope and the epiphyseal bone was assessed by micro-CT analysis. Articular cartilage and subchondral bone were further evaluated by histomorphometric, histochemical, and immunohistochemical analyses.The joint surface was intact, but thickness of both the total and uncalcified layer of articular cartilage were decreased both after joint unloading and immobilization. Subchondral bone atrophy with concomitant marrow expansion predisposed osteoclast activity at bone surface to invade into cartilaginous layer. Uncalcified cartilage showed decreased aggrecan content and increased aggrecanase expression. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was increased at uncalcified cartilage, whereas decreased at calcified cartilage. The distributions of hypertrophic chondrocyte markers remained unchanged.Thinning of articular cartilage induced by mechanical unloading may be mediated by metabolic changes in chondrocytes, including accelerated aggrecan catabolism and exquisitely modulated matrix mineralization, and cartilage matrix degradation and resorption by subchondral osteoclasts. Cartilage degeneration without chondrocyte hypertrophy under unloading condition indicate the possible existence of mechanism which is different from osteoarthritis pathogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

The objective of this study was to prepare different low molecular  chondroitin sulfates (LMWCSs) and to investigate the biological activity in anti-complement capacity. A series of LMWCSs was prepared from different sources and characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), size exclusion chromatography-multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Hemolytic, anti-complement 3 deposition capacity and cell viability assays were carried out to investigate the biological activities in vitro.

Although more patients in the augmented group had positive margins, this was not statistically significant (6 vs 3, P = 0.86). No difference was noted between re-excision rates among the augmented versus non-augmented groups (21.1% vs 19.6%, respectively; odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-2.37; P = 0.85); these remained unchanged even when adjusting for tumor stage (P = .75) and margins (P = 0.73). Although more patients in the augmented group recurred (4 vs 0), this was not statistically significant (P = 0.1).Our results indicate that, from the oncological standpoint, patients with prior augmentation can undergo lumpectomy with equivalent tumor margins and re-excision rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported comparative study between these 2 groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30041885>Effects of breast milk on pain severity during muscular injection of hepatitis B vaccine in neonates in a teaching hospital in Iran.</a></h2><p>Human breast milk is a natural pain reliever that contains endorphins. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of breast milk and powdered milk on pain severity after a muscular injection in 1-day-old neonates.One hundred neonates admitted to a teaching hospital in Ilam city, Iran, participated in a randomized clinical trial in 2016. One-day-old neonates were divided into four equal groups including: the control group (no feeding); the breastfed group; the bottle-fed mother's milk group and the powdered formula group. All infants received the hepatitis B vaccine by muscle injection in the same position of the thigh. The severity and duration of pain were compared among all groups during and after injection using the DAN scoring method (evaluation behavioral scale of acute pain in newborn infant).One hundred neonates (57% boys) participated in this study. The mean±SD age and  for participants were 39.15±0.05 weeks and 3016±28g, respectively. Crying duration either during or after the injection in breastfed infants was significantly shorter compared to the control and powdered formula groups (9.2±3.9 and 16±4. vs. 38.2±8.9 and 30.0±4.4s, respectively, during injection, P<0.003); (11.8±3.4 and 20.6±5.1s vs. 56.2±6.5 and 49.8±9., respectively, after injection, P<0.006). There was also a significant relationship between behavioral variations and pain during injection (P<0.0001).The results of this study showed that breastfeeding decreases pain severity during painful experiences in neonates, which is in accordance with other reports. Based on this finding, neonates are advised to be breastfed if a painful intervention such as vaccination is needed. The pain-relieving effect of breast milk could also be added to its other suitable effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This may be partially explained by variations in the concentration and spatial location of molecules within and in the vicinity of each cell.This paper introduces an agent-based model that represents single-molecule transport through the cellular envelope of Escherichia coli at the micrometre scale. This model enables broader observation of molecular transport throughout the different membrane layers and the study of the effect of molecular concentration in cellular noise. Simulations considered various low molecular  molecules, i.e. ampicillin, bosentan, coumarin, saquinavir, and terbutaline, and a gradient of molecular concentrations. The model ensured stochasticity in the location of the agents, using diffusing spherical particles with physical dimensions.Simulation results were validated against theoretical and experimental data. For example, theoretically, ampicillin molecules take 0.6 s to cross the entire cell envelope, and computational simulations took 0.68 s, 0.68 s, 0.70 s, and 0.69 s, for concentrations of 1.44 μM, 13.21 μM, 26.4 μM and 105.61 μM, respectively. Replicate standard deviation decreased with growing initial concentrations of the molecules. In turn, no clear relationship could be observed between molecular size and variability.This work presented a novel agent-based model to study the effect of the initial concentration of low molecular  molecules on cellular noise. Cellular noise during molecule diffusion was found to be concentration-dependent and size-independent. The new model holds considerable potential for future, more complex analyses, when emerging experimental data may enable modelling of membrane transport mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The cooperation of three structural chromophores, namely, Bi O OH short chains with  lone pair electrons, distorted TeO octahedra with d electrons, and π-conjugated [NO ] triangles, generates a new nitrate NLO material, Bi TeO OH(NO ) , which exhibits an enhanced phase-matchable NLO response of three times that of KH PO (3×KH PO ), exceeding those of most nitrate NLO materials. Remarkably, the new material did not show obvious  loss and degeneration of NLO response after being dipped in de-ionized water for 24 h, indicating that it is highly resistant to water. Theoretical calculations reveal that foreign water molecules cannot stably stay in the crystal lattice of Bi TeO OH(NO ) . These findings highlight the introduction of diverse chromophores into the nitrate systems as an effective approach for developing practical nitrate NLO materials that are of high water-resistance and good optical performance.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

CSE is involved in many biological and pathological processes. In this study, we established new monoclonal antibodies, termed E-12C and E-18H, by using CSE that contained more than 70% of E-units as an immunogen. These antibodies recognized CSE but not other CSs isomers or dermatan sulfate (DS). We evaluated the reactivities of the antibodies to 6-O-sulfated CSA (-CSA) and DS (-DS) that possessed ∼ 60% of GalNAc (4S, ) moieties in their structures. Neither of the antibodies reacted with -DS. The antibodies strictly distinguished the structural difference of GlcA and L-iduronic acid in the polysaccharide. Binding affinities of the antibodies were determined by a surface plasmon resonance assay using CSE and -CSA. The binding affinities were strongly associated with the molecular  of CSE and the E-unit content of -CSA. Moreover, we demonstrated that the antibodies are applicable to histochemical analysis. In conclusion, the new anti-CSE monoclonal antibodies specifically recognize the E-unit of CSE. The antibodies will become useful tools for the investigation of the biological and pathological significance of CSE.© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

At 2 and 4 weeks after surgery, subchondral bone changes were evaluated via micro-computed tomography with various knee flexion angles to simulate -bearing during rat ambulation under a 3-dimensional motion capture apparatus. Additionally, the biomechanical properties, histology, and ultrastructure of the medial tibia and femoral condyle were evaluated.Focal subchondral bone plate perforations were confirmed in the medial tibia within 2 weeks after surgery and were aggravated rapidly 2 weeks later. This subchondral plate porosity colocalized with articular cartilage lesions as confirmed by histology and scanning electron microscopy, and coincided with the likely point of contact between the posterior femoral condyle and tibial plateau during ambulation. Biomechanical properties were confirmed at the medial tibia, at which stiffness was reduced to approximately half that of the sham-operated knee at 4 weeks after surgery.Cartilage-subchondral bone plate alterations localized in the region of the point of mechanical load during ambulation in DMM-operated knees, at which the mechanical integrity of cartilage was impaired. These results indicate that DMM-induced increases in mechanical load play an important role in the pathogenesis of early post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA), and it might accelerate the development of the disease via cartilage-subchondral bone plate crosstalk through increased subchondral plate perforations.Copyright © 2015 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Four weeks after the surgery, the animals were subjected to moderate (12 m/min) or intense (21 m/min) treadmill exercises for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. PTOA development in articular cartilage and SB was examined using histological and immunohistochemical analyses, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis, and biomechanical testing at 8 weeks after surgery. Gremlin-1 was injected to determine the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling on PTOA development following moderate exercise.Moderate exercise increased BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP receptor 2, pSmad-5, and inhibitor of DNA binding protein-1 expression in the superficial zone chondrocytes and suppressed cartilage degeneration, osteophyte growth, SB damage, and osteoclast-mediated SB resorption. However, intense exercise had little effect on BMP expression and even caused progression of these osteoarthritis (OA) changes. Gremlin-1 injection following moderate exercise caused progression of the PTOA development down to the level of the non-exercise DMM-operated knee.Exercise regulated cartilage-SB PTOA development in DMM-operated knees in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings shed light on the important role of BMP expression in superficial zone chondrocytes in attenuation of PTOA development following physiological exercise loading. Further studies to support a mechanism by which BMPs would be beneficial in preventing PTOA progression are warranted.Copyright © 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

For this, we analyzed 2814 rounds of all  divisions by motor actions and spatiotemporal changes according actions and time of the Keeping distance, Clinch and Groundwork combat phases. We observed differences between  divisions in the keeping distance on stand-up combat (p≤0.001; with lower time in Featherweight 131.4s and bantamweight 127.9s) clinch without attack (p≤0.001; with higher timer in Flyweight 11.4s and Half-middleweight 12.) and groundwork without attack (p≤0.001; with higher timer in Half-middleweight 0.9s). During keeping distance, half-middleweight presented a higher frequency of Head Strikes Landed (p=0.026; 7±8 times) and attempted (p=0.003; 24±22 times). In clinch actions heavyweight present a higher frequency (p≤0.023) of head strike landed (3±7 times) and attempted (4±9 times) and half-middleweight for  strikes (p≤0.023) landed (2±5 times) and attempted (3±5 times).

This is hypothesized to be due to retained circulating maternal estrogens decreasing the structural density of collagen; however, this has not been fully tested. Cartilage elasticity is dependent on the concentration of the proteoglycan aggregate, and hyaluronic acid, a constituent of proteoglycan aggregate, is increased by estrogens. Nonsurgical correction of these deformities in more developed patients has the potential to change clinical practice and eliminate surgical risks. Previous studies have demonstrated preliminary promise with the use of injectable estrogen to treat auricular deformities. For this study, we have validated an animal model and demonstrated the feasibility of a more therapeutically appropriate topical estrogen treatment in restoring neonatal plasticity of auricular cartilage.Ears of 12 New Zealand rabbits were folded and splinted, and assigned an experimental group (estrogen, placebo, and untreated control) (n = 8 ears). Treatment ears received topical estrogen or placebo cream daily for 4 weeks, whereas controls received no treatment. The splints were removed following 2 additional weeks, and photographs were taken to calculate the retained fold angle. Biopsies were also taken for histologic analysis.The 8 control ears showed a statistically increased angle from a folded orientation of 46.6 degrees to return of ear position to a normal upright position of 151.2 degrees by the fourth day after splint removal. Both the estrogen-treated and placebo-treated ears responded to splinting with maintained folding (36.6 degrees and 32.5 degrees, respectively). Auricular cartilage thickness trended toward thicker in ears treated with estrogen, consistent with increased matrix components.Estrogen and placebo treatment with splinting of ears lead to a significant change to the cartilage configuration, validating the model. The results of this study are very encouraging and provide the foundation for a noninvasive therapeutic approach for correcting auricular deformities. Future work will include a more detailed mechanistic study evaluating the dosing of estrogen and the efficiency of dermal penetration as well as evaluating the long-term outcomes and molecular mechanism-associated cartilaginous responses to estrogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526182>Pharmacologic Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Available Therapies.</a></h2><p>Choices for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have multiplied as our understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic defects has evolved. Treatment should target multiple defects in T2DM and follow a patient-centered approach that considers factors beyond glycemic control, including cardiovascular risk reduction. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology and the American Diabetes Association recommend an initial approach consisting of lifestyle changes and monotherapy, preferably with metformin. Therapy choices are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, particularly effects on  and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost. Balancing management of hyperglycemia with the risk of hypoglycemia and consideration of the effects of pharmacotherapy on  figure prominently in US-based T2DM recommendations, whereas less emphasis has been placed on the ability of specific medications to affect cardiovascular outcomes. This is likely because, until recently, specific glucose-lowering agents have not been shown to affect cardiorenal outcomes. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, and the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes 6 (SUSTAIN-6) recently showed a reduction in overall cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin, liraglutide, and semaglutide treatment, respectively. Moreover, empagliflozin has become the first glucose-lowering agent indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. Results from cardiovascular outcomes trials have prompted an update to the 2017 American Diabetes Association standards of care, which now recommend consideration of empagliflozin or liraglutide for patients with suboptimally controlled long-standing T2DM and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because these agents have been shown to reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality when added to standard care.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

Regnault grades 2 and 3 ptotic breasts feature significant mastectomy flap redundancy that may be incorporated into the reconstruction. This allows surgeons to use patients' de-epithelialized inferior dermal pedicle instead of ADM.All consecutive SSM patients with Regnault grade 2 or 3 ptosis who underwent Passot-type immediate breast reconstruction (IBBR) with tissue expanders (TEs) and de-epithelialized inferior dermal pedicle without an ADM were included. Patient data from the electronic medical record, clinical photographs, and a comparative cost analysis of ADM versus additional operative time are provided.Thirty-eight patients with an average age of 52.7 years,  210.5 lb, and  mass index of 35.1 kg/m were treated (34 bilateral, 4 unilateral; 72 reconstructed breasts). Average mastectomy specimens weighed 962.8 g. Tissue expanders were filled to 265.0 mL (41.6% capacity) intraoperatively, and final implant volume averaged 710.9 ± 118.5 mL after an average of 628.6 ± 74.1-mL expansion. Operative times for Passot-type IBBR was 124.3 ± 37.7 versus 92.5 ± 27.9 minutes (P = 0.0001) for submuscular TE placement with ADM. The operative technique is described in detail. There were 8 TE explantations (21.1%) included: intractable infection (10.5%; n = 4), symptomatic capsular contracture (7.9%; n = 3), and spontaneous TE deflation (2.6%; n = 1). All but 3 patients (92.1%) successfully completed Passot reconstruction, with 2 patients declining salvage latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction and 1 patient lost to follow-up. Total cost savings in this case series was $89,724 ($2361 ± $3529/case).Additional prospective comparison studies are needed to determine whether Passot-type IBBR results in higher complication rates than conventional IBBR with ADM in this challenging patient population. Passot-type IBR after SSM is safe, demonstrates acceptable rates of successful breast reconstruction, confers cost savings by obviating the use of ADM, and provides favorable aesthetic results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28353382>New-Generation Thromboelastography: Comprehensive Evaluation of Citrated and Heparinized Blood Sample Storage Effect on Clot-Forming Variables.</a></h2><p>- Thromboelastography (TEG) is a whole blood, real-time analyzer measuring the viscoelastic properties of the hemostasis process and allowing for individualized goal-directed therapy.

Its role in patients with advanced disease is unclear. In this study, we evaluate the safety of oncoplastic BCS (OBCS) in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy (NT) for high stage breast cancer.The oncologic outcomes of consecutive patients classified as high stage (>T2 or at least N1) who received NT followed by BCS at EUH by a single breast surgeon (T.M.S.) from September 2004 until June 2015 were compared with those who received BCS combined with an oncoplastic reduction. Patients were surveyed using the BREAST-Q to determine their satisfaction after surgery.A total of 87 patients were included in this series. The mean initial tumor size (4.37 vs 2.56 cm), the  of the surgical specimen, and the post-NT tumor size were all larger in the OBCS group as compared with BCS alone (1.54 vs 1.29 cm). The mean follow-up was 44 months. The average percent reduction in tumor size in response to NT was slightly greater in the OBCS group (61 vs 52%). Oncologic outcomes were similar for OBCS reduction and BCS groups, respectively: positive margin rate, reexcision rate, completion mastectomy rate, local recurrence rate, and 5-year DSS. Patient satisfaction was similar between the 2 groups.The oncoplastic approach in high stage patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic Powered by Editorial Manager and ProduXion Manager from Aries Systems Corporation therapy appears to be as safe and effective when compared to BCS alone. Oncoplastic BCS paired with NT broadens the indication for BCS for patients with larger tumor size.</p></html>
