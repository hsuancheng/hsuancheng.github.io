To investigate potential acute effects of T23 on the viability and the glucose metabolism of brain cells, we exposed cultured primary rat astrocytes to T23 for up to 4 h. While the viability and the morphology of the cultured astrocytes were not acutely affected by the presence of T23 in concentrations of up to 300 µM, this compound caused a rapid, time- and concentration-dependent increase in glucose consumption and lactate release. Maximal effects on glycolytic flux were found for incubations with 100 µM T23 for 2 h which doubled both glucose consumption and lactate production. The stimulation of glycolytic flux by T23 was reversible, completely abolished upon removal of the compound and not found in presence of other known inhibitors of endocytosis. Structurally related compounds such as tyrphostin 25 and catechol or modulators of AMP kinase activity did neither affect the basal nor the T23-stimulated lactate production by astrocytes. In contrast, the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate completely abolished the stimulation by T23 of astrocytic lactate production in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that T23-sensitive phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events are involved in the regulation of astrocytic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27775075>Myoferlin regulates cellular lipid metabolism and promotes metastases in triple-negative breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Myoferlin is a multiple C2-domain-containing protein that regulates membrane repair,  kinase receptor function and endocytosis in myoblasts and endothelial cells. Recently it has been reported as overexpressed in several cancers and shown to contribute to proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. We have previously demonstrated that myoferlin regulates epidermal growth factor receptor activity in breast cancer. In the current study, we report a consistent overexpression of myoferlin in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) over cells originating from other breast cancer subtypes. Using a combination of proteomics, metabolomics and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that myoferlin depletion results in marked alteration of endosomal system and metabolism. Mechanistically, myoferlin depletion caused impaired vesicle traffic that led to a misbalance of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids. This provoked mitochondrial dysfunction in TNBC cells. As a consequence of the major metabolic stress, TNBC cells rapidly triggered AMP activated protein kinase-mediated metabolic reprogramming to . This reduced their ability to balance between oxidative phosphorylation and , rendering TNBC cells metabolically inflexible, and more sensitive to metabolic drug targeting in vitro. In line with this, our in vivo findings demonstrated a significantly reduced capacity of myoferlin-deficient TNBC cells to metastasise to lungs. The significance of this observation was further supported by clinical data, showing that TNBC patients whose tumors overexpress myoferlin have worst distant metastasis-free and overall survivals. This novel insight into myoferlin function establishes an important link between vesicle traffic, cancer metabolism and progression, offering new diagnostic and therapeutic concepts to develop treatments for TNBC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25810260>PPARα inhibition modulates multiple reprogrammed metabolic pathways in kidney cancer and attenuates tumor growth.</a></h2><p>Kidney cancer [renal cell carcinoma (RCC)] is the sixth-most-common cancer in the United States, and its incidence is increasing. The current progression-free survival for patients with advanced RCC rarely extends beyond 1-2 yr due to the development of therapeutic resistance. We previously identified peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-α (PPARα) as a potential therapeutic target for this disease and showed that a specific PPARα antagonist, GW6471, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 in RCC cell lines associated with attenuation of cell cycle regulatory proteins. We now extend that work and show that PPARα inhibition attenuates components of RCC metabolic reprogramming, capitalizing on the Warburg effect. The specific PPARα inhibitor GW6471, as well as a siRNA specific to PPARα, attenuates the enhanced fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation associated with  inhibition, and PPARα antagonism also blocks the enhanced  that has been observed in RCC cells; this effect did not occur in normal human kidney epithelial cells. Such cell type-specific inhibition of  corresponds with changes in protein levels of the oncogene c-Myc and has promising clinical implications. Furthermore, we show that treatment with GW6471 results in RCC tumor growth attenuation in a xenograft mouse model, with minimal obvious toxicity, a finding associated with the expected on-target effects on c-Myc. These studies demonstrate that several pivotal cancer-relevant metabolic pathways are inhibited by PPARα antagonism. Our data support the concept that targeting PPARα, with or without concurrent inhibition of , is a potential novel and effective therapeutic approach for RCC that targets metabolic reprogramming in this tumor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26674644>RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene inhibited differentiation and apoptosis in myelopoiesis: an in vivo study.</a></h2><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 1-Evi-1 is a chimeric gene generated by the t (3; 21) (q26; q22) translocation, which leads into malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by unclear mechanisms. This in vivo study aimed to establish a stable line of zebrafish expressing the human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene under the control of a heat stress-inducible bidirectional promoter, and investigate its roles in hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies.We introduced human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene into embryonic zebrafish through a heat-shock promoter to establish Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. Two males and one female mosaic F0 zebrafish embryos (2.1%) were identified as stable positive germline transgenic zebrafish.The population of immature myeloid cells and hematopoietic blast cells were accumulated in peripheral blood and single cell suspension from kidney of adult Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. RUNX1-Evi-1 presented an intensive influence on hematopoietic regulatory factors. Consequently, primitive hematopoiesis was enhanced by upregulation of gata2 and scl, while erythropoiesis was downregulated due to the suppression of gata1. Early stage of myelopoiesis was flourishing with the high expression of pu.1, but it was inhibited along with the low expression of mpo. Microarray analysis demonstrated that RUNX1-Evi-1 not only upregulated proteasome, cell cycle, /gluconeogenesis,  metabolism, drug metabolism, and PPAR pathway, but also suppressed transforming growth factor β, Jak-STAT, DNA replication, mismatch repair, p53 pathway, JNK signaling pathway, and nucleotide excision repair. Interestingly, histone deacetylase 4 was significantly up-regulated. Factors in cell proliferation were obviously suppressed after 3-day treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid. Accordingly, higher proportion of G1 arrest and apoptosis were manifested by the propidium iodide staining.RUNX1-Evi-1 may promote proliferation and apoptosis resistance of primitive hematopoietic cell, and inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells with the synergy of different pathways and factors. VPA may be a promising choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-Evi-1-related leukemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29269267>Complex II phosphorylation is triggered by unbalanced redox homeostasis in cells lacking complex III.</a></h2><p>A marked stimulation of complex II enzymatic activity was detected in cybrids bearing a homoplasmic MTCYB microdeletion causing disruption of both the activity and the assembly of complex III, but not in cybrids harbouring another MTCYB mutation affecting only the complex III activity. Moreover, complex II stimulation was associated with SDHA subunit  phosphorylation. Despite the lack of detectable hydrogen peroxide production, up-regulation of the levels of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses revealed a significant redox unbalance. This effect was also supported by the finding that treatment with N-acetylcysteine dampened the complex II stimulation, SDHA subunit  phosphorylation, and levels of antioxidant enzymes. In the absence of complex III, the cellular amount of succinate, but not fumarate, was markedly increased, indicating that enhanced activity of complex II is hampered due to the blockage of respiratory electron flow. Thus, we propose that complex II phosphorylation and stimulation of its activity represent a molecular mechanism triggered by perturbation of mitochondrial redox homeostasis due to severe dysfunction of respiratory complexes. Depending on the site and nature of the damage, complex II stimulation can either bypass the energetic deficit as an efficient compensatory mechanism, or be ineffectual, leaving cells to rely on  for survival.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of strategies aiming to inhibit alternative survival pathways in CML is therefore critical. We have previously shown that a nonspecific pharmacological inhibition of autophagy potentiates TKI-induced death in Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells. Here we provide further understanding of how specific and pharmacological autophagy inhibition affects nonmitochondrial and mitochondrial energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated differentiation of CML cells and highlight ATG7 (a critical component of the LC3 conjugation system) as a potential specific therapeutic target. By combining extra- and intracellular steady state metabolite measurements by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with metabolic flux assays using labeled glucose and functional assays, we demonstrate that knockdown of ATG7 results in decreased  and increased flux of labeled carbons through the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle. This leads to increased oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Furthermore, following ROS accumulation, CML cells, including primary CML CD34(+) progenitor cells, differentiate toward the erythroid lineage. Finally, ATG7 knockdown sensitizes CML progenitor cells to TKI-induced death, without affecting survival of normal cells, suggesting that specific inhibitors of ATG7 in combination with TKI would provide a novel therapeutic approach for CML patients exhibiting persistent disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30174307>Increased Lactate Secretion by Cancer Cells Sustains Non-cell-autonomous Adaptive Resistance to MET and EGFR Targeted Therapies.</a></h2><p>The microenvironment influences cancer drug response and sustains resistance to therapies targeting receptor- kinases. However, if and how the tumor microenvironment can be altered during treatment, contributing to resistance onset, is not known. We show that, under prolonged treatment with  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), EGFR- or MET-addicted cancer cells displayed a metabolic shift toward increased  and lactate production. We identified secreted lactate as the key molecule instructing cancer-associated fibroblasts to produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in a nuclear factor κB-dependent manner. Increased HGF, activating MET-dependent signaling in cancer cells, sustained resistance to TKIs. Functional or pharmacological targeting of molecules involved in the lactate axis abrogated in vivo resistance, demonstrating the crucial role of this metabolite in the adaptive process. This adaptive resistance mechanism was observed in lung cancer patients progressed on EGFR TKIs, demonstrating the clinical relevance of our findings and opening novel scenarios in the challenge to drug resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that metabolic stress triggered by perturbation of receptor  kinase FLT3 in non-acute myeloid leukemia cells sensitizes cancer cells to autophagy inhibition and leads to excessive activation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Our data demonstrate that FLT3 is an important sensor of cellular nutritional state and elucidate the role and molecular mechanism of CMA in metabolic regulation and mediating cancer cell death. Importantly, our proteome analysis revealed that HK2 is a CMA substrate and that its degradation by CMA is regulated by glucose availability. We reveal a new mechanism by which excessive activation of CMA may be exploited pharmacologically to eliminate cancer cells by inhibiting both FLT3 and autophagy. Our study delineates a novel pharmacological strategy to promote the degradation of HK2 in cancer cells.© 2015 Xia et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824714>Cardiac Metabolic Deregulation Induced by the  Kinase Receptor Inhibitor Sunitinib is rescued by Endothelin Receptor Antagonism.</a></h2><p>The growing field of cardio-oncology addresses the side effects of cancer treatment on the cardiovascular system. Here, we explored the cardiotoxicity of the antiangiogenic therapy, sunitinib, in the mouse heart from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective. We showed that sunitinib induces an anaerobic switch of cellular metabolism within the myocardium which is associated with the development of myocardial fibrosis and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction as demonstrated by echocardiography. The capacity of positron emission tomography with [F]fluorodeoxyglucose to detect the changes in cardiac metabolism caused by sunitinib was dependent on fasting status and duration of treatment. Pan proteomic analysis in the myocardium showed that sunitinib induced  an early metabolic switch with enhanced  and reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and  a metabolic failure to use glucose as energy substrate, similar to the insulin resistance found in type 2 diabetes. Co-administration of the endothelin receptor antagonist, macitentan, to sunitinib-treated animals prevented both metabolic defects, restored glucose uptake and cardiac function, and prevented myocardial fibrosis. These results support the endothelin system in mediating the cardiotoxic effects of sunitinib and endothelin receptor antagonism as a potential therapeutic approach to prevent cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, metabolic and functional imaging can monitor the cardiotoxic effects and the benefits of endothelin antagonism in a theranostic approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463472>Interferon Gamma Induces Reversible Metabolic Reprogramming of M1 Macrophages to Sustain Cell Viability and Pro-Inflammatory Activity.</a></h2><p>Classical activation of M1 macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to . However, the generalizability of such metabolic remodeling to other modes of M1 macrophage stimulation, e.g. type II interferons (IFNs) such as IFNγ, has remained unknown as has the functional significance of aerobic  during macrophage activation. Here we demonstrate that IFNγ induces a rapid activation of aerobic  followed by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation in M1 macrophages. Elevated glycolytic flux sustains cell viability and inflammatory activity, while limiting reliance on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) distributed by aerobic  is critical for sustaining IFN-γ triggered JAK (Janus  kinase)-STAT-1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1) signaling with phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT-1 as its signature trait. Inhibition of aerobic  not only blocks the M1 phenotype and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in murine macrophages and also human monocytes/macrophages. These findings extend on the potential functional role of immuno-metabolism from LPS- to IFNγ-linked diseases such as atherosclerosis and autoimmune disease.Copyright © 2018 German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).

Existing methods for studying kinase expression and activation have limited kinome coverage. Herein we established a multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM)-based targeted proteomic method that provided an unprecedented coverage (∼80%) of the human kinome. We employed this method for profiling comprehensively the alterations of the global kinome of HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells upon treatment with methylglyoxal, a  byproduct that is present at elevated levels in blood and tissues of diabetic patients and is thought to contribute to diabetic complications. Our results led to the quantification of 328 unique kinases. In particular, we found that methylglyoxal treatment gave rise to altered expression of a number of kinases in the MAPK pathway and diminished expression of several receptor  kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), etc. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the diminished expression of EGFR occurred through a mechanism that is distinct from the reduced expression of IGF2R and FGFR1. Together, our targeted kinome profiling method offers a powerful resource for exploring kinase-mediated signaling pathways that are altered by extracellular stimuli, and the results from the present study suggest new mechanisms underlying the development of diabetic complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27597275>Standardized uptake value on (18)F-FDG-PET/CT is a predictor of EGFR T790M mutation status in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.</a></h2><p>The development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M point mutation in exon 20 (T790M) is the most common mechanism of resistance to EGFR  kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). The purpose of this study was to determine the association of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) metrics with T790M status after acquiring resitance to EGFR-TKI resistance.We retrospectively reviewed 34 advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR mutation who underwent rebiopsy and FDG-PET/CT before rebiopsy. These patients were evaluated for baseline characteristics, initial response to EGFR-TKIs, site of rebiopsy, overall survival, and FDG-PET/CT metrics, such as standardized uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion  of the rebiopsy site.The median age was 67 years (range, 37-86 years); 19 of the patients (56%) were men. Histologic examination revealed adenocarcinoma in all but one patient, with 20 patients (59%) having stage IIIB and IV disease. Upon initial mutational analyses, the types of EGFR mutation included 17 (50%) deletions in exon 19 and 17 (50%) L858R point mutations in exon 21. At the time of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, T790M mutation was identified in 20 (59%) patients. T790M-positive patients had significantly lower levels of median SUVmean and median SUVmax of the rebiopsy site on FDG-PET/CT, compared with T790M-negative patients (SUVmean: 4.57 vs. 9.91, P=0.0069; SUVmax: 7.26 vs. 16.06, P=0.0054). The survival in patients who acquired T790M after failure of EGFR-TKIs was significantly longer than those without T790M (10.2 mos. vs. 18.6 mos., P<0.05).T790M status was associated with lower levels of SUVmean and SUVmax on FDG-PET/CT and significantly longer survival.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To gain insight into BCR-ABL kinase activity-independent mechanisms, we performed an initial bioinformatics screen and followed by a quantitative PCR screen of genes that were elevated in CML samples. A total of 33 candidate genes were identified to be highly expressed in TKIs resistant patients. Among those genes, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), controlling the limiting step of , was found to be strongly associated with TKIs resistance. PFKFB3 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of its kinase activity markedly enhanced the sensitivity of CML cells to TKIs. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 inhibited CML cells growth and significantly prolonged the survival of both allograft and xenograft CML mice. ChIP-seq data analysis combined with subsequent knockdown experiment showed that the Ets transcription factor PU.1 regulated the elevated expression of PFKFB3 in TKIs-resistant CML cells. Therefore, our results showed that targeting PFKFB3 sensitizes CML cells to TKIs and PFKFB3 may be a potential BCR-ABL kinase activity-independent mechanism in CML.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26027252>[The C3-aldehydes and disorder of cellular metabolism: possible modes of normalization of carbohydrate metabolism].</a></h2><p>The control of cellular metabolism is present in many organs and tissues and its loss means development of hypo- and hyperglycemia. The high level of glucose results in glycation of proteins and increase of concentration of ketoaldehyde and methyl glyoxal in cells. The increase of level of this ketoaldehyde and D-lactate in organs and tissues also can be a result offormation of methyl glyoxal in particular enzymatic reactions including decomposition of one of substrates of  and conversion of aminoacetone catalyzed by semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxydase of endothelium cells. The methyl glyoxal attacks arginine residuals of proteins. This aldehyde is related to interruption in transmission of insulin signal, disorder of pro-antioxidant balance, inhibition of enzymes of , etc. The model of cellular metabolism is proposed where methyl glyoxal plays a key role in development of resistance to insulin, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia and hypertension. The modes of increase of consumption of glucose in conditions of low activity of protein  kinase are considered. The possible involvement of tokopherol (its derivatives) in activation ofphosphodiesterase in liver and regulation of carbohydrate metabolism is considered too. The role of tokopherol-carrier proteins and effect of tokopherol on functioning of OI-cells is discussed.

Warburg effect is an important characteristic of tumor cell metabolism including prostate cancer cells, in which hexokinase 2 (HK2), a major rate-limiting enzyme involved in Warburg effect, is selectively upregulated. The lectin PCL is a mannose binding lectin which induces tumor cell apoptosis and autophagy. In the present study, we report that PCL could lower glucose consumption and lactate production, shift the Warburg effect by inhibiting the expression of HK2 in PC3 cells and the suppression of HK2 by siRNA reversed the effect of PCL on glucose consumption and lactate production. The expression of HK2 is closely related to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream signaling pathway activation, therefore, we investigated the interaction of PCL with EGFR by western blot analysis and found that PCL could suppress the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) with EGFR and HK2 expression. Also, we explored the binding mechanism between the PCL and EGFR through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations and found that PCL bocked the active site of EGFR which is also the binding site of the nature ligand EGF, the resulting conformation has higher stability than EGF in complex with EGFR. The results indicated that PCL could competitively bind to EGFR binding pocket and then prevent EGF from binding to EGFR, blocking the autophosphorylation of the EGFR  kinase, after that the EGFR activation is inhibited. Collectively, our studies concluded that PCL inhibits tumor cell  by combining with EGFR and reducing HK2 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28581641>Clk1-regulated aerobic  is involved in glioma chemoresistance.</a></h2><p>Chemoresistance remains a major challenge for the treatment of glioma. In this study, we investigated the role of Clock 1 (Clk1), which encodes an enzyme that is necessary for ubiquinone biosynthesis in glioma chemoresistance in vitro. The results showed that Clk1 was highly expressed in GL261 mouse glioma cells which were most sensitive to 1,3Bis (2-chloroethyl) 1 nitrosourea (BCNU) while was low expressed in BCNU resistant cells such as glioma cancer stem cells, T98G, U87MG and U251 glioma cells. Knockdown of Clk1 in GL261 glioma cells significantly reduced BCNU- or cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, whereas the proliferative activity and the expression of multidrug resistance-related genes including MDR1, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, and GSTP1 were not changed. When Clk1 was re-expressed in Clk1 knockdown GL261 glioma cells, the BCNU sensitivity was restored. The mechanistic study revealed that knockdown of Clk1 in GL261 glioma cells increased aerobic  including high glucose consumption, lactate production, and up-regulation of -associated genes. Inhibition of  can reverse the chemoresistance elicited by Clk1 knockdown in GL261 cells. Moreover, knockdown of Clk1 induced HIF-1α expression in GL261 glioma cells which was found to be mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Both metformin and rapamycin reversed the chemoresistance of Clk1 knockdown GL261 glioma cells. Over-expression of Clk1 significantly increased the sensitivity of T98G or U251 human glioblastoma cells to BCNU which was accompanied by decreased lactate secretion, decreased expression of HIF-1α, AMPK activation, and inhibition of mTOR pathway. Inhibition of  or activation of AMPK did not alter Clk1 expression in variant glioma cell lines suggesting that aerobic  is not an upstream event of Clk1 expression in glioma cells. Taken together, our results revealed, for the first time, that mitochondrial Clk1 regulated chemoresistance in glioma cells through AMPK/mTOR/HIF-1α mediated  pathway.© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29236774>EphrinA1-Fc attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice.</a></h2><p>EphrinA1, a membrane-bound receptor  kinase ligand expressed in healthy cardiomyocytes, is lost in injured cells following myocardial infarction. Previously, we have reported that a single intramyocardial injection of chimeric ephrinA1-Fc at the time of ischemia reduced injury in the nonreperfused myocardium by 50% at 4 days post-MI by reducing apoptosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. In a clinically relevant model of acute ischemia (30min)/reperfusion (24hr or 4 days) injury, we now demonstrate that ephrinA1-Fc reduces infarct size by 46% and completely preserves cardiac function (ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and chamber dimensions) in the short-term (24hrs post-MI) as well as long-term (4 days). At 24 hours post-MI, diminished serum inflammatory cell chemoattractants in ephrinA1-Fc-treated mice reduces recruitment of neutrophils and leukocytes into the myocardium. Differences in relative expression levels of EphA-Rs are described in the context of their putative role in mediating cardioprotection. Validation by Western blotting of selected targets from mass spectrometry analyses of pooled samples of left ventricular tissue homogenates from mice that underwent 30min ischemia and 24hr of reperfusion (I/R) indicates that ephrinA1-Fc administration alters several regulators of signaling pathways that attenuate apoptosis, promote autophagy, and shift from FA metabolism in favor of increased  to optimize anaerobic ATP production. Taken together, reduced injury is due a combination of adaptive metabolic reprogramming, improved cell survival, and decreased inflammatory cell recruitment, suggesting that ephrinA1-Fc enhances the capacity of the heart to withstand an ischemic insult.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27132990>Metabolic alterations and drug sensitivity of  kinase inhibitor resistant leukemia cells with a FLT3/ITD mutation.</a></h2><p>Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane region of FMS-like  kinase-3 (FLT3) receptor is a common type of mutation in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and patient response to FLT3 inhibitors appears to be transient due to the emergence of drug resistance. We established two sorafenib-resistant cell lines carrying FLT3/ITD mutations, including the murine BaF3/ITD-R and human MV4-11-R cell lines. Gene expression profile analysis of the resistant and parental cells suggests that the highest ranked molecular and cellular functions of the differentially expressed genes are related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Both murine and human resistant cell lines display a longer doubling time, along with a significant inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and substantial upregulation of . The sorafenib-resistant cells exhibit increased expression of a majority of glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase 2, which is also highly expressed in the mitochondrial fraction and is associated with resistance to apoptotic cell death. The sorafenib-resistant cells are collaterally sensitive to a number of glycolytic inhibitors including 2-deoxyglucose and 3-bromopyruvate propylester.

However, the mechanism of how arctigenin kills cancer cells is not fully understood. In the present work we studied the mechanism of toxicity by arctigenin in the human pancreatic cell line, Panc-1, with special emphasis on the mitochondria. A comparison of Panc-1 cells cultured in glucose versus galactose medium was applied, allowing assessments of effects in glycolytic versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent Panc-1 cells. For control purposes, the mitochondrial toxic response to treatment with arctigenin was compared to the anti-cancer drug, sorafenib, which is a  kinase inhibitor known for mitochondrial toxic off-target effects (Will et al., 2008). In both Panc-1 OXPHOS-dependent and glycolytic cells, arctigenin dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential, which was demonstrated to be due to inhibition of the mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, arctigenin selectively killed only the OXPHOS-dependent Panc-1 cells. This selective killing of OXPHOS-dependent Panc-1 cells was accompanied by generation of ER stress, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation leading to apoptosis and aponecrosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reprogramming in energy (especially glucose) metabolism plays an important role in development and progression of acquired resistance in cancer cells. We hypothesize that glucose metabolism in EGFR-TKI sensitive HCC827 cells and erlotinib-resistant sub-line of HCC827 (which we name it as erlotinib-resistant 6, ER6 cells in this study) is different and targeting glucose metabolism might be a treatment strategy for erlotinib-resistant NSCLCs. In this study, we found increased glucose uptakes, significant increase in  rate and overexpression of glucose transporter 1 in ER6 cells compared to its parental cells HCC827. We also found AKT and autophagy of ER6 cells were more activated than HCC827 cells after glucose starvation. Combining glucose deprivation and AKT or autophagy inhibitor could synergize and overcome the acquired resistance against EGFR-targeted therapy for NSCLCs. Our data suggest that the combinations of inhibitors of AKT or autophagy together with glucose deprivation could be novel treatment strategies for NSCLC with acquired resistance to targeted therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410449>Bacteriocyte Reprogramming to Cope With Nutritional Stress in a Phloem Sap Feeding Hemipteran, the Pea Aphid .</a></h2><p>Nutritional symbioses play a central role in the ability of insects to thrive on unbalanced diets and in ensuring their evolutionary success. A genomic model for nutritional symbiosis comprises the hemipteran , and the gamma-3-proteobacterium, , with genomes encoding highly integrated metabolic pathways.  feeds exclusively on plant phloem sap, a nutritionally unbalanced diet highly variable in composition, thus raising the question of how this symbiotic system responds to nutritional stress. We addressed this by combining transcriptomic, phenotypic and life history trait analyses to determine the organismal impact of deprivation of  and phenylalanine. These two aromatic amino acids are essential for aphid development, are synthesized in a metabolic pathway for which the aphid host and the endosymbiont are interdependent, and their concentration can be highly variable in plant phloem sap. We found that this nutritional challenge does not have major phenotypic effects on the pea aphid, except for a limited weight reduction and a 2-day delay in onset of nymph laying. Transcriptomic analyses through aphid development showed a prominent response in bacteriocytes (the core symbiotic tissue which houses the symbionts), but not in gut, thus highlighting the role of bacteriocytes as major modulators of this homeostasis. This response does not involve a direct regulation of  and phenylalanine biosynthetic pathway and transporter genes. Instead, we observed an extensive transcriptional reprogramming of the bacteriocyte with a rapid down-regulation of genes encoding sugar transporters and genes required for sugar metabolism. Consistently, we observed continued overexpression of the  homolog of RRAD, a small GTPase implicated in repressing aerobic . In addition, we found increased transcription of genes involved in proliferation, cell size control and signaling. We experimentally confirmed the significance of these gene expression changes detecting an increase in bacteriocyte number and cell size  under  and phenylalanine depletion. Our results support a central role of bacteriocytes in the aphid response to amino acid deprivation: their transcriptional and cellular responses fine-tune host physiology providing the host insect with an effective way to cope with the challenges posed by the variability in composition of phloem sap.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28822947>Cell metabolomics reveals the neurotoxicity mechanism of cadmium in PC12 cells.</a></h2><p>The heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) can induce neurotoxicity. Extensive studies about the effects of Cd on human health have been reported, however, a systematic investigation on the molecular mechanisms of the effects of Cd on central nervous system is still needed. In this paper, the neuronal PC-12 cells were treated with a series of concentrations of CdCl for 48h. Then the cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The IC value (15% inhibiting concentration) was selected for further mechanism studies. After PC-12 cells incubated with CdCl at a dose of IC for 48h, the intracellular and extracellular metabolites were profiled using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS)-based cell metabolomics approach. As found, the effects of the heavy metal Cd produced on the PC-12 cell viability were dose-dependent. The metabolic changes were involved in the  and gluconeogenesis, biopterin metabolism, tryptophan metabolism,  metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and fatty acids beta-oxidation. These could cause the perturbation of cell membrane, redox balance, energy supply, cellular detoxification, further affecting the cellular proliferation and apoptosis and other cellular activities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the comparative untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed in this study. The results revealed that  pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were significantly enhanced in yellowed rice, indicating the activated energy metabolism was trigged during the yellowing process. In addition, the increased aromatic compounds (4-hydroxycinnamic acid and benzoic acid) and their precursors (phenylalanine, ) suggested the activation of shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in yellowed rice, which is an antioxidant defense related pathway. In particular, the pathways involved in the metabolism of glutamate and arginine also significantly altered in yellowed rice. Therefore, the enriched pathways of increased amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, and intermediates of the TCA cycle during yellowing process are proposed to be associated with the response of heat and dry induced by the yellowing process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, response rates are low, and only approximately 25% will achieve disease control. Early prediction of treatment resistance could accelerate discontinuation of ineffective treatment and reduce unnecessary toxicity. In this study, we evaluated early changes on 18F-fluoro-D-glucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and in total plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as markers of erlotinib response in EGFR-wt patients.F-18-FDG-PET/CT scans and blood samples were obtained prior to erlotinib initiation and were repeated after 1 week (PET/CT) and 1 to 4 weeks (blood sample) of treatment. Level of cfDNA was measured by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Percentage change (%∆) in SUL and total lesion  (TLG) on FDG-PET/CT and in plasma cfDNA was correlated to radiological response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).Fifty patients were prospectively enrolled. A significant correlation was found between CT response and %∆TLG (P=.003). All patients with early metabolic progression showed radiological progression. Increased %∆TLG and %∆cfDNA were significantly correlated with shorter PFS (P=.002 and P=.004, respectively) and OS (P=.009 and P=.009, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated %∆cfDNA to be the strongest predictor of OS.Early increase in TLG on F-18-FDG-PET/CT correlates with radiological progression, and shorter PFS and OS. Early increase in cfDNA predicts shorter PFS and OS. Both assessments are promising tools for early detection of nonresponders and reduced OS in TKI-treated EGFR-wt NSCLC patients.Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Monocytes/macrophages represent key components of cancer immune surveillance and effectors for antibody-mediated antitumor effects. Monocytes display an altered subset composition in CLL. Moreover, we find a changed metabolic phenotype: glucose uptake, glucose transporters and expression of glycolytic molecules are reduced. Our data establish a link between glycolytic competence and monocyte-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells. Furthermore, we report that CLL monocytes express Bruton's  kinase (BTK). Our observations suggest that using BTK inhibitors in CLL might further aggravate the observed immune metabolic defects in monocytes. Triggering the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) checkpoint on monocytes hampers , phagocytosis and BTK signaling. Conversely, disrupting PD-1/PD-L1 signaling reverses these immune metabolic dysfunctions. Taken together, our findings imply a novel metabolic interplay between CLL cells and monocytes and that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 might restore metabolic together with antitumor activity of CLL monocytes/macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29455660>The relevance of  kinase inhibitors for global metabolic pathways in cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumor metabolism is a thrilling discipline that focuses on mechanisms used by cancer cells to earn crucial building blocks and energy to preserve growth and overcome resistance to various treatment modalities. At the same time, therapies directed specifically against aberrant signalling pathways driven by protein  kinases (TKs) involved in proliferation, metastasis and growth count for several years to promising anti-cancer approaches. In this respect, small molecule inhibitors are the most widely used clinically relevant means for targeted therapy, with a rising number of approvals for TKs inhibitors. In this review, we discuss recent observations related to TKs-associated metabolism and to metabolic feedback that is initialized as cellular response to particular TK-targeted therapies. These observations provide collective evidence that therapeutic responses are primarily linked to such pathways as regulation of lipid and amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle and , advocating therefore the development of further effective targeted therapies against a broader spectrum of TKs to treat patients whose tumors display deregulated signalling driven by these proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493687>Comparative Metabolic Response between Cucumber ( Cucumis sativus) and Corn ( Zea mays) to a Cu(OH) Nanopesticide.</a></h2><p>Due to their unique properties, copper-based nanopesticides are emerging in the market. Thus, understanding their effect on crop plants is very important. Metabolomics can capture a snapshot of cellular metabolic responses to a stressor. We selected maize and cucumber as model plants for exposure to different doses of Cu(OH) nanopesticide. GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics was employed to determine the metabolic responses of these two species. Results revealed significant differences in metabolite profile changes between maize and cucumber. Furthermore, the Cu(OH) nanopesticide induced metabolic reprogramming in both species, but in different manners. In maize, several intermediate metabolites of the  pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were up-regulated, indicating the energy metabolism was activated. In addition, the levels of aromatic compounds (4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 1,2,4-benzenetriol) and their precursors (phenylalanine, ) were enhanced, indicating the activation of shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in maize leaves, which is an antioxidant defense-related pathway. In cucumber, arginine and proline metabolic pathways were the most significantly altered pathway. Both species exhibited altered levels of fatty acids and polysaccharides, suggesting the cell membrane and cell wall composition may change in response to Cu(OH) nanopesticide. Thus, metabolomics helps to deeply understand the differential response of these plants to the same nanopesticide stressor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535578>Suhuai suckling piglet hindgut microbiome-metabolome responses to different dietary copper levels.</a></h2><p>Unabsorbed copper accumulates in the hindgut of pigs that consume high levels of dietary copper, which enhances the coselection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is considered detrimental to the environment and to porcine health. In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and nontargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the microbiome-metabolome responses to dietary copper levels in the hindgut of suckling piglets. The results showed that the dietary copper level affected the abundance of several Clostridia genera and that the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Acidaminococcus, was reduced in the 300 mg kg (high) Cu group. Metabolomic analysis revealed that dietary copper levels affected protein and carbohydrate metabolites, protein biosynthesis, the urea cycle, galactose metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism (including the metabolism of arginine, proline, β-alanine, phenylalanine, , and methionine). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance levels of Coprococcus (family Lachnospiraceae) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 18 (family Ruminococcaceae) were positively correlated with  metabolism pathways (gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway). The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways (protein biosynthesis, glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, and  metabolism), and OTU583 and OTU1067 (family Rikenellaceae) were positively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the copper levels consumed by LC (low-copper group) versus HC (high-copper group) animals alter the composition of the gut microbiota and modulate microbial metabolic pathways, which may further affect the health of suckling piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087897> Kinase Signaling in Cancer Metabolism: PKM2 Paradox in the Warburg Effect.</a></h2><p>The Warburg Effect, or aerobic , is one of the major metabolic alterations observed in cancer. Hypothesized to increase a cell's proliferative capacity via regenerating NAD, increasing the pool of glycolytic biosynthetic intermediates, and increasing lactate production that affects the tumor microenvironment, the Warburg Effect is important for the growth and proliferation of tumor cells. The mechanisms by which a cell acquires the Warburg Effect phenotype are regulated by the expression of numerous oncogenes, including oncogenic  kinases. Oncogenic  kinases play a significant role in phosphorylating and regulating the activity of numerous metabolic enzymes.  phosphorylation of glycolytic enzymes increases the activities of a majority of glycolytic enzymes, thus promoting increased glycolytic rate and tumor cell proliferation. Paradoxically however,  phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) results in decreased PKM2 activity, and this decrease in PKM2 activity promotes the Warburg Effect. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that PKM2 is also able to act as a protein kinase using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate to promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated both the role of the classical and non-canonical activity of PKM2 in promoting the Warburg Effect and tumor growth, which raise further interesting questions. In this review, we will summarize these recent advances revealing the importance of  kinases in the regulation of the Warburg Effect as well as the role of PKM2 in the promotion of tumor growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29025010>Sperm function, protein phosphorylation, and metabolism differ in mice lacking successive sperm-specific glycolytic enzymes.</a></h2><p>Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S (GAPDHS) and phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), two isozymes restricted to the male germline, catalyze successive steps in the glycolytic pathway in mammalian sperm. Although gene targeting of each isozyme demonstrated that  is required for normal sperm motility and male fertility, the phenotype of mice lacking GAPDHS is more severe than that of mice lacking PGK2. This study examined sperm function, signaling pathways, and metabolism to investigate factors that contribute to the phenotypic differences between these knockout models. Sperm from the two knockouts exhibited comparable deficits in zona binding, in vitro fertilization with or without zona drilling, and capacitation-dependent  phosphorylation. In contrast, signaling and metabolic differences were apparent prior to capacitation. Phosphorylation of sperm protein phosphatase 1, which has been associated with the acquisition of motile capacity during epididymal maturation, was deficient only in GAPDHS-null sperm. Carnitine, choline, phosphocholine, and taurine were elevated in sperm from both knockouts immediately after collection from the epididymis. However, only carnitine levels in PGK2-null sperm were significantly different from wild-type sperm, while all four metabolites were significantly higher in GAPDHS-null sperm. We confirmed that  is required for robust hyperactivation, but found that the motility of PGK2-null sperm improved to levels comparable to wild-type sperm with pyruvate as the sole metabolic substrate. This nonglycolysable substrate did not improve progressive motility in GAPDHS-null sperm. These results identify multiple signaling and metabolic defects that are likely contributors to male infertility and the absence of progressive sperm motility seen in mice lacking GAPDHS.© The Authors 2017.

To investigate the interaction of the two oncogenes, we crossed the two transgenic lines and observed more severe and faster hepatocarcinogenesis in Myc/xmrk double transgenic zebrafish than either single transgenic fish. RNA-Seq analyses revealed distinct changes in many molecular pathways among the three types of liver tumors. In particular, we found dramatic alteration of cancer metabolism based on the uniquely enriched pathways in the Myc/xmrk tumors. Critical glycolytic genes including hk2, pkm and ldha were significantly up-regulated in Myc/xmrk tumors but not in either single oncogene-induced tumors, suggesting a potential Warburg effect. In RT-qPCR analyses, the specific pkm2 isoformin Warburg effect was found to be highly enriched in the Myc/xmrk tumors but not in Myc or xmrk tumors, consistent with the observations in many human cancers with Warburg effect. Moreover, the splicing factor genes (hnrnpa1, ptbp1a, ptbp1b and sfrs3b) responsible for generating the pkm isoform were also greatly up-regulated in the Myc/xmrk tumors. As Pkm2 isoform is generally inactive and causes incomplete  to favor anabolism and tumor growth, by treatment with a Pkm2-specific activator, TEPP-46, we further demonstrated that activation of Pkm2 suppressed the growth of oncogenic liver as well as proliferation of liver cells. Collectively, our Myc/xmrk zebrafish model suggests synergetic effect of EGFR and MYC in triggering Warburg effect in the HCC formation and may provide a promising in vivo model for Warburg effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27350164>GC-TOF/MS-based metabolomics approach to study the cellular immunotoxicity of deoxynivalenol on murine macrophage ANA-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Gas chromatography-time of fly/mass spectrum (GC-TOF/MS) based complete murine macrophage ANA-1 cell metabolome strategy, including the endo-metabolome and the exo-metabolome, ANA-1 cell viability assays and apoptosis induced by diverse concentrations of DON were evaluated for selection of an optimized dose for in-depth metabolomic research. Using the optimized chromatography and mass spectrometry parameters, the metabolites detected by GC-TOF/MS were identified and processed with multivariate statistical analysis, including principal componentanalysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) analysis. The data sets were screened with a t-test (P) value < 0.05, VIP value > 1, similarity value > 500, leaving 16 exo-metabolite variables and 11 endo-metabolite variables for further pathway analysis. Implementing the integration of key metabolic pathways, the metabolism pathways were categorized into two dominating types, metabolism of amino acid and glycometabolism. Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism were the significant amino acids affected by the metabolic pathways, indicating statistically significant fold changes including pyruvate, serine, glycine, lactate and threonine.  or gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, and galactose metabolism, belonging to glycometabolism, were the pathways that were found to be primarily affected, resulting in abnormal metabolites such as glucose-1P, Glucose, gluconic acid, myo-inositol, sorbitol and glycerol.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We recently demonstrated that 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a dual energy ( inhibition) and ER-stress (N-linked-glycosylation inhibition) inducer, leads to cell death in ALL via ER-stress/UPR-mediated apoptosis. Among ALL subtypes, BCR-ABL+ ALL cells exhibited the highest sensitivity to 2-DG suggesting BCR-ABL expression may be linked to this increased vulnerability. To confirm the role of BCR-ABL, we constructed a NALM6/BCR-ABL stable cell line and found significant increase in 2-DG-induced apoptosis compared to control. We found that Mcl-1 was downregulated by agents inducing ER-stress and Mcl-1 levels correlated with ALL sensitivity. In addition, we showed that Mcl-1 expression is positively regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway, dependent on BCR-ABL, and further downregulated by combining ER-stressors with TKIs. We determined that energy/ER stressors led to translational repression of Mcl-1 via the AMPK/mTOR and UPR/PERK/eIF2α pathways. Taken together, our data indicate that BCR-ABL+ ALL exhibits heightened sensitivity to induction of energy and ER-stress through inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway, and translational repression of Mcl-1 expression via AMPK/mTOR and UPR/PERK/eIF2α pathways. This study supports further consideration of strategies combining energy/ER-stress inducers with BCR-ABL TKIs for future clinical translation in BCR-ABL+ ALL patients.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of changes in cancer metabolism in response to the inhibitors creates an opportunity for better understanding of the interplay between cell signaling and metabolism and, from the translational perspective, potential early evaluation of response to the inhibitors as well as treatment optimization. We performed genomic, metabolomic, and fluxomic analyses to evaluate the mechanism of action of the Bruton's  kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib (IBR) in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. Our comprehensive analysis of the data generated by these diverse technologies revealed that IBR profoundly affected key metabolic pathways in IBR-sensitive cells including , pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis while having much less effects on IBR-poorly responsive cells. Changes in H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable lactate and alanine concentrations emerged as promising biomarkers of response and resistance to IBR as demonstrated from experiments on various MCL cell lines. The metabolic network analysis on the C MRS and C LC/MS experimental data provided quantitative estimates of various intracellular fluxes and energy contributions. Glutaminolysis contributed over 50% of mitochondrial ATP production. Administration of the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 induced growth suppression of the IBR-poorly responsive cells. IMPLICATIONS: Our study demonstrates application of the advanced metabolomic/fluxomic techniques for comprehensive, precise, and prompt evaluations of the effects of kinase inhibition in MCL cells and has strong translational implications by potentially permitting early evaluation of cancer patient response versus resistance to kinase inhibitors and on design of novel therapies for overcoming the resistance.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996049>tRNA Fragments Show Intertwining with mRNAs of Specific Repeat Content and Have Links to Disparities.</a></h2><p>tRNA-derived fragments (tRF) are a class of potent regulatory RNAs. We mined the datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) representing 32 cancer types with a deterministic and exhaustive pipeline for tRNA fragments. We found that mitochondrial tRNAs contribute disproportionally more tRFs than nuclear tRNAs. Through integrative analyses, we uncovered a multitude of statistically significant and context-dependent associations between the identified tRFs and mRNAs. In many of the 32 cancer types, these associations involve mRNAs from developmental processes, receptor  kinase signaling, the proteasome, and metabolic pathways that include , oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP synthesis. Even though the pathways are common to multiple cancers, the association of specific mRNAs with tRFs depends on and differs from cancer to cancer. The associations between tRFs and mRNAs extend to genomic properties as well; specifically, tRFs are positively correlated with shorter genes that have a higher density in repeats, such as ALUs, MIRs, and ERVLs. Conversely, tRFs are negatively correlated with longer genes that have a lower repeat density, suggesting a possible dichotomy between cell proliferation and differentiation. Analyses of bladder, lung, and kidney cancer data indicate that the tRF-mRNA wiring can also depend on a patient's sex. Sex-dependent associations involve cyclin-dependent kinases in bladder cancer, the MAPK signaling pathway in lung cancer, and purine metabolism in kidney cancer. Taken together, these findings suggest diverse and wide-ranging roles for tRFs and highlight the extensive interconnections of tRFs with key cellular processes and human genomic architecture.

Although TNS2 can bind with Axl, the details of their interactions have not been elucidated. TNS2 is involved in IRS-1 signaling pathway. In this study, we confirmed the relationship between TNS2 expression and the expression of Axl, IRS-1, PDK1 and Glut4 in pancreatic cancer patients.The expression levels of TNS2, Axl, IRS-1, PDK1 and Glut4 in human cancer cells were measured by Western blot and/or IP-Western blot assays. Paired samples of pancreatic cancer and non-cancer tissues were obtained from 33 patients and were used to construct tissue microarrays. The expression levels of these markers in the tissue microarrays were measured by enzyme-linked Immunohistochemistry assay, and the relationships were analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test and two-tailed t-test analysis.We demonstrated for the first time that TNS2 is a phosphorylation substrate of Axl. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between TNS2 expression and the expression of Axl, IRS-1, PDK1 and Glut4 in pancreatic cancer patients. Based on these results, we suggest that Axl modulates glucose metabolism potentially through TNS2 and IRS-1. We hypothesize that there exists a novel mechanism whereby Axl binds to and phosphorylates TNS2, releasing TNS2 from interaction with IRS-1 and resulting in increased stability of IRS-1. The two key enzymes of aerobic  (Glut4 and PDK1) were found to be up-regulated by Axl/TNS2/IRS-1 cross-talk and may play a critical role in glucose metabolism of cancer cells.Our results revealed for the first time that Axl binds to and phosphorylates TNS2 and that Axl/TNS2/IRS-1 cross-talk may potentially play a critical role in glucose metabolism of cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29930100>Interplay between ShcA Signaling and PGC-1α Triggers Targetable Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>The ShcA adaptor protein transduces oncogenic signals downstream of receptor  kinases. We show here that breast tumors engage the ShcA pathway to increase their metabolism. ShcA signaling enhanced glucose catabolism through  and oxidative phosphorylation, rendering breast cancer cells critically dependent on glucose. ShcA signaling simultaneously increased the metabolic rate and flexibility of breast cancer cells by inducing the PGC-1α transcriptional coactivator, a central regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. Breast tumors that engaged ShcA signaling were critically dependent on PGC-1α to support their increased metabolic rate. PGC-1α deletion drastically delayed breast tumor onset in an orthotopic mouse model, highlighting a key role for PGC-1α in tumor initiation. Conversely, reduced ShcA signaling impaired both the metabolic rate and flexibility of breast cancer cells, rendering them reliant on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic reprogramming exposed a targetable metabolic vulnerability, leading to a sensitization of breast tumors to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I (biguanides). Genetic inhibition of ShcA signaling in the Polyoma virus middle T (MT) breast cancer mouse model sensitized mammary tumors to biguanides during the earliest stages of breast cancer progression. Tumor initiation and growth were selectively and severely impaired in MT/ShcA-deficient animals. These data demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming is a key component of ShcA signaling and serves an unappreciated yet vital role during breast cancer initiation and progression. These data further unravel a novel interplay between ShcA and PGC-1α in the coordination of metabolic reprogramming and demonstrate the sensitivity of breast tumors to drugs targeting oxidative phosphorylation.

Further, binding of uPA to uPAR regulates expression of molecules that govern cell invasion, including extracellular matrix metallo-proteinases inducer (EMPPRIN) and enolase, a glycolytyc enzyme that also serves as a plasminogen receptor, thus providing a common denominator between tumor metabolism and phenotypic invasive features. Such effects depend on the α5β1-integrin-mediated uPAR connection with EGFR in melanoma cells with engagement of the PI3K-mTOR-HIFα pathway.

Sunitinib is a multitargeted receptor  kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of highly vascularized tumors. In diabetic patients, sunitinib significantly decreases blood glucose. However, a considerable proportion of sunitinib-treated patients develop cardiac dysfunction or failure. We asked whether sunitinib treatment results in shift towards  in the heart. Glucose uptake by the heart was increased fivefold in mice treated with sunitinib. Transcript analysis by qPCR revealed an induction of genes associated with  and reactivation of the fetal gene program. Additionally, we observed a shift in the enzyme pyruvate kinase from the adult M1 (PKM1) isoform to the fetal M2 (PKM2) isoform, a hallmark of the Warburg Effect. This novel observation led us to examine whether a similar shift occurs in human heart failure. Examination of tissue from patients with heart failure similarly displayed an induction of PKM2. Moreover, this phenomenon was partially reversed following mechanical unloading. We propose that pyruvate kinase isoform switching represents a novel feature of the fetal gene program in the failing heart.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30319974>Ibrutinib Resistance Is Reduced by an Inhibitor of Fatty Acid Oxidation in Primary CLL Lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease, characterized by the accumulation of malignant B-lymphocytes in the blood stream (quiescent state) and homing tissues (where they can proliferate). In CLL, the targeting of B-cell receptor signaling through a Burton's  kinase inhibitor (ibrutinib) has rendered outstanding clinical results. However, complete remission is not guaranteed due to drug resistance or relapse, revealing the need for novel approaches for CLL treatment. The characterization of metabolic rewiring in proliferative cancer cells is already being applied for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, but our knowledge of quiescent cell metabolism-relevant for CLL cells-is still fragmentary. Recently, we reported that glutamine metabolism in primary CLL cells bearing the del11q deletion is different from their del11q negative counterparts, making del11q cells especially sensitive to glutaminase and  inhibitors. In this work, we used our primary CLL lymphocyte bank and compounds interfering with central carbon metabolism to define metabolic traits associated with ibrutinib resistance. We observe a differential basal metabolite uptake linked to ibrutinib resistance, favoring glutamine uptake and catabolism. Upon ibrutinib treatment, the redox balance in ibrutinib resistant cells is shifted toward NADPH accumulation, without an increase in glutamine uptake, suggesting alternative metabolic rewiring such as the activation of fatty acid oxidation. In accordance to this idea, the curtailing of fatty acid oxidation by CPT1 inhibition (etomoxir) re-sensitized resistant cells to ibrutinib.

We investigated the role of 5-HT signaling in the growth of pancreatic tumors.We measured the levels of proteins that regulate 5-HT synthesis, packaging, and degradation in pancreata from Kras/Trp53/Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice, which develop pancreatic tumors, as well as in PDAC cell lines and a tissue microarray containing 81 human PDAC samples. We also analyzed expression levels of proteins involved in 5-HT synthesis and degradation by immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray containing 311 PDAC specimens, and associated expression levels with patient survival times. 5-HT level in 14 matched PDAC tumor and non-tumor tissues were analyzed by ELISA. PDAC cell lines were incubated with 5-HT and cell survival and apoptosis were measured. We analyzed expression of the 5-HT receptor HTR2B in PDAC cells and effects of receptor agonists and antagonists, as well as HTR2B knockdown with small hairpin RNAs. We determined the effects of 5-HT stimulation on gene expression profiles of BxPC-3 cells. Regulation of  by 5-HT signaling via HTR2B was assessed by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analyses, as well as by determination of the extracellular acid ratio, glucose consumption, and lactate production. Primary PDACs, with or without exposure to SB204741 (a selective antagonist of HTR2B), were grown as xenograft tumors in mice, and SB204741 was administered to tumor-bearing KPC mice; tumor growth and metabolism were measured by imaging analyses.In immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray of PDAC specimens, increased levels of TPH1 and decreased level of MAOA, which regulate 5-HT synthesis and degradation, correlated with stage and size of PDACs and shorter patient survival time. We found levels of 5-HT to be increased in human PDAC tissues compared with non-tumor pancreatic tissues, and PDAC cell lines compared with non-transformed pancreatic cells. Incubation of PDAC cell lines with 5-HT increased proliferation and prevented apoptosis. Agonists of HTR2B, but not other 5-HT receptors, promoted proliferation and prevented apoptosis of PDAC cells. Knockdown of HTR2B in PDAC cells, or incubation of cells with HTR2B inhibitors, reduced their growth as xenograft tumors in mice. We observed a correlation between 5-HT and glycolytic flux in PDAC cells; levels of metabolic enzymes involved in , the phosphate pentose pathway, and hexosamine biosynthesis pathway increased significantly in PDAC cells following 5-HT stimulation. 5-HT stimulation led to formation of the HTR2B-LYN-p85 complex, which increased PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and the Warburg effect by increasing protein levels of MYC and HIF1A. Administration of SB204741 to KPC mice slowed growth and metabolism of established pancreatic tumors and prolonged survival of the mice.Human PDACs have increased levels of 5-HT, and PDAC cells increase expression of its receptor, HTR2B. These increases allow for tumor  under metabolic stress and promote growth of pancreatic tumors and PDAC xenograft tumors in mice.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, all these metabolic requirements could be in principle satisfied from glucose. Here we investigate why cancer cells do not satisfy their metabolic demands using aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. Based on the typical composition of a mammalian cell we quantify the energy demand and the OxPhos burden of cell biosynthesis from glucose. Our calculation demonstrates that aerobic growth from glucose is feasible up to a minimum doubling time that is proportional to the OxPhos burden and inversely proportional to the mitochondria OxPhos capacity. To grow faster cancer cells must activate aerobic  for energy generation and uncouple NADH generation from biosynthesis. To uncouple biosynthesis from NADH generation cancer cells can synthesize lipids from carbon sources that do not produce NADH in their catabolism, including acetate and the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine and . Finally, we show that cancer cell lines have an OxPhos capacity that is insufficient to support aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. We conclude that selection for high rate of biosynthesis implies a selection for aerobic  and uncoupling biosynthesis from NADH generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27861144>Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation suppresses the development of osimertinib resistance in a preclinical model of EGFR-driven lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Metabolic plasticity is an emerging hallmark of cancer, and increased  is often observed in transformed cells. Small molecule inhibitors that target driver oncogenes can potentially inhibit the glycolytic pathway. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is a novel EGFR  kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is potent and selective for sensitising (EGFRm) and T790M resistance mutations. Clinical studies have shown osimertinib to be efficacious in patients with EGFRm/ T790M advanced NSCLC who have progressed after EGFR-TKI treatment. However experience with targeted therapies suggests that acquired resistance may emerge. Thus there is a need to characterize resistance mechanisms and to devise ways to prevent, delay or overcome osimertinib resistance. We show here that osimertinib suppresses  in parental EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma lines, but has not in osimertinib-resistant cell lines. Critically, we show osimertinib treatment induces a strict dependence on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), as OxPhos inhibitors significantly delay the long-term development of osimertinib resistance in osimertinib-sensitive lines. Accordingly, growth conditions which promote a less glycolytic phenotype confer a degree of osimertinib resistance. Our data support a model in which the combination of osimertinib and OxPhos inhibitors can delay or prevent resistance in osimertinib-naïve tumour cells, and represents a novel strategy that warrants further pre-clinical investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527276>Serine and SAM Responsive Complex SESAME Regulates Histone Modification Crosstalk by Sensing Cellular Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key enzyme for  and catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, which supplies cellular energy. PKM2 also phosphorylates histone H3 threonine 11 (H3T11); however, it is largely unknown how PKM2 links cellular metabolism to chromatin regulation. Here, we show that the yeast PKM2 homolog, Pyk1, is a part of a novel protein complex named SESAME (Serine-responsive SAM-containing Metabolic Enzyme complex), which contains serine metabolic enzymes, SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) synthetases, and an acetyl-CoA synthetase. SESAME interacts with the Set1 H3K4 methyltransferase complex, which requires SAM synthesized from SESAME, and recruits SESAME to target genes, resulting in phosphorylation of H3T11. SESAME regulates the crosstalk between H3K4 methylation and H3T11 phosphorylation by sensing  and glucose-derived serine metabolism. This leads to auto-regulation of PYK1 expression. Thus, our study provides insights into the mechanism of regulating gene expression, responding to cellular metabolism via chromatin modifications.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Constant at basal level it may become highly active in response to cellular stress. The type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), which accumulates under stressful cell conditions, plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy and cells lacking this enzyme display impaired autophagy/mitophagy and a consequent shift their metabolism to . To further define the molecular partners of TG2 involved in these cellular processes, we analysed the TG2 interactome under normal and starved conditions discovering that TG2 interacts with various proteins belonging to different functional categories. Herein we show that TG2 interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a rate limiting enzyme of  which is responsible for maintaining a glycolytic phenotype in malignant cells and displays non metabolic functions, including transcriptional co-activation and protein kinase activity. Interestingly, the ablation of PKM2 led to the decrease of intracellular TG2's transamidating activity paralleled by an increase of its  phosphorylation. Along with this, a significant decrease of ULK1 and Beclin1 was also recorded, thus suggesting a block in the upstream regulation of autophagosome formation. These data suggest that the PKM2/TG2 interplay plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy in particular under cellular stressful conditions such as those displayed by cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396957>Oxidative phosphorylation as a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>In contrast to prior belief, cancer cells require oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to strive, and exacerbated OXPHOS dependency frequently characterizes cancer stem cells, as well as primary or acquired resistance against chemotherapy or  kinase inhibitors. A growing arsenal of therapeutic agents is being designed to suppress the transfer of mitochondria from stromal to malignant cells, to interfere with mitochondrial biogenesis, to directly inhibit respiratory chain complexes, or to disrupt mitochondrial function in other ways. For the experimental treatment of cancers, OXPHOS inhibitors can be advantageously combined with  kinase inhibitors, as well as with other strategies to inhibit , thereby causing a lethal energy crisis. Unfortunately, most of the preclinical data arguing in favor of OXPHOS inhibition have been obtained in xenograft models, in which human cancer cells are implanted in immunodeficient mice. Future studies on OXPHOS inhibitors should elaborate optimal treatment schedules and combination regimens that stimulate-or at least are compatible with-anticancer immune responses for long-term tumor control.© 2019 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606631>Delaying the biosynthesis of aromatic secondary metabolites in postharvest strawberry fruit exposed to elevated CO atmosphere.</a></h2><p>Aromatic secondary metabolites are closely related to quality attributes of postharvest fruit. In the present study, 20% CO was applied to strawberry fruit to investigate the regulation of elevated CO on aromatic secondary metabolites. The results showed that elevated CO delayed accumulations of anthocyanins, eugenol and lignin. Phenylalanine and , the precursors of the above secondary metabolites, were 18.90% and 35.61%, respectively, lower in CO-treated fruit compared with the control on day 6. Furthermore, enzyme activities and transcriptional profiles analysis showed pentose phosphate pathway and  were activated by elevated CO whereas the aromatic amino acids (AAAs) pathway was inhibited. These results indicated that elevated CO restricted carbon flux into aromatic secondary metabolism by inhibiting the AAAs pathway, leading to the decrease of phenylalanine and , and thus, delayed the accumulation of aromatic secondary metabolites. In addition, the effect of elevated CO was eliminated after transferred CO-treated fruit to air.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered metabolism and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of  phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPF) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase M2, a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. Furthermore, CENPF cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer metabolism, potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning. Additional quantitative immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzes on a series of PC tumor microarrays demonstrated that CENPF expression is significantly increased in higher-risk PC patients. Based on these findings, we suggest the CENPF may be an important regulator of PC metabolism through its role in the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26271120>Cryptococcal phosphoglucose isomerase is required for virulence factor production, cell wall integrity and stress resistance.</a></h2><p>Regulation of virulence factor production in the pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans remains to be fully illustrated. We present here a finding that a gene, encoding the  enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi1), is critical for the biosynthesis of melanin and capsule, cell wall integrity and resistance to stress conditions. A leaky mutant of the yeast, LZM19, resulted from an insertion of T-DNA in the PGI1 promoter region, expressed PGI1 at a level only 1.9% of the wild type. LZM19 could synthesize the pigment melanin in the presence of 2% glucose, suggesting a status of LAC1 derepression. Phenotypically, capsule biosynthesis in LZM19 was remarkably reduced. Integrity of the cell wall and plasma membrane of LZM19 were impaired based on its sensitivity to Congo red and SDS. Also, LZM19 exhibited hypersensitivity to osmotic stress generated by 2 M NaCl or 1 M KCl, indicating possible impairment in the HOG signaling pathway. Furthermore, LZM19 failed to utilize mannose and fructose, suggesting a possible involvement of Pgi1 in the breakdown of these two sugars. Our results revealed a crucial role of PGI1 in coordination of the production of virulence factors, cell wall integrity and stress response in C. neoformans.© FEMS 2015. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to determine whether increased FAK levels reduced rhabdomyolysis in skeletal muscle too.In a translational in vivo experiment, rat lower limbs were subjected to 4 hours of ischemia followed by 24 or 72 hours of reperfusion. FAK expression was stimulated 7 days before (via somatic transfection with pCMV-driven FAK expression plasmid) and outcomes were measured against non-transfected and empty transfected controls. Slow oxidative (i.e., mitochondria-rich) and fast glycolytic (i.e., mitochondria-poor) type muscles were analyzed separately regarding rhabdomyolysis, apoptosis, and inflammation. Severity of IR injury was assessed using paired non-ischemic controls.After 24 hours of reperfusion, marked rhabdomyolysis was found in non-transfected and empty plasmid-transfected fast-type glycolytic muscle, tibialis anterior. Prior transfection enhanced FAK concentration significantly (p = 0.01). Concomitantly, levels of BAX, promoting mitochondrial transition pores, were reduced sixfold (p = 0.02) together with a blunted inflammation (p = 0.01) and reduced rhabdomyolysis (p = 0.003). Slow oxidative muscle, m. soleus, reacted differently: although apoptosis was detectable after IR, rhabdomyolysis did not appear before 72 hours of reperfusion; and FAK levels were not enhanced in ischemic muscle despite transfection (p = 0.66).IR-induced skeletal muscle rhabdomyolysis is a fiber type-specific phenomenon that appears to be modulated by mitochondria reserves. Stimulation of FAK may exploit these reserves constituting a potential therapeutic approach to reduce tissue loss following acute limb IR in fast-type muscle.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

The molecular basis for this toxicity and its relationship to therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear; we therefore undertook a systems-level analysis of human cardiomyocytes (CMs) exposed to four TKIs. CMs differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were exposed to sunitinib, sorafenib, lapatinib, or erlotinib, and responses were assessed by functional assays, microscopy, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry (GEO: GSE114686; PRIDE: PXD012043). TKIs have diverse effects on hiPSC-CMs distinct from inhibition of -kinase-mediated signal transduction; cardiac metabolism is particularly sensitive. Following sorafenib treatment, oxidative phosphorylation is downregulated, resulting in a profound defect in mitochondrial energetics. Cells adapt by upregulating aerobic . Adaptation makes cells less acutely sensitive to sorafenib but may have long-term negative consequences. Thus, CMs exhibit adaptive responses to anti-cancer drugs conceptually similar to those previously shown in tumors to mediate drug resistance.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Sprouty2 (Spry2) is a modulator of receptor  kinase signaling and inhibits cell proliferation by a number of different mechanisms. Because of the seemingly opposite actions of HIFα subunits and Spry2 on cellular processes, we investigated whether Spry2 regulates the levels of HIF1α and HIF2α proteins. In cell lines from different types of tumors in which the decreased protein levels of Spry2 have been associated with poor prognosis, silencing of Spry2 elevated HIF1α protein levels. Increases in HIF1α and HIF2α protein levels due to silencing of Spry2 also up-regulated HIFα target genes. Using HIF1α as a prototype, we show that Spry2 decreases HIF1α stability and enhances the ubiquitylation of HIF1α by a von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-dependent mechanism. Spry2 also exists in a complex with HIF1α. Because Spry2 can also associate with pVHL, using a mutant form of Spry2 (3P/3A-Spry2) that binds HIF1α, but not pVHL, we show that WT-Spry2, but not the 3P/3A-Spry2 decreases HIF1α protein levels. In accordance, expression of WT-Spry2, but not 3P/3A-Spry2 results in a decrease in HIF1α-sensitive glucose uptake. Together our data suggest that Spry2 acts as a scaffold to bring more pVHL/associated E3 ligase in proximity of HIF1α and increase its ubiquitylation and degradation. This represents a novel action for Spry2 in modulating biological processes regulated by HIFα subunits.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550118>S100A9 potentiates the activation of neutrophils by the etiological agent of gout, monosodium urate crystals.</a></h2><p>Gout is one of the most painful types of arthritis that arises when the body mounts an acute inflammatory reaction against a crystallized form of uric acid known as monosodium urate crystals (MSUs). Although MSUs are known to activate neutrophils, the most abundant leukocyte in the synovial fluid of patients with gout, few studies have investigated the effect on neutrophils of the simultaneous stimulation with MSU and proinflammatory mediators in the inflamed joint. Herein, we focused on a protein that is highly expressed in the synovium in gout, S100A9. The predominant expression of S100A9 in and around blood vessels suggests it may prime neutrophils during their migration toward the inflamed joint. Using a combination of functional and signaling assays, we found that S100A9 enhances the production of radical oxygen species as well as IL-1 and IL-8 release by human neutrophils activated with MSU. Moreover, upstream and downstream signaling events activated by MSUs in human neutrophils were also potentiated by S100A9, including the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores,  phosphorylation, the serine phosphorylation of PKC substrates, Akt, and p38. We also show that S100A9 alone increases  in human neutrophils, which is suggestive of an additional mechanism through which neutrophils can be primed. Together, our observations indicate a novel way in which S100A9 may contribute to the pathogenesis of gout, by priming neutrophils to respond to MSUs.© Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374533>Circadian control of p75 neurotrophin receptor leads to alternate activation of Nrf2 and c-Rel to reset energy metabolism in astrocytes via brain-derived neurotrophic factor.</a></h2><p>Circadian clock genes regulate energy metabolism partly through neurotrophins in the body. The low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 is a clock component directly regulated by the transcriptional factor Clock:Bmal1 complex. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is expressed in the brain and plays a key role in coordinating metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes. BDNF transduces signals through TrkB and p75 receptors. This review highlights a novel molecular mechanism by which BDNF via circadian control of p75 leads to daily resetting of glucose and glycogen metabolism in brain astrocytes to accommodate their functional interaction with neurons. Astrocytes store glycogen as an energy reservoir to provide active neurons with the glycolytic metabolite lactate. Astrocytes predominantly express the truncated receptor TrkB.T1 which lacks an intracellular receptor  kinase domain. TrkB.T1 retains the capacity to regulate cell morphology through regulation of Rho GTPases. In contrast, p75 mediates generation of the bioactive lipid ceramide upon stimulation with BDNF and inhibits PKA activation. As ceramide directly activates PKCζ, we discuss the importance of the TrkB.T1-p75-ceramide-PKCζ signaling axis in the stimulation of glycogen and lipid synthesis and activation of RhoA. Ceramide-PKCζ-casein kinase 2 signaling activates Nrf2 to support oxidative phosphorylation via upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. In the absence of p75, TrkB.T1 functionally interacts with adenosine AR and dopamine D1R receptors to enhance cAMP-PKA signaling and activate Rac1 and NF-κB c-Rel, favoring glycogen hydrolysis, gluconeogenesis and aerobic . Thus, diurnal changes in p75 levels in astrocytes resets energy metabolism via BDNF to accommodate their metabolic interaction with neurons.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Other cytokines and signaling molecules also participate in the early part of the process. Regeneration employs effective redundancy schemes to compensate for the missing signals. Elimination of any single extracellular signaling pathway only delays but does not abolish the process. Our present study, however, shows that combined systemic elimination of MET and EGFR signaling (MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice) abolishes liver regeneration, prevents restoration of liver mass, and leads to liver decompensation. MET knockout or simply EGFR-inhibited mice had distinct and signaling-specific alterations in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, phosphatase and tensin homolog, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α, etc. In the combined MET and EGFR signaling elimination of MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice, however, alterations dependent on either MET or EGFR combined to create shutdown of many programs vital to hepatocytes. These included decrease in expression of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism, urea cycle, cell replication, and mitochondrial functions and increase in expression of  enzymes. There was, however, increased expression of genes of plasma proteins. Hepatocyte average volume decreased to 35% of control, with a proportional decrease in the dimensions of the hepatic lobules. Mice died at 15-18 days after hepatectomy with ascites, increased plasma ammonia, and very small livers.MET and EGFR separately control many nonoverlapping signaling endpoints, allowing for compensation when only one of the signals is blocked, though the combined elimination of the signals is not tolerated; the results provide critical new information on interactive MET and EGFR signaling and the contribution of their combined absence to regeneration arrest and liver decompensation.

It represents one of the most frequent causes of heart failure and sudden death in Latin America. Herein, we provide evidence that aerobic glycolytic pathway activation in monocytes drives nitric oxide (NO) production, triggering  nitration (TN) on CD8+ T cells and dysfunction in patients with chronic Chagas disease. Monocytes from patients exhibited a higher frequency of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and increased expression of its target genes/proteins. Nonclassical monocytes are expanded in patients' peripheral blood and represent an important source of NO. Monocytes entail CD8+ T cell surface nitration because both the frequency of nonclassical monocytes and that of NO-producing monocytes positively correlated with the percentage of TN+ lymphocytes. Inhibition of  in in vitro-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased the inflammatory properties of monocytes/macrophages, diminishing the frequency of IL-1β- and NO-producing cells.

In addition, particulate β-glucan converts immunosuppressive TAM via the C-type lectin receptor dectin-1-induced spleen  kinase-Card9-Erk pathway. Further in vivo studies show that oral particulate β-glucan treatment significantly delays tumor growth, which is associated with in vivo TAM phenotype conversion and enhanced effector T cell activation. Mice injected with particulate β-glucan-treated TAM mixed with tumor cells have significantly reduced tumor burden with less blood vascular vessels compared with those with TAM plus tumor cell injection. In addition, macrophage depletion significantly reduced the therapeutic efficacy of particulate β-glucan in tumor-bearing mice. These findings have established a new paradigm for macrophage polarization and immunosuppressive TAM conversion and shed light on the action mode of β-glucan treatment in cancer.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26714846>Neuregulin improves response to glucose tolerance test in control and diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Neuregulin (NRG) is an EGF-related growth factor that binds to the  kinase receptors ErbB3 and ErbB4, thus inducing tissue development and muscle glucose utilization during contraction. Here, we analyzed whether NRG has systemic effects regulating glycemia in control and type 2 diabetic rats. To this end, recombinant NRG (rNRG) was injected into Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and their respective lean littermates 15 min before a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed. rNRG enhanced glucose tolerance without promoting the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) or insulin receptor substrates (IRS) in muscle and liver. However, in control rats, rNRG induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in liver but not in muscle. In liver, rNRG increased ErbB3  phosphorylation and its binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), thus indicating that rNRG activates the ErbB3/PI3K/PKB signaling pathway. rNRG increased glycogen content in liver but not in muscle. rNRG also increased the content of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), an activator of hepatic , and lactate in liver but not in muscle. Increases in lactate were abrogated by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, in incubated hepatocytes. The liver of ZDF rats showed a reduced content of ErbB3 receptors, entailing a minor stimulation of the rNRG-induced PKB/GSK-3 cascade and resulting in unaltered hepatic glycogen content. Nonetheless, rNRG increased hepatic Fru-2,6-P2 and augmented lactate both in liver and in plasma of diabetic rats. As a whole, rNRG improved response to the GTT in both control and diabetic rats by enhancing hepatic glucose utilization.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572179>Effects of Tianshu Capsule on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats as Revealed by H-NMR-Based Metabolic Profiling.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, resulting in serious complications such as cardiovascular damage and chronic kidney disease. Tianshu capsule (TSC), composed of Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort) and Tianma (Gastrodiaelata Blume), has been widely used to treat the blood stasis type of headache and migraine in clinic. Results of previous research showed its antihypertensive effects, but the underlying mechanisms were still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TSC on spontaneously hypertensive rats by H NMR-based metabonomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIAS), explore potential biomarkers and targets, and probe the potential mechanism of TSC on antihypertensive treatment. The results showed that TSC could decrease the product of oxidative stress (MDA) and enhance the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, down-regulate the expression of enzymes (LDHA, PKM2 and HK2) related to , and perturb the levels of a series of amino acids (isoleucine, alanine, asparagine, citrate, etc.) and pathways. Multivariate statistical analyses showed remarkable changes in some endogenous metabolites after administrating TSC related to oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism disturbances. Some enzymes (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2,  hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, etc.) related to metabolic biomarkers were predicted as the potential targets of TSC treatment on SHRs. The discoveries are helpful to understand the antihypertensive mechanism of TSC and provide theoretical evidence for its future research, development and clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Ma, Li, Zhao and Chen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28076845>Molecular dynamics simulation reveals how phosphorylation of  26 of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 upregulates  and promotes tumor growth.</a></h2><p>Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) catalyzes the eighth step of  and is often found upregulated in cancer cells. To test the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of  26 residue of PGAM1 greatly enhances its activity, we performed both conventional and steered molecular dynamics simulations on the binding and unbinding of PGAM1 to its substrates, with  26 either phosphorylated or not. We analyzed the simulated data in terms of structural stability, hydrogen bond formation, binding free energy, etc. We found that  26 phosphorylation enhances the binding of PGAM1 to its substrates through generating electrostatic environment and structural features that are advantageous to the binding.

The intracellular and extracellular pH of cancer cells affects their growth; however, the role of ATP6V0C in highly invasive esophageal cancer cells (ECCs) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of ATP6V0C in glucose metabolism in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion attenuated ECC proliferation, invasion, and suppressed glucose metabolism, as indicated by reduced glucose uptake and decreased lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in cells. Consistent with this, expression of glycolytic enzyme and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were also decreased by ATP6V0C knockdown. Mechanistically, ATP6V0C interacted with pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), a key regulator of  in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion reduced PKM2 phosphorylation at  residue 105 (Tyr), leading to inhibition of nuclear translocation of PKM2. In addition, ATP6V0C was recruited at hypoxia response element (HRE) sites in the lactate dehydrogenase A () gene for .

However, recent studies reported that NBPT affects urea uptake and urease activity in plants. To shed light on these latter aspects, the effects of NBPT were studied analysing transcriptomic and metabolic changes occurring in urea-fed maize seedlings after a short-term exposure to the inhibitor. We provide evidence that NBPT treatment led to a wide reprogramming of plant metabolism. NBPT inhibited the activity of endogenous urease limiting the release and assimilation of ureic-ammonium, with a simultaneous accumulation of urea in plant tissues. Furthermore, NBPT determined changes in the glutamine, glutamate, and asparagine contents. Microarray data indicate that NBPT affects ureic-N assimilation and primary metabolism, such as , TCA cycle, and electron transport chain, while activates the phenylalanine/-derivative pathway. Moreover, the expression of genes relating to the transport and complexation of divalent metals was strongly modulated by NBPT. Data here presented suggest that when NBPT is provided in conjunction with urea an imbalance between C and N compounds might occur in plant cells. Under this condition, root cells also seem to activate a response to maintain the homeostasis of some micronutrients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27912096>Drugging ACAT1 for Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>In this issue, Fan et al.

Previous proteomic studies have identified over 170,000 phosphorylation sites and 15,000 K-acetylation sites in mammals. We recently reported that the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD), which functions in the regulation of water-reabsorption, via the actions of vasopressin, expresses many of the enzymes that can modulated K-acetylation. The purpose of this study was to determine the K-acetylated or phosphorylated proteins expressed in IMCD cells. Second we questioned whether vasopressin V2 receptor activation significantly affects the IMCD acetylome or phosphoproteome? K-acetylated or serine-, threonine-, or -phosphorylated peptides were identified from native rat IMCDs by proteomic analysis with four different enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, ASP-N, or Glu-C) to generate a high-resolution proteome. K-acetylation was identified in 431 unique proteins, and 64% of the K-acetylated sites were novel. The acetylated proteins were expressed in all compartments of the cell and were enriched in pathways including  and vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption. In the vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption pathway, eight proteins were acetylated, including the novel identification of the basolateral water channel, AQP3, acetylated at K282; 215 proteins were phosphorylated in this IMCD cohort, including AQP2 peptides that were phosphorylated at four serines: 256, 261, 264, and 269. Acute dDAVP did not significantly affect the IMCD acetylome; however, it did significantly affect previously known vasopressin-regulated phosphorylation sites. In conclusion, presence of K-acetylated proteins involved in metabolism, ion, and water transport in the IMCD points to multiple roles of K-acetylation beyond its canonical role in transcriptional regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25476535>Effects of intratumoral inflammatory process on 18F-FDG uptake: pathologic and comparative study with 18F-fluoro-α-methyltyrosine PET/CT in oral squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The accurate depiction of both biologic and anatomic profiles of tumors has long been a challenge in PET imaging. An inflammation, which is innate in the carcinogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), frequently complicates the image analysis because of the limitations of (18)F-FDG and maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)). New PET parameters, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG), as well as (18)F-fluoro-α-methyltyrosine ((18)F-FAMT), a malignancy-specific amino acid-based PET radiotracer, are considered more comprehensive in tumor image analysis. Here, we showed the substantial effects of the intratumoral inflammatory process on (18)F-FDG uptake and further study the possibility of MTV and TLG to predict both tumor biology (proliferation activity) and anatomy (pathologic tumor volume).(18)F-FDG and (18)F-FAMT PET images from 25 OSCC patients were analyzed. SUV(max) on the tumor site was obtained. PET volume computerized-assisted reporting was used to generate a volume of interest to obtain MTV and TLG for (18)F-FDG and total lesion retention (TLR) for (18)F-FAMT. The whole tumor dissected from surgery was measured and sectioned for pathologic analysis of tumor inflammation grade and Ki-67 labeling index.The high SUV(max) of (18)F-FDG was related to the high inflammation grade. The SUV(max )ratio of (18)F-FDG to (18)F-FAMT was higher in inflammatory tumors (P < 0.05) whereas the corresponding value in tumors with a low inflammation grade was kept low. All (18)F-FAMT parameters were correlated with Ki-67 labeling index (P < 0.01). Pathologic tumor volume predicted from MTV of (18)F-FAMT was more accurate (R = 0.90, bias = 3.4 ± 6.42 cm(3), 95% confidence interval = 0.77-6.09 cm(3)) than that of (18)F-FDG (R = 0.77, bias = 8.1 ± 11.17 cm(3), 95% confidence interval = 3.45-12.67 cm(3)).(18)F-FDG uptake was overestimated by additional uptake related to the intratumoral inflammatory process, whereas (18)F-FAMT simply accumulated in tumors according to tumor activity as evaluated by Ki-67 labeling index in OSCC.© 2015 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221965>Identification of metabolic vulnerabilities of receptor  kinases-driven cancer.</a></h2><p>One of the biggest hurdles for the development of metabolism-targeted therapies is to identify the responsive tumor subsets. However, the metabolic vulnerabilities for most human cancers remain unclear. Establishing the link between metabolic signatures and the oncogenic alterations of receptor  kinases (RTK), the most well-defined cancer genotypes, may precisely direct metabolic intervention to a broad patient population. By integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics, we herein show that oncogenic RTK activation causes distinct metabolic preference. Specifically, EGFR activation branches  to the serine synthesis for nucleotide biosynthesis and redox homeostasis, whereas FGFR activation recycles lactate to fuel oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation. Genetic alterations of EGFR and FGFR stratify the responsive tumors to pharmacological inhibitors that target serine synthesis and lactate fluxes, respectively. Together, this study provides the molecular link between cancer genotypes and metabolic dependency, providing basis for patient stratification in metabolism-targeted therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25263439>TRIM35 Interacts with pyruvate kinase isoform M2 to suppress the Warburg effect and tumorigenicity in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Tripartite motif-containing protein 35 (TRIM35) is a member of RBCC family, which has a highly conserved order consisting of a RING domain followed by one or two B-Box domains and then a coiled-coil domain. We previously identified TRIM35 as a novel tumor suppressor in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism that TRIM35 uses to suppress tumorigenicity is largely unknown. Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) has been demonstrated to have a central role in metabolic reprogramming during cancer progression. Phosphorylation of PKM2  residue 105 (Y105) regulates PKM2 to provide a metabolic advantage to tumor cells, thereby promoting tumor growth. In the present work, mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated an interaction between TRIM35 and PKM2. Co-IP experiments confirmed that TRIM35 interacts with PKM2 and that the coiled-coil domain is required for such an interaction. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain mediates decreases in the Warburg effect and in the cell proliferation of HCC cells. In addition, TRIM35 suppresses the tumorigenicity of HCC cells through the blockade of PKM2 Y105 phosphorylation. Collectively, our data reveal a new function for TRIM35, which is to regulate the Warburg effect and tumorigenicity through interaction with PKM2 in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25825269>Developmental Changes for the Hemolymph Metabolome of Silkworm (Bombyx mori L.).</a></h2><p>Silkworm (Bombyx mori) is a lepidopteran-holometabolic model organism. To understand its developmental biochemistry, we characterized the larval hemolymph metabonome from the third instar to prepupa stage using (1)H NMR spectroscopy whilst hemolymph fatty acid composition using GC-FID/MS. We unambiguously assigned more than 60 metabolites, among which -o-β-glucuronide, mesaconate, homocarnosine, and picolinate were reported for the first time from the silkworm hemolymph. Phosphorylcholine was the most abundant metabolite in all developmental stages with exception for the periods before the third and fourth molting. We also found obvious developmental dependence for the hemolymph metabonome involving multiple pathways including protein biosyntheses, , TCA cycle, the metabolisms of choline amino acids, fatty acids, purines, and pyrimidines. Most hemolymph amino acids had two elevations during the feeding period of the fourth instar and prepupa stage. Trehalose was the major blood sugar before day 8 of the fifth instar, whereas glucose became the major blood sugar after spinning. C16:0, C18:0 and its unsaturated forms were dominant fatty acids in hemolymph. The developmental changes of hemolymph metabonome were associated with dietary nutrient intakes, biosyntheses of cell membrane, pigments, proteins, and energy metabolism. These findings offered essential biochemistry information in terms of the dynamic metabolic changes during silkworm development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30477476>Prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume of pretreatment F-FAMT PET/CT in non-small cell lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) metabolic parameters-namely metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion  (TLG), and total lesion retention (TLR)-on fluorine-18 (F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and L- [3-F]-α-methyltyrosine (F-FAMT) PET/CT in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The study group comprised 112 NSCLC patients who underwent F-FDG and F-FAMT PET/CT prior to any therapy.

Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher MTV of F-FAMT (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.88, CI: 1.63-5.09, P < 0.01) and advanced clinical stage (HR: 5.36, CI: 1.88-15.34, P < 0.01) were significant predictors of shorter OS.MTV of F-FAMT is of prognostic value for OS in NSCLC cases and can help guide decision-making during patient management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30730747>Multiomic Profiling of  Kinase Inhibitor-Resistant K562 Cells Suggests Metabolic Reprogramming To Promote Cell Survival.</a></h2><p>Resistance to chemotherapy can occur through a wide variety of mechanisms. Resistance to  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often arises from kinase mutations-however, "off-target" resistance occurs but is poorly understood. Previously, we established cell line resistance models for three TKIs used in chronic myeloid leukemia treatment, and found that resistance was not attributed entirely to failure of kinase inhibition. Here, we performed global, integrated proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of these cell lines to describe mechanisms of resistance at the protein and gene expression level. We used whole transcriptome sequencing and SWATH-based data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS), which does not require isotopic labels and provides quantitative measurements of proteins in a comprehensive, unbiased fashion. The proteomic and transcriptional data were correlated to generate an integrated understanding of the gene expression and protein alterations associated with TKI resistance. We defined mechanisms of resistance and two novel markers, CA1 and alpha-synuclein, that were common to all TKIs tested. Resistance to all of the TKIs was associated with oxidative stress responses, hypoxia signatures, and apparent metabolic reprogramming of the cells. Metabolite profiling and glucose-dependence experiments showed that resistant cells had routed their metabolism through  (particularly through the pentose phosphate pathway) and exhibited disruptions in mitochondrial metabolism. These experiments are the first to report a global, integrated proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolic analysis of TKI resistance. These data suggest that although the mechanisms are complex, targeting metabolic pathways along with TKI treatment may overcome pan-TKI resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28500338>Inflammatory bacteriome featuring Fusobacterium nucleatum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified in association with oral squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Studies on the possible association between bacteria and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain inconclusive, largely due to methodological variations/limitations. The objective of this study was to characterize the species composition as well as functional potential of the bacteriome associated with OSCC. DNA obtained from 20 fresh OSCC biopsies (cases) and 20 deep-epithelium swabs (matched control subjects) was sequenced for the V1-V3 region using Illumina's 2 × 300 bp chemistry. High quality, non-chimeric merged reads were classified to species level using a prioritized BLASTN-algorithm. Downstream analyses were performed using QIIME, PICRUSt, and LEfSe. Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum was the most significantly overrepresented species in the tumors followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Campylobacter sp. Oral taxon 44, while Streptococcus mitis, Rothia mucilaginosa and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were the most significantly abundant in the controls. Functional prediction showed that genes involved in bacterial mobility, flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis and LPS synthesis were enriched in the tumors while those responsible for DNA repair and combination, purine metabolism, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis and /gluconeogenesis were significantly associated with the controls. This is the first epidemiological evidence for association of F. nucleatum and P. aeruginosa with OSCC.

In this study, we report a novel role for TrkAIII in signaling ER stress to the mitochondria in SH-SY5Y NB cells that results in glycolytic metabolic adaptation. The ER stress-inducing agents DTT, A23187 and thapsigargin activated the ER stress-response in control pcDNA SH-SY5Y and TrkAIII expressing SH-SY5Y cells and in TrkAIII SH-SY5Y cells increased TrkAIII targeting to mitochondria and internalisation into inner-mitochondrial membranes. Within inner-mitochondrial membranes, TrkAIII was subjected to Omi/HtrA2-dependent cleavage to  phosphorylated 45-48kDa carboxyl terminal active fragments, localised predominantly in  kinase-domain mitochondrial matrix orientation. This stress-induced activation of mitochondrial TrkAIII was associated with increased ROS production, prevented by the ROS scavenger Resveratrol and underpinned by changes in Ca2+ movement, implicating ROS/Ca2+ interplay in overcoming the mitochondrial TrkAIII activation threshold. Stress-induced, cleavage-activation of mitochondrial TrkAIII resulted in mitochondrial PDHK1  phosphorylation, leading to glycolytic metabolic adaptation. This novel mitochondrial role for TrkAIII provides a potential self-perpetuating, drug reversible way through which tumour microenvironmental stress may maintain the metastasis promoting "Warburg effect" in TrkAIII expressing NBs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325096>Apatinib inhibits  by suppressing the VEGFR2/AKT1/SOX5/GLUT4 signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Apatinib is a  kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and has shown encouraging therapeutic effects in various malignant tumors. As yet, however, the role of apatinib in ovarian cancer has remained unknown. Here, we sought to elucidate the role of apatinib in the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, as well as in glucose metabolism in these cells.The effects of apatinib on ovarian cancer cell viability and proliferation were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays, respectively. The expression of VEGFR2/AKT1/SOX5/GLUT4 pathway proteins was assessed using Western blotting, and glucose uptake and lactate production assays were used to detect  in ovarian cancer cells. SOX5 was exogenously over-expressed and silenced in ovarian cancer cells using expression vector and shRNA-based methods, respectively. RNA expression analyses were performed using RNA-seq and gene-chip-based methods. GLUT4 promoter activity was assessed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of p-VEGFR2 (Tyr1175), p-AKT1 (Ser473), p-GSK3β (Ser9), SOX5 and GLUT4 in xenograft tissues was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC).We found that apatinib inhibited the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation in Hey and OVCA433 ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. We also found that apatinib effectively suppressed glucose uptake and lactate production by blocking the expression of GLUT4 in these cells. In addition, we found that SOX5 predominantly rescued the inhibitory effect of apatinib on GLUT4 expression by activating its promoter. Finally, we found that apatinib regulated the expression of SOX5 by suppressing the VEGFR2/AKT1/GSK3β signaling pathway.From our results, we conclude that apatinib suppresses the in vitro and in vivo viability and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, as well as  by inhibiting the VEGFR2/AKT1/GSK3β/SOX5/GLUT4 signaling pathway.

We used human leukemic cell lines cells, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as leukemic samples from AML patients to demonstrate the role of 2-DG in tumor cell growth inhibition. 2-DG, through N-linked glycosylation inhibition, affected the cell-surface expression and cellular signaling of both FTL3-ITD and mutated c-KIT and induced apoptotic cell death. Leukemic cells harboring these mutated RTKs (MV4-11, MOLM-14, Kasumi-1, and TF-1 c-KIT D816V) were the most sensitive to 2-DG treatment in vitro as compared with nonmutated cells. 2-DG activity was also demonstrated in leukemic cells harboring FLT3-TKD mutations resistant to the  kinase inhibitor (TKI) quizartinib. Moreover, the antileukemic activity of 2-DG was particularly marked in c-KIT-mutated cell lines and cell samples from core binding factor-AML patients. In these cells, 2-DG inhibited the cell-surface expression of c-KIT, abrogated STAT3 and MAPK-ERK pathways, and strongly downregulated the expression of the receptor resulting in a strong in vivo effect in NOD/SCID mice xenografted with Kasumi-1 cells. Finally, we showed that 2-DG decreases Mcl-1 protein expression in AML cells and induces sensitization to both the BH3 mimetic inhibitor of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, ABT-737, and cytarabine. In conclusion, 2-DG displays a significant antileukemic activity in AML with FLT3-ITD or KIT mutations, opening a new therapeutic window in a subset of AML with mutated RTKs.©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28659801>Hepatocellular Toxicity Associated with  Kinase Inhibitors: Mitochondrial Damage and Inhibition of .</a></h2><p> kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are anticancer drugs with a lesser toxicity than classical chemotherapeutic agents but still with a narrow therapeutic window. While hepatotoxicity is known for most TKIs, underlying mechanisms remain mostly unclear. We therefore aimed at investigating mechanisms of hepatotoxicity for imatinib, sunitinib, lapatinib and erlotinib . We treated HepG2 cells, HepaRG cells and mouse liver mitochondria with TKIs (concentrations 1-100 μM) for different periods of time and assessed toxicity. In HepG2 cells maintained with glucose (favoring ), all TKIs showed a time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and, except erlotinib, a drop in intracellular ATP. In the presence of galactose (favoring mitochondrial metabolism), imatinib, sunitinib and erlotinib showed a similar toxicity profile as for glucose whereas lapatinib was less toxic. For imatinib, lapatinib and sunitinib, cytotoxicity increased in HepaRG cells induced with rifampicin, suggesting formation of toxic metabolites. In contrast, erlotinib was more toxic in HepaRG cells under basal than CYP-induced conditions. Imatinib, sunitinib and lapatinib reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 cells and in mouse liver mitochondria. In HepG2 cells, these compounds increased reactive oxygen species production, impaired , and induced apoptosis. In addition, imatinib and sunitinib impaired oxygen consumption and activities of complex I and III (only imatinib), and reduced the cellular GSH pool. In conclusion, imatinib and sunitinib are mitochondrial toxicants after acute and long-term exposure and inhibit . Lapatinib affected mitochondria only weakly and inhibited , whereas the cytotoxicity of erlotinib could not be explained by a mitochondrial mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171721>Peroxynitrite supports a metabolic reprogramming in merlin-deficient Schwann cells and promotes cell survival.</a></h2><p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The  gene encodes the tumor suppressor merlin, and loss of merlin activity promotes tumorigenesis and causes NF2. Cellular redox signaling has been implicated in different stages of tumor development. Among reactive nitrogen species, peroxynitrite is the most powerful oxidant produced by cells. We recently showed that peroxynitrite-mediated  nitration down-regulates mitochondrial metabolism in tumor cells. However, whether peroxynitrite supports a metabolic shift that could be exploited for therapeutic development is unknown. Here, we show that vestibular schwannomas from NF2 patients and human, merlin-deficient (MD) Schwann cells have high levels of endogenous  nitration, indicating production of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, scavenging or inhibiting peroxynitrite formation significantly and selectively decreased survival of human and mouse MD-Schwann cells. Using multiple complementary methods, we also found that merlin deficiency leads to a reprogramming of energy metabolism characterized by a peroxynitrite-dependent decrease of oxidative phosphorylation and increased  and glutaminolysis. In MD-Schwann cells, scavenging of peroxynitrite increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and membrane potential, mediated by the up-regulation of the levels and activity of mitochondrial complex IV. This increase in mitochondrial activity correlated with a decrease in the glycolytic rate and glutamine dependence. This is the first demonstration of a peroxynitrite-dependent reprogramming of energy metabolism in tumor cells. Oxidized proteins constitute a novel target for therapeutic development not only for the treatment of NF2 schwannomas but also other tumors in which peroxynitrite plays a regulatory role.© 2019 Pestoni et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28821609>Insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy in cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial activity and metabolic reprogramming influence the phenotype of cancer cells and resistance to targeted therapy.

Here we show that IGF-1 stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis in a range of cell lines. In MCF-7 and ZR75.1 breast cancer cells, IGF-1 induces peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) and PGC-1α-related coactivator (PRC). Suppression of PGC-1β and PRC with siRNA reverses the effects of IGF-1 and disrupts mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential. IGF-1 also induced expression of the redox regulator nuclear factor-erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2 alias NRF-2). Of note, MCF-7 cells with acquired resistance to an IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)  kinase inhibitor exhibited reduced expression of PGC-1β, PRC, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly, these cells exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, indicated by reactive oxygen species expression, reduced expression of the mitophagy mediators BNIP3 and BNIP3L, and impaired mitophagy. In agreement with this, IGF-1 robustly induced BNIP3 accumulation in mitochondria. Other active receptor  kinases could not compensate for reduced IGF-1R activity in mitochondrial protection, and MCF-7 cells with suppressed IGF-1R activity became highly dependent on  for survival. We conclude that IGF-1 signaling is essential for sustaining cancer cell viability by stimulating both mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover through BNIP3 induction. This core mitochondrial protective signal is likely to strongly influence responses to therapy and the phenotypic evolution of cancer.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482070>Inhibition of Glyoxalase-I Leads to Reduced Proliferation, Migration and Colony Formation, and Enhanced Susceptibility to Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p> Glyoxalase-I (Glo-I) is essential for detoxification of methylglyoxal (MGO), a byproduct of . Overexpression of Glo-I has been linked to multi-drug resistance in cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to analyze Glo-I in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the effect of the multi- kinase inhibitor sorafenib on Glo-I.  Expression and specific activity of Glo-I was measured in human HCC samples, HCC-cell lines (HepG2, Huh7) and a hepatocyte cell line (AML 12). Cells were either treated with Glo-I inhibitors, ethyl pyruvate (EP, 1-20 mM) and BrBzGSHCp2 (1-10 μM), or sorafenib (2.5-10 μM) and protein expression (Western Blot), proliferation (WST-assay), migration (scratch assay), and colony formation (clonogenic assay) were assessed.  High expression of Glo-I was detected in human HCC tissue samples. Huh7 showed highest expression and activity of Glo-I and revealed highest proliferation compared to AML 12 and HepG2. Targeting Glo-I by EP or BrBzGSHCp led to significantly reduced proliferation (20 mM EP 24 h: 57 ± 12%), migration and colony formation. Glo-I inhibition by 20 mM EP resulted in reduced expression of PDGFR-β (18 ± 10%), VEGFR2 (46 ± 11%), VEGF (61 ± 10%), pERK/ERK (62 ± 6%), NF-κB (44 ± 12%) as well as stimulation of Nrf2 (243 ± 36%). Similar results were seen with BrBzGSHCp2. Sorafenib treatment revealed elevation of Glo-I (10 μM: 209 ± 25%) and MGO. Co-treatment of EP and sorafenib led to an additional reduction of proliferation compared to sorafenib alone.  Glo-I is positively correlated with HCC proliferation. Inhibition of Glo-I reduced proliferation, migration, and colony formation. In turn, sorafenib increases Glo-I. Co-treatment using Glo-I inhibitors could enhance susceptibility of HCC to sorafenib.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30206772>Volumetric and texture analysis of pretherapeutic F-FDG PET can predict overall survival in medullary thyroid cancer patients treated with Vandetanib.</a></h2><p>The metabolically most active lesion in 2-deoxy-2-(F)fluoro-D-glucose (F-FDG) PET/CT can predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) starting treatment with the  kinase inhibitor (TKI) vandetanib. However, this metric failed in overall survival (OS) prediction. In the present proof of concept study, we aimed to explore the prognostic value of intratumoral textural features (TF) as well as volumetric parameters (total lesion , TLG) derived by pre-therapeutic F-FDG PET.Eighteen patients with progressive MTC underwent baseline F-FDG PET/CT prior to and 3 months after vandetanib initiation. By manual segmentation of the tumor burden at baseline and follow-up PET, intratumoral TF and TLG were computed. The ability of TLG, imaging-based TF, and clinical parameters (including age, tumor marker doubling times, prior therapies and RET (rearranged during transfection) mutational status) for prediction of both PFS and OS were evaluated.The TF Complexity and the volumetric parameter TLG obtained at baseline prior to TKI initiation successfully differentiated between low- and high-risk patients. Complexity allocated 10/18 patients to the high-risk group with an OS of 3.3 y (vs. low-risk group, OS = 5.3 y, 8/18, AUC = 0.78, P = 0.03). Baseline TLG designated 11/18 patients to the high-risk group (OS = 3.5 y vs. low-risk group, OS = 5 y, 7/18, AUC = 0.83, P = 0.005). The Hazard Ratio for cancer-related death was 6.1 for Complexity (TLG, 9.5). Among investigated clinical parameters, the age at initiation of TKI treatment reached significance for PFS prediction (P = 0.02, OS, n.s.).The TF Complexity and the volumetric parameter TLG are both independent parameters for OS prediction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27485204>PKM2 dephosphorylation by Cdc25A promotes the Warburg effect and tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Many types of human tumour cells overexpress the dual-specificity phosphatase Cdc25A. Cdc25A dephosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase and regulates the cell cycle, but other substrates of Cdc25A and their relevant cellular functions have yet to be identified. We demonstrate here that EGFR activation results in c-Src-mediated Cdc25A phosphorylation at Y59, which interacts with nuclear pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Cdc25A dephosphorylates PKM2 at S37, and promotes PKM2-dependent β-catenin transactivation and c-Myc-upregulated expression of the glycolytic genes GLUT1, PKM2 and LDHA, and of CDC25A; thus, Cdc25A upregulates itself in a positive feedback loop. Cdc25A-mediated PKM2 dephosphorylation promotes the Warburg effect, cell proliferation and brain tumorigenesis. In addition, we identify positive correlations among Cdc25A Y59 phosphorylation, Cdc25A and PKM2 in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of Cdc25A Y59 phosphorylation correlate with grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. These findings reveal an instrumental function of Cdc25A in controlling cell metabolism, which is essential for EGFR-promoted tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26575584>Inhibition of mitochondrial glutaminase activity reverses acquired erlotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib has been approved based on the clinical benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients over the past decade. Unfortunately, cancer cells become resistant to this agent via various mechanisms, and this limits the improvement in patient outcomes. Thus, it is urgent to develop novel agents to overcome erlotinib resistance. Here, we propose a novel strategy to overcome acquired erlotinib resistance in NSCLC by inhibiting glutaminase activity. Compound 968, an inhibitor of the glutaminase C (GAC), when combined with erlotinib potently inhibited the cell proliferation of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells HCC827ER and NCI-H1975. The combination of compound 968 and erlotinib not only decreased GAC and EGFR protein expression but also inhibited GAC activity in HCC827ER cells. The growth of erlotinib-resistant cells was glutamine-dependent as proved by GAC gene knocked down and rescue experiment. More importantly, compound 968 combined with erlotinib down-regulated the glutamine and  metabolism in erlotinib-resistant cells. Taken together, our study provides a valuable approach to overcome acquired erlotinib resistance by blocking glutamine metabolism and suggests that combination of EGFR-TKI and GAC inhibitor maybe a potential treatment strategy for acquired erlotinib-resistant NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026382>Cabozantinib Exhibits Potent Antitumor Activity in Colorectal Cancer Patient-Derived Tumor Xenograft Models via Autophagy and Signaling Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Antiangiogenic therapy used in treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) inevitably succumbs to treatment resistance.

We previously reported that cabozantinib (XL184), an inhibitor of receptor  kinases (RTK) including MET, AXL, and VEGFR2, had potent antitumor effects in mCRC patient-derived tumor explant models. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of cabozantinib sensitivity, using regorafenib as a control. The tumor growth inhibition index (TGII) was used to compare treatment effects of cabozantinib 30 mg/kg daily versus regorafenib 10 mg/kg daily for a maximum of 28 days in 10 PDX mouse models.  angiogenesis and glucose uptake were assessed using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and [F]-FDG-PET imaging, respectively.

Cabozantinib significantly reduced vascularity and glucose uptake compared with baseline. Gene pathway analysis showed that cabozantinib significantly decreased protein activity involved in  and upregulated proteins involved in autophagy compared with control, whereas regorafenib did not.

It is increasingly recognized that intracellular pathogens modify host cell metabolic pathways to increase infection and transmission in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Recent reports have shown that amino acids are central to the host-pathogen metabolic interaction. In this study, a genome-wide search for components of amino acid metabolic pathways was performed in , the main tick vector of  in the United States, for which the genome was recently published. The enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation pathways of the twenty amino acids were identified. Then, the available transcriptomics and proteomics data was used to characterize the mRNA and protein levels of  amino acid metabolic pathway components in response to  infection of tick tissues and ISE6 tick cells. Our analysis was focused on the interplay between carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism during  infection in ISE6 cells. The results showed that tick cells increase the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from  to control  infection. Metabolic pathway analysis suggested that this is achieved by (i) increasing the transcript and protein levels of mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M), (ii) shunting  into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to increase fumarate and oxaloacetate which will be converted into PEP by PEPCK-M, and (iii) blocking all the pathways that use PEP downstream gluconeogenesis (i.e.,  serine synthesis pathway (SSP), glyceroneogenesis and gluconeogenesis). While sequestering host PEP may be critical for this bacterium because it cannot actively carry out  to produce PEP, excess of this metabolite may be toxic for .

In the present study, we investigated alterations of gene expression in SH-SY5Y cells during neuronal differentiation mediated by retinoic acid (RA) treatment. We evaluated important pathways involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), nuclear E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glycolytic, and p53 during neuronal differentiation. We also investigated the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in modulating the gene expression profile of those pathways by antioxidant co-treatment with Trolox®, a hydrophilic analogue of α-tocopherol. We found that RA treatment increases levels of gene expression of NF-κB, glycolytic, and antioxidant pathway genes during neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. We also found that ROS production induced by RA treatment in SH-SY5Y cells is involved in gene expression profile alterations, chiefly in NF-κB, and glycolytic pathways. Antioxidant co-treatment with Trolox® reversed the effects mediated by RA NF-κB, and glycolytic pathways gene expression. Interestingly, co-treatment with Trolox® did not reverse the effects in antioxidant gene expression mediated by RA in SH-SY5Y. To confirm neuronal differentiation, we quantified endogenous levels of  hydroxylase, a recognized marker of neuronal differentiation. Our data suggest that during neuronal differentiation mediated by RA, changes in profile gene expression of important pathways occur. These alterations are in part mediated by ROS production. Therefore, our results reinforce the importance in understanding the mechanism by which RA induces neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells, principally due this model being commonly used as a neuronal cell model in studies of neuronal pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776759>Melatonin ameliorates hypoglycemic stress-induced brain endothelial tight junction injury by inhibiting protein nitration of TP53-induced  and apoptosis regulator.</a></h2><p>Severe hypoglycemia has a detrimental impact on the cerebrovasculature, but the molecular events that lead to the disruption of the integrity of the tight junctions remain unclear. Here, we report that the microvessel integrity was dramatically compromised (59.41% of wild-type mice) in TP53-induced  and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) transgenic mice stressed by hypoglycemia. Melatonin, a potent antioxidant, protects against hypoglycemic stress-induced brain endothelial tight junction injury in the dosage of 400 nmol/L in vitro. FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) imaging data of endothelial cells stressed by low glucose revealed that TIGAR couples with calmodulin to promote TIGAR  nitration. A  92 mutation interferes with the TIGAR-dependent NADPH generation (55.60% decreased) and abolishes its protective effect on tight junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. We further demonstrate that the low-glucose-induced disruption of occludin and Caludin5 as well as activation of autophagy was abrogated by melatonin-mediated blockade of nitrosative stress in vitro. Collectively, we provide information on the detailed molecular mechanisms for the protective actions of melatonin on brain endothelial tight junctions and suggest that this indole has translational potential for severe hypoglycemia-induced neurovascular damage.© 2017 The Authors.

However, the metabolomic signature of T2DM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has not been investigated thus far. In this prospective metabolomic study, fasting CSF and plasma samples from 40 T2DM patients to 36 control subjects undergoing elective surgery with spinal anesthesia were analyzed by H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectra of CSF and plasma metabolites were analyzed and correlated with the presence of T2DM and diabetic microangiopathy (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) using an area under the curve (AUC) estimation. CSF metabolomic profiles in T2DM patients vs. controls revealed significantly increased levels of alanine, leucine, valine, , lactate, pyruvate, and decreased levels of histidine. In addition, a combination of alanine, histidine, leucine, pyruvate, , and valine in CSF showed a superior correlation with the presence of T2DM (AUC:0.951), diabetic retinopathy (AUC:0.858), nephropathy (AUC:0.811), and neuropathy (AUC:0.691). Similar correlations also appeared in plasma profiling. These metabolic alterations in CSF suggest decreasing aerobic metabolism and increasing anaerobic  in cerebral circulation of patients with T2DM.

Targeting unique cellular metabolism of cancer cells is a potentially less toxic approach. Monotherapy with mitochondrial inhibitors like metformin have met with limited success since escape mechanisms such as increased glycolytic ATP production, especially in hyperglycemia, can overcome the metabolic blockade. As an alternative strategy for metformin therapy, we hypothesized that the combination of 6-benzylthioinosine (6-BT), a broad-spectrum metabolic inhibitor, and metformin could block this drug resistance mechanism. Metformin treatment alone resulted in significant suppression of ROS and mitochondrial respiration with increased  accompanied by modest cytotoxicity (10-25%). In contrast, 6-BT monotherapy resulted in inhibition of glucose uptake, decreased , and decreased ATP with minimal changes in ROS and mitochondrial respiration. The combination of 6-BT with metformin resulted in significant cytotoxicity (60-70%) in monocytic AML cell lines and was associated with inhibition of FLT3-ITD activated STAT5 and reduced c-Myc and GLUT-1 expression. Therefore, although the anti-tumor and metabolic effects of metformin have been limited by the metabolic reprogramming within cells, the novel combination of 6-BT and metformin targets this bypass mechanism resulting in reduced , STAT5 inhibition, and increased cell death.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For volumetric parameters of primary tumors, 40% of SUVmax was used to generate volume of interest. If the 40% of SUVmax was below 2.5, an SUV threshold of 2.5 was used instead. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion  (TLG), dopaminergic tumor volume (DTV), and total lesion F-DOPA activity (TLDA) were recorded as F-FDG and F-DOPA volumetric parameters. All indices were compared between groups distinguished by survival status and clinical features, including bone marrow involvement, lymph node metastasis, amplification of the MYCN oncogene, invasive features on anatomic images, and risk categories. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the survival curves between groups.The median follow-up period was 28.2 months. Nonsurvivors (20%) tended to have lower SUVDOPA, DTV, and TLDA (P ≤ 0.05), and higher SUVFDG, MTV, and TLG (all P < 0.05).

This was accompanied by increased selective threonine phosphorylation of Akt and the downstream target PFK-2 at S483. PFK-1 activity was increased when compared with Intralipid as measured by the ratio of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (Omegaven 0.60 ± 0.11 versus Intralipid 0.47 ± 0.09; P = .023), consistent with increased formation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by PFK2, its main allosteric activator. Omegaven lead to accumulation of acylcarnitines and fostered a prooxidant response as evidenced by NFκB nuclear translocation and activation.Omegaven as opposed to Intralipid preserves glucose uptake via the PP2A-Akt-PFK pathway in intact beating hearts. n3 fatty acids decelerate β-oxidation causing accumulation of acylcarnitine species and a prooxidant response, which likely inhibits redox-sensitive PP2A and thus preserves insulin signaling and glucose uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29843785>Oxidative stress impairs energy metabolism in primary cells and synovial tissue of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>In this study, we examined the effect of oxidative stress on cellular energy metabolism and pro-angiogenic/pro-inflammatory mechanisms of primary rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast cells (RASFC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).Primary RASFC and HUVEC were cultured with the oxidative stress inducer 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), and extracellular acidification rate, oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial function and pro-angiogenic/pro-inflammatory mechanisms were assessed using the Seahorse analyser, complex I-V activity assays, random mutation mitochondrial capture assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and functional assays, including angiogenic tube formation, migration and invasion. Expression of angiogenic growth factors in synovial tissue (ST) was assessed by IHC in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) undergoing arthroscopy before and after administration of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi).In RASFC and HUVEC, 4-HNE-induced oxidative stress reprogrammed energy metabolism by inhibiting mitochondrial basal, maximal and adenosine triphosphate-linked respiration and reserve capacity, coupled with the reduced enzymatic activity of oxidative phosphorylation complexes III and IV. In contrast, 4-HNE elevated basal , glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve, paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial DNA mutations and reactive oxygen species. 4-HNE activated pro-angiogenic responses of RASFC, which subsequently altered HUVEC invasion and migration, angiogenic tube formation and the release of pro-angiogenic mediators. In vivo markers of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin 2 [Ang2],  kinase receptor [Tie2]) were significantly associated with oxidative damage and oxygen metabolism in the inflamed synovium. Significant reduction in ST vascularity and Ang2/Tie2 expression was demonstrated in patients with RA before and after administration of TNFi.Oxidative stress promotes metabolism in favour of , an effect that may contribute to acceleration of inflammatory mechanisms and subsequent dysfunctional angiogenesis in RA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26550536>Monitoring of anti-cancer treatment with (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT PET: a comprehensive review of pre-clinical studies.</a></h2><p>Functional imaging of solid tumors with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is an evolving field with continuous development of new PET tracers and discovery of new applications for already implemented PET tracers. During treatment of cancer patients, a general challenge is to measure treatment effect early in a treatment course and by that to stratify patients into responders and non-responders. With 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) and 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine((18)F-FLT) two of the cancer hallmarks, altered energy metabolism and increased cell proliferation, can be visualized and quantified non-invasively by PET. With (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT PET changes in energy metabolism and cell proliferation can thereby be determined after initiation of cancer treatment in both clinical and pre-clinical studies in order to predict, at an early time-point, treatment response. It is hypothesized that decreases in  and cell proliferation may occur in tumors that are sensitive to the applied cancer therapeutics and that tumors that are resistant to treatment will show unchanged glucose metabolism and cell proliferation. Whether (18)F-FDG and/or (18)F-FLT PET can be used for prediction of treatment response has been analyzed in many studies both following treatment with conventional chemotherapeutic agents but also following treatment with different targeted therapies, e.g. monoclonal antibodies and small molecules inhibitors. The results from these studies have been most variable; in some studies early changes in (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT uptake predicted later tumor regression whereas in other studies no change in tracer uptake was observed despite the treatment being effective. The present review gives an overview of pre-clinical studies that have used (18)F-FDG and/or (18)F-FLT PET for response monitoring of cancer therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28218905>Phosphorylation-mediated activation of LDHA promotes cancer cell invasion and tumour metastasis.</a></h2><p>Metastases remain the major cause of death from cancer. Recent molecular advances have highlighted the importance of metabolic alterations in cancer cells, including the Warburg effect that describes an increased  in cancer cells. However, how this altered metabolism contributes to tumour metastasis remains elusive. Here, we report that phosphorylation-induced activation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), an enzyme that catalyses the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, promotes cancer cell invasion, anoikis resistance and tumour metastasis. We demonstrate that LDHA is phosphorylated at  10 by upstream kinases, HER2 and Src. Targeting HER2 or Src attenuated LDH activity as well as invasive potential in head and neck cancer and breast cancer cells. Inhibition of LDH activity by small hairpin ribonucleic acid or expression of phospho-deficient LDHA Y10F sensitized the cancer cells to anoikis induction and resulted in attenuated cell invasion and elevated reactive oxygen species, whereas such phenotypes were reversed by its product lactate or antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that Y10 phosphorylation-mediated LDHA activity promotes cancer cell invasion and anoikis resistance through redox homeostasis. In addition, LDHA knockdown or LDHA Y10F rescue expression in human cancer cells resulted in decreased tumour metastasis in xenograft mice. Furthermore, LDHA phosphorylation at Y10 positively correlated with progression of metastatic breast cancer in clinical patient tumour samples. Our findings demonstrate that LDHA phosphorylation and activation provide pro-invasive, anti-anoikis and pro-metastatic advantages to cancer cells, suggesting that Y10 phosphorylation of LDHA may represent a promising therapeutic target and a prognostic marker for metastatic human cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28194038>ITD mutation in FLT3  kinase promotes Warburg effect and renders therapeutic sensitivity to glycolytic inhibition.</a></h2><p>Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in Fms-like  kinase 3 gene (FLT3/ITD) represents an unfavorable genetic change in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with poor prognosis. Metabolic alterations have been involved in tumor progression and attracted interest as a target for therapeutic intervention. However, few studies analyzed the adaptations of cellular metabolism in the context of FLT3/ITD mutation. Here, we report that FLT3/ITD causes a significant increase in aerobic  through AKT-mediated upregulation of mitochondrial hexokinase (HK2), and renders the leukemia cells highly dependent on  and sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of glycolytic activity. Inhibition of  preferentially causes severe ATP depletion and massive cell death in FLT3/ITD leukemia cells. Glycolytic inhibitors significantly enhances the cytotoxicity induced by FLT3  kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Importantly, such combination provides substantial therapeutic benefit in a murine model bearing FLT3/ITD leukemia. Our study suggests that FLT3/ITD mutation promotes Warburg effect, and such metabolic alteration can be exploited to develop effective therapeutic strategy for treatment of AML with FLT3/ITD mutation via metabolic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25863232>Combination of imatinib and clotrimazole enhances cell growth inhibition in T47D breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Imatinib mesylate (IM), a  kinase inhibitor, is used as targeted cancer therapy. However, mono-targeting by IM does not always achieve full tumor eradication and thus it is recommended to combine IM with other anticancer agents. Clotrimazole (CLT) is an antifungal azole derivative with promising anticancer effects due to inhibiting the activity of glycolytic enzymes. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of combining CLT with IM on breast cancer cell line in an attempt to establish effective new combination. T47D human breast cancer cell line was treated with different concentrations of IM and/or CLT for 48 h. IM-CLT interaction was determined by isobologram equation and combination index. Cell viability was confirmed by measuring LDH activity. As indicators of  inhibition, the expression of hexokinase-2 (HK-2) and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) plus the activity of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate kinase (PK) were determined. In addition, glucose consumption and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were measured. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-α (HIF-α) were also determined as they are modulators for . This study demonstrated that IM or CLT synergistically inhibited cell growth in T47D as shown by combination and dose reduction indices. The combination of 15 μM IM and 20 μM CLT significantly decreased glucose consumption, activity of both PK and intracellular LDH, while increased leaked LDH, VEGF and NO in the medium compared to each drug alone. Furthermore the combination decreased gene expression of HK-2, PFK-1 and ATP content compared to the control. In conclusion, the synergistic effect of CLT on IM cytotoxicity in T47D cell line maybe mediated through inhibition of  and increasing both NO and VEGF. Further studies are required to confirm the efficiency and safety of this combination.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, it remains unclear whether c-Src contributes to metabolic reprogramming. Here we find that c-Src can interact with and phosphorylate hexokinases HK1 and HK2, the rate-limiting enzymes in .  phosphorylation dramatically increases their catalytic activity and thus enhances . Mechanistically, c-Src phosphorylation of HK1 at Tyr732 robustly decreases its K and increases its V by disrupting its dimer formation. Mutation in c-Src phosphorylation site of either HK1 or HK2 remarkably abrogates the stimulating effects of c-Src on , cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumorigenesis and metastasis. Due to its lower K for glucose, HK1 rather than HK2 is required for tumour cell survival when glucose is scarce. Importantly, HK1-Y732 phosphorylation level remarkably correlates with the incidence and metastasis of various clinical cancers and may serve as a marker to predict metastasis risk of primary cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28720063>STYK1 promotes Warburg effect through PI3K/AKT signaling and predicts a poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</a></h2><p>STYK1 (Serine/threonine/ kinase 1), a member of the receptor  kinase family, exhibits tumorigenicity in many types of cancers. Our study reveals the important role played by STYK1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. STYK1 is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues compared with para-carcinoma. Knockdown of STYK1 inhibits nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while ectopic STYK1 expression significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities. In addition, we provided lines of evidence supporting the critical role of STYK1 in the regulation of  via activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway.

Melanoma cells' metabolism and energy production networks play an important role in cancer proliferation, survival, motility, invasiveness, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Since the Warburg theory was put forward in the 1930s, more researchers focus on finding new ways for effectively eliminating cancer cells by targeting their energy metabolism. In this study, we found naringin has the inhibitory effects on the glucose metabolism of A375 cells, a melanoma cell line, in a concentration-dependent manner. We also found that naringin could significantly reduce the phosphorylation of c-Src. In summary, we demonstrated that naringin inhibits the malignant phenotype of A375 cells by suppressing c-Src and its downstream signaling pathway. More importantly, we provide the novel mechanism that, as a natural inhibitor of c-Src, naringin could be an effective candidate for the treatment of melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483439>The immune receptor Tim-3 mediates activation of PI3 kinase/mTOR and HIF-1 pathways in human myeloid leukaemia cells.</a></h2><p>The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) is a plasma membrane-associated protein that is highly expressed in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells. As an acute myeloid leukaemia antigen, it could therefore be considered as a potential target for immune therapy and highly-specific drug delivery. However, a conceptual understanding of its biological role is required before consideration of this protein for therapeutic settings. Here, we reveal the detailed mechanism of action underlying the biological responses mediated by the Tim-3 receptor in myeloid cells. Our studies demonstrate that Tim-3 triggers growth factor type responses in acute myeloid leukaemia cells by activating a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. In addition, the receptor activates hypoxic signalling pathways upregulating  and pro-angiogenic responses. These findings suggest that Tim-3 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for immune therapy and drug delivery in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key transmitter of growth factor and anchorage stimulation, is aberrantly overexpressed or activated in most solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). We determined whether FAK can act as an intrinsic driver to promote aerobic  and tumorigenesis. FAK inhibition decreases and overexpression increases intracellular glucose levels during unfavorable conditions, including growth factor deficiency and cell detachment. Amplex glucose assay, fluorescence and carbon-13 tracing studies demonstrate that FAK promotes glucose consumption and glucose-to-lactate conversion. Extracellular flux analysis indicates that FAK enhances  and decreases mitochondrial respiration. FAK increases key glycolytic proteins, including enolase, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase and monocarboxylate transporter. Furthermore, active/-phosphorylated FAK directly binds to PKM2 and promotes PKM2-mediated . On the other hand, FAK-decreased levels of mitochondrial complex I can result in reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Attenuation of FAK-enhanced  re-sensitizes cancer cells to growth factor withdrawal, decreases cell viability and reduces growth of tumor xenografts. These observations, for the first time, establish a vital role of FAK in cancer glucose metabolism through alterations in the OXPHOS-to- balance. Broadly targeting the common phenotype of aerobic  and more specifically FAK-reprogrammed glucose metabolism will disrupt the bioenergetic and biosynthetic supply for uncontrolled growth of tumors, particularly glycolytic PDAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27616546>Toxicological proteomic responses of halophyte Suaeda salsa to lead and zinc.</a></h2><p>The long term (30 days) toxicological effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb (20μg/L) and Zn (100μg/L) were characterized in Suaeda salsa using proteomics techniques.

However, TKI treatment is long-term and can induce resistance to TKI, which often leads to a poor clinical outcome in CML patients. Here, we examined the effect of continuous IM exposure on intracellular energy metabolism in K562 cells, a human Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML cell line, and its subsequent sensitivity to anti-cancer agents. Contrary to our expectations, we found that continuous IM exposure increased sensitivity to TKI. Cancer energy metabolism, characterized by abnormal , is linked to cancer cell survival. Interestingly, glycolytic activity was suppressed by continuous exposure to IM, and autophagy increased to maintain cell viability by compensating for glycolytic suppression. Notably, increased sensitivity to TKI was not caused by glycolytic inhibition but by altered intracellular signaling, causing glycolytic suppression and increased autophagy, as evidenced by suppression of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Using another human CML cell line (KCL22 cells) and BCR/ABL+ Ba/F3 cells (mimicking Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML cells) confirmed that suppressing S6K1 and activating AMPK increased sensitivity to TKI. Furthermore, suppressing S6K1 and activating AMPK had a synergistic anti-cancer effect by inhibiting autophagy in the presence of TKI. The present study provides new insight into the importance of signaling pathways that affect cellular energy metabolism, and suggests that co-treatment with agents that disrupt energy metabolic signaling (using S6K1 suppressors and AMPK activators) plus blockade of autophagy may be strategies for TKI-based CML therapy.© 2017 The Authors.

The results of this study show that epidermal growth factor receptor activation induces pyruvate kinase type M2 nuclear translocation. To further determine the relationship between pyruvate kinase type M2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, we analyzed pathological data from mammary glands and performed epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 knockdown to reveal that pyruvate kinase type M2 is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Lapatinib is a small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor that can inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, though its effect on pyruvate kinase type M2 remains elusive. Accordingly, we performed Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and analyzed pathological data from mammary glands, with results suggesting that lapatinib inhibits pyruvate kinase type M2 expression. We further found that the antitumor drug lapatinib inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by influencing pyruvate kinase type M2 expression, as based on Cell Counting Kit-8 analyses and pyruvate kinase type M2 overexpression experiments. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, which is a transcription factor-associated cell proliferation and the only transcription factor that interacts with pyruvate kinase type M2, we performed pyruvate kinase type M2 knockdown experiments in Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and Human breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 cell lines and examined the effect on levels of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. The results indicate that pyruvate kinase type M2 regulates Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) expression. Together with previous reports, our findings show that lapatinib inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by influencing pyruvate kinase type M2 expression, which results in a reduction in both Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153923>Macrophages sensing oxidized DAMPs reprogram their metabolism to support redox homeostasis and inflammation through a TLR2-Syk-ceramide dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>Macrophages control tissue homeostasis and inflammation by sensing and responding to environmental cues. However, the metabolic adaptation of macrophages to oxidative tissue damage and its translation into inflammatory mechanisms remains enigmatic.Here we identify the critical regulatory pathways that are induced by endogenous oxidation-derived DAMPs (oxidized phospholipids, OxPL) in vitro, leading to formation of a unique redox-regulatory metabolic phenotype (Mox), which is strikingly different from conventional classical or alternative macrophage activation.Unexpectedly, metabolomic analyses demonstrated that Mox heavily rely on glucose metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support GSH production and Nrf2-dependent antioxidant gene expression. While the metabolic adaptation of macrophages to OxPL involved transient suppression of aerobic , it also led to upregulation of inflammatory gene expression. In contrast to classically activated (M1) macrophages, Hif1α mediated expression of OxPL-induced Glut1 and VEGF but was dispensable for Il1β expression. Mechanistically, we show that OxPL suppress mitochondrial respiration via TLR2-dependent ceramide production, redirecting TCA metabolites to GSH synthesis. Finally, we identify spleen  kinase (Syk) as a critical downstream signaling mediator that translates OxPL-induced effects into ceramide production and inflammatory gene regulation.Together, these data demonstrate the metabolic and bioenergetic requirements that enable macrophages to translate tissue oxidation status into either antioxidant or inflammatory responses via sensing OxPL. Targeting dysregulated redox homeostasis in macrophages could therefore lead to novel therapies to treat chronic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK 1-4) play a pivotal role in metabolic flexibility by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. We determined whether metabolic reprogramming, diverting metabolism from aerobic  back to OXPHOS, would inhibit platelet function. PDKs activity in human and mouse platelets was inhibited with dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a potent inhibitor of all 4 forms of PDK. Human and mouse platelets pretreated with DCA exhibited decreased platelet aggregation to suboptimal doses of collagen, convulxin, thrombin, and adenosine diphosphate concomitant with decreased glucose uptake. Bioenergetics profile revealed that platelets pretreated with DCA exhibited decreased aerobic  in response to convulxin only. Furthermore, DCA inhibited ATP secretion, thromboxane A2 generation, and  phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 in response to collagen or convulxin in human and mouse platelets ( < .05 vs vehicle treated). In the flow chamber assay, human and mouse blood pretreated with DCA formed smaller thrombi when perfused over collagen for 10 minutes at an arterial shear rate of 1500 s ( < .05 vs control). Wild-type mice pretreated with DCA were less susceptible to thrombosis in the FeCl-induced carotid and laser injury-induced mesenteric artery thrombosis models ( < .05 vs vehicle control), without altering hemostasis.

However, the mechanism underlying response of C. acetobutylicum to butanol stress remains poorly understood. This study was performed to clarify such mechanism through investigating the butanol stress-associated intracellular biochemical changes at acidogenesis phase (i.e., middle exponential phase) and solventogenesis phase (i.e., early stationary phase) by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics strategy. With the aid of partial least-squares-discriminant analysis, a pairwise discrimination between control group and butanol-treated groups was revealed, and 27 metabolites with variable importance in the projection value greater than 1 were identified. Under butanol stress, the  might be inhibited while TCA cycle might be promoted. Moreover, changes of lipids and fatty acids compositions, amino acid metabolism and osmoregulator concentrations might be the key factors involved in C. acetobutylicum metabolic response to butanol stress. It was suggested that C. acetobutylicum cells might change the levels of long acyl chain saturated fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids to maintain the integrity of cell membrane through adjusting membrane fluidity under butanol stress. The increased level of glycerol was considered to be correlated with osmoregulation and regulating redox balance. In addition, increased levels of some amino acids (i.e., threonine, glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, , tryptophan, aspartate and glutamate) might also confer butanol tolerance to C. acetobutylicum. These results highlighted our knowledge about the response or adaptation of C. acetobutylicum to butanol stress, and would contribute to the construction of feasible butanologenic strains with higher butanol tolerance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We found this phosphatase ensures the activated statuses of Src and Bcr-Abl. Since, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins represent a key post-translational regulation of several enzymes, we also explored the kinome. We hereby show that LMWPTP superactivation, together with kinome reprogramming, cooperate towards glucose addiction. Resistant leukemia cells present lower levels of oxidative metabolism, in part due to downexpression of the following mitochondrial proteins: pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit alpha 1, succinate dehydrogenase, and voltage-dependent anion channel. Those cells displayed higher expression levels of glucose transporter 1 and higher production of lactate. In addition, Lucena-1 siRNA LMWPTP cells showed lower expression levels of glucose transporter 1 and lower activity of lactate dehydrogenase. On the other hand, K562 cells overexpressing LMWPTP presented higher expression/activity of both proteins. In this study, we show that LMWPTP is a pivotal mediator of metabolic reprogramming that confers survival advantages to leukemia cells against death stimuli. J. Cell.

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in RA exhibit a tumor cell-like aggressive phenotype. Thus, gas chromatography/time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) was employed to identify the characteristic metabolic profiling of RA FLS.Metabolite profiling of RA FLS and osteoarthritis (OA) FLS was performed using GC/TOF-MS in conjunction with statistical analyses. We performed metabolite set enrichment analysis to establish which pathways are affected.A total of 129 metabolites were identified. A principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated clear differentiation of the metabolic profiling between RA FLS and OA FLS. The levels of 35 metabolites that belonged to the amines, fatty acids, phosphates, and organic acids class were significantly increased in RA FLS compared to those in OA FLS. Also, the levels of 26 metabolites that belonged to the amino acids, sugars, and sugar alcohols class were significantly decreased in RA FLS compared to those in OA FLS. The sugar metabolism ( and pentose phosphate pathway) and amino acid metabolism ( and catecholamine biosynthesis, and protein biosynthesis) were severely disturbed in RA FLS compared to those in OA FLS.Our metabolic results suggested that the alteration of sugar metabolism, lipolysis, and amino acid metabolism in RA FLS is related to synovial hyperplasia and inflammation.

Pathogenetic CML events are closely linked with the Bcr-Abl protein with  kinase activity. TKIs block the ATP-binding site; therefore, the signal pathways leading to malignant transformation are no longer active. However, there is limited information about the impact of TKI treatment on the metabolome of CML patients. Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometric metabolite profiling and multivariate statistical methods, we analyzed plasma and leukocyte samples of patients newly diagnosed with CML, patients treated with hydroxyurea and TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib), and healthy controls. The global metabolic profiles clearly distinguished the newly diagnosed CML patients and the patients treated with hydroxyurea from those treated with TKIs and the healthy controls. The major changes were found in , the citric acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism.

It is constitutively phosphorylated on  (Y-P) in many tumors, where its transcriptional activity can induce a metabolic switch toward aerobic  and down-regulate mitochondrial activity, a prominent metabolic feature of most cancer cells, correlating with reduced production of ROS, delayed senescence, and protection from apoptosis. STAT3 can, however, also localize to mitochondria, where its serine-phosphorylated (S-P) form preserves mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and controls the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, also promoting survival and resistance to apoptosis in response to specific signals/oncogenes such as RAS. Thus, downstream of different signals, both nuclear, Y-P STAT3, and mitochondrial, S-P STAT3, can act by promoting cell survival and reducing ROS production. Here, we discuss these properties in the light of potential connections between STAT3-driven alterations of mitochondrial metabolism and the development of drug resistance in cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509298>Syk-dependent glycolytic reprogramming in dendritic cells regulates IL-1β production to β-glucan ligands in a TLR-independent manner.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) activated via TLR ligation experience metabolic reprogramming, in which the cells are heavily dependent on glucose and  for the synthesis of molecular building blocks essential for maturation, cytokine production, and the ability to stimulate T cells. Although the TLR-driven metabolic reprogramming events are well documented, fungal-mediated metabolic regulation via C-type lectin receptors such as Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 is not clearly understood. Here, we show that activation of DCs with fungal-associated β-glucan ligands induces acute glycolytic reprogramming that supports the production of IL-1β and its secretion subsequent to NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. This acute glycolytic induction in response to β-glucan ligands requires spleen  kinase signaling in a TLR-independent manner, suggesting now that different classes of innate immune receptors functionally induce conserved metabolic responses to support immune cell activation. These studies provide new insight into the complexities of metabolic regulation of DCs immune effector function regarding cellular activation associated with protection against fungal microbes.©2019 The Authors.

We compared the predictive ability of FAMT PET versus FDG PET regarding metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) outcomes for distant metastasis, including lymph node metastasis, and identified the relevant metabolic parameters for each.We enrolled 160 patients with OSCC who underwent PET/computed tomography using FDG and FAMT before treatment. Outcomes were assessed using clinicopathological characteristics such as the standardized uptake value (SUV, SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion  or total lesion retention. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the independent predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) during an average follow-up time of 1401.7 and 1646.0 days, respectively. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed for the accuracy and predictive value of imaging parameters.Clinical parameters (excluding age) and PET metabolic parameters were significantly associated with OS. Multivariate analysis showed that an infiltrative growth pattern [p = 0.034, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.30], and the FDG-measured SUV (p = 0.045, HR = 2.45) were independent risk factors for DFS and that lymph node metastasis (p = 0.03, HR = 2.57) and the FAMT-measured MTV (p = 0.004, HR = 3.65) were independent risk factors for OS.In patients with OSCC, FDG PET predicted DFS, whereas FAMT predicted OS.

Accumulating evidence suggests that diverse regulatory mechanisms mediate this cancer-associated metabolic change seen in a wide spectrum of cancer. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion protein is found in approximately 3-7% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Molecular evidence and therapeutic effectiveness of FDA-approved ALK inhibitors indicated that EML4-ALK is a driving factor of lung tumorigenesis. A recent clinical study showed that NSCLC harboring EML4-ALK rearrangements displayed higher glucose metabolism compared with EML4-ALK-negative NSCLC. In the current work, we presented evidence that EML4-ALK is coupled to overexpression of hexokinase II (HK2), one of the rate-limiting enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. The link from EML4-ALK to HK2 upregulation is essential for a high rate of  and proliferation of EML4-ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells. We identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) as a key transcription factor to drive HK2 gene expression in normoxia in these cells. EML4-ALK induced hypoxia-independent but glucose-dependent accumulation of HIF1α protein via both transcriptional activation of HIF1α mRNA and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-AKT pathway to enhance HIF1α protein synthesis. The EML4-ALK-mediated upregulation of HIF1α, HK2 and glycolytic metabolism was also highly active in vivo as demonstrated by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging of xenografts grown from EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cells. Our data reveal a novel EML4-ALK-HIF1α-HK2 cascade to enhance glucose metabolism in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777991>Co-evolutionary associations between root-associated microbiomes and root transcriptomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties.</a></h2><p>The plants and root-associated microbiomes are closely related. Plant metabolic substances can serve as a nutrient source for the microbiome, and in return, the microbiome can regulate the production of plant metabolic substances. Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), as the ancestor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), has changed several metabolic pathways and root-associated microbiome during evolution. Thus, the study of the different associations between metabolic pathways and root-associated microbiomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties is important for rice breeding. In this article, the co-evolutionary association between metabolic pathways, which are based on transcriptome data, and root-associated microbiomes, which are based on 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon data, in wild and cultivated rice was studied. The results showed that the enriched pathways were differentially correlated with the enriched microbiomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties. Pathways for 'Glutathione metabolism', 'Plant-pathogen interaction', 'Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum' and ' metabolism' were positively associated with the improved relative abundance of bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in wild rice. On the other hand, '/Gluconeogenesis', 'Brassinosteroid biosynthesis', 'Carbon metabolism', 'Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis' and 'Caffeine metabolism' were positively correlated with the improved relative abundance of bacterial and fungal OTUs in cultivated rice. Redundancy analysis showed that certain bacterial and fungal species could positively and significantly affect plant gene expression; for instance, Streptomyces, with 8.7% relative abundance in bacterial community, significantly affected plant gene expression in wild rice. This study can provide the theoretical basis for recognizing the associations between root-associated microbiomes and root transcriptomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties, and can provide practical significance for developing useful bacterial and fungal resources in wild rice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Does 14 days of live-high, train-low simulated altitude alter an individual's metabolomic/metabolic profile? What is the main finding and its importance? This study demonstrated that ∼200 h of moderate simulated altitude exposure resulted in greater variance in measured metabolites between subject than within subject, which indicates individual variability during the adaptive phase to altitude exposure. In addition, metabolomics results indicate that altitude alters multiple metabolic pathways, and the time course of these pathways is different over 14 days of altitude exposure. These findings support previous literature and provide new information on the acute adaptation response to altitude.The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of 14 days of normobaric hypoxic simulated altitude exposure at 3000 m on the human plasma metabolomic profile. For 14 days, 10 well-trained endurance runners (six men and four women; 29 ± 7 years of age) lived at 3000 m simulated altitude, accumulating 196.4 ± 25.6 h of hypoxic exposure, and trained at ∼600 m. Resting plasma samples were collected at baseline and on days 3 and 14 of altitude exposure and stored at -80°C. Plasma samples were analysed using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry to construct a metabolite profile of altitude exposure. Mass spectrometry of plasma identified 36 metabolites, of which eight were statistically significant (false discovery rate probability 0.1) from baseline to either day 3 or day 14. Specifically, changes in plasma metabolites relating to amino acid metabolism ( and proline),  (adenosine) and purine metabolism (adenosine) were observed during altitude exposure. Principal component canonical variate analysis showed significant discrimination between group means (P < 0.05), with canonical variate 1 describing a non-linear recovery trajectory from baseline to day 3 and then back to baseline by day 14. Conversely, canonical variate 2 described a weaker non-recovery trajectory and increase from baseline to day 3, with a further increase from day 3 to 14. The present study demonstrates that metabolomics can be a useful tool to monitor metabolic changes associated with altitude exposure. Furthermore, it is apparent that altitude exposure alters multiple metabolic pathways, and the time course of these changes is different over 14 days of altitude exposure.© 2018 The Authors.

Nanostring technology was used to evaluate a gene set defining a hypoxia signature in leukemic blasts and normal donors. The efficacy of the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 was examined in the in vitro and in vivo leukemia models.Metabolic imaging has demonstrated increased  in the femur of leukemic mice compared with healthy control mice, suggesting metabolic reprogramming of hypoxic bone marrow niches. Primary leukemic blasts in samples from AML patients overexpressed genes defining a "hypoxia index" compared with samples from normal donors. TH-302 depleted hypoxic cells, prolonged survival of xenograft leukemia models, and reduced the leukemia stem cell pool in vivo In the aggressive FLT3/ITD MOLM-13 model, combination of TH-302 with  kinase inhibitor sorafenib had greater antileukemia effects than either drug alone. Importantly, residual leukemic bone marrow cells in a syngeneic AML model remain hypoxic after chemotherapy. In turn, administration of TH-302 following chemotherapy treatment to mice with residual disease prolonged survival, suggesting that this approach may be suitable for eliminating chemotherapy-resistant leukemia cells.These findings implicate a pathogenic role of hypoxia in leukemia maintenance and chemoresistance and demonstrate the feasibility of targeting hypoxic cells by hypoxia cytotoxins.©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574317>Connecting central carbon and aromatic amino acid metabolisms to improve de novo 2-phenylethanol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h2><p>The organic compound 2-phenylethanol (2PE) has a pleasant floral scent and is intensively used in the cosmetic and food industries. Microbial production of 2PE by phenylalanine bioconversion or de novo biosynthesis from sugar offer sustainable, reliable and natural production processes compared to chemical synthesis. Despite the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to naturally synthesize 2PE, de novo synthesis in high concentration and yield remains a metabolic engineering challenge. Here, we demonstrate that improving phosphoenolpyruvate supply by expressing pyruvate kinase variants and eliminating the formation of p-hydroxy-phenylethanol without creating  auxotrophy significantly contributed to improve 2PE production in S. cerevisiae. In combination with the engineering of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and Ehrlich pathway, these mutations enabled better connection between  and pentose phosphate pathway optimizing carbon flux towards 2PE. However, attempts to further connect these two parts of central carbon metabolism by redirecting fructose-6P towards erythrose-4P by expressing a phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase pathway did not result in improved performance. The best performing strains were capable of producing 13mM of 2PE at a yield of 0.113 mol mol, which represents the highest yield for de novo produced 2PE in S. cerevisiae and other yeast species.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The difference in the role between RAR and RXR, however, are not well clarified. In the present study, we comparatively investigated the phenotypic and global gene expression changes in Xenopus tropicalis embryos induced by three different agonists, including a RAR selective ligand (all-trans retinoic acid, at-RA), a RXR selective ligand (fluorobexarotene, FBA) and their common ligand (9-cis retinoic acid, 9c-RA). All three agonists induced striking and similar malformations in X. tropicalis embryos at the concentrations of 5-50μg/L. Especially, the development of anterior structures and caudal region was dramatically altered. The hierarchical clustering analysis of phenotypes and gene profiles suggested that effects induced by 9c-RA separated from those by at-RA and FBA. The up-regulated genes were involved in multiple pathways while down-regulated genes were mainly related to phototransduction and  metabolism. at-RA primarily affected the retinol, , starch and sucrose metabolisms while FBA led to disturbances in more wide-ranging pathways such as the PPAR, adipocytokine, insulin, FoxO signaling pathways, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. RXR is a heterodimeric partner for several other nuclear receptors, which opens the possibility that additional retinoid effects could be mediated by FBA, such as RXR-PPAR. Our data indicates that not only RXR-RAR but also RXR-PPAR plays important roles in the control of metabolism with retinoid treatment in X. tropicalis embryos.Copyright © 2017.

So, we attempted to determine whether betanin (a natural pigment) would be protective against hyperglycemia in streptozotocin (STZ) - nicotinamide (NA) induced diabetic rats. Rats were injected with STZ (40mg/kgb.w.) 15 mins after the administration of NA (110mg/kgb.w.) by intraperitonially (i.p.) 30days for the induction of experimental diabetes mellitus. After 72h diabetic rats were treated with betanin orally at a doses of 10, 20 and 40mg/kg b.w., respectively in a dose dependent manner and glibenclamide (600μg/kgb.w.). The promising character of betanin against diabetic rats was evaluated by performing the various biochemical parameters and histomorphological changes in liver and pancreas. Among the three doses, 20mg/kgb.w. of betanin was able to positively regulate plasma glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels by significantly increasing the activity of glycolytic enzyme (glucokinase and pyruvate kinase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and significantly decreasing the activity of gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) thereby increasing the glycogen content in the liver. We put forward that betanin could significantly restore the levels of carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes to near normal in diabetic rat. Immunohistochemical observation of pancreas revealed that betanin treated diabetic rats showed increased insulin immunoreactive β-cells, which confirmed the biochemical findings. Taken together, present study suggests that betanin modulates the carbohydrate metabolism and has beneficial effects in glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, intracellular lipolysis appears not to be critical for cold-induced thermogenesis. As activation of the SNS increases glucose uptake, we studied whether intracellular  plays a role in BAT thermogenesis. To stimulate BAT-innervating sympathetic nerves in vivo, we expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in catecholaminergic fibers by crossbreeding  hydroxylase-Cre mice with floxed-stop ChR2 mice. Acute optogenetic stimulation of sympathetic efferent fibers of BAT increased body temperature and lowered blood glucose levels that were completely abolished by the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Knockdown of the Ucp1 gene in BAT blocked the effects of optogenetic stimulation on body temperature and glucose uptake. Inhibition of glucose uptake in BAT and  abolished optogenetically induced thermogenesis. Stimulation of sympathetic nerves upregulated expression of the lactate dehydrogenase-A and -B genes in BAT. Optogenetic stimulation failed to induce thermogenesis following treatment with the LDH inhibitor. Pharmacological blockade and genetic deletion of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 completely abolished the effects of sympathetic activation. Our results suggest that intracellular  and lactate shuttle play an important role in regulating acute thermogenesis in BAT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30220973>Involvement of GLUT1-mediated glucose transport and metabolism in gefitinib resistance of non-small-cell lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors represented by gefitinib and erlotinib has become the standard of treatment for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating EGFR mutations. However, the majority of NSCLCs, which overexpress EGFR without such mutations, are resistant to EGFR inhibitors, and the mechanism(s) behind such primary resistance of NSCLCs without activating EGFR mutations to EGFR inhibitors still remains poorly understood. Here in this study, we show that glucose metabolism mediated by GLUT1, a facilitative glucose transporter, is involved in gefitinib resistance of NSCLC cells. We found that GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake were increased in resistant NSCLC cells after gefitinib treatment and that genetic as well as pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 sensitized not only NSCLC cells with primary resistance but also those with acquired resistance to gefitinib. , the combination of systemic gefitinib and a GLUT1 inhibitor, both of which failed to inhibit tumor growth when administered alone, significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors formed by the implantation of NSCLC cells with wild-type EGFR (wt-EGFR). Since our data indicated that GLUT1 was similarly involved in erlotinib resistance, our findings suggest that the activity of GLUT1-mediated glucose metabolism could be a critical determinant for the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to EGFR inhibitors and that concurrent GLUT1 inhibition may therefore be a mechanism-based approach to treating NSCLCs resistant to EGFR inhibitors, including those with wt-EGFR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26973211>Metabolic tumor burden as marker of outcome in advanced EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib.</a></h2><p>Accurate estimation of the prognosis of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is essential before initiation of palliative treatment; especially in the second and third-line setting. This study was conducted in order to evaluate tumor burden measured on an 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan as a marker of outcome in advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type patients treated with second or third-line erlotinib.Fifty-one patients were included from a prospectively collected cohort. An F-18-FDG-PET/CT scan was conducted prior to erlotinib treatment and tumor burden was measured in terms of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG). Median values of MTV and TLG were used for dichotomization of patients. Survival outcome was compared between groups.MTV and TLG could be measured in 49 patients. High values of MTV and TLG were significantly correlated with shorter PFS (p<0.001 and p=0.027, respectively) and OS (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). In multivariate analyses, including both clinical and imaging data, high MTV and TLG remained strong independent markers of both shorter PFS (MTV, hazard ratio (HR)=5.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.46-12.02); TLG, HR=2.17 (95% CI 1.11-4.26)) and OS (MTV, HR=4.80 (95% CI 2.08-11.06); TLG, HR=2.76 (95% CI 1.33-5.71)).High MTV and TLG are independently correlated with shorter PFS and OS in advanced EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients treated with second or third-line erlotinib.

This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect. The pyruvate kinase promotes aerobic , and the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) is highly expressed in many cancer cells. Although the Warburg effect is a hallmark of cancer, the mechanism by which PKM2 contributes to the Warburg effect, and its role in tumor growth remain to be defined. We proposed that PKM2 activates transcription of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) by phosphorylating STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) at Y705 ( 705) as a plausible mechanism for liver cancer cell proliferation. In the current study, we observed that PKM2 was over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. The experiments further indicate that nuclear PKM2 is an active protein kinase in cultured cells. Knockdown of PKM2 affected the levels of HIF-1α and Bcl-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large), suggesting that PKM2 plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation. In conclusion, the current findings demonstrate that PKM2 is an active protein kinase, and promotes liver cancer cell proliferation by up-regulating HIF-1α and Bcl-xL expression.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Several drugs are being developed to overcome EGFR  kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. Here, we report that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) stabilized mutant EGFR protein by direct interaction and sustained cell survival signaling in lung cancer cells. PKM2 silencing resulted in markedly reduced mutant EGFR expression in TKI-sensitive or -resistant human lung cancer cells, and in inhibition of tumor growth in their xenografts, concomitant with downregulation of EGFR-related signaling. Mechanistically, PKM2 directly interacted with mutant EGFR and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), and thus stabilized EGFR by maintaining its binding with HSP90 and co-chaperones. Stabilization of EGFR relied on dimeric PKM2, and the protein half-life of mutant EGFR decreased when PKM2 was forced into its tetramer form. Clinical levels of PKM2 positively correlated with mutant EGFR expression and with patient outcome. These results reveal a previously undescribed non- function of PKM2 in the cytoplasm, which contribute to EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis and provide a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance to EGFR TKIs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26751287>The LINK-A lncRNA activates normoxic HIF1α signalling in triple-negative breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) predominately reside in the nucleus and exert their functions in many biological processes, their potential involvement in cytoplasmic signal transduction remains unexplored. Here, we identify a cytoplasmic lncRNA, LINK-A (long intergenic non-coding RNA for kinase activation), which mediates HB-EGF-triggered, EGFR:GPNMB heterodimer-dependent HIF1α phosphorylation at Tyr 565 and Ser 797 by BRK and LRRK2, respectively. These events cause HIF1α stabilization, HIF1α-p300 interaction, and activation of HIF1α transcriptional programs under normoxic conditions. Mechanistically, LINK-A facilitates the recruitment of BRK to the EGFR:GPNMB complex and BRK kinase activation. The BRK-dependent HIF1α Tyr 565 phosphorylation interferes with Pro 564 hydroxylation, leading to normoxic HIF1α stabilization. Both LINK-A expression and LINK-A-dependent signalling pathway activation correlate with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), promoting breast cancer  reprogramming and tumorigenesis.

We found that SLC2A5, which encodes solute carrier family 2 member 5 (SLC2A5, previously termed GLUT5) that facilitates cell fructose uptake, was up-regulated in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ALL). Microarray-based analyses also suggested that SLC2A5 expression was significantly down-regulated in childhood B-ALL with t(1;19) or 11q23 mutation. High SLC2A5 expression was found in patients who had disease recurrence within 3 years, early relapse, shortened complete remission duration and positive minimal residue disease (MRD) status after treatment. SLC2A5 overexpression at both the mRNA and protein level in Ph+ALL was confirmed in a validation cohort of childhood B-ALL. We also validated the correlation of SLC2A5 expression and MRD status. A mechanistic study using a human Ph+ALL cell line showed that BCR-ABL1 kinase might regulate SLC2A5 expression via MYC. The  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and dasatinib repressed SLC2A5 expression and the cell uptake of fructose. Fructose protected the tumour cells from nutrition deficiency and drug-induced cell death. Overall, our findings showed that SLC2A5 was up-regulated in childhood Ph+ALL. SLC2A5 expression correlated with childhood B-ALL clinical factors, such as MRD status. Given that TKIs could inhibit SLC2A5 expression, repression of fructose utility after TKI treatment contributes to TKI-induced Ph+ALL cytotoxicity. Targeting SLC2A5 might be promising in B-ALL treatment, especially for Ph+ALL patients with high SLC2A5 expression.© 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27470284>The changes of gene expression profiling between segmental vitiligo, generalized vitiligo and healthy individual.</a></h2><p>Vitiligo is a common acquired depigmentation skin disease characterized by loss or dysfunction of melanocytes within the skin lesion, but its pathologenesis is far from lucid.

The high-throughput whole genome expression microarrays were used to assay the gene expression profiles between HI, SV and GV. Bioinformatics tools were employed to annotated the biological function of differently expressed genes. Quantitative PCR assay was used to validate the gene expression of array.Compared to HI, 239 over-expressed genes and 175 down-expressed genes detected in SV, 688 over-expressed genes and 560 down-expressed genes were found in GV, following the criteria of log2 (fold change)≥0.585 and P value<0.05. In these differently expressed genes, 60 over-expressed genes and 60 down-expressed genes had similar tendency in SV and GV. Compared to SV, 223 genes were up regulated and 129 genes were down regulated in GV. In the SV with HI as control, the differently expressed genes were mainly involved in the adaptive immune response, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, focal adhesion and sphingolipid metabolism. The differently expressed genes between GV and HI were mainly involved in the innate immune, autophagy, apoptosis, melanocyte biology, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and  metabolism, which was different from SV. While the differently expressed genes between SV and GV were mainly involved in the metabolism pathway of purine, pyrimidine,  and sphingolipid.Above results suggested that they not only shared part bio-process and signal pathway, but more important, they utilized different biological mechanism in their pathogenesis and maintenance. Our results provide a comprehensive view on the gene expression profiling change between SV and GV especially in the side of leukocytes, and may facilitate the future study on their molecular mechanism and theraputic targets.Copyright © 2016 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

It is a potential drug target in the treatment of type II diabetes. The protein is also associated with a rare inherited metabolic disease and some cancer cells lack FBPase activity which promotes  facilitating the Warburg effect. Thus, there is interest in both inhibiting the enzyme (for diabetes treatment) and restoring its activity (in relevant cancers). The mammalian enzyme is tetrameric, competitively inhibited by Fructose 2,6-phosphate and negatively allosterically regulated by AMP. This allosteric regulation requires information transmission between the AMP binding site and the active site of the enzyme. A recent paper by Topaz et al. ( (2019) , pii:BSR20180960) has added additional detail to our understanding of this information transmission process. Two residues in the AMP binding site (Lys and Tyr) were shown to be involved in initiating the message between the two sites. This  residue has recently be shown to be important with protein's interaction with the antidiabetic drug metformin. A variant designed to increase metal ion affinity (M248D) resulted in a five-fold increase in enzymatic activity. Interestingly alterations of two residues at the subunit interfaces (Tyr and Met) resulted in increased responsiveness to AMP. Overall, these findings may have implications in the design of novel FBPase inhibitors or activators.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27178822>2-Deoxy-d-glucose Suppresses the In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy of Erlotinib in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Poor tumor response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a significant challenge for effective treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, strategies that may increase tumor response to EGFR TKIs are warranted in order to improve HNSCC patient treatment and overall survival.

We have previously shown that inhibition of  with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of cisplatin and radiation, which are commonly used to treat HNSCC. The goal of the current studies is to determine if 2DG will enhance the antitumor activity of the EGFR TKI erlotinib in HNSCC. Erlotinib transiently suppressed glucose consumption accompanied by alterations in pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression. 2DG enhanced the cytotoxic effect of erlotinib in vitro but reversed the antitumor effect of erlotinib in vivo. 2DG altered the N-glycosylation status of EGFR and induced the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers CHOP and BiP in vitro. Additionally, the effects of 2DG + erlotinib on cytotoxicity and ER stress in vitro were reversed by mannose but not glucose or antioxidant enzymes. Lastly, the protective effect of 2DG on erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity in vivo was reversed by chloroquine. Altogether, 2DG suppressed the antitumor efficacy of erlotinib in a HNSCC xenograft mouse model, which may be due to increased cytoprotective autophagy mediated by ER stress activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29072336>Mechanisms of toxicity associated with six  kinase inhibitors in human hepatocyte cell lines.</a></h2><p> kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of certain cancers. They are usually well tolerated, but can cause adverse reactions including liver injury. Currently, mechanisms of hepatotoxicity associated with  kinase inhibitors are only partially clarified. We therefore aimed at investigating the toxicity of regorafenib, sorafenib, ponatinib, crizotinib, dasatinib and pazopanib on HepG2 and partially on HepaRG cells. Regorafenib and sorafenib strongly inhibited oxidative metabolism (measured by the Seahorse-XF24 analyzer) and , decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced apoptosis and/or necrosis of HepG2 cells at concentrations similar to steady-state plasma concentrations in humans. In HepaRG cells, pretreatment with rifampicin decreased membrane toxicity (measured as adenylate kinase release) and dissipation of adenosine triphosphate stores, indicating that toxicity was associated mainly with the parent drugs. Ponatinib strongly impaired oxidative metabolism but only weakly , and induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells at concentrations higher than steady-state plasma concentrations in humans. Crizotinib and dasatinib did not significantly affect mitochondrial functions and inhibited  only weakly, but induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Pazopanib was associated with a weak increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation and inhibition of  without being cytotoxic. In conclusion, regorafenib and sorafenib are strong mitochondrial toxicants and inhibitors of  at clinically relevant concentrations. Ponatinib affects mitochondria and  at higher concentrations than reached in plasma (but possibly in liver), whereas crizotinib, dasatinib and pazopanib showed no relevant toxicity. Mitochondrial toxicity and inhibition of  most likely explain hepatotoxicity associated with regorafenib, sorafenib and possibly pazopanib, but not for the other compounds investigated.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277809>Distinct Nrf2 Signaling Mechanisms of Fumaric Acid Esters and Their Role in Neuroprotection against 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1,2,3,6-Tetrahydropyridine-Induced Experimental Parkinson's-Like Disease.</a></h2><p>A promising approach to neurotherapeutics involves activating the nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element signaling, which regulates expression of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective genes. Tecfidera, a putative Nrf2 activator, is an oral formulation of dimethylfumarate (DMF) used to treat multiple sclerosis. We compared the effects of DMF and its bioactive metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) on Nrf2 signaling and their ability to block 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced experimental Parkinson's disease (PD). We show that in vitro DMF and MMF activate the Nrf2 pathway via S-alkylation of the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 and by causing nuclear exit of the Nrf2 repressor Bach1. Nrf2 activation by DMF but not MMF was associated with depletion of glutathione, decreased cell viability, and inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and  rates in a dose-dependent manner, whereas MMF increased these activities in vitro However, both DMF and MMF upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis in vitro in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Despite the in vitro differences, both DMF and MMF exerted similar neuroprotective effects and blocked MPTP neurotoxicity in wild-type but not in Nrf2 null mice. Our data suggest that DMF and MMF exhibit neuroprotective effects against MPTP neurotoxicity because of their distinct Nrf2-mediated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial functional/biogenetic effects, but MMF does so without depleting glutathione and inhibiting mitochondrial and glycolytic functions. Given that oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are all implicated in PD pathogenesis, our results provide preclinical evidence for the development of MMF rather than DMF as a novel PD therapeutic.Almost two centuries since its first description by James Parkinson, Parkinson's disease (PD) remains an incurable disease with limited symptomatic treatment. The current study provides preclinical evidence that a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, dimethylfumarate (DMF), and its metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) can block nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of PD. We elucidated mechanisms by which DMF and its active metabolite MMF activates the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to upregulate antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial biosynthetic and cytoprotective genes to render neuroprotection via distinct S-alkylating properties and depletion of glutathione. Our data suggest that targeting Nrf2-mediated gene transcription using MMF rather than DMF is a promising approach to block oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction for therapeutic intervention in PD while minimizing side effects.Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/366333-20$15.00/0.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25621025>-induced  and apoptosis regulator promotes proliferation and invasiveness of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>The -induced  and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is the protein product of the p53 target gene, . TIGAR blocks  and promotes cellular metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway; it promotes the production of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which leads to enhanced scavenging of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in normal cells. Our previous study identified a novel nucleoside analog that inhibited cellular growth and induced apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines via downregulation of TIGAR expression. Furthermore, the growth inhibitory effects of c-Met  kinase inhibitors were ameliorated by the overexpression of TIGAR in the NPC cell lines. These results indicate a significant role for TIGAR expression in the survival of NPCs. The present study aimed to further define the function of TIGAR expression in NPC cells. In total, 36 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded NPC tissue samples were obtained for the immunohistochemical determination of TIGAR expression. The effects of TIGAR expression on cell proliferation, NADPH production and cellular invasiveness were also assessed in NPC cell lines. Overall, TIGAR was overexpressed in 27/36 (75%) of the NPC tissues compared with the adjacent non-cancer epithelial cells. Similarly, TIGAR overexpression was also observed in a panel of six NPC cell lines compared with normal NP460 hTert and Het1A cell lines. TIGAR overexpression led to increased cellular growth, NADPH production and invasiveness of the NPC cell lines, whereas a knockdown of TIGAR expression resulted in significant inhibition of cellular growth and invasiveness. The expression of the two mesenchymal markers, fibronectin and vimentin, was increased by TIGAR overexpression, but reduced following TIGAR-knockdown. The present study revealed that TIGAR overexpression led to increased cellular growth, NADPH production and invasiveness, and the maintenance of a mesenchymal phenotype, in NPC tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947742>Metabolic reprogramming and redox adaptation in sorafenib-resistant leukemia cells: detected by untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing analysis.</a></h2><p>Internal tandem duplications (ITD) within the juxtamembrane domain of FMS-like  kinase 3 (FLT3) represent a poor prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therapeutic benefits of  kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, are limited due to the emergence of drug resistance. While investigations have been conducted to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to this FLT3 inhibitor, a profile of cell functioning at the metabolite level and crosstalk between metabolic pathways has yet to be created. This study aimed to elucidate the alteration of metabolomic profile of leukemia cells resistant to the FLT3 inhibitor.We established two sorafenib-resistant cell lines carrying FLT3/ITD mutations, namely the murine BaF3/ITD-R and the human MV4-11-R cell lines. We performed a global untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope-labeling mass spectrometry analysis to identify the metabolic alterations relevant to the therapeutic resistance.The resistant cells displayed fundamentally rewired metabolic profiles, characterized by a higher demand for glucose, accompanied by a reduction in glucose flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP); and by an increase in oxidative stress, accompanied by an enhanced glutathione synthesis. We demonstrated that the highest scoring network of altered metabolites in resistant cells was related to nucleotide degradation. A stable isotope tracing experiment was performed and the results indicated a decrease in the quantity of glucose entering the PPP in resistant cells. Further experiment suggested that the inhibition of major enzymes in the PPP consist of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) in the oxidative arm and transketolase (TKT) in the non-oxidative arm. In addition, we observed that chronic treatment with sorafenib resulted in an increased oxidative stress in FLT3/ITD-positive leukemia cells, which was accompanied by decreased cell proliferation and an enhanced antioxidant response.Our data regarding comparative metabolomics characterized a distinct metabolic and redox adaptation that may contribute to sorafenib resistance in FLT3/ITD-mutated leukemia cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279633>A H NMR based study of hemolymph metabonomics in different resistant silkworms, Bombyx mori (Lepidotera), after BmNPV inoculation.</a></h2><p>Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a primary silkworm pathogen, and the molecular mechanism of silkworm defense to BmNPV infection is still unclear. Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of energy, plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose metabolism plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and  was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The  and gluconeogenesis pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection. Moreover, the levels of other metabolites related to fat metabolism, transamination, energy metabolism, and glycometabolism, such as glycine, threonine, glutamine, and glutamate, were unstable in the two silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. Thus, our study provides an overview of the metabolic response of the silkworm in response to BmNPV infection, which lays the foundation for clarifying the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While quiescent T cells use oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production, and effector T cells (Teffs) rely on  for proliferation, the distinct metabolic features of regulatory T cells (Tregs) are less well established. Here we show that the metabolic sensor LKB1 is critical to maintain cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis in Tregs. Treg-specific deletion of  in mice causes loss of Treg number and function, leading to a fatal, early-onset autoimmune disorder. Tregs lacking  have defective mitochondria, compromised OXPHOS, depleted cellular ATP, and altered cellular metabolism pathways that compromise their survival and function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the function of LKB1 in Tregs is largely independent of the AMP-activated protein kinase, but is mediated by the MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinases and salt-inducible kinases. Our results define a metabolic checkpoint in Tregs that couples metabolic regulation to immune homeostasis and tolerance.Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

Consequently,  kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the EGFR are among the most effective therapies for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations. Clinical responses to the EGFR-targeting TKIs are evaluated through 2-[F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET uptake, which is decreased in patients responding favorably to therapy and is positively correlated with survival. Recent studies have reported that EGFR signaling drives glucose metabolism in NSCLC cells; however, the precise downstream effectors required for this EGFR-driven metabolic effect are largely unknown. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) is an essential glycolytic regulator that is consistently overexpressed in lung cancer. Here, we found that PFKFB3 is an essential target of EGFR signaling and that PFKFB3 activation is required for  stimulation upon EGFR activation. We demonstrate that exposing NSCLC cells harboring either WT or mutated EGFR to EGF rapidly increases PFKFB3 phosphorylation, expression, and activity and that PFKFB3 inhibition markedly reduces the EGF-mediated increase in . Furthermore, we found that prolonged NSCLC cell exposure to the TKI erlotinib drives PFKFB3 expression and that chemical PFKFB3 inhibition synergizes with erlotinib in increasing erlotinib's anti-proliferative activity in NSCLC cells. We conclude that PFKFB3 has a key role in mediating glucose metabolism and survival of NSCLC cells in response to EGFR signaling. These results support the potential clinical utility of using PFKFB3 inhibitors in combination with EGFR-TKIs to manage NSCLC.© 2019 Lypova et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445804>Regorafenib impairs mitochondrial functions, activates AMP-activated protein kinase, induces autophagy, and causes rat hepatocyte necrosis.</a></h2><p>The  kinase inhibitor regorafenib was approved by regulatory agencies for cancer treatment, albeit with strong warnings of severe hepatotoxicity included in the product label. The basis of this toxicity is unknown; one possible mechanism, that of mitochondrial damage, was tested. In isolated rat liver mitochondria, regorafenib directly uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and promoted calcium overload-induced swelling, which were respectively prevented by the recoupler 6-ketocholestanol (KC) and the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore blocker cyclosporine A (CsA). In primary hepatocytes, regorafenib uncoupled OXPHOS, disrupted mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP), and decreased cellular ATP at 1h, and triggered MPT at 3h, which was followed by necrosis but not apoptosis at 7h and 24h, all of which were abrogated by KC. The combination of the  enhancer fructose plus the mitochondrial ATPase synthase inhibitor oligomycin A abolished regorafenib induced necrosis at 7h. This effect was not seen at 24h nor with the fructose or oligomycin A separately. CsA in combination with trifluoperazine, both MPT blockers, showed similar effects. Two compensatory mechanisms, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to ameliorate ATP shortage and induction of autophagy to remove dysfunctional mitochondria, were found to be mobilized. Hepatocyte necrosis was enhanced either by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C or the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, while autophagy inducer rapamycin was strongly cytoprotective. Remarkably, all toxic effects were observed at clinically-relevant concentrations of 2.5-15μM. These data suggest that uncoupling of OXPHOS and the resulting ATP shortage and MPT induction are the key mechanisms for regorafenib induced hepatocyte injury, and AMPK activation and autophagy induction serve as pro-survival pathways against such toxicity.Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212523>Redox regulation in metabolic programming and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Energy metabolism and redox state are intrinsically linked. In order to mount an adequate immune response, cells must have an adequate and rapidly available energy resource to migrate to the inflammatory site, to generate reactive oxygen species using NADPH as a cofactor and to engulf bacteria or damaged tissue. The first responder cells of the innate immune response, neutrophils, are largely dependent on . Neutrophils are relatively short-lived, dying via apoptosis in the process of bacterial killing through production of hypochlorous acid and release of extracellular NETs. Later on, the most prevalent recruited innate immune cells are monocytes. Their role is to complete a damage limitation exercise initiated by neutrophils and then, as re-programmed M2 macrophages, to resolve the inflammatory event. Almost twenty five years ago, it was noted that macrophages lose their glycolytic capacity and become anti-inflammatory after treatment with corticosteroids. In support of this we now understand that, in contrast to early responders, M2 macrophages are predominantly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy. During early inflammation, polarisation towards M1 macrophages is dependent on NOX2 activation which, via protein  phosphatase oxidation and AKT activation, increases trafficking of glucose transporters to the membrane and consequently increases glucose uptake for . In parallel, mitochondrial efficiency is likely to be compromised via nitrosylation of the electron transport chain. Resolution of inflammation is triggered by encounter with apoptotic membranes exposing oxidised phosphatidylserine that interact with the scavenger receptor, CD36. Downstream of CD36, activation of AMPK and PPARγ elicits mitochondrial biogenesis, arginase expression and a switch towards oxidative phosphorylation in the M2 macrophage. Proinflammatory cytokine production by M2 cells decreases, but anti-inflammatory and wound healing growth factor production is maintained to support restoration of normal function.Copyright © 2017.

HBP provides substrate for N-linked glycosylation, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.

Their metabolism is elevated, which allows them to sustain higher proliferative rate and resist some cell death signals. This phenomenon, known as the "Warburg effect", has become the focus of intensive efforts in the discovery of new therapeutic targets and new cancer drugs. Both  and glutaminolysis pathways are enhanced in cancer cells. While  is enhanced to satisfy the increasing energy demand of cancer cells, glutaminolysis is enhanced to provide biosynthetic precursors for cancer cells. It was recently discovered that there is a  phosphorylation of a specific isoform of pyruvate kinase, the M2 isoform, that is preferentially expressed in all cancer cells, which results in the generation of pyruvate through a unique enzymatic mechanism that is uncoupled from ATP production. Pyruvate produced through this unique enzymatic mechanism is converted primarily into lactic acid, rather than acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of citrate, which would normally then enter the citric acid cycle. Inhibition of key enzymes in  and glutaminolysis pathways with small molecules has provided a novel but emerging area of cancer research and has been proven effective in slowing the proliferation of cancer cells, with several inhibitors being in clinical trials. This review paper will cover recent advances in the development of chemotherapeutic agents against several metabolic targets for cancer therapy, including glucose transporters, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase M2, glutaminase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997364>The role of melanogenesis in regulation of melanoma behavior: melanogenesis leads to stimulation of HIF-1α expression and HIF-dependent attendant pathways.</a></h2><p>To study the effect of melanogenesis on HIF-1α expression and attendant pathways, we used stable human and hamster melanoma cell lines in which the amelanotic vs. melanotic phenotypes are dependent upon the concentration of melanogenesis precursors in the culture media. The induction of melanin pigmentation led to significant up-regulation of HIF-1α, but not HIF-2α, protein in melanized cells for both lines. Similar upregulation of nuclear HIF-1α was observed in excisions of advanced melanotic vs. amelanotic melanomas. In cultured cells, melanogenesis also significantly stimulated expression of classical HIF-1-dependent target genes involved in angiogenesis and cellular metabolism, including glucose metabolism and stimulation of activity of key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. Several other stress related genes containing putative HRE consensus sites were also upregulated by melanogenesis, concurrently with modulation of expression of HIF-1-independent genes encoding for steroidogenic enzymes, cytokines and growth factors. Immunohistochemical studies using a large panel of pigmented lesions revealed that higher levels of HIF-1α and GLUT-1 were detected in advanced melanomas in comparison to melanocytic nevi or thin melanomas localized to the skin. However, the effects on overall or disease free survival in melanoma patients were modest or absent for GLUT-1 or for HIF-1α, respectively. In conclusion, induction of the melanogenic pathway leads to robust upregulation of HIF-1-dependent and independent pathways in cultured melanoma cells, suggesting a key role for melanogenesis in regulation of cellular metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27785417>Metabolic response to glatiramer acetate therapy in multiple sclerosis patients.</a></h2><p>Glatiramer acetate (GA; Copaxone) is a random copolymer of glutamic acid, lysine, alanine, and  used for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Here, we show that the CLL lymph node niche is characterized by overexpression and activation of HIF-1α, which increases adenosine generation and signaling, affecting tumor and host cellular responses. Hypoxia in CLL lymphocytes modifies central metabolic pathways, protects against drug-driven apoptosis, and induces interleukin 10 (IL-10) production. In myeloid cells, it forces monocyte differentiation to macrophages expressing IRF4, IDO, CD163, and CD206, hallmarks of the M2 phenotype, which promotes tumor progression. It also induces IL-6 production and enhances nurturing properties. Low oxygen levels decrease T-cell proliferation, promote , and cause the appearance of a population of PD-1 and IL-10-secreting T cells. Blockade of the A2A adenosine receptor counteracts these effects on all cell populations, making leukemic cells more susceptible to pharmacological agents while restoring immune competence and T-cell proliferation. Together, these results indicate that adenosine signaling through the A2A receptor mediates part of the effects of hypoxia. They also suggest that therapeutic strategies to inhibit the adenosinergic axis may be useful adjuncts to chemotherapy or  kinase inhibitors in the treatment of CLL patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26852079>Resistance mechanisms after  kinase inhibitors afatinib and crizotinib in non-small cell lung cancer, a review of the literature.</a></h2><p>Targeted treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with afatinib in EGFR mutation or crizotinib in ALK break positive patients results in profound tumor responses but inevitably induces resistance.

EGFR inhibitors for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) treatment have been applied for decades in clinical practices with great success, but also their clinical benefits were somewhat hampered by the rising acquired-resistance. Combination drug therapy is an effective strategy to cope with the challenge. In this study, we utilized Dichloroacetate (DCA), a widely regarded PDK inhibitor, together with Erlotinib and Gefitinib, two well-known EGFR inhibitors, and demonstrated that the applications of DCA in combination with either Erlotinib or Gefitinib significantly attenuated the viability of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells (NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1650) in a synergistic manner. This synergistic outcome appears to be a combination effect in promoting apoptosis, rather than co-suppression of either EGFR or PDK signaling pathways. Moreover, we have shown that the combination treatment did not exhibit synergistic effect in other NSCLC cell lines without EGFR mutations (A549 or NCI-H460). Together, these observations suggested that combined targeting of EGFR and PDK in NSCLC cells exerted synergistic effects in an EGFR mutation-dependent fashion.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

GSTZ1 is dysregulated in cancers; however, its role in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the role of GSTZ1 in HCC and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, which may contribute to finding a potential therapeutic strategy against HCC.We first analyzed GSTZ1 expression levels in paired human HCC and adjacent normal tissue specimens and the prognostic effect of GSTZ1 on HCC patients. Thereafter, we evaluated the role of GSTZ1 in aerobic  in HCC cells on the basis of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of GSTZ1 on HCC proliferation, glutathione (GSH) concentration, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling via gain- and loss- of GSTZ1 function in vitro. Moreover, we investigated the effect of GSTZ1 on diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a mouse model of HCC.GSTZ1 was downregulated in HCC, thus indicating a poor prognosis. GSTZ1 deficiency significantly promoted hepatoma cell proliferation and aerobic  in HCC cells. Moreover, loss of GSTZ1 function depleted GSH, increased ROS levels, and enhanced lipid peroxidation, thus activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway. Furthermore, Gstz1 knockout in mice promoted DEN/CCl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine and NRF2 inhibitor brusatol effectively suppressed the growth of Gstz1-knockout HepG2 cells and HCC progression in Gstz1 mice.GSTZ1 serves as a tumor suppressor in HCC. GSH depletion caused by GSTZ1 deficiency elevates oxidative stress, thus constitutively activating the NRF2 antioxidant response pathway and accelerating HCC progression. Targeting the NRF2 signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic approach for this subset of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414323>Pyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 mediates pyruvate kinase M2-dependent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and oncogenesis in anaplastic large cell lymphoma.</a></h2><p>PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), a critical regulator of , is phosphorylated by numerous growth factor receptors and oncogenic  kinases including NPM-ALK which is expressed in a subset of aggressive T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas known as anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-positive. Our previous work demonstrated that phosphorylation of Y105-PKM2 by NPM-ALK regulates a major metabolic shift to promote lymphomagenesis. In addition to its role in metabolism, recent studies have shown that PKM2 promotes oncogenesis by phosphorylating nuclear STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and regulating transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation. We hypothesized that identification of novel PKM2 interactors could provide additional insights into its expanding functional role in cancer. To this end, immunocomplexes of FLAG-tagged PKM2 were isolated from NPM-ALK-positive ALCL (anaplastic large cell lymphoma) cells and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) which led to the identification of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) as a novel interactor of PKM2. The interaction between PTBP1 and PKM2 was restricted to the nucleus and was dependent on NPM-ALK mediated Y105 phosphorylation of PKM2. Stable shRNA-mediated silencing of PTBP1 resulted in a marked decrease in pY105-PKM2 and pY705-STAT3 which led to decreased ALCL cell proliferation and colony formation. Overall, our data demonstrate that PTBP1 interacts with PKM2 and promotes ALCL oncogenesis by facilitating PKM2-dependent activation of STAT3 within the nucleus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410193>Metabolic targeting of EGFRvIII/PDK1 axis in temozolomide resistant glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastomas are characterized by amplification of EGFR. Approximately half of tumors with EGFR over-expression also express a constitutively active ligand independent EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII). While current treatments emphasize surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ), acquired chemoresistance is a universal feature of recurrent GBMs. To mimic the GBM resistant state, we generated an in vitro TMZ resistant model and demonstrated that dichloroacetate (DCA), a metabolic inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), reverses the Warburg effect. Microarray analysis conducted on the TMZ resistant cells with their subsequent treatment with DCA revealed PDK1 as its sole target. DCA treatment also induced mitochondrial membrane potential change and apoptosis as evidenced by JC-1 staining and electron microscopic studies. Computational homology modeling and docking studies confirmed DCA binding to EGFR, EGFRvIII and PDK1 with high affinity. In addition, expression of EGFRvIII was comparable to PDK1 when compared to EGFR in GBM surgical specimens supporting our in silico prediction data. Collectively our current study provides the first in vitro proof of concept that DCA reverses the Warburg effect in the setting of EGFRvIII positivity and TMZ resistance leading to GBM cytotoxicity, implicating cellular  kinase signaling in cancer cell metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197082>Extracellular Matrix Remodeling Regulates Glucose Metabolism through TXNIP Destabilization.</a></h2><p>The metabolic state of a cell is influenced by cell-extrinsic factors, including nutrient availability and growth factor signaling. Here, we present extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as another fundamental node of cell-extrinsic metabolic regulation. Unbiased analysis of glycolytic drivers identified the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor as being among the most highly correlated with  in cancer. Confirming a mechanistic link between the ECM component hyaluronan and metabolism, treatment of cells and xenografts with hyaluronidase triggers a robust increase in . This is largely achieved through rapid receptor  kinase-mediated induction of the mRNA decay factor ZFP36, which targets TXNIP transcripts for degradation. Because TXNIP promotes internalization of the glucose transporter GLUT1, its acute decline enriches GLUT1 at the plasma membrane. Functionally, induction of  by hyaluronidase is required for concomitant acceleration of cell migration. This interconnection between ECM remodeling and metabolism is exhibited in dynamic tissue states, including tumorigenesis and embryogenesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The utilization of rootstock that is resistant to Fe deficiency is an effective way to solve this problem. Malus halliana is an Fe deficiency-tolerant rootstock; however, few molecular studies have been conducted on M. halliana. In the present work, a transcriptome analysis was combined with qRT-PCR and sugar measurements to investigate Fe deficiency responses in M. halliana roots at 0 h (T1), 12 h (T2) and 72 h (T3) after Fe deficiency stress. Total of 2473, 661, and 776 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the pairs of T2 vs. T1, T3 vs. T1, and T3 vs. T2, respectively. Several DEGs were enriched in the photosynthesis,  and gluconeogenesis,  metabolism and fatty acid degradation pathways. The  and photosynthesis pathways were upregulated under Fe deficiency. In this experiment, sucrose accumulated in Fe-deficient roots and leaves. However, the glucose content significantly decreased in the roots, while the fructose content significantly decreased in the leaves. Additionally, 15 genes related to  and sugar synthesis and sugar transport were selected to validate the accuracy of the transcriptome data by qRT-PCR. Overall, these results indicated that sugar synthesis and metabolism in the roots were affected by Fe deficiency.

For target-based therapy of lung cancer, gefitinib, as the first generation of  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), demonstrated good initial response to the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whom harbors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. However, within one year, additional EGFR mutation occurred, leading to eventual gefitinib-resistance. Therefore, it is urgently to discover novel effective small molecule inhibitors for those patients. Abnormal energy metabolism is accepted as new cancer hallmark. Recently, a metabolism rate-limiting enzyme 5'-adenosine menophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has become a promising anti-cancer target. In this study, we have identified a novel direct AMPK agonist, D561-0775 from a compound library by using molecular docking screening technique. We demonstrated that D561-0775 exhibited significant inhibitory effect on gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines but less cytotoxicity on normal cells. Furthermore, D561-0775 demonstrated a remarkable  AMPK enzyme activation effect. Taken together, D561-0775 showed potential anti-cancer activity via inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, suppressing  and cholesterol synthesis after activation of AMPK in gefitinib-resistant H1975 cells. D561-0775 has provided a new chemical structure that could be developed as cancer drug for gefitinib-resistant NSCLC patients through inhibition lipid metabolism by directly targeting at AMPK directly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27717823>Plexin A1 signaling confers malignant phenotypes in lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Aberrant changes to several signaling pathways because of genetic mutations or increased cytokine production are critical for tumor cells to become malignant. Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) acts as a bivalent factor that suppresses or promotes tumor development in different pathological backgrounds. Previously, we showed that SEMA3A positively regulated the proliferative and glycolytic activities of mouse-derived Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. Plexins A1-A4 (PLXNA1-PLXNA4) are SEMA3A receptors; however, it is not known which subtype is critical for oncogenic SEMA3A signaling. We used LLC cells to investigate the role of PLXNA1 in oncogenic SEMA3A signaling. Using short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, we investigated the effects of constitutive inhibition of Plxna1 on cell proliferation, metabolic dependency, and epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) sensitivity. We found that Plxna1 knockdown did not affect apoptosis but resulted in decreased cell proliferation and reductions in mRNA expression levels of proliferation-marker genes, such as Ccnd1, Pcna, and Myc. In addition, we found decreased mRNA expression levels of -associated genes, such as Pkm2 and Ldha, and decreased lactate production. In contrast, we found no changes in the mRNA expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation-associated genes, such as Cycs, Cox5a, and Atp5g1. We found that Plxna1 knockdown conferred resistance to glucose starvation but increased cytotoxicity to oligomycin. Plxna1 or Sema3a knockdown caused an increased sensitivity to the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib, in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. These findings demonstrate that PLXNA1 mediates the acquisition of malignant phenotypes induced by autocrine SEMA3A signaling.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed at exploring the role of microRNA-140 (miR-140) in septic mice. Wnt family member 11 (WNT11) was verified to be a target gene of miR-140 after bioinformatic prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Importantly, miR-140 negatively regulated WNT11. We initially induced the model of sepsis by endotoxin, and then ectopic expression and knockdown experiments were performed to explore the functional role of miR-140 in sepsis. Additionally, cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber, lactic acid production, 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and  (Tyr) production in extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscles, and serum levels of inflammatory factors were examined. The effect of miR-140 on the expression of WNT signaling pathway-related and apoptosis-related factors in skeletal muscle tissue was determined. The experimental results indicated that upregulated miR-140 or silenced WNT11 increased cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber while decreasing lactic acid production, skeletal muscle cell apoptosis [corresponding to downregulated B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3 and upregulated Bcl-2], and the proteolytic rate of Tyr and 3-MH. Also, overexpressed miR-140 or silenced WNT11 reduced inflammation as reflected by decreased serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-140 was shown to suppress the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, accompanied by decreased expression of WNT11, β-catenin, and GSK-3β. Taken together, upregulation of miR-140 could potentially inhibit skeletal muscle lactate release, an indirect measure of , and atrophy in septic mice through suppressing the WNT signaling pathway via inhibiting WNT11 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28129334>A Novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Approach to Monitor Cardiac Metabolic Pathway Remodeling in Response to Sunitinib Malate.</a></h2><p>Sunitinib is a  kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of multiple solid tumors. However, cardiotoxicity is of increasing concern, with a need to develop rational mechanism driven approaches for the early detection of cardiac dysfunction. We sought to interrogate changes in cardiac energy substrate usage during sunitinib treatment, hypothesising that these changes could represent a strategy for the early detection of cardiotoxicity. Balb/CJ mice or Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally for 4 weeks with 40 or 20 mg/kg/day sunitinib. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) was implemented to investigate alterations in myocardial glucose and oxidative metabolism. Following treatment, blood pressure increased, and left ventricular ejection fraction decreased. Cardiac [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET revealed increased glucose uptake after 48 hours. [11C]Acetate-PET showed decreased myocardial perfusion following treatment. Electron microscopy revealed significant lipid accumulation in the myocardium. Proteomic analyses indicated that oxidative metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction were among the top myocardial signalling pathways perturbed. Sunitinib treatment results in an increased reliance on , increased myocardial lipid deposition and perturbed mitochondrial function, indicative of a fundamental energy crisis resulting in compromised myocardial energy metabolism and function. Our findings suggest that a cardiac PET strategy may represent a rational approach to non-invasively monitor metabolic pathway remodeling following sunitinib treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891507>Aberrant FGFR  Kinase Signaling Enhances the Warburg Effect by Reprogramming LDH Isoform Expression and Activity in Prostate Cancer.</a></h2><p>The acquisition of ectopic fibroblast growthfactor receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression is well documented in prostate cancer progression. How it contributes to prostate cancer progression is not fully understood, although it is known to confer a growth advantage and promote cell survival. Here, we report that FGFR1  kinase reprograms the energy metabolism of prostate cancer cells by regulating the expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes. FGFR1 increased LDHA stability through  phosphorylation and reduced LDHB expression by promoting its promoter methylation, thereby shifting cell metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic . LDHA depletion compromised, whereas LDHB depletion enhanced the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, FGFR1 overexpression and aberrant LDH isozyme expression were associated with short overall survival and biochemical recurrence times in patients with prostate cancer. Our results indicate that ectopic FGFR1 expression reprograms the energy metabolism of prostate cancer cells, representing a hallmark change in prostate cancer progression. FGF signaling drives the Warburg effect through differential regulation of LDHA and LDHB, thereby promoting the progression of prostate cancer. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/16/4459/F1.large.jpg .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28835371>B-cell Receptor Signaling Regulates Metabolism in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.</a></h2><p>Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are quiescent but have active transcription and translation processes, suggesting that these lymphocytes are metabolically active. Based on this premise, the metabolic phenotype of CLL lymphocytes was investigated by evaluating the two intracellular ATP-generating pathways. Metabolic flux was assessed by measuring  as extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and then correlated with prognostic factors. Further, the impact of B-cell receptor signaling (BCR) on metabolism was determined by genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibitors. Compared with proliferative B-cell lines, metabolic fluxes of oxygen and lactate were low in CLL cells. ECAR was consistently low, but OCR varied considerably in human patient samples ( = 45). Higher OCR was associated with poor prognostic factors such as ZAP 70 positivity, unmutated IGHV, high β2M levels, and higher Rai stage. Consistent with the association of ZAP 70 and IGHV unmutated status with active BCR signaling, genetic ablation of BCR mitigated OCR in malignant B cells. Similarly, knocking out PI3Kδ, a critical component of the BCR pathway, decreased OCR and ECAR. In concert, PI3K pathway inhibitors dramatically reduced OCR and ECAR. In harmony with a decline in metabolic activity, the ribonucleotide pools in CLL cells were reduced with duvelisib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate that CLL metabolism, especially OCR, is linked to prognostic factors and is curbed by BCR and PI3K pathway inhibition. This study identifies a relationship between oxidative phosphorylation in CLL and prognostic factors providing a rationale to therapeutically target these processes. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29225472>F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake predicts MET expression in lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>MET is a member of the receptor  kinases. Several MET-targeting inhibitors and antagonistic antibodies have shown promising data in clinical trials of lung adenocarcinoma. Finding noninvasive diagnostic tools to estimate the status of MET is helpful in clinical practice. F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (F-FDG PET/CT) has been used routinely for the diagnosis and staging of tumors. However, the relationship between MET expression and F-FDG uptake has not been investigated yet. This study aimed to determine the correlation of MET expression with F-FDG uptake on PET-CT scan and whether or not F-FDG PET/CT can be used to predict the MET status of lung adenocarcinoma patients.Fifty-seven lung adenocarcinoma patients were analyzed in our study. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated in all PET/CT images. The expression levels of MET and two important -related markers, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and pyruvate kinase M2, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry of tissues. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyze the association between MET expression and SUV. In vitro MET knockdown in lung adenocarcinoma cells was used to examine the role of MET in tumor metabolism. The effect of MET on GLUT1 expression was investigated using Western blot assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.SUV was positively correlated with the expression levels of MET (=0.458; <0.001) and GLUT1 (=0.551; <0.001). SUV was significantly higher in patients with positive MET expression than in those with negative MET expression (9.92±6.62 vs 4.60±3.00; =0.002). MET knockdown in lung adenocarcinoma cells led to a significant decrease in GLUT1 expression and F-FDG uptake.MET could increase F-FDG uptake by upregulating GLUT1 expression.

However, the context-dependent metabolic traits of CRCSCs remain poorly elucidated. Here we report that adenylate kinase hCINAP is overexpressed in CRC tissues. Depletion of hCINAP inhibits invasion, self-renewal, tumorigenesis and chemoresistance of CRCSCs with a loss of mesenchymal signature. Mechanistically, hCINAP binds to the C-terminal domain of LDHA, the key regulator of , and depends on its adenylate kinase activity to promote LDHA phosphorylation at  10, resulting in the hyperactive Warburg effect and the lower cellular ROS level and conferring metabolic advantage to CRCSC invasion. Moreover, hCINAP expression is positively correlated with the level of Y10-phosphorylated LDHA in CRC patients.

The antioxidant tempol was shown to prevent or reduce weight gain and modulate the gut microbiota community in mice; however, the mechanism by which tempol modulates weight gain/loss with respect to the host and gut microbiota has not been clearly established. Here we show that tempol (0, 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg p.o. for 5 days) decreased cecal bacterial fermentation and increased fecal energy excretion in a dose-dependent manner. Liver (1)H NMR-based metabolomics identified a dose-dependent decrease in glycogen and glucose, enhanced glucogenic and ketogenic activity ( and phenylalanine), and increased activation of the  pathway. Serum (1)H NMR-based metabolomics indicated that tempol promotes enhanced glucose catabolism. Hepatic gene expression was significantly altered as demonstrated by an increase in Pepck and G6pase and a decrease in Hnf4a, ChREBP, Fabp1, and Cd36 mRNAs. No significant change in the liver and serum metabolomic profiles was observed in germ-free mice, thus establishing a significant role for the gut microbiota in mediating the beneficial metabolic effects of tempol. These results demonstrate that tempol modulates the gut microbial community and its function, resulting in reduced host energy availability and a significant shift in liver metabolism toward a more catabolic state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29758295>Systematic bioinformatic approaches reveal novel gene expression signatures associated with acquired resistance to EGFR targeted therapy in lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that harbors activating mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) initially responds to treatment with EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib but eventually tumor cells acquire resistance. To date, several gene expression profiles have been reported in TKIs-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The objective of this study is to identify robust gene expression signatures, biological processes, and promising overcoming targets for TKIs-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC.Five publicly available microarray datasets were integrated by performing two network-based meta-analyses following by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and gene set enrichment analysis.According to our meta-analyses, 830 and 1286 genes were differentially expressed in the TKIs-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines compared to TKIs-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines in the absence and presence of TKIs treatment, respectively. PPI network analysis identified ESR1 and ELAVL1 to be the most highly ranked hub genes involved in the NSCLC acquired TKI-resistance. Moreover, gene set enrichment analyses indicated that up-regulated genes are mainly distributed in hallmarks "", some "E2F targets". Down-regulated genes mainly contribute to hallmarks "interferon alpha response", "interferon gamma response", and also "E2F targets". For the first time, this study has demonstrated several robust candidate genes and pathways of the NSCLC acquired TKI-resistance.

Metabolomic signatures represent the pathophysiological phenotype of diseases. Recent studies in gut microbiota and metabolomics analysis revealed the dramatic role of microbiome in psychoneurological system diseases, but still, the mechanisms underlying gut microbiome-host interaction remain unclear.Male Wistar rats were s.c. injection of ACTH fragment 1-24 for 14 days to induce treatment-resistant depression. Depression-related behavioral tests, analysis of serum monoamine neurotransmitters and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones were determined for assessment of ACTH-induced depression rat model. A gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer based urinary metabolomic signatures integrated 16S rRNA sequence analysis based gut microbial profiling was performed, as well as Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis was used to manifest the covariation between the differential urinary metabolites and gut microbiota of genus level.Chronic injection of ACTH-induced depression-like phenotype (increased immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test) was accompanied by peripheral serotonin down-regulation and HPA axis overactivation (ACTH and corticosterone up-regulation). Urinary metabolomics analysis indicated that pyruvic acid, L-threonine, mannitol, D-gluconic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, D-arabitol, myo-inositol and ascorbic acid levels were reduced in ACTH-treated rats' urine, while hippurate level was elevated. In addition, microbial community profiling revealed bacterial enrichment (e.g. Ruminococcus, Klebsiella) and reduction (e.g. Akkermansia, Lactobacillus) in the ACTH-induced depression rat model. Correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were closely relevant to metabolites myo-inositol and hippurate, which were included in host inositol phosphate metabolism, and phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis.Depression rat model induced by ACTH is associated with disturbance of pyruvate metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and  or gluconeogenesis, as well as changes in microbial community structure. Gut microbiota may participate in the mediation of systemic metabolomic changes in ACTH-induced depression model. Therefore, integrated metabolomic signatures and gut microbial community profiling would provide a basis for further studies on the pathogenesis of depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27894844>The tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in cultured primary astrocytes is strongly accelerated by the protein  kinase inhibitor tyrphostin 23.</a></h2><p>Tyrphostin 23 (T23) is a well-known inhibitor of protein  kinases and has been considered as potential anti-cancer drug. T23 was recently reported to acutely stimulate the glycolytic flux in primary cultured astrocytes. To investigate whether T23 also affects the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, we incubated primary rat astrocyte cultures with [U-C]glucose in the absence or the presence of 100 μM T23 for 2 h and analyzed the C metabolite pattern. These incubation conditions did not compromise cell viability and confirmed that the presence of T23 doubled glycolytic lactate production. In addition, T23-treatment strongly increased the molecular carbon labeling of the TCA cycle intermediates citrate, succinate, fumarate and malate, and significantly increased the incorporation of C-labelling into the amino acids glutamate, glutamine and aspartate. These results clearly demonstrate that, in addition to , also the mitochondrial TCA cycle is strongly accelerated after exposure of astrocytes to T23, suggesting that a protein  kinase may be involved in the regulation of the TCA cycle in astrocytes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As HCC involves a complex process of genetic and epigenetic modifications, we evaluated expression of both polyadenylated transcripts and microRNAs from HCC and liver samples derived from two cohorts of patients undergoing either partial hepatic resection or liver transplantation. Copy number variants were inferred from whole genome low-pass sequencing data, and a set of 56 cancer-related genes were screened using an oncology panel assay. HCC was associated with marked transcriptional deregulation of hundreds of protein-coding genes. In the partially resected livers, diminished transcriptional activity was observed in genes associated with drug catabolism and increased expression in genes related to inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Moreover, several long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs not previously linked with HCC were found to be deregulated. In liver transplant recipients, down-regulation of genes involved in energy production and up-regulation of genes associated with  were detected. Numerous copy number variants events were observed, with hotspots on chromosomes 1 and 17.

Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (), fms-like  kinase 3 (), nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 (), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide (), phosphatase and tensin homolog (), G-protein-coupled receptors-like receptor Smoothened (), and tumor protein P53 () were mutated in all tumors; another 26 cancer-related genes were mutated with variable penetrance. : Our results underscore the marked molecular heterogeneity between HCC tumors and reinforce the notion that precision medicine approaches are needed for management of individual HCC. These data will serve as a resource to generate hypotheses for further research to improve our understanding of HCC biology.

The restraint on pyruvate flux into mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in cancer cells is in part attributed to the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Src is a prominent oncogenic non-receptor  kinase that promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis and resistance to conventional and targeted therapies. However, the potential role of Src in tumor metabolism remained unclear. Here we report that activation of Src attenuated PDH activity and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, Src inhibitors activated PDH and increased cellular ROS levels. Src inactivated PDH through direct phosphorylation of -289 of PDH E1α subunit (PDHA1). Indeed, Src was the main kinase responsible for PDHA1  phosphorylation in cancer cells. Expression of a -289 non-phosphorable PDHA1 mutant in Src-hyperactivated cancer cells restored PDH activity, increased mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress, decreased experimental metastasis, and sensitized cancer cells to pro-oxidant treatment. The results suggest that Src contributes to the Warburg phenotype by inactivating PDH through  phosphorylation, and the metabolic effect of Src is essential for Src-driven malignancy and therapy resistance. Combination therapies consisting of both Src inhibitors and pro-oxidants may improve anticancer efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769915>Clk1 deficiency promotes neuroinflammation and subsequent dopaminergic cell death through regulation of microglial metabolic reprogramming.</a></h2><p>Clock (Clk)1/COQ7 is a mitochondrial hydroxylase that is necessary for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or UQ). Here, we investigate the role of Clk1 in neuroinflammation and consequentially dopaminergic (DA) neuron survival. Reduced expression of Clk1 in microglia enhanced the LPS-induced proinflammatory response and promoted aerobic . Inhibition of  abolished Clk1 deficiency-induced hypersensitivity to the inflammatory stimulation. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that mTOR/HIF-1α and ROS/HIF-1α signaling pathways were involved in Clk1 deficiency-induced aerobic . The increase in neuronal cell death was observed following treatment with conditioned media from Clk1 deficient microglia. Increased DA neuron loss and microgliosis were observed in Clk1 mice after treatment with MPTP, a rodent model of Parkinson's disease (PD). This increase in DA neuron loss was due to an exacerbated microglial inflammatory response, rather than direct susceptibility of Clk1 DA cells to MPP, the active species of MPTP. Exaggerated expressions of proinflammatory genes and loss of DA neurons were also observed in Clk1 mice after stereotaxic injection of LPS. Our results suggest that Clk1 regulates microglial metabolic reprogramming that is, in turn, involved in the neuroinflammatory processes and PD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Serum samples were collected in male Wistar rats with BDL (n = 8) and sham surgery (n = 8) at day 3 after surgery for metabolomics analysis using a combination of reversed phase chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS). The serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathion peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured to estimate the oxidative stress state. Key changes after BDL included increased levels of l-phenylalanine, l-glutamate, , kynurenine, l-lactic acid, LysoPC(c) (14:0), glycine and succinic acid and decreased levels of l-valine, PC(b) (19:0/0:0), taurine, palmitic acid, l-isoleucine and citric acid metabolism products. And treatment with BDL significantly decreased the levels of GSH, T-AOC as well as SOD, GSH-Px activities, and upregulated MDA levels. The changes could be mapped to metabolism of amino acids and lipids, Krebs cycle and , as well as increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capability. Our study indicated that BDL induces major changes in the metabolism of all 3 major energy substances, as well as oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29987212>Senescence Induces Dysfunctions in Endothelial Progenitor Cells and Osteoblasts by Interfering Translational Machinery and Bioenergetic Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Age-related bone diseases are partly caused by impaired bone integrity, which are closely related to osteoblasts’ activity and angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the initiators of angiogenesis and found to have senescent-induced dysfunctions. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of senescence in EPCs on osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Human primary EPCs and a murine osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) are utilized in this study. The senescence of EPCs are induced by serial passages. When co-cultured with senescent EPCs, the osteoblasts demonstrate weakened alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineral deposition. On the other hand, osteoblast-induced migration decreases in senescent EPCs. As for the intracellular alterations of senescent EPCs, the activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, MnSOD and catalase are diminished. In contrast, the level of reactive oxygen species are significantly higher in senescent EPCs. Furthermore, senescent EPCs has decreased level intracellular ATP level and coupling efficiency for oxidative phosphorylation while the non-mitochondrial respiration and  are elevated. The senescence of EPCs impairs the functions of both osteoblasts and EPCs, suggesting EPCs’ role in the pathophysiology of age-related bone diseases. Targeting the alterations found in this study could be potential treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30213498>Inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 enhances the anti-cancer effect of EGFR  kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have been used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for decades with great success in patients with EGFR mutations, acquired-resistance inevitably occurs after long-term exposure to the treatment of EGFR inhibitors.  is a predominant process for most cancer cells to utilize glucose, which referred to as the Warburg Effect. Targeting critical enzymes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) that inversely regulating the process of  could be a promising approach to work alone or in combination with other treatments for cancer therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether PDK1 inhibition could enhance the anti-cancer effects of EGFR-TKi. Herein, we utilized a recently reported PDK1 inhibitor 2,2-Dichloro-1-(4-isopropoxy-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Cpd64), which was more potent and selective than dichloroacetate (DCA) and/or dichloroacetophenone (DAP), to study the mechanism of PDK1 inhibition in TKi-mediated anti-cancer activity. We found that the introduction of Cpd64 in EGFR-TKi therapy enhanced the anti-proliferative effects in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells under hypoxia. In particular, Cpd64 was shown to increase the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and improved XPHOS, such as elevated mitochondrial respiration, and increased ATP generation, which effectively modulated the upregulation of PDK1 by EGFR-TKi treatment. We have observed that Cpd64 effectively enhanced the tumor growth inhibition induced by erlotinib in a NCI-H1975 xenograft mouse model. Collectively, our results suggested that combined use of selective PDK inhibitor and EGFR-TKi could be a potential strategy for NSCLC therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Non-invasive tools are less sensitive in detecting the disease, particularly in the early stage. A number of researchers have used metabolomics analyses on serum/plasma samples of patients with CRC compared with normal healthy individuals in an effort to identify biomarkers for CRC. The aim of the present review is to compare reported serum metabolomics profiles of CRC and to identify common metabolites affected among these studies. A literature search was performed to include any experimental studies on global metabolomics profile of CRC using serum/plasma samples published up to March 2018. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool was used to assess the quality of the studies reviewed. In total, nine studies were included. The studies used various analytical platforms and were performed on different populations. A pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the data from all the studies under review. The most affected pathways identified were protein biosynthesis, urea cycle, ammonia recycling, alanine metabolism, glutathione metabolism and citric acid cycle. The metabolomics analysis revealed levels of metabolites of , tricarboxylic acid cycle, anaerobic respiration, protein, lipid and glutathione metabolism were significantly different between cancer and control samples. Although the majority of differentiating metabolites identified were different in the different studies, there were several metabolites that were common. These metabolites include pyruvic acid, glucose, lactic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, tryptophan, phenylalanine, , creatinine and ornithine. The consistent dysregulation of these metabolites among the different studies suggest the possibility of common diagnostic biomarkers for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518347>Dietary genistein supplementation in laying broiler breeder hens alters the development and metabolism of offspring embryos as revealed by hepatic transcriptome analysis.</a></h2><p>Genistein (GEN) is a type of isoflavone mainly derived from soy products. In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and liver index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic liver, whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein  kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the  process in the embryonic liver through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (arachidonic acid) in the embryonic liver through upregulation of liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased fatty acid β-oxidation and Na/K-ATPase activity in the embryonic liver through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPARα and PPARδ) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide energy for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic liver and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3. The improved immunity and antioxidant capacity, as a result of maternal GEN effects, was conducive to embryonic development. In summary, the addition of GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens significantly promoted the development and metabolism of chick embryos.-Lv, Z., Fan, H., Zhang, B., Ning, C., Xing, K., Guo, Y.

We employed shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomic and metabonomic profiling approaches on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal (HPC) tissue from Df(16)A mice, a model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Proteomic results were compared with previous transcriptomic profiling studies of the same brain regions. The aim was to investigate how the combined effect of the 22q11.2 deletion and the corresponding miRNA dysregulation affects the cell biology at the systems level. The proteomic brain profiling analysis revealed PFC and HPC changes in various molecular pathways associated with chromatin remodelling and RNA transcription, indicative of an epigenetic component of the 22q11.2DS. Further, alterations in /gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial function and lipid biosynthesis were identified. Metabonomic profiling substantiated the proteomic findings by identifying changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)-related pathways, such as changes in ceramide phosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin, carnitines,  derivates and panthothenic acid. The proteomic findings were confirmed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, validating decreased levels of several proteins encoded on 22q11.2, increased levels of the computationally predicted putative miR-185 targets UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110 kDa subunit (OGT1) and kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A and alterations in the non-miR-185 targets serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit gamma isoform, neurofilament light chain and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins associated with mammalian target of rapamycin signalling were detected in the PFC and with glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus. Based on the proteomic and metabonomic findings, we were able to develop a schematic model summarizing the most prominent molecular network findings in the Df(16)A mouse. Interestingly, the implicated pathways can be linked to one of the most consistent and strongest proteomic candidates, (OGT1), which is a predicted miR-185 target. Our results provide novel insights into system-biological mechanisms associated with the 22q11DS, which may be linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk to develop schizophrenia. Further investigation of these pathways could help to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310736>Breast cancer: Occluded role of mitochondria N-acetylserotonin/melatonin ratio in co-ordinating pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>A plethora of factors contribute to the biochemical underpinnings of breast cancer, in the absence of any clear, integrative framework. This article proposes that melatonergic pathway regulation within mitochondria provides an integrative framework for the wide array of data driving breast cancer pathophysiology. As melatonin is toxic to breast cancer cells, its production within mitochondria poses a significant challenge to breast cancer cell survival. Consequently, the diverse plasticity in breast cancer cells may arise from a requirement to decrease mitochondria melatonin synthesis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor role in breast cancer pathophysiology may be mediated by an increase in cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1 in mitochondria, leading to the backward conversion of melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS has distinct effects to melatonin, including its activation of the  receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor. TrkB activation significantly contributes to breast cancer cell survival and migration. However, the most important aspect of NAS induction by CYP1b1 in breast cancer cells is the prevention of melatonin effects in mitochondria. Many of the changes occurring in breast cancer cells arise from the need to regulate this pathway in mitochondria, allowing this to provide a framework that integrates a host of previously disparate data, including: microRNAs, estrogen, 14-3-3 proteins, sirtuins, , oxidative phosphorylation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the kynurenine pathways. It is also proposed that this framework provides a pathoetiological model incorporating the early developmental regulation of the gut microbiome that integrates breast cancer risk factors, including obesity. This has significant treatment, prevention and research implications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Of those, the thyroid hormone has been reported to increase the albinism rate of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and thiourea were introduced into P. olivaceus larvae from 16 to 57 days after hatching (DAH). By comparison of albinism rate, T3 treatment and control larvae of 42 DAH were chosen for mRNA and miRNA high-throughput sequencing analyses. A total of 337 miRNAs were identified via miRNA-seq, and 12 miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression patterns in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (TPM > 10, fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.67 and q ≤ 0.05). These differentially expressed miRNAs targeted 3658 putative genes, which further enriched to 10 GO terms (q < 0.05). RNA-seq identified 146 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (|log fold change| > 1 and q < 0.005), including pigmentation-related genes such as the receptor -protein kinase erbB-3, pro-opiomelanocortin A, and melanotransferrin, and the growth-related gene somatotropin. These DEGs were significantly enriched to 15 GO terms and 8 KEGG pathways (q < 0.05), which included several sugar metabolic pathways (/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway). Integrated analysis revealed that 26 overlapping genes between DEGs and mRNAs were targeted by miRNAs. Furthermore, seven mRNA-miRNA pairs exhibited reversed regulation patterns. This provides important clues to understand the role of thyroid hormones in flatfish pigmentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27856737>Global transformation of erythrocyte properties via engagement of an SH2-like sequence in band 3.</a></h2><p>Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are composed of weakly conserved sequences of ∼100 aa that bind phosphotyrosines in signaling proteins and thereby mediate intra- and intermolecular protein-protein interactions. In exploring the mechanism whereby  phosphorylation of the erythrocyte anion transporter, band 3, triggers membrane destabilization, vesiculation, and fragmentation, we discovered a SH2 signature motif positioned between membrane-spanning helices 4 and 5. Evidence that this exposed cytoplasmic sequence contributes to a functional SH2-like domain is provided by observations that: (i) it contains the most conserved sequence of SH2 domains, GSFLVR; (ii) it binds the  phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (cdb3-PO) with K = 14 nM; (iii) binding of cdb3-PO to erythrocyte membranes is inhibited both by antibodies against the SH2 signature sequence and dephosphorylation of cdb3-PO; (iv) label transfer experiments demonstrate the covalent transfer of photoactivatable biotin from isolated cdb3-PO (but not cdb3) to band 3 in erythrocyte membranes; and (v) phosphorylation-induced binding of cdb3-PO to the membrane-spanning domain of band 3 in intact cells causes global changes in membrane properties, including (i) displacement of a glycolytic enzyme complex from the membrane, (ii) inhibition of anion transport, and (iii) rupture of the band 3-ankyrin bridge connecting the spectrin-based cytoskeleton to the membrane. Because SH2-like motifs are not retrieved by normal homology searches for SH2 domains, but can be found in many  kinase-regulated transport proteins using modified search programs, we suggest that related cases of membrane transport proteins containing similar motifs are widespread in nature where they participate in regulation of cell properties.</p></html>
