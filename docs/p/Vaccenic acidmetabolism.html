Participant groups were defined based on the share of consumed organic products; to discriminate between effects of food origin and food patterns, healthy diet indicators were considered in some statistical models.Consumption of organic food was associated with a more favourable pre-pregnancy BMI and lower prevalence of gestational diabetes. Compared with participants consuming no organic food (reference group), a marker of dairy products intake (pentadecanoic acid) and trans-fatty acids from natural origin (vaccenic and rumenic acids) were higher among participants consuming organic food (organic groups), whereas elaidic acid, a marker of the intake of trans-fatty acids found in industrially hydrogenated fats, was lower. Plasma levels of homocysteine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in the organic groups than in the reference group. Differences in pentadecanoic acid,  and vitamin D retained statistical significance when correcting for indicators of the healthy diet pattern associated with the consumption of organic food.Consumption of organic food during pregnancy is associated with several health-related characteristics and blood biomarkers. Part of the observed associations is explained by food patterns accompanying the consumption of organic food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25858152>Improved n-butanol tolerance in Escherichia coli by controlling membrane related functions.</a></h1><p>As the increasing demand from both chemical and fuel markets, the interest in producing n-butanol using biological route has been rejuvenated to engineer an economical fermentation process, competing with the currently-dominant chemical synthesis. n-Butanol has been traditionally produced from the ABE fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum. This system, however, is not economically feasible due to its limited efficiency and the lack of genetic modification tools for further improvements. Alternatively, n-butanol synthesis pathway was successfully transferred into Escherichia coli and rapidly improved to reach a level of production comparable to the native producer. Nevertheless, the toxicity of n-butanol has become a common issue that either approach has to deal with. Previously, we reported our success in improving n-butanol tolerance in E. coli by engineering an Artificial Transcription Factor (ATF) that can modify the expression level of multiple targets simultaneously and improved the n-butanol tolerance of MG1655 strain to 1.5% (vol/vol) n-butanol. However, it was observed that some possible n-butanol tolerance mechanisms did not occurred upon the ATF expression, especially the membrane-related functions such as the homeoviscous adaptation, iron uptaking system, and efflux pump system. In this work, we attempted to enhance the n-butanol tolerance associated with the ATF by combining it with the membrane-related functions in E. coli, including the overexpression of fatty acid synthesis genes, iron-uptaking protein FeoA, and introducing a SrpABC efflux pump from Pseudomonas putida into E. coli. The synergistic effect of this combinatorial approach led to 4, 5, and 9-fold improved growths in the cultures containing 1, 1.5, and 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol, respectively, of an MG1655 knockout strain engineered for n-butanol production, and expanded the tolerance limit to 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To assess the linoleate isomerase for CLA production in the most efficient CLA producer.In this study, strains of food-derived lactobacilli were cultured in media with linoleic acid and CLA production was assessed. Most of the selected strains produced CLA at different levels, with Lactobacillus plantarum ZS2058 being the most efficient CLA producer converting over 50% of linoleic acid to c9, t11-CLA and t9, t11-CLA. Some intermediates 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, 10-oxo-cis-12-octadecenoic acid and 10-oxo-trans- were determined via GC-MS. The genes coding the multicomponent linoleate isomerase containing myosin-cross-reactive antigen, short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase and acetoacetate decarboxylase for CLA production in Lact. plantarum ZS2058 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. With the mixture of recombinant E. coli, c9, t11-CLA and three kinds of intermediates were produced from linoleic acid, which were in line with those in the lactobacilli.The ability for CLA production by lactobacilli exhibited variation. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lact. bulgaricus were the most efficient producers in the selected strains. Lact. plantarum ZS2058 converted linoleic acid to CLAs with 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, 10-oxo-cis-12-octadecenoic acid and 10-oxo-trans- as intermediates. The multiple-step reactions for CLA production catalysed by multicomponent linoleate isomerase in Lact. plantarum ZS2058 were confirmed successfully.Multicomponent linoleate isomerase provides important results for the illustration of the mechanism for CLA production in lactic acid bacteria. Food-derived lactobacilli with CLA production ability offers novel opportunities for functional foods development.© 2014 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446544>Association between plasma trans-fatty acid concentrations and diabetes in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</a></h1><p>A diet high in trans-fatty acids (TFA) induces insulin resistance in rodent models and primates. However, previous epidemiological studies on the association between TFAs, based primarily on self-reported intake from the diet, and diabetes in humans have yielded conflicting results. Herein we examined the associations of objectively measured plasma TFA concentrations with diabetes in a large population-based study among US adults.We included 3801 participants aged ≥20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2009-10. Four major TFAs, namely palmitelaidic acid (C16:1 n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1 n-9t),  (C18:1 n-7t), and linolelaidic acid (C18:2 n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Diabetes was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis, plasma fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5%.After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of diabetes comparing the highest with lowest quintile of plasma TFAs was 2.19 (1.27-3.79) for total TFAs (P  = 0.01), 2.34 (1.48-3.72) for elaidic acid (P  = 0.0004), 1.33 (0.82-2.15) for linolelaidic acid (P  = 0.18), 1.58 (0.97-2.58) for palmitelaidic acid (P  = 0.02), and 1.64 (0.95-2.84) for  (P  = 0.08). In addition, total TFAs, elaidic acid, palmitelaidic acid, and  were significantly associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the insulin resistance index, and HbA1c.In a nationally representative population, plasma TFAs, in particular elaidic acid, were positively associated with diabetes and biomarkers of glucose metabolism.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21687964>Efficient accumulation of oleic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae caused by expression of rat elongase 2 gene (rELO2) and its contribution to tolerance to alcohols.</a></h1><p>When the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are exposed to high concentration of ethanol, the content of oleic acid (C18:1n-9) increased as the initial concentration of ethanol increased. Based on this observation, we attempted to confer ethanol tolerance to S. cerevisiae by manipulating fatty acid composition of the cells. Rather than altering OLE1 expression [the desaturase making both C16:1n-7 (palmitoleic acid) and C18:1n-9], we introduced elongase genes. Introduction of rat elongase 1 gene (rELO1) into S. cerevisiae gave cis- (cis-C18:1n-7) by conversion from C16:1n-7, and the increase in this C18:1 fatty acid did not confer ethanol tolerance to the cells. On the other hand, the introduction of rat elongase 2 gene (rELO2), which elongates C16:0 to C18:0, drastically increased C18:1n-9 content, and the cells acquired ethanol tolerance, emphasizing the specific role of C18:1n-9. Furthermore, the transformant of rELO2 also conferred tolerance to n-butanol, n-propanol, and 2-propanol.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22300160>Subcutaneous adipose tissue fatty acid desaturation in adults with and without rare adipose disorders.</a></h1><p>Elevated stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity has been described in obese states, with an increased desaturation index (DI) suggesting enhanced lipogenesis. Differences in the DI among various phenotypes of abnormal adiposity have not been studied. Abnormal accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue occurs in rare adipose disorders (RADs) including Dercum's disease (DD), multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL), and familial multiple lipomatosis (FML). Examining the DI in subcutaneous fat of people with DD, MSL and FML may provide information on adipose tissue fatty acid  in these disorders. The aims of this pilot study were: 1) to determine if differences in adipose tissue DIs are present among RADs, and 2) to determine if the DIs correlate to clinical or biochemical parameters.Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from human participants with DD (n = 6), MSL (n = 5), FML (n = 8) and obese Controls (n = 6). Fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The DIs (palmitoleic/palmitic, oleic/stearic, vaccenic/stearic ratios) were calculated from the gas chromatogram peak intensities. SCD1 gene expression was determined. Spearman's correlations between the DIs and available clinical or biochemical data were performed.In DD subjects, the vaccenic/stearic index was lower (p < 0.05) in comparison to Controls. Percent of total of the saturated fatty acid myristic acid was higher in DD compared with Controls and FML. Percent of monounsaturated  in DD trended lower when compared with Controls, and was decreased in comparison to FML. In MSL, total percent of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly lower than in the Control group (p < 0.05). In the total cohort of subjects, the palmitoleic/palmitic and oleic/stearic DIs positively correlated with age, BMI, and percent body fat.The positive associations between the DIs and measures of adiposity (BMI and percent body fat) support increased desaturase activity in obesity. The lower vaccenic/stearic DI in DD SAT compared with Controls suggests presence of other factors involved in fat accumulation in addition to lifestyle. Other mechanisms driving fat accumulation in DD such as inflammation or lymphatic dysfunction should be investigated.© 2012 Yee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27269708>Is  (18:1t n-7) associated with an increased incidence of hip fracture? An explanation for the calcium paradox.</a></h1><p>High calcium intake may increase hip fracture (HF) incidence. This phenomenon, known as the calcium paradox, might be explained by  (18:1t n-7, VA), the highly specific trans fatty acid (TFA) present in dairy products. First, we ecologically investigated the relationship between 18:1 TFA intake and HF incidence using data from 12 to 13 European countries collected before 2000; then we measured the effects of VA and elaidic acid (18:1t n-9, EA) on osteoblasts from goldfish scales (tissues very similar to mammalian bone), with alkaline phosphatase as a marker; and finally we measured the effect of VA on mRNA expression in the scales for the major bone proteins type I collagen and osteocalcin. HF incidence was significantly correlated with 18:1 TFA intake in men (r=0.57) and women (r=0.65). Incubation with 1μmol/L VA and EA for 48h significantly decreased alkaline phosphatase activity by 25% and 21%, respectively. Incubation of scales with 10μmol/L VA for 48h significantly decreased mRNA expression for type I collagen and osteocalcin (by about 50%). In conclusion, VA may be causatively related to HF and could explain the calcium paradox. It may be prudent to reduce 18:1 TFA intake, irrespective of trans positions, to prevent HF.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Trans- (TVA) is a naturally occurring TFA found in the fat of ruminants and in human dairy products. The present study was conducted to investigate the anticancer activity and underlying mechanisms of TVA on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 5-8F and CNE-2 cells.A CCK8 assay was used to determine the effect of TVA and the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 on the proliferation of NPC cells. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of factors associated with Bcl-2-family protein signaling and Akt signaling.TVA significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that TVA significantly decreased p-Akt levels and Bad phosphorylation on Ser-136 and Ser-112. More importantly, we discovered that the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 synergistically sensitized NPC cells to apoptosis induction by TVA.TVA can inhibit NPC cell growth and induced apoptosis through the inhibition of Bad/Akt phosphorylation. The combined use of TVA and Mcl-1 inhibitors offers a potential advantage for nasopharyngeal cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27883264>Mucosa-associated biohydrogenating microbes protect the simulated colon microbiome from stress associated with high concentrations of poly-unsaturated fat.</a></h1><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may affect colon microbiome homeostasis by exerting (specific) antimicrobial effects and/or interfering with mucosal biofilm formation at the gut mucosal interface. We used standardized batch incubations and the Mucosal-Simulator of the Human Microbial Intestinal Ecosystem (M-SHIME) to show the in vitro luminal and mucosal effects of the main PUFA in the Western diet, linoleic acid (LA). High concentrations of LA were found to decrease butyrate production and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii numbers dependent on LA biohydrogenation to  (VA) and stearic acid (SA). In faecal batch incubations, LA biohydrogenation and butyrate production were positively correlated and SA did not inhibit butyrate production. In the M-SHIME, addition of a mucosal environment stimulated biohydrogenation to SA and protected F. prausnitzii from inhibition by LA. This was probably due to the preference of two biohydrogenating genera Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio for the mucosal niche. Co-culture batch incubations using Roseburia hominis and F. prausnitzii validated these observations. Correlations  further uncovered the central role of Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio in protecting luminal and mucosal SHIME microbiota from LA-induced stress. Our results confirm how cross-shielding interactions provide resilience to the microbiome and demonstrate the importance of biohydrogenating, mucosal bacteria for recovery from LA stress.© 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27904041>Fatty Acid β-Oxidation Plays a Key Role in Regulating cis-Palmitoleic Acid Levels in the Liver.</a></h1><p>Different monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) species have distinct pathophysiological activities. cis-Palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) was previously reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal studies. The proportions of hepatic MUFAs are generally considered to reflect changes in the activities of fatty acid modifications (∆9 desaturation and fatty acid elongation). However, hepatic levels of 16:1n-7 are markedly lower than those of oleic acid (18:1n-9). Nevertheless, no convincing explanation has yet been provided for the low level of 16:1n-7. We hypothesized that fatty acid degradation plays a key role in maintaining a low 16:1n-7 proportion in the liver. In order to corroborate the link between β-oxidation and the proportion of 16:1n-7, rats were fed a control diet, fed a fat-free diet to up-regulate fatty acid modifications, but not β-oxidation, or treated with clofibric acid to up-regulate fatty acid modifications and β-oxidation. The nutritional manipulation markedly increased the proportions of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and cis- (18:1n-7). Although the pharmacological manipulation enhanced fatty acid modifications to largely the same extent as the nutritional manipulation and markedly elevated the proportion of 18:1n-9, those of 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-7 remained largely unchanged. The oxidation rates of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and 18:1n-7 in liver slices were in the following order: 16:1n-7>18:1n-7≑18:1n-9 in control livers, and were increased by the pharmacological manipulation and decreased by the nutritional manipulation. These results strongly suggest that β-oxidation, in concert with fatty acid modifications, plays a key role in regulating the MUFA profile and is crucially involved in maintaining low 16:1n-7 levels in the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28625013>Anti-mutagenic Properties of Mono- and Dienoic Acid Biohydrogenation Products from Beef Fat.</a></h1><p>Unsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation products from beef fat and pure fatty acids were subjected to the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity testing, including monounsaturated fatty acids [MUFA: oleic acid, , elaidic acid; beef fatty acid fractions rich in trans (t)11/t13-t14-18:1 (t11,13,14-Frac), t10-18:1 (t10-Frac)] and dienoic fatty acids [linoleic acid, conjugated linoleic isomers cis (c)9,t11-18:2 and t10,c12-18:2, and a mixed beef dienoic fatty acid fraction high in c9,t13-/t8,c12/t11c15-18:2 (MD)]. Significantly higher anti-mutagenic effects of oleic acid, , t11, 13, 14-Frac, and t10-Frac against daunomycin were observed at 2.5 mg. All dienoic acids except MD significantly reduced daunomycin mutagenicity at ≥0.25 mg. Anti-mutagenicity of oleic and vaccenic acids against 2-aminoanthracene was found at 2.5 and 0.25 mg, respectively. All dienoic acids significantly reduced 2-aminoanthracene mutagenicity at ≥0.25 mg.

Previously, we have reported that the adipose tissue was generally smaller in GH transgenic fish compared to the control, and that the Δ-6 fatty acyl desaturase gene was down-regulated in the Tg/+ fish. However, fatty acid (FA) compositions have not been measured previously in these fish. In this study we compared the FAs composition and content in the liver using gas chromatography. Eleven kinds of FA were detected. The composition of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (SFA and MUFA) such as myristic acid (14:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), and cis- (cis-18:1n-7) was significantly (P<0.05) decreased in GH transgenic Amago. On the other hand, the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic acid (18:2n-6), arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) was significantly (P<0.05) increased. Levels of serum glucose and triacylglycerol were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in the GH transgenics compared with +/+ fish. Furthermore, 3'-tag digital gene expression profiling was performed using liver tissues from Tg/Tg and +/+ fish, and showed that Mid1 interacting protein 1 (Mid1ip1), which is an important factor to activate Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), was down-regulated in Tg/Tg fish, while genes involved in FA catabolism were up-regulated, including long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 1 (ACSL1) and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 3 (ACOX3). These data suggest that liver tissue from GH transgenic Amago showed starvation by alteration in glucose and lipid  due to GH overexpression. The decrease of serum glucose suppressed Mid1ip1, and caused a decrease of de novo FA synthesis, resulting in a decrease of SFA and MUFA. This induced expression of ACSL1 and ACOX3 to produce energy through β-oxidation in the GH transgenic Amago.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21856892>The forage type (grazing versus hay pasture) fed to ewes and the lamb sex affect fatty acid profile and lipogenic gene expression in the longissimus muscle of suckling lambs.</a></h1><p>Meat intramuscular fat (IMF) contributes to meat quality and consumer acceptance. Molecular events that occur during IMF deposition and the identification of genes that are differentially expressed during this process are important to the design of an optimal nutrition plan for animals. In the present study, we examined the effect of the forage type (grazing vs. hay pasture) fed to ewes and the effect of lamb sex on the LM fatty acid (FA) profile and gene expression of suckling lambs (10 to 12 kg of BW at slaughter); ewes received pasture hay (PH) or grazed pasture (GRE). Forage type had a significant effect on IMF FA profile. Ewes grazing green forage (GRE) promoted the formation and deposition of  (C18:1n-7), CLA, and PUFA n-3 in LM from their suckling lambs (P < 0.05). We found that forage type affected the expression of the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) gene in females. However, in males, it modulated stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) gene expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, our results showed that females, independent of the diet of the ewes (PH or GRE), are predisposed to develop fat and to upregulate the expression of key genes of transcriptional factors PPARA, CEBPB, SREBF1, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and SCD (P < 0.05). The data suggest that SREBF1, SCD, and most likely CEBPB gene expression in young suckling lambs is modulated by both lamb sex and forage type fed to ewes. Fatty acid indicators PUFA, n-6/n-3, CLA, and SFA are closely related to LPL, SCD, PPARA, and CEBPB gene expression depending on animal sex or the diet of ewes. This study suggests that grazing pasture affects FA composition promoting greater vaccenic, CLA, and total PUFA n-3 FA in female and male suckling lambs, and it is mediated through the regulation of lipogenic enzyme expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594358>The effect of oak tannin (Quercus robur) and hops (Humulus lupulus) on dietary nitrogen efficiency, methane emission, and milk fatty acid composition of dairy cows fed a low-protein diet including linseed.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to test the effects of inclusion of hop pellets (HP) and oak tannin extracts (OT) alone or in combination on N efficiency, methane (CH) emission, and milk production and composition in 2 experiments with dairy cows fed low-N rations supplemented with linseed. In both experiments, 6 lactating Holstein cows were assigned to 3 dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 duplicated Latin square design (21-d periods). Cows were fed a total mixed ration at a restricted level to meet their nutrient requirements. In experiment 1, 169 g dry matter (DM) of OT or 56 g DM of HP was included separately in the control diet (C1). In experiment 2, the additives were included together (OT-HP) in the control diet (C2) similar to C1. Diet C2 was compared with a control without linseed (C0). In experiment 1, the supplementation of the control diet with OT decreased urinary N excretion by 12%. In experiment 2, the combination of OT and HP decreased urinary N by 7%. Oak tannin extracts and HP alone or in combination did not influence the daily enteric CH production of cows. Cows fed diet C0 produced 17% more enteric CH daily than those fed diet C2. Intake of diet C2, which contained 6.7% extruded linseed on a DM basis (experiment 2), decreased the sum of 6:0 to 14:0 fatty acids (-16%) and palmitic acid (-26%) and increased the stearic acid (+50%), oleic acid (+36%),  (trans-11 18:1; +285%), rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11 18:2; +235%), and α-linolenic acid (+100%) in milk fat. The supplementation of diet C2 with the OT-HP mixture further improved the milk's fatty acid composition. Intake of the OT alone increased α-linolenic acid by 17.7% (experiment 1). The results of this study show that at the economically acceptable dose we tested, hops had no effect on urinary N excretion, CH emission, milk production, and milk composition. By contrast, supplementation of diets with oak tannin extract can be considered for reducing urinary N excretion. The combination of oak tannin and hops had no more effect than oak tannin alone except on the milk fatty acid profile, which was favorably influenced from a nutritional point of view.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

This meta-analysis was carried out using only data from trials including a control diet without fat supplementation. The dependent variables were defined by the mean differences between values from EL-supplemented groups and values from control groups. The data were processed by regression testing the dose effect, multivariable regression testing the effect of each potential interfering factor associated with the dose effect, and then stepwise regression with backward elimination procedure with all potential interfering factors retained in previous steps. This entire strategy was also applied to a restricted data set, including only trials conducted inside a practical range of fat feeding (only supplemented diets with <60 g of fat/kg of dry matter and supplemented with <600 g of fat from EL). The whole data set consisted of 17 publications, representing 21 control diets and 29 EL-supplemented diets. The daily intake of fat from EL supplementation ranged from 87 to 1,194 g/cow per day. The dry matter intake was numerically reduced in high-fat diets. Extruded linseed supplementation increased milk yield (0.72 kg/d in the restricted data set) and decreased milk protein content by a dilutive effect (-0.58 g/kg in the restricted data set). No effect of dose or diet was identified on dry matter intake, milk yield, or milk protein content. Milk fat content decreased when EL was supplemented to diets with high proportion of corn silage in the forage (-2.8 g/kg between low and high corn silage-based diets in the restricted data set) but did not decrease when the diet contained alfalfa hay. Milk trans-10 18:1 proportion increased when EL was supplemented to high corn silage-based diets. A shift in ruminal biohydrogenation , from trans-11 18:1 to trans-10 18:1, probably occurred when supplementing EL with high corn silage-based diets related to a change in the activity or composition of the microbial equilibrium in the rumen. The sum of pairs 4:0 to 14:0 (FA synthesized de novo by the udder), palmitic acid, and the sum of saturated FA decreased linearly, whereas oleic acid, , rumenic acid, α-linolenic acid, and the sums of mono- and polyunsaturated FA increased linearly when the daily intake of fat from EL was increased. In experimental conditions, EL supplementation increased linearly proportions of potentially human health-beneficial FA in milk (i.e., oleic acid, , rumenic acid, α-linolenic acid, total polyunsaturated FA), but should be used cautiously in corn silage-based diets.The Authors.

We hypothesized that linseed oil in combination with malate (a key propionate precursor in the rumen) would increase ∆9 unsaturated fatty acids and specific gene expression in somatic cells and mammary glands of lactating goats. Twelve lactating goats were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments included the basal diet (CON), the CON plus 4% linseed oil (LO), and the CON plus 4% linseed oil and 2% -malate (LOM). Relative to CON, the LO and LOM supplements increased the daily intake of palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1-9), linoleic (18:2-6), α-linolenic (18:3-3), and γ-linolenic acids (18:2-6); α-linolenic acid intake was increased over 9-fold, from 6.77 to over 51 g/d ( < 0.02). The LO and LOM supplements increased daily milk yield, milk fat yield, and milk fat percentage ( < 0.05). The LOM supplement also increased milk lactose percentage and daily yield ( = 0.03). Both the LO and LOM supplements increased plasma glucose and total cholesterol and decreased plasma β-hydroxbutyrate concentrations ( = 0.03). The LO and LOM supplements increased concentrations of stearic acid; - (TVA; 18:1-11); -9, -11 CLA; -10 -12 CLA; and α-linolenic acid in rumen fluid and increased the concentrations of oleic acid; TVA; -9, -11 CLA; -10, -12 CLA; and α-linolenic acid in plasma lipids and milk fat ( < 0.05). Conversely, the LO and LOM supplements decreased short- and medium-chain SFA, including lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0), and palmitic acids, in plasma and milk fat ( < 0.05). Relative mRNA levels for and () gene expression were increased in somatic cells and mammary gland tissue by LO and LOM ( < 0.05). We conclude that the higher intake and ruminal production of stearic acid promoted SCD gene expression in somatic cells and mammary tissue. Furthermore, milk somatic cells are a suitable substitute for documenting treatment effects of dietary oils on gene expression in goat mammary tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121959>Lipidomic and proteomic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans lipid droplets and identification of ACS-4 as a lipid droplet-associated protein.</a></h1><p>Lipid droplets are cytoplasmic organelles that store neutral lipids for membrane synthesis and energy reserves. In this study, we characterized the lipid and protein composition of purified Caenorhabditis elegans lipid droplets. These lipid droplets are composed mainly of triacylglycerols, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer composed primarily of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acid composition of the triacylglycerols is rich in fatty acid species obtained from the dietary Escherichia coli, including cyclopropane fatty acids and cis-. Unlike other organisms, C. elegans lipid droplets contain very little cholesterol or cholesterol esters. Comparison of the lipid droplet proteomes of wild type and high-fat daf-2 mutant strains shows a very similar proteome in both strains, except that the most abundant protein in the C. elegans lipid droplet proteome, MDT-28, is relatively less abundant in lipid droplets isolated from daf-2 mutants. Functional analysis of lipid droplet proteins identified in our proteomic studies indicated an enrichment of proteins required for growth and fat homeostasis in C. elegans. Finally, we confirmed the localization of one of the newly identified lipid droplet proteins, ACS-4. We found that ACS-4 localizes to the surface of lipid droplets in the C. elegans intestine and skin. This study bolsters C. elegans as a model to study the dynamics and functions of lipid droplets in a multicellular organism.Copyright © 2015.

ATCC 26185.</a></h1><p>Thraustochytrids, unicellular eukaryotic marine protists, accumulate polyunsaturated fatty acids. Here, we report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of two fatty acid elongase genes (designated tselo1 and tselo2), which could be involved in the desaturase/elongase (standard) pathway in Thraustochytrium sp. ATCC 26185. TsELO1, the product of tselo1 and classified into a Δ6 elongase group by phylogenetic analysis, showed strong C18-Δ6 elongase activity and relatively weak C18-Δ9 and C20-Δ5 activities when expressed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TsELO2, classified into a Δ9 elongase subgroup, showed only C16-Δ9 activity. When expressed in Aurantiochytrium limacinum mh0186 using a thraustochytrid-derived promoter and a terminator, TsELO1 exhibited almost the same specificity as expressed in the yeast but TsELO2 showed weak C18-Δ9 activity, in addition to its main C16-Δ9 activity. These results suggest that TsELO1 functions not only as a C18-Δ6 and a C20-Δ5 elongase in the main route but also as a C18-Δ9 elongase in the alternative route of standard pathway, while TsELO2 functions mainly as a C16-Δ9 elongase generating  (C18:1n-7) in thraustochytrids. This is the first report describing a fatty acid elongase harboring C16-Δ9 activity in thraustochytrids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500463>Association between plasma trans fatty acids concentrations and leucocyte telomere length in US adults.</a></h1><p>To assess the relationship between plasma trans-fatty acids (TFAs) levels and leucocyte telomere length (TL) in a US adult population sample.National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database was used for this study. Gas chromatography was used to separate derivatised fatty acids (Four major TFAs [palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t), trans  (C18:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t), and linoelaidic acid (C18:2n-6t,9t)]) which were then quatified using negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Data analyses used multivariable linear regressions, while accounting for the survey design.A total of 5446 eligible participants, with 46.8% (n = 2550) being men, were included. Their average age was 47.1 years for the total sample, and 47.8 and 46.5 years in men and women respectively (p = 0.085 for men vs. women difference). Concentrations of palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid decreased with increasing length of the telomere (p < 0.05). Univariable linear regressions revealed a significant negative association between levels of the palmitelaidic acid, elaidic acid, , and linolelaidic acid with TL. However when models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status, sub-clinical , body mass index, and smoking, only palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid remained significant (p < 0.05).TFAs levels and particularly palmitelaidic and linolelaidic acids, are likely negatively associated with telomere lenght. Future studies should explore the potential implications of these associations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067750>Effects of dietary n-6: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios on meat quality, carcass characteristics, tissue fatty acid profiles, and expression of lipogenic genes in growing goats.</a></h1><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of altering the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids in the diet on meat quality, fatty acid composition of muscle, and expression of lipogenic genes in the muscle of Boer goats. A total of twenty-one Boer goats (5 months old; 31.66±1.07 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments with n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratios of 2.27:1 (LR), 5.01:1 (MR) and 10.38:1 (HR), fed at 3.7% of body weight. After 100 days of feeding, all goats were slaughtered and the longissimus dorsi muscle was sampled for analysis of fatty acids and gene expression. The dietary treatments did not affect (P>0.05) the carcass traits, and meat quality of growing goats. The concentrations of cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid, trans , polyunsaturated fatty acids, and unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratios linearly increased (P<0.01) with decreasing dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratios, especially for LR in the longissimus dorsi muscle of goats. In contrast, the mRNA expression level of the PPARα and PPARγ was down-regulated and stearoyl-CoA desaturase up-regulated in the longissimus dorsi of growing goats with increasing dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratios (P<0.01). In conclusion, the results obtained indicate that the optimal n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio of 2.27:1 exerted beneficial effects on meat fatty acid profiles, leading towards an enrichment in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid in goat intramuscular fat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25701799>Influence of the cis-9, cis-12 and cis-15 double bond position in octadecenoic acid (18:1) isomers on the rat FADS2-catalyzed Δ6-desaturation.</a></h1><p>Oleic (cis9-18:1), linoleic (cis9,cis12-18:2) and α-linolenic (cis9,cis12,cis15-18:3) acids are well described substrates of the Δ6-desaturase encoded by the mammalian fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) gene. In addition, at least 9 other very structurally different fatty acids have been shown to be Δ6- or even Δ8-desaturated by the FADS2 protein. A better characterization of the substrate specificity of this enzyme is therefore needed. By using commercial cis9-18:1 and chemically synthesized cis12- and cis15-18:1 (sharing the n-6 double bond with 18:2 n-6 and the n-3 double bond with 18:3 n-3, respectively), we tried to decrypt the fatty acid structure driving the FADS2 substrate affinity. We first showed that both recombinant and native rat FADS2 were able to Δ6-desaturate not only the cis9- but also the cis12- and cis15-18:1 isomers. Next, the inhibitory effect of increasing concentrations of each 18:1 isomer was investigated in vitro on the Δ6-desaturation of α-linolenic acid. At equimolar inhibitor/substrate ratio (60 μM), the cis9-18:1 exhibited a significantly higher inhibition (25%) than the cis12- (8%) and cis15-18:1 (5%). This study shows that a single cis double bond in 12- or 15-position in 18:1 is enough to make them low Δ6-desaturable substrates. If a preexisting cis9-double bond is not absolutely required for the Δ6-desaturation of octadecenoic acids, its presence is however crucial to explain the higher enzyme affinity. Compared with oleic acid, the additional presence of a cis12-double bond in linoleic acid increased its inhibitory effect on the Δ6-desaturation of α-linolenic acid at low concentration (30 μM) but not at higher concentrations (60 and 120 μM). In this classification of the decreasing impact of the double bond when it comes closer to the methyl end of octadecenoic acids, the cis11-18:1 (cis-) should be considered apart since it is itself not Δ6-desaturated but still a good competitive inhibitor of the α-linolenic acid Δ6-desaturation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Twenty-eight Angus steers were assigned randomly to 3 groups of 9 or 10 steers and fed a basal diet without additional fat (control), with 3% palm oil (rich in palmitic acid), or with 3% soybean oil (rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids), for 10 wk, top-dressed daily. Palm oil had no effect (P > 0.05) on ADG, food intake, or G:F, whereas soybean oil depressed ADG (P = 0.02), food intake (P = 0.04), and G:F (P = 0.05). Marbling scores tended (P = 0.09) to be greater in palm oil-fed steers (Modest(09)) than in soybean oil-fed steers (Small(55)). Subcutaneous adipocyte mean volume was greater in palm oil-fed steers (515.9 pL) than in soybean-supplemented cattle (395.6 pL; P = 0.01). Similarly, glucose and acetate incorporation into total lipids in vitro was greater in subcutaneous adipose tissue of palm oil-fed steers (119.9 and 242.8 nmol·3h(-1)·10(5) cells, respectively) than adipose tissue of soybean oil-fed steers in (48.9 and 95.8 nmol·3h(-1)·10(5) cells, respectively). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADP-malate dehydrogenase activities were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of palm oil-fed steers than in adipose tissue of control steers. Palm oil did not increase palmitic acid or decrease oleic acid in subcutaneous adipose tissue or LM, but decreased (P ≤ 0.05) myristoleic, palmitoleic, and cis- in adipose tissue, indicating a depression in stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase activity. Soybean oil increased the proportion of α-linolenic acid in adipose tissue and muscle and increased linoleic acid and 18:1trans-10 in muscle. We conclude that palm oil supplementation promoted lipid synthesis in adipose tissue without depressing feed efficiency or increasing the palmitic acid content of beef.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518825>trans-11 18:1  (TVA) has a direct anti-carcinogenic effect on MCF-7 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells.</a></h1><p>Trans  (TVA; trans-11 18:1) is a positional and geometric isomer of oleic acid and it is the predominant trans isomer found in ruminant fats. TVA can be converted into cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (c9, t11-CLA), a CLA isomer that has many beneficial effects, by stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in the mammary gland. The health benefits associated with CLA are well documented, but it is unclear whether trans fatty acids (TFAs) from ruminant products have healthy effects. Therefore, the effects of TVA on the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells were investigated in the present study. Results showed that TVA inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells but not MCF-10A cells by down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 as well as procaspase-9. In addition, the suppressive effect of TVA was confirmed in SCD1-depleted MCF-7 cells. Our results suggested that TVA exerts a direct anti-carcinogenic effect on MCF-7 cells. These findings provided a better understanding of the research on the anti-carcinogenic effects of TVA and this may facilitate the manufacture of TVA/c9, t11-CLA fortified ruminant products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600650>Cadmium Alters the Concentration of Fatty Acids in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h1><p>Fatty acid composition of human immune cells influences their function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of known toxicant and immunomodulator, cadmium, at low concentrations on levels of selected fatty acids (FAs) in THP-1 macrophages. The differentiation of THP-1 monocytes into macrophages was achieved by administration of phorbol myristate acetate. Macrophages were incubated with various cadmium chloride (CdCl) solutions for 48 h at final concentrations of 5 nM, 20 nM, 200 nM, and 2 μM CdCl. Fatty acids were extracted from samples according to the Folch method. The fatty acid levels were determined using gas chromatography. The following fatty acids were analyzed: long-chain saturated fatty acids (SFAs) palmitic acid and stearic acid, very long-chain saturated fatty acid (VLSFA) arachidic acid, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) palmitoleic acid, oleic acid and , and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. Treatment of macrophages with very low concentrations of cadmium (5-200 nM) resulted in significant reduction in the levels of arachidic, palmitoleic, oleic, vaccenic, and linoleic acids and significant increase in arachidonic acid levels (following exposure to 5 nM Cd), without significant reduction of palmitic and stearic acid levels. Treatment of macrophages with the highest tested cadmium concentration (2 μM) produced significant reduction in the levels of all examined FAs: SFAs, VLSFA, MUFAs, and PUFAs. In conclusion, cadmium at tested concentrations caused significant alterations in THP-1 macrophage fatty acid levels, disrupting their composition, which might dysregulate fatty acid/lipid  thus affecting macrophage behavior and inflammatory state.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498854>Assessment of anti-diabetic activity of an ethnopharmacological plant Nerium oleander through alloxan induced diabetes in mice.</a></h1><p>Nerium oleander L. (syn. Nerium indicum Mill. and Nerium odorum Aiton.) is used for its anti-diabetic properties in Pakistan, Algeria, Morocco and is also recognized in Ayurveda. The present study was undertaken to investigate the anti-diabetic capacity of a standardized hydromethanolic extract of Nerium oleander in alloxan induced diabetes in mice.Nerium oleander leaf extract (NOLE) was orally administered at 50 and 200mg/kg body weight (BW) dose to alloxanized mice (blood glucose >200mg/dl). After 20 consecutive days of treatment, various diabetic parameters were studied and compared with untreated mice. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was employed to reveal the phytochemical composition of the plant extract.NOLE demonstrated antihyperglycaemic activity by reducing 73.79% blood glucose level after 20 days of treatment. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed increase in glucose tolerance as evident by 65.72% decrease in blood glucose in 3h post treatment. Percentage decrease in different liver marker enzymes were significant along with decrease in triglyceride and cholesterol levels, displaying potent antihyperlipidemic activity. Peroxidase and catalase activity in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle were significantly restored besides marked reduction in lipid peroxidation and normalization of hepatic glycogen level in the NOLE treated alloxanized mice. Different bioactive phytocompounds with potent anti-diabetic activity were identified by GC-MS and HPLC analysis.The present investigation revealed that Nerium oleander possess potent anti-diabetic activity as claimed in different ethnopharmacological practices.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effects of linseed supplementation and feeding duration on the fatty acid profile, cholesterol and bioactive compounds of bovine meat. In total, 54 Friesian steers were randomly allocated during the finishing period into six experimental treatments following a 2×3 factorial design. The six treatments consisted of two diets, the control diet (CO) with no supplemental fat and the linseed diet (LS) containing 10% whole linseed, fed 40, 75 or 120 days before slaughter. At the end of each finishing period, steers from the CO and LS groups were slaughtered. After 8 days of ageing chemical analysis, the fatty acid profile, cholesterol content and bioactive compounds were determined from the longissimus thoracis muscle. Including linseed in the diet increased the content of monounsaturated fatty acids, CLA and n-3 PUFA, and reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA. The percentage of myristic fatty acid increased with the duration of feeding, regardless of diet and a decrease in PUFA and n-6 PUFA was observed in the CO and LS diets, respectively. Furthermore, meat from steers fed linseed showed an increased percentage of n-3 PUFA, linolenic acid, and EPA from 40 to 75 days of feeding, whereas , CLA 9c,11t, and total CLA increased from 40 and 75 days but declined at 120 days. Beef from the linseed group had a higher content of bioactive substances such as creatine, carnosine and anserine than beef from the control group. The duration of feeding significantly affected the creatine concentrations, with an increase in the LS group from 40 to 75 days of feeding. Feeding linseed did not modify the cholesterol content, on average and the lowest cholesterol content was found in meat after 75 days of linseed administration. This study demonstrates that a short-term diet manipulation is sufficient to improve the nutritional properties of meat, including n-3 PUFA and bioactive compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24775093>Diets enriched in trans-11  alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation in a rat model of NAFLD and  syndrome.</a></h1><p>Trans11-18:1 (, VA) is one of the most predominant naturally occurring trans fats in our food chain and has recently been shown to exert hypolipidemic effects in animal models. In this study, we reveal new mechanism(s) by which VA can alter body fat distribution, energy utilization and dysfunctional lipid  in an animal model of obesity displaying features of the  syndrome (MetS). Obese JCR:LA-cp rats were assigned to a control diet that included dairy-derived fat or the control diet supplemented with 1% VA. VA reduced total body fat (-6%), stimulated adipose tissue redistribution [reduced mesenteric fat (-17%) while increasing inguinal fat mass (29%)] and decreased adipocyte size (-44%) versus control rats. VA supplementation also increased  rate (7%) concomitantly with an increased preference for whole-body glucose utilization for oxidation and increased insulin sensitivity [lower HOMA-IR (-59%)]. Further, VA decreased nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores (-34%) and reduced hepatic (-27%) and intestinal (-39%) triglyceride secretion relative to control diet, while exerting differential transcriptional regulation of SREBP1 and FAS amongst other key genes in the liver and the intestine. Adding VA to dairy fat alleviates features of MetS potentially by remodeling adipose tissue and attenuating ectopic lipid accumulation in a rat model of obesity and MetS. Increasing VA content in the diet (naturally or by fortification) may be a useful approach to maximize the health value of dairy-derived fats.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Although many studies have examined the anticarcinogenic effects of CLA, few studies have reported the anticarcinogenic properties of BHI in their natural form found in dairy and beef fats. The present study compared the growth-inhibitory effects of fatty acids from beef perirenal fat (PRF) or subcutaneous fat (SCF) with low or high levels of BHI in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Cells were exposed for 72 h to media containing increasing doses (50 to 400 μM) of different beef fat treatments. Fatty-acid analysis showed that BHI were readily incorporated into cell phospholipids (PL) in a treatment-dependent manner, but higher BHI in PL did not consistently inhibit growth. Culturing with low-BHI PRF or high-BHI PRF did not lead to growth inhibition, but low-BHI SCF inhibited growth, and inhibition was further increased by high-BHI SCF. Other classes of fatty acids may, therefore, be interacting with BHI resulting in differential effects on growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells.© 2018 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Lipids © 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23581938>Effects of incremental amounts of fish oil on trans fatty acids and Butyrivibrio bacteria in continuous culture fermenters.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that adding fish oil (FO) to ruminant animal diets increased  (VA; t11 C18:1) accumulation in the rumen. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary FO amounts on selected strains of rumen bacteria involved in biohydrogenation. A single-flow continuous culture system consisting of four fermenters was used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with four 9 days consecutive periods. Treatment diets were as follows: (i) control diet (53:47 forage to concentrate; CON), (ii) control plus FO at 0.5% (DM basis; FOL), (iii) control plus FO at 2% (DM basis; FOM) and (iv) control plus FO at 3.5% (DM basis; FOH). Fermenters were fed treatment diets three times daily at 120 g/day. Samples were collected from each fermenter on day 9 of each period at 1.5, 3 and 6 h post-morning feeding and then composited into one sample per fermenter. Increasing dietary FO amounts resulted in a linear decrease in acetate and isobutyrate concentrations and a linear decrease in acetate-to-propionate ratio. Propionate, butyrate, valerate and isovalerate concentrations were not affected by FO supplementation. Concentrations of C18:0 in fermenters linearly decreased, while concentrations of t10 C18:1 and VA linearly increased as dietary FO amounts increased. The concentrations of c9t11 and t10c12 conjugated linoleic acid were not affected by FO supplementation. The DNA abundance for Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Butyrivibrio  subgroup, Butyrivibrio stearic acid subgroup and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus linearly decreased as dietary FO amounts increased. In conclusion, FO effects on trans fatty acid accumulation in the rumen may be explained in part by FO influence on Butyrivibrio group.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30243517>Inhibitory effect of the gut microbial linoleic acid metabolites, 10-oxo-trans- and 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, on BV-2 microglial cell activation.</a></h1><p>10-oxo-trans- (KetoC) and 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA) are long-chain fatty acids generated from linoleic acid by the gut lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum. These fatty acids have been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity in the intestine. However, little is known about their effects in the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of these fatty acids on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory processes in mouse microglial cells (BV-2 cells). KetoC and HYA inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production and suppressed the expression of inducible NO synthase in BV-2 cells. NO changes in these inhibitory effects were observed with AH7614, a G-protein coupled receptor 120 antagonist, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors antagonists, GW6471 and GW9662. In addition, KetoC and HYA did not inhibit translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, or IκB degradation. Similarly, no effect on p38 or JNK phosphorylation was observed. However, KetoC and HYA were found to inhibit ERK phosphorylation induced by LPS, suggesting that these fatty acids may exert their anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of ERK activation in microglial cells.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We have investigated the hepatocellular responses to the predominant trans fatty acid isomers in industrially produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (elaidic acid) and products of ruminant origin (trans-).The responses of HepG2-SF cells exposed to 100 μM fatty acids during 7 days were examined. Elaidic acid decreased the cellular proliferation rate while trans- had no effect. Analysis of cellular triacylglycerol fractions showed, that both trans fatty acids were metabolized by HepG2-SF cells, although elaidic acid, to a higher degree than trans-vaccenic, accumulated in the triacylglycerol fraction. Proteome analysis revealed that the overlap of differentially regulated proteins only contained four proteins, suggesting that the two trans fatty acid isomers affect the cells in different ways. The data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000760.Our investigations revealed that the hepatocellular response to the two most abundant dietary positional C18:1 trans fatty acid isomers differ substantially.

Modifying fatty acid composition so as to increase CLA and other beneficial PUFA/MUFA level and reducing SFA levels might be a key to enhance the neutraceutical and therapeutic value of ruminant-derived food products. In the present experiment, the effect of supplementation of polyphenol rich Terminalia chebula plant extract at different concentrations (1.06g/kg and 3.18g/kg of body weight in T1 and T2 groups, respectively) was investigated on fatty acid composition of rumen fluid, plasma, intramuscular fat and Δ9-desaturase activity in longissimus dorsi muscle of crossbred kids. Total MUFA and PUFA content in muscle were enhanced by 25 and 35%, respectively, whereas SFA was reduced by 20% thereby improving the desaturation index. Δ9-desaturase activity also increased by 47% resulting in an enhancement of total CLA content (58.73%) in muscle.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway plays a central role in cellular antioxidative responses. In this study, we investigated the effects of novel fatty acid metabolite derivatives of linoleic acid generated by the gut lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum on the Nrf2-ARE pathway. 10-Oxo-trans- (KetoC) protected HepG2 cells from cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide. KetoC also significantly increased cellular Nrf2 protein levels, ARE-dependent transcription, and the gene expression of antioxidative enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), andquinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in HepG2 cells. Additionally, a single oral dose administration of KetoC also increased antioxidative gene expression and protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in mouse organs. Since other fatty acid metabolites and linoleic acid did not affect cellular antioxidative responses, the cytoprotective effect of KetoC may be because of its α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety. Collectively, our data suggested that KetoC activated the Nrf2-ARE pathway to enhance cellular antioxidative responses in vitro and in vivo, which further suggests that KetoC may prevent multiple diseases induced by oxidative stress.Copyright © 2016.

Basic information on the profiles of fatty acids and lipid classes in the liver is indispensable to use SHRSP as a model of disorder of lipid ; nevertheless, detailed information on the  of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and fatty acids in the liver of SHRSP is lacking. This study aimed to characterize profiles of lipid classes and fatty acids and to explore the mechanism underlying the characteristic alterations in  of TAGs and fatty acids in the liver of SHRSP, in comparison with spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The characteristic changes observed in SHRSP were (1) markedly lower hepatic TAG contents; (2) altered expressions of genes encoding three enzymes responsible for the control of TAG level, namely, adipose triglyceride lipase (for TAG degradation; up-regulated), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (for fatty acid β-oxidation; up-regulated) and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (for glycerolipid synthesis; down-regulated); (3) evidently lower contents and proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids, in particular cis- (18:1n-7), in the liver and serum; and (4) down-regulation of palmitoleoyl-CoA chain elongase, which is necessary for the biosynthesis of 18:1n-7, in the liver. From the above observations, we concluded that there are significant differences in profiles of lipid classes and fatty acids between SHRSP and SHR, and that altered characteristics in SHRSP are likely responsible for increases in TAG hydrolysis and β-oxidation, and decreases in TAG synthesis and 18:1n-7 synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459841>Effects of feeding increasing dietary levels of high oleic or regular sunflower or linseed oil on fatty acid profile of goat milk.</a></h1><p>In this work, the effects of increasing amounts of 3 plant oils in diets on the fatty acid (FA) profile of goat milk were studied. The study consisted of 3 experiments, one per oil tested (linseed oil, LO; high oleic sunflower oil, HOSFO; and regular sunflower oil, RSFO). The 3 experiments were conducted successively on 12 Malagueña goats, which were assigned at random to 1 of 4 treatments: 0, 30, 48, and 66 (H) g of added oil/d. A basal diet made of alfalfa hay and pelleted concentrate (33:67) was used in all of the experiments. For each animal, milk samples collected after 15 d on treatments were analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, and FA composition, whereas individual milk yield was measured the last 3 d of each experiment. Oil supplementation affected neither dry matter intake nor milk production traits. Increasing the oil supplementation decreased the content of saturated FA (especially 16:0) in milk fat and increased mono- and polyunsaturated FA in a linear manner.  content linearly increased with the oil supplementation by 370, 217, and 634% to 5.32, 2.66, and 5.09 g/100 g of total FA methyl esters with the H diet in LO, HOSFO, and RSFO experiments, respectively. Rumenic acid content linearly increased with LO and RSFO supplementation by 298 and 354% from 0.53 and 0.41 g/100 g of total FA methyl esters with the 0 g of added oil/d diet. The content of trans-10-18:1 was not affected by LO supplementation but showed an increasing linear trend with HOSFO supplementation and linearly increased with RSFO supplementation. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated FA in milk fat was decreased by about 70% with the H diet in the LO experiment and it was increased by 54 and 82% with the H diet in the HOSFO and RSFO experiments. In conclusion, LO supplementation in this work seemed to be the most favorable alternative compared with HOSFO or RSFO supplementation.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

Although animal and cell studies suggest that VA and c9,t11-CLA may be hypocholesterolemic and antiatherogenic, epidemiologic data comparing rTFAs and iTFAs are inconsistent, and human intervention studies have been limited, underpowered, and not well controlled.We determined the effects of VA, c9,t11-CLA, and iTFA, in the context of highly controlled diets (24 d each), on lipoprotein risk factors compared with a control diet.We conducted a double-blind, randomized, crossover feeding trial in 106 healthy adults [mean ± SD age: 47 ± 10.8 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 28.5 ± 4.0; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 3.24 ± 0.63 mmol/L]. Diets were designed to have stearic acid replaced with the following TFA isomers (percentage of energy): 0.1% mixed isomers of TFA (control), ∼3% VA, ∼3% iTFA, or 1% c9,t11-CLA. Total dietary fat (34% of energy) and other macronutrients were matched. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoprotein B were higher after VA than after iTFA; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI also were higher after VA. Compared with control, VA and iTFA both increased TC, LDL cholesterol, ratio of TC to HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (2-6% change; P < 0.05); VA also increased HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a) (2-6% change; P < 0.05), whereas iTFA did not. c9,t11-CLA lowered triacylglycerol (P ≤ 0.01) and had no effect on other lipoprotein risk factors.With respect to risk of cardiovascular disease, these results are consistent with current nutrition labeling guidelines, with the requirement of VA, but not c9,t11-CLA, to be listed under TFA on the Nutrition Facts Panel.

Here, we compared 30 molecular species pertaining to saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids, measured in plasma by gas chromatography, in 14 patients with a diagnosis of amnestic single domain mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 30 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 30 healthy controls (HC). As no participants showed neuroimaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease, patients could be considered as purely neurodegenerative. We found differences in specific components of almost all fatty acid classes except n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. Compared with HC, aMCI and AD patients had higher levels of arachidic (C20:0), erucic (C22:1, n-9), and  (C18:1, n-9) and lower levels of cerotic (C26:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2, n-6). In particular, level of linoleic acid decreased and level of mead acid increased progressively from HC to aMCI to AD patients, and they were also inversely correlated in AD and aMCI patients. In conclusion, we found a previously unrecognized linoleic acid deficiency in the early phase of neurodegeneration that was strongly supported by an increased, compensatory mead acid level. These findings suggest the importance of creating new dietary manipulation strategies to counteract disease progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22332075>Effects of ruminant trans fatty acids on cardiovascular disease and cancer: a comprehensive review of epidemiological, clinical, and mechanistic studies.</a></h1><p>There are 2 predominant sources of dietary trans fatty acids (TFA) in the food supply, those formed during the industrial partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils (iTFA) and those formed by biohydrogenation in ruminants (rTFA), including  (VA) and the naturally occurring isomer of conjugated linoleic acid, cis-9, trans-11 CLA (c9,t11-CLA). The objective of this review is to evaluate the evidence base from epidemiological and clinical studies to determine whether intake of rTFA isomers, specifically VA and c9,t11-CLA, differentially affects risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer compared with iTFA. In addition, animal and cell culture studies are reviewed to explore potential pro- and antiatherogenic mechanisms of VA and c9,t11-CLA. Some epidemiological studies suggest that a positive association with coronary heart disease risk exists between only iTFA isomers and not rTFA isomers. Small clinical studies have been conducted to establish cause-and-effect relationships between these different sources of TFA and biomarkers or risk factors of CVD with inconclusive results. The lack of detection of treatment effects reported in some studies may be due to insufficient statistical power. Many studies have used doses of rTFA that are not realistically attainable via diet; thus, further clinical studies are warranted. Associations between iTFA intake and cancer have been inconsistent, and associations between rTFA intake and cancer have not been well studied. Clinical studies have not been conducted investigating the cause-and-effect relationship between iTFA and rTFA intake and risk for cancers. Further research is needed to determine the health effects of VA and c9,t11-CLA in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22074701>Deleterious impact of elaidic fatty acid on ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from mouse and human macrophages.</a></h1><p>Consumption of trans fatty acids (TFA) increase cardiovascular risk more than do saturated FA, but the mechanisms explaining their atherogenicity are still unclear. We investigated the impact of membrane incorporation of TFA on cholesterol efflux by exposing J774 mouse macrophages or human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) to media enriched or not (standard medium) with industrially produced elaidic (trans-9 18:1) acid, naturally produced vaccenic (trans-11 18:1) acid (34 h, 70 μM) or palmitic acid. In J774 macrophages, elaidic and palmitic acid, but not , reduced ABCA1-mediated efflux by ~23% without affecting aqueous diffusion, SR-BI or ABCG1-mediated , and this effect was maintained in cholesterol-loaded cells. The impact of elaidic acid on the ABCA1 pathway was weaker in cholesterol-normal HMDM, but elaidic acid induced a strong reduction of ABCA1-mediated efflux in cholesterol-loaded cells (-36%). In J774 cells, the FA supplies had no impact on cellular free cholesterol or cholesteryl ester masses, the abundance of ABCA1 mRNA or the total and plasma membrane ABCA1 protein content. Conversely, TFA or palmitic acid incorporation induced strong modifications of the membrane FA composition with a decrease in the ratio of (cis-monounsaturated FA+polyunsaturated FA):(saturated FA+TFA), with elaidic and vaccenic acids representing each 20% and 13% of the total FA composition, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that cellular ATP was required for the effect of elaidic acid, suggesting that it contributes to atherogenesis by impairing ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages, likely by decreasing the membrane fluidity, which could thereby reduce ATPase activity and the function of the transporter.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Extensive use of leaf discs (mechanical wounding) in studies regarding the effect on the biochemical response of the grapevine to different types of biotic stress makes it necessary to understand  perturbation after injury. In this study, we investigate how mechanical wounding can affect the  of grapevine leaf tissue using Bianca variety as case study. Two sizes of leaf discs (1.1 and 2.8 cm in diameter) were excised from leaves, and phenol, lipid and carotenoid perturbation were investigated 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 120 h post cutting. In our study, we found an accumulation of molecules belonging to stilbenoid and stilbene classes such as trans-resveratrol, trans-piceide, Z-miyabenol C, E-cis-miyabenol C and ampelopsin D + quadrangularin A after abiotic stress. The increase in fatty acids such as linoleic acid, linolenic acid and oleic + cis- during the first 12 h after injury, followed by a return to basal level, allowed us to surmise their role in response to abiotic stress, in particular to mechanical wounding in grapevine leaves. Different-sized discs caused a different response to the tissue, with a higher accumulation in 1.1-cm-diameter discs, especially of phenol compounds. The results of this work can be used to better understand  changes due to biotic stress, having previous knowledge about the perturbation caused by abiotic stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22205319>Randomized controlled study of the effect of a butter naturally enriched in trans fatty acids on blood lipids in healthy women.</a></h1><p>Whereas the negative effect of consuming trans fatty acids found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is well established, the effect of trans fatty acids from ruminant sources (rTFAs) on CVD risk factors has not yet been established, particularly among women.We investigated the effects of a butter naturally enriched in rTFAs, of which  is the predominant isomer, on plasma lipid concentrations among healthy women.In a double-blind, randomized, crossover controlled study, 61 healthy women aged 19-70 y were fed 2 isoenergetic diets lasting 4 wk each. The 2 diets were defined as moderately high in rTFAs (3.7 g/d, 1.5% of daily energy) and control (0.9 g/d, 0.3% of daily energy).No significant effect of the rTFA diet was found on total plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A-I, and triglyceride concentrations compared with the control diet. There was a small yet statistically significant reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations with the rTFA diet (-2.8%; P = 0.004), which was significant (P for the BMI × treatment interaction = 0.006) among women with a BMI (in kg/m(2)) ≥25 (-5.2%; P = 0.004; n = 18) but not among women with a BMI <25 (-1.2%; P = 0.13; n = 43).These results suggest that an increase in dietary rTFAs equivalent to ∼1% of daily energy has no significant effect on LDL but may be associated with a reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations, particularly in overweight women.

However, health-promoting effects are associated with consumption of anhydrous milk fat (AMF) and ruminant trans fatty acids, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and  (VA) contained in the lipid fraction of milk and dairy products. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of AMF naturally enriched with CLA and VA in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), using sterculic oil to inhibit the conversion of VA into CLA. The administration of AMF to SHR during 7 weeks exerted beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk biomarkers (reduction of insulin, blood lipids, increase of adiponectin). When sterculic oil was included, some parameters were further ameliorated (reduction of insulin, increase of adiponectin). Sterculic oil alone reduced body weight and adiposity, and improved blood pressure, adiponectin and triglyceride levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28448838>Effects of feeding steers extruded flaxseed on its own before hay or mixed with hay on animal performance, carcass quality, and meat and hamburger fatty acid composition.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present experiment was to determine if carcass quality and fatty acid profiles of longissimus thoracis (LT) and hamburger would be affected by feeding steers extruded flaxseed on its own followed by hay (non-TMR) compared to when hay and extruded flaxseed were fed together (TMR). Forty-eight steers in six pens were assigned to TMR or non-TMR for an average of 242days. Dry matter intake was lower for non-TMR versus TMR steers (10.56 vs. 11.42kg/d; P=0.02), but final live weight (610±0.50kg) and average daily gain (1.18±0.02kg/d) did not differ.

In this study, BH of PUFA originating from different oilseeds (linseed, soya beans, sunflower seed and rapeseed) present in crushed oilseeds or their free oils were assessed in vitro. The assay substrates were incubated in buffered rumen fluid for 0, 6, 12 and 24 h. After incubation, the FA pattern of the incubated samples was analysed using gas chromatography. Biohydrogenation is defined as disappearance of double bonds (DB) calculated from the contents of unsaturated FA. After 24-h incubation, the DB contents of all oilseeds were reduced (p < 0.001) by 40-60%. The reduction was higher (p < 0.001) for the crushed form compared with the oil form. In addition, linseed and sunflower seed known as oilseeds with high contents of linolenic acid C18:3 c9,12,15 (LNA) and linoleic acid C18:2 c9,12 (LA), respectively, showed a higher (p < 0.001) accumulation of the BH intermediates conjugated linoleic acid (CLA, isomer C18:2 c9t11) and  (C18:1 t11) for the crushed form, when compared with the oil. These results suggest an inherent effect of the physical form of the assay oilseeds on in vitro BH. Changes in FA pattern during BH in vitro can be attributed to both source and physical form of the assay oilseeds. However, further investigations are warranted to ensure whether the observed in vitro effects on ruminal BH can be confirmed in vivo.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22021809>Technical note: stearidonic acid  by mixed ruminal microorganisms in vitro.</a></h1><p>Dietary supplementation of stearidonic acid (SDA; 18:4n-3) has been considered a possible strategy to increase n-3 unsaturated fatty acid content in ruminant products; however, little is known about its  in the rumen. In vitro batch incubations were carried out with bovine ruminal digesta to investigate the  of SDA and its biohydrogenation products. Incubation mixtures (4.5 mL) that contained 0 (control), 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, or 1.50 mg of SDA supplemented to 33 mg (DM basis) of commercial total mixed ration based on corn silage, for dairy cows, were incubated for 72 h at 39°C. The content of most fatty acids in whole freeze-dried cultures was affected by SDA supplementation. Branched-chain fatty acids decreased linearly (P < 0.01), and odd-chain fatty acids decreased quadratically (P < 0.01), particularly from 1.00 mg of SDA and above, whereas most C18 fatty acids increased linearly or quadratically (P ≤ 0.04). Stearidonic acid concentrations at 72 h of incubation were very small (<0.6% of total fatty acids and ≤0.9% of added SDA) in all treatments. The apparent biohydrogenation of SDA was extensive, but it was not affected by SDA concentration (P > 0.05). Biohydrogenation followed a pattern similar to that of other C18 unsaturated fatty acids up to 1.00 mg of SDA. Stearic acid (18:0) and  (18:1 trans-11) were the major fatty acids formed, with the latter increasing 9-fold in the 1.00 mg of SDA treatment. At greater inclusion rates, 18:0 and 18:1 trans isomers decreased (P ≤ 0.03), accompanied by increases in unidentified 18:3 and 18:4 isomers (P = 0.02), suggesting that the biohydrogenation pathway was inhibited. The present results clearly indicate that SDA was metabolized extensively, with numerous 18:4 and 18:3 products formed en route to further conversion to 18:2, 18:1 isomers, and 18:0.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25534067>Butter naturally enriched in cis-9, trans-11 CLA prevents hyperinsulinemia and increases both serum HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in rats.</a></h1><p>Evidence from in vitro and animal studies indicates that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) possesses anti-diabetic properties, which appear to be attributed to cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the major CLA isomer in ruminant fat. However, there is a shortage of studies addressing CLA from natural source. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of butter naturally enriched in cis-9, trans-11 CLA on parameters related to glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia in rats.Forty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the following dietary treatments (n=10/group), for 60 days: 1) Normal fat-Soybean oil (NF-So): diet containing 4.0% soybean oil (SO); 2) High Fat-Control Butter (HF-Cb): diet containing 21.7% control butter and 2.3% SO; 3) High Fat-CLA enriched Butter (HF-CLAb): diet containing 21.7% cis-9, trans-11 CLA-enriched butter and 2.3% SO; and 4) High fat-Soybean oil (HF-So): diet containing 24.0% SO. HF-Cb and HF-CLAb diets contained 0.075% and 0.235% of cis-9, trans-11 CLA, respectively.HF-CLAb-fed rats had lower serum insulin levels at fasting than those fed with the HF-Cb diet, while the PPARγ protein levels in adipose tissue was increased in HF-CLAb-fed rats compared to HF-Cb-fed rats. Furthermore, R-QUICK was lower in HF-Cb than in NF-So group, while no differences in R-QUICK were observed among NF-So, HF-CLAb and HF-So groups. Serum HDL cholesterol levels were higher in HF-CLAb-fed rats than in those fed NF-So, HF-Cb and HF-So diets, as well as higher in NF-So-fed rats than in HF-Cb and HF-So-fed rats. HF-CLAb, HF-Cb and HF-So diets reduced serum LDL cholesterol levels when compared to NF-So, whereas serum triacylglycerol levels were increased in HF-CLAb.Feeding rats on a high-fat diet containing butter naturally enriched in cis-9, trans-11 CLA prevented hyperinsulinemia and increased HDL cholesterol, which could be associated with higher levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA, , oleic acid and lower levels of short and medium-chain saturated fatty acids from butter naturally modified compared to control butter. On the other hand CLA-enriched butter also increased serum triacylglycerol levels, which could be associated with concomitant increases in the content of trans-9 and trans-10 C18:1 isomers in the CLA-enriched butter.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146725>New Nordic Diet versus Average Danish Diet: A Randomized Controlled Trial Revealed Healthy Long-Term Effects of the New Nordic Diet by GC-MS Blood Plasma Metabolomics.</a></h1><p>A previous study has shown effects of the New Nordic Diet (NND) to stimulate weight loss and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in obese Danish women and men in a randomized, controlled dietary intervention study. This work demonstrates long-term metabolic effects of the NND as compared with an Average Danish Diet (ADD) in blood plasma and reveals associations between metabolic changes and health beneficial effects of the NND including weight loss. A total of 145 individuals completed the intervention and blood samples were taken along with clinical examinations before the intervention started (week 0) and after 12 and 26 weeks. The plasma metabolome was measured using GC-MS, and the final metabolite table contained 144 variables. Significant and novel metabolic effects of the diet, resulting weight loss, gender, and intervention study season were revealed using PLS-DA and ASCA. Several metabolites reflecting specific differences in the diets, especially intake of plant foods and seafood, and in  metabolism related to ketone bodies and gluconeogenesis formed the predominant metabolite pattern discriminating the intervention groups. Among NND subjects, higher levels of  and 3-hydroxybutanoic acid were related to a higher weight loss, while higher concentrations of salicylic, lactic, and N-aspartic acids and 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol were related to a lower weight loss. Specific gender and seasonal differences were also observed. The study strongly indicates that healthy diets high in fish, vegetables, fruit, and whole grain facilitated weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity by increasing ketosis and gluconeogenesis in the fasting state.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22205318>What do we really know about the health effects of natural sources of trans fatty acids?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29396366>Quantitation of trans-fatty acids in human blood via isotope dilution-gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization-mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Trans-fatty acids (TFA) are geometric isomers of naturally occurring cis-fatty acids. High dietary TFA intake has been associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, little is known about TFA levels in humans. To address this data need, we developed and validated a new isotope dilution-gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (ID-GC-NCI-MS) method for quantitation of 27 fatty acids (FA) including 4 major TFA in human plasma, serum, and red blood cells (RBC) from 66 donors. Quantitation was performed with 18 isotope labeled internal standards and results are presented in μM and % of total FA. This method has high sensitivity and specificity due to use of pentafluorobenzyl-bromide derivatization combined with NCI-MS and a 200m column to optimize positional and geometric FA isomer separation. The four major TFA, palmitelaidic acid, elaidic acid, trans-, and linoelaidic acid, were detected in all samples, with median total TFA concentrations of 17.7μM in plasma, 19.6μM in serum, and 21.5μM in RBC. The % of total FA for the TFA was 0.20% in plasma, 0.20% in serum, and 0.30% in RBC. Patterns for % FA are similar to those reported in other studies.

Of the organisms capable of producing fatty acids, marine oomycetes are promising model organisms. One group of marine oomycetes are the Halophytophthora spp. which is known to have an important role in leaf decomposition, thereby changing the plant debris into exudates which are usable to consumers in the mangrove ecosystems. This study reports the three mangrove oomycetes isolated from Philippine mangrove forests, identified herein as Halophytophthora vesicula AK1YB2 (Aklan), H. vesicula PQ1YB3 (Quezon) and Salispina spinosa ST1YB3 (Davao del Norte). These isolates were subjected to growth analyses using varying incubation parameters (salinity level and pH), and for fatty acid production. Results revealed the presence of different fatty acids such as Arachidonic acid, Linoleic acid and  when grown on V8S and PYGS media. This study is the first observation of fatty acids from S. spinosa and H. vesicula from the Philippines. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Tropical Philippines straddling west of the Pacific Ocean and East of South China Sea is rich in marine and estuarine oomycetes. These micro-organisms, hitherto poorly known and unstudied in the country, play an important role in the nutritive cycle of the mangrove ecosystem. Due to the increasing demand for an alternative source of fatty acids, species of Oomycetes isolated from select mangrove forests in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao were analysed for their fatty acid contents. Prospects for industrially-important fatty acids make these Oomycetes all-important to study in applied microbiology in the Philippine setting where these structurally simple micro-organisms abound.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179851>Effectiveness of rubber seed oil and flaxseed oil to enhance the α-linolenic acid content in milk from dairy cows.</a></h1><p>This experiment was conducted to investigate effect of rubber seed oil compared with flaxseed oil when fed alone or in combination on milk yield, milk composition, and α-linolenic acid (ALA) concentration in milk of dairy cows. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments according to a completely randomized design. Cows were fed a basal diet (control; CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 4% rubber seed oil (RO), 4% flaxseed oil (FO), or 2% rubber seed oil plus 2% flaxseed oil (RFO) on a dry matter basis for 9 wk. Feed intake, milk protein percentage, and milk fat levels did not differ between the treatments. Cows fed the RO, FO, or RFO treatments had a higher milk yield than the CON group (up to 10.5% more), whereas milk fat percentages decreased. Compared with the CON, milk concentration of ALA was substantially higher in cows receiving RO or RFO, and was doubled in cows receiving FO. The ALA yield (g/d) increased by 31.0, 70.3, and 33.4% in milk from cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. Both C18:1 trans-11 () and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 (conjugated linoleic acid; CLA) levels were higher in cows fed added flaxseed or rubber seed oil. The CLA yield (g/d) increased by 336, 492, and 484% in cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. The increase in , ALA, and CLA was greater in cows fed RFO than in cows fed RO alone. Compared with the CON, the milk fat from cows fed any of the dietary supplements had a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids; conversely, the saturated fatty acids levels in milk fat were 30.5% lower. Insulin and growth hormones were not affected by dietary treatments; however, we noted an increase in both cholesterol and nonesterified fatty acids levels in the RO, FO, or RFO treatments.

Feeds were heated in a laboratory oven at 110 °C for 0 (unheated), 45, or 90 min. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was applied for quantifying biohydrogenation rate. The DF heated for 90 min showed the lowest biohydrogenation rate of LNA and LA, indicated by the lowest V value (P < 0.04 and P < 0.03, respectively). The DS heated for 45 min had the lowest biohydrogenation rate of LNA, indicated by the lowest V value (P < 0.04). In conclusion, heat treatment decreased biohydrogenation of LA and LNA in DF and LNA in DS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26044769>Oral Absorption and Disposition of alpha-Linolenic, Rumenic and Vaccenic Acids After Administration as a Naturally Enriched Goat Dairy Fat to Rats.</a></h1><p>Although there is extensive information describing the positive biological effects of conjugated linoleic acid and its main isomer rumenic acid (RA; C18:2 cis 9, trans 11), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and  (TVA), data about their bioavailability are not available. In this work, we investigated the oral absorption and disposition of these fatty acids in Wistar rats. A naturally enriched goat dairy fat (EDF) was obtained by supplementing ruminant diets with oils or oilseeds rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The EDF was administered orally (single dose of 3000 mg EDF/kg body weight equivalent to 153 mg TVA/kg body weight, 46 mg RA/kg body weight and 31 mg ALA/kg body weight), and serial blood and liver samples were collected and TVA, RA and ALA concentrations determined by GC/MS. The fatty acids TVA, RA and ALA were rapidly absorbed (t1/2a, 0.36, 0.66 and 0.76 h, respectively, for plasma) and slowly eliminated (t1/2β, 17.04, 18.40 and 16.52 h, respectively, for plasma). The maximum concentration (C max) was detected in liver > plasma > erythrocyte. Our study shows that when orally administered EDF, its components TVA, RA and ALA were rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body by the blood circulation to exert systemic effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830448>Significant decrease of saturation index in erythrocytes membrane from subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</a></h1><p>The lipidomic profiling of erythrocyte membranes is expected to provide a peculiar scenario at molecular level of  and nutritional  which may influence the lipid balance and the adaptation and homeostasis of the organism. Considering that lipid accumulation in the cell is important in promoting tissue inflammation, the purpose of this study is to analyze the fatty acid profile in red blood cell membranes of patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), in order to identify and validate membrane profiles possibly associated with the degree of hepatic damage.This work presents data obtained at baseline from 101 subjects that participated to a nutritional trial (registration number: ) enrolling consecutive subjects with NAFLD. Diagnosis of liver steatosis was performed by using vibration-controlled elastography implemented on FibroScan. Fatty acids, extracted from phospholipids of erythrocyte membranes, were quantified by gas chromatography method.The subjects with severe NAFLD showed a significant decrease of the ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid (saturation index, SI) compared to controls, 1.281 ± 0.31 vs 1.5 ± 0.29, respectively. Low levels of SI in red blood cell membranes, inversely associated with degree of liver damage, suggest that an impairment of circulating cell membrane structure can reflect modifications that take place in the liver. Subjects with severe NAFLDalso showed higher levels of elongase 5 enzymatic activity, evaluated as  to palmitoleic acid ratio.Starting from these evidences, our findings show the importance of lipidomic approach in the diagnosis and the staging of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22914200>Dietary supplementation of trans-11- reduces adipocyte size but neither aggravates nor attenuates obesity-mediated  abnormalities in fa/fa Zucker rats.</a></h1><p>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) present in dairy and ruminant fat has beneficial effects on  syndrome characteristics in humans and some rodent models. Production practices to increase the milk content of CLA are also substantially elevating trans-11- (VA). Questions are being raised whether VA has the same beneficial actions as CLA or has adverse biological effects similar to industrially produced trans-fatty acids. The present study examined the effects of dietary supplementation of either 0 or 1·5 % (w/w) VA for 8 weeks on lipidaemia, glycaemia, blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, adipocyte size and molecular markers of inflammation and insulin signalling in fa/fa Zucker rats. Dietary supplementation of VA did not alter feed intake, weight gain, blood pressure or organ:body weight (BW) ratios, except the epididymal fat:BW ratio which was lower in the VA group compared with the control group. The total liver lipid concentration as an indicator of hepatic steatosis was not different between the groups. Likewise, there were no changes in fasting lipidaemia, glycaemia or oral glucose tolerance. Although there were no physiological differences observed between the groups, animals supplemented with VA had smaller adipocytes (approximately 7 % smaller than the controls). The VA group also had higher adipophilin and IL-10 protein levels in epididymal adipose tissue (1·7- and 1·4-fold higher than the controls, respectively); however, there were no changes observed in critical nodes of insulin signalling. The present study provides evidence that supplementation with VA, a naturally produced trans-fat, has some positive effects on adipose tissue and did not exacerbate obesity-mediated  abnormalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547647>Short communication: A nanoemulsified form of oil blends positively affects the fatty acid proportion in ruminal batch cultures.</a></h1><p>Two consecutive rumen batch cultures were used to study the effect of nanoemulsified oils as a new type of supplement, on the in vitro fatty acid proportion and  formation. Three levels (3, 5, and 7%) of 2 different oil blends [soybean:fish oil (SF) or rapeseed-fish oil (RF)] were used. Both oil blends were used either in the raw form (SF or RF, respectively) or in the nanoemulsified form (NSF or NRF, respectively). The diets were the control (0%), which consisted of a dry total mixed ration without any supplements, the control plus 3, 5, or 7% of the SF or RF oil blend in appropriate form (raw or nanoemulsified). For each treatment, 6 incubation vessels were used. Each batch culture was incubated for 24h and conducted twice in 2 consecutive days. All supplements were calculated as a percentage of the substrate dry matter (400mg). Nanoemulsified supplements were recalculated to make sure the oil amount was equal to the raw oil supplementation levels. The results from both experiments indicated that the proportions of  and cis-9,trans-11 C18:2 increased when a raw oil blend was supplemented; on the other hand, no influence of nanoemulsified form of oil blend was observed on the proportion cis-9,trans-11 C18:2. Generally, supplementation with the nanoemulsified oil blends had less effect on biohydrogenation intermediates than the raw form of oil blends. However, the nanoemulsified form had a greater effect on the increase of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. Nanoemulsified oil blends had a positive effect on decreasing the transformation rate of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids in the biohydrogenation environment. Supplements of nanoemulsified oil blends tended to be more effective than supplements of raw oils in preserving a greater proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fermentation culture.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Biohydrogenation is typically less extensive in sheep than cattle, and consequently, sheep meat can contain higher proportions of omega (n)-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), and PUFA biohydrogenation intermediates (PUFA-BHI) including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and trans-monounsaturated FAs (t-MUFA). Sheep meat is also noted for having characteristically higher contents of branched chain FA (BCFA). From a human health and wellness perspective, some SFA and trans-MUFA have been found to negatively affect blood lipid profiles, and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). On the other hand, n-3 PUFA, BCFA and some PUFA-BHI may have many potential beneficial effects on human health and wellbeing. In particular,  (VA), rumenic acid (RA) and BCFA may have potential for protecting against cancer and inflammatory disorders among other human health benefits. Several innovative strategies have been evaluated for their potential to enrich sheep meat with FA which may have human health benefits. To this end, dietary manipulation has been found to be the most effective strategy of improving the FA profile of sheep meat. However, there is a missing link between the FA profile of sheep meat, human consumption patterns of sheep FA and chronic diseases. The current review provides an overview of the nutritional strategies used to enhance the FA profile of sheep meat for human consumption.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Beef blood (RBC), subcutaneous fat (SC) and muscle (intramuscular fat; IM) samples were collected from an experiment with dietary vitamin E with/without flaxseed (n=80) and fatty acids analyzed. Across treatments, correlation analysis of total and individual trans-18:1 isomers were performed between tissues. Correlations between SC and IM were highly significant for all individual and total trans-18:1. RBC trans-18:1 were also well correlated with other tissues except for . Levels of 10t-, 12t- and 13t/14t- were amongst the best correlated between RBC and SC and IM profiles. Levels of 6t/7t/8t-, 9t-, and 15t-18:1 showed significant but lower correlation factors particularly between RBC and SC. These results confirm the possibility of utilizing blood as a non-destructive sample to predict the total and isomeric profile of trans-18:1 in beef.Crown Copyright Â© 2012.

Here we report effects of production system (organic vs conventional) and finishing season on meat and fat quality of sirloin steaks from retail outlets and simulated fatty acid intakes by consumers. There was little difference in meat quality (pH, shear force and colour), but the fat profiles varied considerably between production systems and season. Meat fat from organic and summer finished cattle contained higher concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid, its precursor  and individual omega-3 fatty acids and had a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids compared with non-organic and winter finished cattle respectively. The fat profile from summer finished organic beef aligns better to recommended dietary guideline including those for long chain omega-3 fatty acids compared with that from winter finished, non-organic steak.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23957001>Antioxidant and α -amylase inhibitory property of phyllanthus virgatus L.: an in vitro and molecular interaction study.</a></h1><p>The present study on Phyllanthus virgatus, known traditionally for its remedial potential, for the first time provides descriptions of the antioxidant and inhibition of α -amylase enzyme activity first by in vitro analyses, followed by a confirmatory in silico study to create a stronger biochemical rationale. Our results illustrated that P. virgatus methanol extract exhibited strong antioxidant and oxidative DNA damage protective activity than other extracts, which was well correlated with its total phenolic content. In addition, P. virgatus methanol extract strongly inhibited the α -amylase activity (IC50 33.20 ± 0.556  μ g/mL), in a noncompetitive manner, than acarbose (IC50 76.88 ± 0.277  μ g/mL), which showed competitive inhibition. Moreover, this extract stimulated the glucose uptake activity in 3T3-L1 cells and also showed a good correlation between antioxidant and α -amylase activities. The molecular docking studies of the major bioactive compounds (9,12-octadecadienoic acid, asarone, , and acrylic acid) revealed via GC-MS analysis from this extract mechanistically suggested that the inhibitory property may be due to the synergistic effect of these bioactive compounds. These results provide substantial basis for the future use of P. virgatus methanol extract and its bioactive compound in in vivo system for the treatment and management of diabetes as well as in the related condition of oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23408826>Cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid is endogenously synthesized from palmitelaidic (C16:1 trans-9) acid in bovine adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Palmitelaidic (C16:1 trans-9) acid has been suggested to have beneficial effects on human health, including reduced adiposity. Objectives of this research were to quantify the amounts of palmitelaidic acid in beef samples and determine the effect of palmitelaidic acid supplementation on lipogenesis in bovine preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro. For the first objective, palmitelaidic acid content of LM samples from steers finished on forage or concentrate systems was determined. Palmitelaidic acid in LM samples from forage-finished beef ranged from 10 to 17 mg/100 g of muscle corresponding to 0.52% to 0.65% of total fatty acids. Forage species grazed during finishing, and animal age at harvest also altered palmitelaidic acid concentrations and contents in the LM of forage-finished beef. Palmitelaidic acid concentration of concentrate-finished beef was lower (P < 0.05; 0.25% vs. 0.56%); however, because of increased (P < 0.05) total fatty acid content with concentrate finishing, amount of palmitelaidic acid was similar (P > 0.05) to beef from steers finished on pearl millet and greater (P < 0.05) than those finished on alfalfa. For the second objective, undifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes were supplemented with 0 to 300 μM of palmitelaidic acid. Palmitelaidic acid supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) cell viability of undifferentiated preadipocytes at greater levels (150 and 300 μM) but did not affect (P > 0.05) the viability of differentiated adipocytes. In preadipocytes, palmitelaidic acid increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic and trans-11 vaccenic (C18:1 trans-11) acids at high levels of supplementation (300 μM). In adipocytes, palmitelaidic acid supplementation increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic acid, trans-11 , and total fatty acid content. In addition, cis-9, trans-11 CLA also increased (P < 0.05) with palmitelaidic acid supplementation in adipocytes. These results indicate that palmitelaidic acid can be elongated in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and desaturated in adipocytes to generate trans-11  and cis-9, trans-11 CLA, respectively. Beef products are a source of palmitelaidic acid in the human diet, which can be elongated and desaturated to produce trans-11  and cis-9, trans-11 CLA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27133424>Ruminant and industrial trans-fatty acid uptake in the heart.</a></h1><p>Dietary trans-fats are strongly associated with heart disease. However, the capacity for the tissues of the body, and specifically the heart, to take up trans-fats is unknown. It is also unknown if different trans-fats have different uptake capacities in the heart and other tissues of the body. Diets of low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice were supplemented for 14weeks with foods that contained 1.5% of the trans-fat elaidic acid or . Tissues were extracted and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then lipids were analyzed by gas chromatography for fatty acid content. Isolated cardiomyocytes were also exposed to elaidic or  in cell culture media for 24h. Dietary supplementation with vaccenic or elaidic acid resulted in a 20-fold higher accumulation of these TFAs in fat deposits in the body in comparison to liver. Liver tissue accumulated about twice as much per gram tissue as heart. Similar quantities of both elaidic acid and  were taken up by the tissues. Isolated cardiomyocytes exhibited an unusually large uptake of trans-fat, and this was dependent upon both the concentration and duration of exposure to the trans-fats but not upon the type of trans-fat. Expression levels of CD36 and FATP4 were not significantly changed during dietary interventions or exposure of cells to trans-fats. We conclude that fat, liver and heart (including cardiomyocytes) are all capable of accumulating trans-fat in response to dietary supplementation without changes in fatty acid transport protein expression.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Crossbred cull beef cows (n = 64, >30 mo of age, 620 ± 5 kg) were removed from grassland pastures, randomly assigned to 16 pens, and given ad libitum access to 50:50 (wt/wt, DM basis) forage:concentrate diets containing 0 or 15% ground flaxseed (DM basis, 5.2% added fat). Diets consisted of hay control (HC), hay+flaxseed (HF), barley silage control (SC), and silage+flaxseed (SF). Backfat biopsies were obtained from each cow at 0, 6, and 12 wk, and at slaughter (~20 wk) to assess fatty acid composition. With the exception of feed efficiency, flaxseed × forage interactions were not significant for backfat accumulation or performance parameters. Flaxseed improved (P < 0.01) feed conversion when supplemented to hay-based diet and increased ADG (P = 0.03), resulting in a heavier (P = 0.02) BW. Compared with hay, barley silage increased (P < 0.01) DMI, ADG, and feed efficiency. Subcutaneous fat contained 0.68% n-3 fatty acids at wk 0, and reached 0.68, 0.81, and 0.94% in HF cows after 6, 12, and 20 wk, respectively (Y(n-3) = 0.0133X + 0.6491, r = 0.87). It was 0.67% at wk 0, and reached 0.65, 0.77, and 0.90% in SF cows after 6, 12, and 20 wk, respectively (Y(n-3) = 0.0121X + 0.6349, r = 0.75). In contrast, weight percentage of n-3 fatty acids decreased in HC cows from 0.63, 0.50, and 0.47, to 0.43%, and in SC cows from 0.63, 0.40, and 0.36, to 0.33% over the 20 wk. A forage × flaxseed interaction (P < 0.05) occurred for many of the α-linolenic acid (ALA) biohydrogenation intermediates, including  (C18:1 trans-11) and CLA (combined C18:2 trans-7,cis-9 and cis-9,trans-11) in plasma, and in subcutaneous fat this also included non-CLA dienes. Concentrations of most α-linolenic acid biohydrogenation intermediates were greater when feeding flaxseed with hay. In conclusion, forage source altered plasma concentrations and rate of accumulation of ALA biohydrogenation products in subcutaneous fat from beef cows fed flaxseed. Factors responsible for this response are yet to be defined, but may include forage-mediated changes in ruminal biohydrogenation of ALA, as well as alterations in fatty acid  and deposition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24055970>Continuous cultivation of photosynthetic bacteria for fatty acids production.</a></h1><p>In the present work, we introduced a novel approach for microbial fatty acids (FA) production. Photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides KD131, were cultivated in a continuous-flow, stirred-tank reactor (CFSTR) at various substrate (lactate) concentrations. At hydraulic retention time (HRT) 4d, cell concentration continuously increased from 0.97 g dcw/L to 2.05 g dcw/L as lactate concentration increased from 30 mM to 60mM. At 70 mM, however, cell concentration fluctuated with incomplete substrate degradation. By installing a membrane unit to CFSTR, a stable performance was observed under much higher substrate loading (lactate 100mM and HRT 1.5d). A maximum cell concentration of 16.2g dcw/L, cell productivity of 1.9 g dcw/L/d, and FA productivity of 665 mg FA/L/d were attained, and these values were comparable with those achieved using microalgae. The FA content of R. sphaeroides was around 35% of dry cell weight, mainly composed of  (C18:1, omega-7).Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a precursor for CLA synthesis in lactic acid bacteria, RA was found previously not to form CLA in ruminal digesta but to have some inhibitory properties. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of RA to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation and methanogenesis. Ruminal digesta from 4 sheep receiving a mixed hay-concentrate diet was incubated in vitro with 0.167 g/L of linoleic acid (LA; cis-9,cis-12-18:2) or with a combination of LA and RA or LA and castor oil (LA, RA, and castor oil added to a final concentration of 0.167 g/L) in the presence and absence of lipase. The CLA rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-18:2) accumulated when either RA or castor oil and lipase was present.  (VA; trans-11-18:1) also accumulated, and a decrease of the rate of production of stearic acid (SA; 18:0) was observed. When LA was incubated with castor oil in the absence of lipase, no effects on biohydrogenation were observed. Ricinoleic acid at 0.02 g/L did not affect growth of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens but it inhibited growth of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus. Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus but not B. fibrisolvens metabolized RA to 12-hydroxystearate. Linoleic acid  by B. proteoclasticus appeared to be unaffected by RA addition whereas rumenic acid accumulation increased (P = 0.015 at 12 h) when RA was added. A 28% decrease (P = 0.004) in methane was obtained in 24 h in vitro incubations of diluted buffered ruminal fluid with added 0.2 g RA/L. There was no effect on the total concentration of VFA after 24 h as a result of RA addition, but the molar proportions of acetate and butyrate were decreased (P = 0.041 and P < 0.001, respectively) whereas that of propionate increased (P < 0.001). It was concluded that, at least in vitro, RA or the combination of castor oil and lipase inhibit biohydrogenation, causing the accumulation of rumenic acid and VA, with potential health benefits for ruminant products. The effect appeared to be mediated via an inhibitory effect on the biohydrogenating activity of B. proteoclasticus. An added environmental benefit could be a concomitant decrease in methane emissions. In vivo studies are now required to confirm the potential of these additives.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28905226>Identification and Characterization of Phospholipids with Very Long Chain Fatty Acids in Brewer's Yeast.</a></h1><p>Yeast lipids and fatty acids (FA) were analyzed in Saccharomyces pastorianus from seven breweries and in the dietary yeast supplement Pangamin. GC-MS identified more than 30 FA, half of which were very-long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) with hydrocarbon chain lengths of ≥22 C atoms. Positional isomers ω-9 and ω-7 were identified in FA with C18-C28 even-numbered alkyl chains. The most abundant ω-7 isomer was cis-. The structure of monounsaturated FA was proved by dimethyl disulfide adducts (position of double bonds and cis geometric configuration) and by GC-MS of pyridyl carbinol esters. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with negative electrospray ionization identified the phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine, with more than 150 molecular species.

However, there is scarce information on the antiophidian potential of this plant.The purpose of this work was to evaluate the inhibition effects of the ethanol extract of C. paniculatum on the enzymatic and biological activities induced by Deinagkistrodon acutus venom (DAV). The phytochemical components in the extract were also determined for understanding the mechanism of antivenom activities.Fresh root of C. paniculatum was shed-dried and smashed into powder. The powder was then extracted in 75% ethanol by refluxing method. Inhibition of proteolytic, phospholipase A, fibrinogenolytic and hyaluronidase activities of DAV by the extract were determined in vitro. Neutralization of lethal, hemorrhagic, myotoxic and edematogenic activities induced by the venom were also performed in vivo. Phytochemical constituents of the extract were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The ethanolic root extract of C. paniculatum (CPER) was able to completely (100%) inhibit protease and hyaluronidase activities induced by DAV when preincubated at a ratio of 1:100 and 1:50 (venom/extract, W/W), respectively. PLA and fibrinogenolytic enzyme activities were actually neutralized at the concentration tested. In-vivo studies the inhibition of venom hemorrhagic and myotoxic action reached 100% when the venom was previously incubated with the extract (1:100) before injection. The edematogenic effect was also inhibited in a dose-response manner. CPER completely inhibited DAV-induced lethality in mice when the venom was preincubated with the extract at a ratio of 1:100. GC-MS analysis indicated that a total of 58 compounds were discovered in CPER. Among them, 5 bioactive constituents including 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-, n-hexadecanoic acid, cis-, γ-sitosterol and stigmasterol exhibit antivenom activity according to previous reports.The results obtained in this work validate for the first time CPER as a traditional antiophidic herb, especially inhibitory effect on local damage induced by DAV, suggesting it could be used as a potential source of bioactive components against snakebites.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Both studies have already been published, but to our knowledge, 16:1 t9 has not yet been considered. This reanalysis of the datasets was reasonable because a new methodology for identifying 16:1 cis and trans isomers allowed us to address the subject presented in this article.Data showed that the systemic or intracellular increase in 16:1 t9 was strongly correlated with the increase in 18:1 t11 after the dietary intake or cellular uptake of 18:1 t11.

Eight lactating goats were fed a diet supplemented with sunflower oil (n=4) or sunflower oil plus fish oil and additional starch (n=4), based on the hypothesis that these dietary treatments could affect Δ(9)-desaturase gene expression in specific tissues. A chemical tracer, 1.5 g of [1-13C]VA as nonesterified fatty acid, was delivered by jugular injection. Goats were slaughtered 4 d later, and tissue samples were collected for the measurement of [13C]VA and [13C]RA enrichment and SCD1 and SCD5 expression. The addition of fish oil and additional starch to a diet containing sunflower oil was associated with several changes in [13C]VA and [13C]RA enrichment. These results support previous studies suggesting that mammary secretory tissue is the primary site of Δ(9)-desaturation in lactating goats. In adipose tissues, the [13C]VA + [13C]RA enrichment was consistent with a net uptake of circulating fatty acids to reconstitute body reserves at the end of the lactation cycle. The putative uptake of [13C]RA synthesized by other tissues precludes any conclusion from being drawn regarding potential Δ(9)-desaturation in the liver of goats, despite the detection of SCD1 and SCD5 mRNA in this tissue. Finally, no significant effect of dietary treatment was observed for SCD1 or SCD5 mRNA abundance in the mammary secretory tissue or other body tissues.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

In this regard, we assayed the γ-globin inducing capacity of Cis- (CVA). CVA induced differentiation of K562, JK1 and transgenic mice primary bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. CVA also significantly up-regulated γ-globin gene expression in JK-1 and transgenic mice bone marrow erythroid progenitor stem cells (TMbmEPSCs) but not K562 cells without altering cell viability. Increased γ-globin expression was accompanied by KLF1 suppression in CVA induced JK-1 cells. Erythropoietin induced differentiation of JK-1 cells 24h before CVA induction did not significantly alter CVA induced differentiation and γ-globin expression in JK-1 cells. Inhibition of JK-1 and Transgenic mice bone marrow erythroid progenitor stem cells Fatty acid elongase 5 (Elovl5) and Δ(9) desaturase suppressed the γ-globin inductive effects of CVA. CVA treatment failed to rescue γ-globin expression in Elovl5 and Δ(9)-desaturase inhibited cells 48 h post inhibition in JK-1 cells. The data suggests that CVA directly modulates differentiation of JK-1 and TMbmEPSCs, and indirectly modulates γ-globin gene expression in these cells. Our findings provide important clues for further evaluations of CVA as a potential fetal hemoglobin therapeutic inducer.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a relatively complicated, heterogeneous endocrine disorder. The etiology and pathogenesis of PCOS remain uncertain. In this study, based on the platform of ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) and the method of pattern recognition, a comprehensive metabolomics approach has been applied to explore the changes in  profiling between PCOS patients (n = 20) and controls (n = 15) as well as insulin-resistance (IR) PCOS patients (n = 11) and non-IR PCOS subjects (n = 9) in serum. In total, 36 metabolites were found significantly different between PCOS and controls, and 9 metabolites were discovered significantly different between IR and non-IR PCOS patients. Significant increases in the levels of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (myristic acid, linoleic acid, 9-/13-HODE, etc.), fatty amides (palmitic amide, oleamide), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, L-glutamic acid, azelaic acid, L-glyceric acid, pyroglutamic acid, and decreases in the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, uridine, and L-carnitine were found in PCOS patients compared with controls. In IR PCOS patients, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitoleic acid, and  also increased significantly compared with non-IR PCOS patients. All these changed metabolites showed abnormalities of steroid hormone biosynthesis, amino acids and nucleosides , glutathione , and lipids and carbohydrates  in PCOS patients. The subgroup IR PCOS patients exhibited greater  deviations than non-IR PCOS patients. These findings may help yield promising insights into the pathogenesis and advance the diagnosis and prevention of PCOS.

Four Serra da Estrela multiparous ewes in the second month of lactation were used in a double 2×2 Latin square design. Ewes were individually penned and milked twice a day with an 8-h interval. Each experimental period included 14 d of diet adaptation followed by 5d of measurements and sampling. The 2 diets included on dry matter basis 450 g/kg of corn silage and 550 g/kg of either a soybean oil-supplemented concentrate meal containing barley and maize (cereal) or dried citrus pulp (DCP; citrus). Feed was offered ad libitum, considering 10% of orts, and intake was measured daily. Milk yield was higher and dry matter intake tended to be higher with the citrus diet. Milk composition and technological properties for cheese production were not affected by treatments, except for lactose, which was lower with the citrus diet. Replacement of cereals by DCP resulted in a 3-percentage-point decrease of both 18:0 and cis-9-18:1 that were mostly compensated by the 4.19- and 1.68-percentage-point increases of trans-11-18:1 and cis-9,trans-11-18:2, respectively. The intake of C18 FA tended to increase with the citrus diet compared with the cereal diet, but the apparent transfer of 18:2n-6 and of 18:3n-3 did not differ between diets. The milk output of C18 FA increased with the citrus compared with the cereal diet, mostly due to the increase of trans-11-18:1 and cis-9,trans-11-18:2 because the daily milk output of 18:0, trans-10-18:1, cis-9-18:1, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 did not differ between diets. Replacing cereals with DCP in an oil-supplemented diet resulted in a selective increase of trans-11-18:1 and cis-9,trans-11-18:2 in milk, with no major effect on other biohydrogenation intermediates.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

We assessed whether plasma phospholipid cis-palmitoleic acid was associated with heart failure risk.This ancillary study of the Physicians' Health Study used a risk set sampling method to select 788 matched pairs. For each case of incident heart failure, we randomly selected a control among subjects that were free of heart failure and alive at the time of index case diagnosis and matched on age, year of birth, race, and time of blood collection. Plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography. Heart failure was ascertained using annual follow-up questionnaire and validated in a subsample. In a multivariable conditional logistic regression, odds ratios (95% CI) for heart failure were 1.0 (ref), 1.06 (0.75-1.48), 1.20 (0.85-1.68), and 1.58 (1.11-2.25) across consecutive quartiles of cis-palmitoleic acid (P for trend 0.009). Each SD increase in plasma cis-palmitoleic acid was associated with 17% higher odds of heart failure (95% CI: 2% to 33%) in a multivariable model. In a secondary analysis, each SD increase of log-stearoyl-coA desaturase activity (16:1n-7/16:0 ratio) was positively associated with the risk of heart failure (odds ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.00 to 1.29]), whereas oleic acid and cis- concentrations were not related to heart failure risk.Our data showed a positive association between plasma phospholipid cis- palmitoleic acid and heart failure risk in male physicians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22714958>The intestinal bioavailability of  and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and -γ in a rodent model of dyslipidemia and the  syndrome.</a></h1><p>Evidence suggests a neutral to beneficial role of certain trans fatty acids (TFA) from natural ruminant sources. Trans11-18:1 (, VA), the most predominant ruminant TFA and a precursor to conjugated linoleic acid, has been shown to improve atherogenic dyslipidemia and symptoms of hepatic steatosis in animal models. The objective of this study was to assess the intestinal bioavailability of various VA sources including synthetic free fatty acid (FFA) and natural ruminant triglyceride forms, as well as the mechanistic  that mediate VA's bioactivity.VA acts as a partial agonist to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ in vitro, with similar affinity compared to commonly known PPAR agonists. It was further confirmed that VA at 30 and 100 μM concentrations suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy vitro in a PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent manner. In vivo, feeding of VA (1%, w/w) resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of PPAR-γ in the mucosa of JCR:LA-cp rats, a model of the  syndrome (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared to control. In addition, VA from a triglyceride source had greater intestinal bioavailability in vivo compared to VA provided in an FFA form (p < 0.01).The activation of PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent  provides a mechanistic explanation of how VA improves blood lipids and related  disorders during conditions of hyperlipidemia.

However, the results remain inconsistent. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association of c9,t11-CLA, and t11-18:1 VA (intake or serum levels) with breast cancer risk.Relevant studies were identified by a search of PubMed, OVID, SCOPUS and Google scholar databases through 25 May 2015. We included case-control and cohort studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between c9,t11-CLA and t11-18:1 VA intake or their serum levels and the risk of breast cancer. This meta-analysis was conducted according to the guidelines for the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology.Three studies on c9,t11-CLA and t11-18:1 VA serum levels and t11-18:1 VA intake were evaluated in the systematic review only (narrative synthesis) and four studies (2 case-control and 2 cohort studies on c9,t11-CLA intake) were included in the meta-analysis (quantitative synthesis). The pooled RR for the highest vs lowest category of c9,t11-CLA intake was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.64-1.25) with evidence of heterogeneity (with 67,533 participants, I2=78.3%, P=0.003).

The inclusion criteria were: duration of HPN ≥ 3 mo, current HPN admixtures ≥ 2 mo and HPN infusions ≥ 2/wk. Blood samples were drawn 4-6 h after the discontinuation of the overnight HPN infusion. The functional lipidomics panel included: the red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) profile, molecular biomarkers [membrane fluidity: saturated/monounsaturated FA ratio = saturated fatty acid (SFA)/monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) index; inflammatory risk: n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio = n-6/n-3 index; cardiovascular risk: sum of n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) = n-3 index; free radical stress: sum of FA trans isomers = %trans index] and FA pathway enzyme activity estimate (delta-9-desaturase = D9D; delta-6-desaturase = D6D; delta-5-desaturase = D5D; elongase = ELO). Statistics were carried out using nonparametric tests. The amount of each FA was calculated as a percentage of the total FA content (relative%).In the OO-IVLE group, the percentage of oleic acid in the RBCs was positively correlated with the weekly load of OO-IVLE ( = 0.540,  = 0.043). In the SMOF-IVLE cohort, the RBC membrane EPA and DHA were positively correlated with the daily amount of SMOF-IVLE ( = 0.751,  = 0.044) and the number of HPN infusions per week ( = 0.753;  = 0.046), respectively. The SMOF-IVLE group showed the highest EPA and DHA and the lowest arachidonic acid percentages ( < 0.001).

The estimated activity of D9D was higher in all the HPN groups than in the HCs ( < 0.001). The estimated activity of D5D was lower in the SMOF-IVLE group than in the HCs ( = 0.013). The SFA/MUFA ratio was lower in all the HPN groups than in the HCs ( < 0.001). The n-6/n-3 index was lower and the n-3 index was higher in the SMOF-IVLE group in comparison to the HCs and to the other HPN groups ( < 0.001). The %trans index did not differ among the four groups.The FA profile of IVLEs significantly influenced the cell membrane functional lipidomics.

However, its low solubility is a challenge for controlled delivery to membranes. Here we introduce a new tool to deliver chol to membranes, namely, liprotides, i.e., protein-lipid complexes composed of a fatty acid core decorated with partially denatured protein. We focus on liprotides prepared by incubating Ca-depleted α-lactalbumin with oleic acid (OA) for 1 h at 20 °C (lip20) or 80 °C (lip80). The binding and membrane delivery properties of liprotides is compared to the widely chol transporter methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mBCD). Both lip20 and lip80 increase the solubility of chol ~ 50% more than mBCD and deliver chol to membranes with comparable efficiency. Although OA is cytotoxic at high concentrations, its effects are counterbalanced by chol. Further, cytotoxicity is strongly reduced when OA is replaced by cis-palmitoleic acid or cis-. This makes liprotides good tools to deliver chol to membranes and cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27116856>Elaidic acid and  in the plasma of pregnant women and umbilical blood plasma.</a></h1><p>The studies suggest that trans fatty acids are the most harmful type of fatty acids, and their ingestion leads to an increase in oxidative stress, changes in the plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, and a reduction in n-6 and n-3 fatty acids utilization. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration profiles of elaidic and vaccenic acids in maternal blood plasma in the perinatal period, and in the plasma of blood collected from the umbilical vein. The article deals with the issue of the correlation between the levels of trans-unsaturated fatty acids in maternal and neonatal blood, which could suggest the transplacental transport of these acids. The potential correlations between the levels of trans-unsaturated fatty acids in maternal and umbilical blood and birth weight and body length in neonates was also verified.The study group comprised 53 pregnant patients of the Clinic of Obstetrics and Perinatology of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, aged 18-39 years, together with their newborn babies. Elaidic and  levels were determined in maternal and umbilical plasma. Fatty acid methyl esters were injected onto the capillary column of the Agilent 6890M gas chromatography system integrated with an autosampler. The content of individual fatty acids was determined from the reference curves and expressed in mg/mL.The lowest levels of both acids were observed in umbilical blood plasma. The level of elaidic acid was 0.0019 mg/mL ± 0.0013 mg/mL, while the level of  was 0.0007 mg/mL ± 0.0011 mg/mL. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between maternal  levels and umbilical  levels.The presence of trans-unsaturated fatty acids (elaidic acid and ) in umbilical plasma is evidence of the transplacental transport of these acids. The significantly higher levels of elaidic acid compared to  in umbilical plasma suggests that  is more extensively metabolized in placenta. The levels of trans-unsaturated fatty acids had no effect on birth weight and body length in neonates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25466095>Influence of deficit irrigation strategies on fatty acid and tocopherol concentration of almond (Prunus dulcis).</a></h1><p>The effects of deficit irrigation on almond fatty acid and tocopherol levels were studied in a field trial. Mature almond trees were subjected to three levels of deficit irrigation (85%, 70% and 55% of potential crop evapotranspiration (ETo), as well as control (100% ETo) and over-irrigation (120% ETo) treatments. Two deficit irrigation strategies were employed: regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and sustained deficit irrigation (SDI). Moderate deficit irrigation (85% RDI and 85% SDI) had no detrimental impact on almond kernel lipid content, but severe and extreme deficiencies (70% and 55%) influenced lipid content. Unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents fluctuated under these treatments, the oleic/linoleic ratio increased under moderate water deficiency, but decreased under severe and extreme water deficiency. Almond tocopherols concentration was relatively stable under deficit irrigation. The variation between years indicated climate has an effect on almond fruit development. In conclusion it is feasible to irrigate almond trees using less water than the normal requirement, without significant loss of kernel quality.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the present study aimed at comparing FA-concentrations between PTSD-patients and healthy controls.A cross-sectional study comparing a mixed-gender sample of 49 patients with PTSD due to civilian trauma to 46 healthy controls regarding erythrocyte FAs including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (AA), and nervonic acid (NA).DHA was found to be significantly lower in PTSD-patients compared to controls after adjusting for sociodemographic and dietary factors (p =0.043). Additionally, exploratory analyses showed lower  (p =0.035) and eicosatrienoic acid (p =0.006), but higher erucic acid (p =0.032) in PTSD-patients. The effect of erucic acid remained after adjustment for sociodemographic factors (p =0.047); with the additional adjustment for dietary factors none of these FAs were found to be significant.Statistical power for differences with small effect sizes was limited, and dietary assessment could be optimized.We found little evidence for a considerable role of FA- in PTSD. Apart from lower DHA after adjusting for confounders, no differences were observed in the hypothesized long-chained polyunsaturated FA-concentrations. Additionally, we found few alterations in the long-chained monounsaturated FAs, which may be explained by dietary factors. Nevertheless, the observed small effect sizes and limited extent of the alterations emphasize the importance of further investigating the assumed role of FA- and its underlying mechanisms in PTSD, before implementing further FA-supplementation studies.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The survivability of mesorhizobial strains at -20 °C and -70 °C was significantly improved by some cryoprotectans (glycerol and sucrose/peptone). It is worth noting that the greatest resistance to freezing was detected when stress treatments were performed in glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Using PCR analysis, cspA genes were identified in the studied strains. Their nucleotide sequences were most similar to the sequences of the corresponding genes of the Mesorhizobium species. The expression of the cspA gene in the studied bacteria was analyzed using the RT-PCR technique. The fatty acid composition of the mesorhizobia was determined at 5, 10, 15, and 28 °C.

The aim of this study was to identify the group of ruminal trans- (trans-11 C18:1, t-VA) hydrogenating bacteria by combining enrichment studies in vitro.The enrichment culture growing on t-VA was obtained by successive transfers in medium containing t-VA. Fatty acids were detected by gas chromatograph and changes in the microbial composition during enrichment were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Prominent DGGE bands of the enrichment cultures were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.The growth of ruminal t-VA hydrogenating bacteria was monitored through the process of culture transfer according to the accumulation of stearic acid (C18:0, SA) and ratio of the substrate (t-VA) transformed to the product (SA). A significant part of the retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequences was most similar to those of uncultured bacteria. Bacteria corresponding to predominant DGGE bands in t-VA enrichment cultures clustered with t-VA biohydrogenated bacteria within Group B.This study provides more insight into the pathway of biohydrogenation.

Four continuous culture fermenters were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 periods of 10d each. Diets were (1) control (CON), (2) control plus soybean oil (SBO), (3) control plus blackberry oil (BBO), and (4) control plus pomegranate oil (PMO). Oil supplements were added at 30 g/kg of diet dry matter. Effluents were collected from each fermenter during the last 3d of each period and analyzed for nutrient and fatty acid composition. The concentration of VA in effluents increased with oil supplements and was greatest with the BBO diet. The concentration of stearic acid (C18:0) increased with the addition of soybean oil but decreased with the addition of pomegranate oil compared with the CON diet. The concentration of cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid increased with oil supplements and was greatest with the PMO diet. In conclusion, all 3 oil sources were effective in increasing the production of VA. The effect of PMO and BBO on VA may have resulted in part from inhibition of the final step in the biohydrogenation of VA to stearic acid.Copyright © 2014 American Dairy Science Association.

While oil accumulation  are intensively researched, the possible existence of a microalgal  converting fatty acids into alka(e)nes has received little attention. Here, we provide evidence that such a pathway occurs in several microalgal species from the green and the red lineages. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlorophyceae), a C17 alkene, n-heptadecene, was detected in the cell pellet and the headspace of liquid cultures. The Chlamydomonas alkene was identified as 7-heptadecene, an isomer likely formed by decarboxylation of cis-. Accordingly, incubation of intact Chlamydomonas cells with per-deuterated D31-16:0 (palmitic) acid yielded D31-18:0 (stearic) acid, D29-18:1 (oleic and cis-vaccenic) acids, and D29-heptadecene. These findings showed that loss of the carboxyl group of a C18 monounsaturated fatty acid lead to heptadecene formation. Amount of 7-heptadecene varied with growth phase and temperature and was strictly dependent on light but was not affected by an inhibitor of photosystem II. Cell fractionation showed that approximately 80% of the alkene is localized in the chloroplast. Heptadecane, pentadecane, as well as 7- and 8-heptadecene were detected in Chlorella variabilis NC64A (Trebouxiophyceae) and several Nannochloropsis species (Eustigmatophyceae). In contrast, Ostreococcus tauri (Mamiellophyceae) and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum produced C21 hexaene, without detectable C15-C19 hydrocarbons. Interestingly, no homologs of known hydrocarbon biosynthesis genes were found in the Nannochloropsis, Chlorella, or Chlamydomonas genomes.

The NAG composition comprised 29 FAs, linoleic, oleic, palmitic, and α-linolenic acids being predominant. Noticeable amounts of other FAs, such as lauric, myristic, hexadec-9-enoic, stearic, (Z)-vaccenic, and arachidic acid, etc., could also be present. In the course of maturation, the qualitative composition of major FAs remained nearly unchanged, while the unsaturation index of FAs in seeds and in TAGs, as well as, but to a lesser extent, in arils and in acDAGs, respectively, always decreased. This decline was brought about by a sharp fall of the α-linolenate level, a decrease of the linoleate content, and a corresponding rise in the oleate content. It is suggested that, in both seeds and arils, both classes of NAGs were formed at the expense of the same FA pool; the quantitative composition of this pool was characteristic of a given fruit part and strongly changed during maturation. The accumulation of TAGs in E. europaeus fruits was accompanied by a conversion of hexadec-9-enoic acid into (Z)- via the C2 -elongation reaction.Copyright © 2014 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zürich.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360100>-Fatty acids promote proinflammatory signaling and cell death by stimulating the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 pathway.</a></h1><p>Food-borne -fatty acids (TFAs) are mainly produced as byproducts during food manufacture. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, including atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms in this disease etiology are largely unknown. Here we have shown that TFAs potentiate activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) induced by extracellular ATP, a damage-associated molecular pattern leaked from injured cells. Major food-associated TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), linoelaidic acid, and -, but not their corresponding  isomers, dramatically enhanced extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis, accompanied by elevated activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway in a macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7. Moreover, knocking out the ASK1-encoding gene abolished EA-mediated enhancement of apoptosis. We have reported previously that extracellular ATP induces apoptosis through the ASK1-p38 pathway activated by reactive oxygen species generated downstream of the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X). However, here we show that EA did not increase ATP-induced reactive oxygen species generation but, rather, augmented the effects of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-dependent ASK1 activation. These results demonstrate that TFAs promote extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis by targeting ASK1 and indicate novel TFA-associated  leading to inflammatory signal transduction and cell death that underlie the pathogenesis and progression of TFA-induced atherosclerosis. Our study thus provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of and proposes potential therapeutic targets for these TFA-related disorders.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518914>Elovl6 regulates mechanical damage-induced keratinocyte death and skin .</a></h1><p>Mechanical damage on the skin not only affects barrier function but also induces various immune responses, which trigger or exacerbate skin . However, how mechanical damage-induced skin  is regulated remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that keratinocytes express the long-chain fatty-acid elongase Elovl6. Mice deficient in Elovl6 showed higher levels of cis- (CVA) in the epidermis and severe skin  induced by mechanical damage due to tape stripping than did wild-type mice. CVA accelerated tape stripping-triggered keratinocyte death and release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1) and IL-1α, which induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-1β and CXCL-1 by keratinocytes. Our results demonstrate that Elovl6 regulates mechanical damage-triggered keratinocyte death and the subsequent dermatitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30011250>Effect of soybean oil availabilities on rumen biohydrogenation and duodenal flow of fatty acids in beef cattle fed a diet with crude glycerine.</a></h1><p>Soybean oil with different ruminal availability (whole soybeans (WS), soybean oil (SO) and calcium salts (CS)) was used to evaluate the fatty acid (FA) intake, rumen biohydrogenation (BH) and duodenal flow of FA in Nellore steers fed diets with crude glycerine (CG). Eight castrated Nellore steers were fitted with a ruminal and duodenal silicone cannula, and distributed in a double, simultaneous, Latin square 4 × 4 design with four diets and four experimental periods. Concentrates contained ground maize, urea, mineral salts, CG (100 g/kg DM) and soybean products with different availability of soybean oil: (1) no additional fat (CO), (2) WS, (3) SO or (4) CS. Fat supplementation was fixed to obtain 50 g ether extract/kg DM. Experimental treatments had no effect on DM intake, DM duodenal flow or ruminal turnover rate of C:16 FA. However, fat addition increased C:18 and turnover rates of total FA rumen (p < 0.05). CS resulted in lower C:18 turnover rates and lower ruminal BH of monounsaturated and unsaturated FA (UFA) than WS (p < 0.05). SO resulted in a greater duodenal flow of C18:0 (stearic acid), C18:1t-11 () and saturated FA than the WS and CS diets (p < 0.05). CS resulted in a higher duodenal flow of C18:3n-3 (linolenic acid) than WS (p < 0.05). The association of CG and calcium salts in Nellore steers was the best nutritional strategy to increase duodenal flow of healthier UFA, which may increase the deposition of these FA in meat. However, SO associated with CG association increased the duodenal flow of , which is main precursor of endogenous synthesis of conjugated linoleic acids in tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26617388>Foetal cord blood contains higher portions of n-3 and n-6 long-chain PUFA but lower portions of trans C18:1 isomers than maternal blood.</a></h1><p>An adequate supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFA) promotes foetal health and development, whereas generally, trans fatty acids (tFA) are considered to negatively interfere with LC PUFA . Nevertheless, to date, limited data concerning separate trans C18:1, such as t9 and t11, are available for maternal and foetal blood. Therefore, in this study the portions of individual trans C18:1, LC n-6, and n-3 PUFA in lipids of maternal and foetal plasma and erythrocyte membranes of German mother and child pairs (n=40) were analysed.Portions of linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid as LC precursors were lower (~0.4-fold); whereas the metabolites arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, n-3) were significantly higher (~2-fold) in foetal than in maternal plasma and erythrocytes. The main tFA in maternal and foetal blood were elaidic acid (C18:1t9; t9) and  (C18:1t11; t11). Portions of t9, t10, t11, and t12 in foetal blood lipids were lower (~0.5-fold) compared with maternal blood. In foetal lipids, t9 was higher than t11. The t9 correlated negatively with eicosapentaenoic acid (n-3) and AA in maternal and foetal lipids; whereas t11 correlated negatively only with foetal total LC n-6 (plasma and erythrocytes) and n-3 PUFA (erythrocytes). No correlation between maternal tFA and foetal PUFA was observed.'Biomagnification' of LC n-6 and n-3 PUFA AA and DHA in foetal blood was confirmed, whereas single trans isomers were lower compared with maternal blood. Nevertheless, tFA intake, especially from industrial sources, should be as low as possible.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697077>Fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway and risk of coronary heart disease: the Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h1><p>De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is an endogenous pathway whereby carbohydrates and proteins are converted to fatty acids. DNL could affect coronary heart disease (CHD) or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) via generation of specific fatty acids. Whether these fatty acids are prospectively associated with SCA or other CHD events is unknown.The objective was to investigate the relations of 4 fatty acids in the DNL pathway-palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), and cis- (18:1n-7)-with incident CHD, including fatal CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), and SCA.A community-based prospective study was conducted in 2890 men and women aged ≥65 y, who were free of known CHD at baseline and who were followed from 1992 to 2006. Cardiovascular disease risk factors and plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured at baseline by using standardized methods. Incident CHD was ascertained prospectively and was centrally adjudicated by using medical records. Risk was assessed by using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards.During 29,835 person-years of follow-up, 631 CHD and 71 SCA events occurred. Both 18:1n-7 and 16:1n-9 were associated with a higher risk of SCA [multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) for the interquintile range: 7.63 (2.58, 22.6) for 18:1n-7 and 2.30 (1.16, 4.55) for 16:1n-9] but not of total CHD, fatal CHD, or NFMI. In secondary analyses censored to mid-follow-up (7 y) to minimize the effects of changes in concentrations over time, 16:1n-9 was also associated with a significantly higher risk of total CHD (2.11; 1.76, 2.54), including a higher risk of CHD death, NFMI, and SCA; 16:0 and 16:1n-7 were not associated with clinical CHD outcomes.Higher plasma phospholipid 18:1n-7 and 16:1n-9 concentrations were prospectively associated with an elevated risk of SCA but not of other CHD events, except in secondary analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23099444>Elovl5 regulates the mTORC2-Akt-FOXO1 pathway by controlling hepatic cis- synthesis in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Elevated hepatic expression of fatty acid elongase-5 (Elovl5) induces FoxO1 phosphorylation, lowers FoxO1 nuclear content, and suppresses expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis (GNG). In this report, we define the molecular and  basis of Elovl5 control of FoxO1 phosphorylation. Adenoviral-mediated (Ad-Elovl5) induction of hepatic Elovl5 in diet-induced obese, glucose-intolerant mice and HepG2 cells increased the phosphorylation of Akt2-S(473) [mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) site], but not Akt2-T(308) (PDK1 site). The Akt2 inhibitor Akti1/2 blocked Elovl5 induction of FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. Elevated Elovl5 activity in liver and HepG2 cells induced rictor mRNA, rictor protein, and rictor-mTOR interaction, whereas rictor knockdown (siRNA) attenuated Elovl5 induction of Akt2-S(473) and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. FA analysis revealed that the abundance of cis- (18:1,n-7) was increased in livers of obese mice and HepG2 cells following Ad-Elovl5 infection. Treating HepG2 cells with Elovl5 substrates established that palmitoleic acid (16:1,n-7), but not γ-linolenic acid (18:3,n-6), induced rictor protein, Akt-S(473), and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation. Inhibition of FA elongation blocked 16:1,n-7 but not 18:1,n-7 induction of rictor protein and Akt-S(473) and FoxO1-S(256) phosphorylation. These results establish a novel link between Elovl5-mediated synthesis of 18:1,n-7 and GNG through the control of the mTORC2-Akt-FoxO1 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22252473>Clinical dyslipidaemia is associated with changes in the lipid composition and inflammatory properties of apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins from women with type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to use lipidomics to determine if the lipid composition of apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins is modified by dyslipidaemia in type 2 diabetes and if any of the identified changes potentially have biological relevance in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.VLDL and LDL from normolipidaemic and dyslipidaemic type 2 diabetic women and controls were isolated and quantified with HPLC and mass spectrometry. A detailed molecular characterisation of VLDL triacylglycerols (TAG) was also performed using the novel ozone-induced dissociation method, which allowed us to distinguish  (C18:1 n-7) from oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) in specific TAG species.Lipid class composition was very similar in VLDL and LDL from normolipidaemic type 2 diabetic and control participants. By contrast, dyslipidaemia was associated with significant changes in both lipid classes (e.g. increased diacylglycerols) and lipid species (e.g. increased C16:1 and C20:3 in phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester and increased C16:0 [palmitic acid] and  in TAG). Levels of palmitic acid in VLDL and LDL TAG correlated with insulin resistance, and VLDL TAG enriched in palmitic acid promoted increased secretion of proinflammatory mediators from human smooth muscle cells.We showed that dyslipidaemia is associated with major changes in both lipid class and lipid species composition in VLDL and LDL from women with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we identified specific molecular lipid species that both correlate with clinical variables and are proinflammatory. Our study thus shows the potential of advanced lipidomic methods to further understand the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208621>Fatty acid distribution of cord and maternal blood in human pregnancy: special focus on individual trans fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids.</a></h1><p>Maternal nutrition in pregnancy has a crucial impact on the development of the fetus. Dietary trans fatty acids (tFA) are known to have adverse health effects, especially during pregnancy. However, the distribution of tFA produced via partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils (mainly elaidic acid; t9) differs compared to ruminant-derived tFA (mainly ; t11). Recent findings indicate that they may have different impact on human health.Therefore, in this study, plasma and erythrocytes of mother-child pairs (n = 55) were sampled to investigate the distribution of tFA, including individual trans C18:1 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) in fetal related to maternal lipids; with additional consideration of maternal dairy fat intake.Portion of t9 and t11, but also of c9,t11 CLA was higher in maternal than in fetal blood lipids. The portion of t9 in maternal and fetal lipids differed only slightly. In contrast, the portion of fetal t11 was only half of that in maternal blood. This led to a fetal t9/t11-index in plasma and erythrocytes being twice as high compared to the maternal values. A high dairy fat intake resulted in elevated portions of t11 and its Δ9-desaturation product c9,t11 CLA in maternal blood. In contrast, in the respective fetal blood lipids only c9,t11 CLA, but not t11 was increased. Nevertheless, a positive association between maternal and fetal plasma exists for both t11 and c9,t11 CLA. Furthermore, in contrast to t9, t11 was not negatively associated with n-3 LC-PUFA in fetal blood lipids.Fetal blood fatty acid composition essentially depends on and is altered by the maternal fatty acid supply. However, in addition to dietary factors, other aspects also contribute to the individual fatty acid distribution (oxidation, conversion, incorporation). The lower portion of fetal t11 compared to maternal t11, possibly results from Δ9-desaturation to c9,t11 CLA and/or oxidation. Based on the fatty acid distribution, it can be concluded that t11 differs from t9 regarding its  and their impact on fetal LC-PUFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26086219>Feeding a High Concentrate Diet Down-Regulates Expression of ACACA, LPL and SCD and Modifies Milk Composition in Lactating Goats.</a></h1><p>High concentrate diets are fed to early and mid-lactation stages dairy ruminants to meet the energy demands for high milk production in modern milk industry. The present study evaluated the effects of a high concentrate diet on milk fat and milk composition, especially, cis-9, trans-11 CLA content in milk and gene expression of lactating goats. Eight mid-lactating goats with rumen fistula were randomly assigned into a high concentrate diet (HCD) group and low concentrate diet (LCD) group. High concentrate diet feeding significantly increased lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in plasma and decreased milk fat content,  (VA) and cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk of the lactating goats. The mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein B 1c (SREBP1c), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthetase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACACA, ACCα) involving in lipid  were analyzed, and ACACA and LPL all decreased in their expression level in the mammary glands of goats fed a high concentrate diet. DNA methylation rate of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) was elevated and decreased, and SCD mRNA and protein expression was reduced significantly in the mammary glands of goats fed a high concentrate diet. In conclusion, feeding a high concentrate diet to lactating goats decreases milk fat and reduced expression of SCD in the mammary gland, which finally induced cis-9, trans-11 CLA content in milk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23880347>Plasma cis- and risk of heart failure with antecedent coronary heart disease in male physicians.</a></h1><p>Although an inverse association of red blood cell cis- and risk of myocardial infarction has been reported, it is unclear whether cis- might lower the risk of heart failure (HF) with antecedent coronary heart disease (CHD). We sought to examine the relation of plasma cis- with HF with antecedent CHD.This nested case-control study was based on 788 incident HF cases (of whom 258 cases had antecedent CHD) and 788 controls. Each control was selected using a risk set sampling technique at the time of the occurrence of the index case and matched on year of birth, age at blood collection, and race. Fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography and incident HF was self-reported on annual questionnaires and validation in a subsample using medical records.In a multivariable conditional logistic regression, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF with prior CHD were 1.0 (ref), 0.72 (0.33-1.57), 0.28 (0.12-0.67), and 0.23 (0.09-0.58) across consecutive quartiles of cis- (p_trend 0.0004). Each standard deviation of cis- was associated with a 41% lower risk of HF with antecedent CHD (95% CI: 17%-59%) in a multivariable adjusted model.Our data suggest that higher plasma levels of plasma cis- may be associated with a lower risk of HF with antecedent CHD.

Three visits have been completed, totaling 6 years of follow-up.Individuals (n = 477) at risk for diabetes recruited from the general population in London and Toronto, Canada.Values from an oral glucose tolerance test were used to compute 1/HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index for IS, the insulinogenic index over HOMA-IR, and the insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 for β-cell function. Thin-layer chromatograph and gas chromatograph quantified FA. Generalized estimating equations were used for the analysis.IS and β-cell function declined by 8.3-19.4% over 6 years. In fully adjusted generalized estimating equation models, PL cis-vaccenate (18:1n-7) was positively associated with all outcomes, whereas γ-linolenate (GLA; 18:3n-6) and stearate (18:0) were negatively associated with IS. Tests for time interactions revealed that PL eicosadienoate (20:2n-6) and palmitate (16:0) and CE dihomo-γ-linolenate (20:3n-6), GLA, and palmitate had stronger associations with the outcomes after longer follow-up.In a Canadian population at risk for diabetes, we found that higher PL stearate and GLA and lower cis- predicted consistently lower IS and β-cell function over 6 years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28990226>Milk fatty acid profile from cows fed with mixed rations and different access time to pastureland during early lactation.</a></h1><p>Milk fatty acid (FA) profiles were determined in Holstein cows (n = 27) fed total mixed rations (TMR) ad libitum (G0) or diet composed by TMR (50% dry matter [DM] offered) plus grazing of pasture with 6 hr of access time to paddock in one session (G1) or 9 hr in two sessions (G2) at 45 days in milk (DIM). Moreover, milk FA was determined at 65 DIM when G0 cows turned out to G1 diet without adaptation period (Post-G0), G1 remained as controls. Milk FA was quantified using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Preformed FA at 45 DIM was greater (+27%) for G2 than G0 cows (p < .05). Stearic acid (C18:0) was 30% greater for G2 cows (p < .05). De novo FA was lowest for G2 cows (p < .05). Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) did not differ (p < .12), while  (C18:1trans) was twofold greater for grazing treatments (p < .01). Linolenic acid [C18:3(n-3)] was greatest for G2 and lowest for G0 cows (p < .01). Omega 6 FA was greater for G0 than grazing cows, mainly due to linoleic acid [18:2cis(n-6); p < .05]. These results determined that n-6/n-3 ratio was almost threefold greater for G0 than grazing cows (p < .001). When diet of G0 cows changed to include pasture (Post-G0), preformed FA increased (p < .05), explained mainly by the increase (p < .05) of stearic (C18:0) and C18:1trans, while de novo FA tended to decrease (p < .1). Moreover, the amount of CLA and C18:3(n-3) tended to increase (p < .1) in Post-G0 cows. Offering 50% of dietary DM from pasture modified milk FA profile in early lactation potentially beneficial for human health. When TMR-fed cows were turned out to 50% pasture, milk FA profile reflected dietary change without need of an adaptation period.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065607>Redirection of  flux for high levels of omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid accumulation in camelina seeds.</a></h1><p>Seed oils enriched in omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acids, including palmitoleic acid (16:1∆9) and cis- (18:1∆11), have nutraceutical and industrial value for polyethylene production and biofuels. Existing oilseed crops accumulate only small amounts (<2%) of these novel fatty acids in their seed oils. We demonstrate a strategy for enhanced production of omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acids in camelina (Camelina sativa) and soybean (Glycine max) that is dependent on redirection of  flux from the typical ∆9 desaturation of stearoyl (18:0)-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to ∆9 desaturation of palmitoyl (16:0)-acyl carrier protein (ACP) and coenzyme A (CoA). This was achieved by seed-specific co-expression of a mutant ∆9-acyl-ACP and an acyl-CoA desaturase with high specificity for 16:0-ACP and CoA substrates, respectively. This strategy was most effective in camelina where seed oils with ~17% omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acids were obtained. Further increases in omega-7 fatty acid accumulation to 60-65% of the total fatty acids in camelina seeds were achieved by inclusion of seed-specific suppression of 3-keto-acyl-ACP synthase II and the FatB 16:0-ACP thioesterase genes to increase substrate pool sizes of 16:0-ACP for the ∆9-acyl-ACP desaturase and by blocking C18 fatty acid elongation. Seeds from these lines also had total saturated fatty acids reduced to ~5% of the seed oil versus ~12% in seeds of nontransformed plants. Consistent with accumulation of triacylglycerol species with shorter fatty acid chain lengths and increased monounsaturation, seed oils from engineered lines had marked shifts in thermotropic properties that may be of value for biofuel applications.© 2014 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359441>Proteomic analysis of Lactobacillus casei GCRL163 cell-free extracts reveals a SecB homolog and other biomarkers of prolonged heat stress.</a></h1><p>Prolonged heat stress is one of the harsh conditions Lactobacillus casei strains encounter as non-starter lactic acid bacteria in dairy product manufacture. To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms through which Lb. casei GCRL163 adapts to persistent elevated temperature, label-free quantitative proteomics of cell-free extracts was used to characterize the global responses of the strain cultured anaerobically in bioreactors at 30 to 45°C, pH 6.5, together with GC-MS for fatty acid methyl ester analysis at different growth phases. At higher growth temperatures, repression of -consuming metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, was observed, while PTS- and ABC-type transporter systems associated with uptake of nitrogen and carbon sources were up-regulated. Alkaline shock protein Asp23_2 was only detected at 45°C, expressed at high abundance, and presumptive α-L-fucosidase only at 40 and 45°C, with highly increased abundance (log2-fold change of 7) at 45°C. We identified a novel SecB homolog as a protein export chaperone putatively involved in posttranslational translocation systems, which was down-regulated as growth temperature increased and where the modelled 3D-structure shared architectural similarities with the Escherichia coli SecB protein. Membrane lipid analyses revealed temporal changes in fatty acid composition, cyclization of oleic acid to cyclopropane and novel cyclopentenyl moieties, and reduced synthesis of , at higher temperatures. An 18kDa α-crystallin domain, Hsp20 family heat shock protein was more highly up-regulated in response to heat stress compared to other molecular chaperones, suggesting this protein could be a useful biomarker of prolonged heat stress in Lb. casei GCRL163.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904960>Relationship between stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene expression, relative protein abundance, and its fatty acid products in bovine tissues.</a></h1><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) greatly contributes to the unsaturated fatty acids present in milk and meat of cattle. The SCD1 enzyme introduces a double bond into certain saturated fatty acyl-CoAs producing monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). The SCD1 enzyme also has been shown to be active in the bovine mammary gland converting t11 18:1 () to c9 t11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). The objective of this study was to determine any association between the gene expression of SCD1 and occurrence of its products (c9 14:1, c9 16:1, c9 18:1, and c9 t11 18:2) in various bovine tissues. Tissue samples were obtained from lactating Holstein cows (n=28) at slaughter, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA was extracted and converted to complementary DNA for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the SCD1 gene. Extracted lipid was converted to fatty acid methyl esters and analysed by GC. Tissues varied in expression of SCD1 gene with mammary, cardiac, intestinal adipose, and skeletal muscle expressing greater copy number as compared with lung, large intestine, small intestine and liver (371, 369, 328, 286, 257, 145, 73, and 21 copies/ng RNA, respectively). Tissues with high mRNA expression of SCD1 contained greater SCD1 protein whereas detection of SCD1 protein in tissues with low SCD1 mRNA expression was very faint or absent. Across tissues, the desaturase indices for c9 18:1 (r=0.24) and sum of SCD products (r=0.20) were positively correlated with SCD1 gene expression (P<0.01 for both). Within each tissue, the relationship between SCD1 gene expression and the desaturase indices varied. No correlation was detected between SCD1 expression and desaturase indices in the liver, large and small intestines, lung, cardiac or skeletal muscles. Positive correlations, however, were detected between SCD1 expression and the desaturase indices in intestinal adipose tissue (P<0.02 for all) except 14:1, whereas only c9 18:1, c9 t11 18:2 and sum of all desaturase indices were positively correlated with SCD1 expression in mammary tissue (P < or = 0.03). Overall, the relationship between SCD1 gene expression and occurrence of its products seems to be tissue specific.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031397>Modulation of the biomarkers of  and oxidative stress by ruminant trans fatty acids and dairy proteins in vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC).</a></h1><p>This study aimed to determine whether dairy macronutrients alter markers of  and oxidative stress in endothelial cells. Human endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with ruminant trans fatty acids (rTFA), either trans- (tVA) or trans-palmitoleic acid (tPA), whey protein hydrolysate, leucine or combinations of rTFA and dairy protein compounds. Industrial TFA elaidic acid (EA) was also investigated and compared with rTFA. Inflammatory prostaglandins (PG) and F-isoprostanes (F-isoP) isomers, markers of oxidative stress, were assessed in cell supernatants by LC-MS/MS. Both tVA and tPA, as well as whey protein hydrolysate, decreased TNFα-induced PG excretion. Combinations of rTFA and dairy protein compounds decreased  to a similar extent than rTFA alone.

Twenty dairy cows were divided into 2 groups that were balanced for milk yield, parity, and days in milk. The control group was fed a conventional diet (20 kg of dry matter/head per day), whereas the experimental group (EG) received the conventional diet supplemented with DOP as 10% of dry matter. During the trial, milk yield was recorded and the samples of milk, cheese, total mixed rations, and DOP were collected and analyzed to determine the chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile. Atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were calculated on the basis of the fatty acid (FA) profile of milk and cheese. Data were analyzed according to the mixed model for milk yield and chemical composition, including cows nested within treatment as a random effect, whereas the general linear model was used for the analysis of cheese parameters. Differences were assessed by Tukey's test. The EG diet had a lower content of palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids and a higher level of oleic acid compared with the control. Dietary DOP integration did not affect milk yield and composition with the exception of protein content, which was greater in EG and significantly affected by diet and period. Instead, period was found to be significant for fat and casein in both groups. Dietary supplementation with DOP modified the FA profile of milk and cheese. There was a decrease in short- and medium-chain FA, but significance was achieved only for palmitic acid. The stearic, isomer trans of oleic (in particular ), oleic, and isomer trans of linoleic acids significantly increased. Monounsaturated FA increased in EG milk and cheese and saturated FA were significantly lower, whereas no difference was marked between the groups regarding level of polyunsaturated FA. Supplementation with DOP reduced atherogenic and thrombogenic indices and increased conjugated linoleic acid in both milk and cheese. The free fatty acids, ketones, lactones, esters, and phenylalanine catabolites were increased in raw milk, whereas only leucine  was affected by diet in pasteurized milk cheese at both 1 and 30 d of ripening. The present results pointed out that DOP supplementation may improve the nutritional and nutraceutical properties and modify the aroma of milk and derived cheese.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Few prospective studies have been conducted, especially among populations with a high carbohydrate intake, to determine whether DNL fatty acids are associated with the risk of the  syndrome (MetS).We aimed to investigate associations of erythrocyte fatty acids in the DNL pathway-including myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), stearic acid (18:0),  (18:1n-7), and oleic acid (18:1n-9)-with the risk of MetS in a Chinese population with an average carbohydrate intake of >60% of energy.A total of 1176 free-living Chinese men and women aged 50-70 y from Beijing and Shanghai were included in our analysis, giving rise to 412 incident MetS cases during 6 y of follow-up. Erythrocyte fatty acids and  traits were measured in these participants.Erythrocyte fatty acids in the DNL pathway were correlated with a high ratio of carbohydrate-to-fat intake, less favorable lipid profiles, and elevated liver enzymes at baseline. In comparison with the lowest quartile, RRs (95% CIs) of MetS in the highest quartile were 1.30 (1.04, 1.62; P-trend = 0.007) for 16:1n-7, 1.48 (1.17, 1.86; P-trend < 0.001) for 16:1n-9, 1.26 (1.01, 1.56; P-trend = 0.06) for 18:1n-7, and 1.51 (1.19, 1.92; P-trend < 0.001) for 18:1n-9 after multivariate adjustment for lifestyle factors and body mass index.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the concentration of specific TFAs (elaidic, vaccenic, and rumenic acids) in maternal plasma and the risk of developing atopic manifestations in the first year of life.A subsample from a population-based pregnancy cohort of the INMA Project was analyzed. Maternal intake of fatty acids was assessed by a food-frequency questionnaire (75.5% of the cohort). TFAs and n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids were measured in samples of plasmatic phospholipids at 12 wk of pregnancy. Information regarding eczema and wheeze in offspring was obtained through questionnaires at ages 6 and 14 mo.Elaidic acid correlated negatively with n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (total, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid), and rumenic acid positively with both n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in maternal plasma. Neither of these two fatty acids was associated with the risk of atopic eczema or wheeze in offspring in the first year of life. However, a higher  level was found to be linked to a lower risk of atopic eczema.High  concentrations in maternal plasma may protect offspring against atopic eczema in infancy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25688688>Consumer sensory evaluation, fatty acid composition, and shelf-life of ground beef with subcutaneous fat trimmings from different carcass locations.</a></h1><p>Brisket, chuck, plate, flank, and round subcutaneous fat trim were used to produce ground beef patties then evaluated for color, lipid oxidation, fatty acid composition, volatile chemical compounds and consumer sensory evaluation.

We aimed to investigate the relationships between four major plasma TFA isomer (elaidic, vaccenic, palmitelaidic and linolelaidic acid) concentrations and the risk of CVD, stroke and non-stroke CVD. A cross-sectional study was conducted, utilising a nationally representative sample of US adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among the 3504 participants, 304 participants self-reported CVD history. The highest quintile of elaidic acid intake was associated with a 233% higher CVD risk (p = .010). Adjusted for age, gender and race, palmitelaidic acid was associated with a decreased CVD risk, but the effect size was diminished in a subsequent analysis model. For stroke risk, we failed to identify any associations. In addition to elaidic acid, the health effect of palmitelaidic acid should be paid more attention in the future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606629>Trans-Fats Inhibit Autophagy Induced by Saturated Fatty Acids.</a></h1><p>Depending on the length of their carbon backbone and their saturation status, natural fatty acids have rather distinct biological effects. Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid. Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic acid (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic acid, trans- and palmitelaidic acid, were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitic, but not by oleic acid. Elaidic acid also inhibited autophagy induction by palmitic acid in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts. We conclude that the well-established, though mechanistically enigmatic toxicity of trans-unsaturated fatty acids may reside in their capacity to abolish cytoprotective stress responses induced by saturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2018 German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).

In vitro trial experiments were employed to study the effect of feeds integrated with this bio-waste, which is rich in polyphenols, on rumen biohydrogenation, using sheep rumen liquor as inoculum.Fatty acid (FA) analysis and a polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) approach aimed at characterising the microbial community indicated that including SOP in feeds at the level of 50 g/kg and 90 g/kg induced changes in the FA profile and microbial populations. The simultaneous decrease of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and accumulation of  was observed. A depression in the populations of Neisseria weaveri, Ruminobacter amylophilus and other unclassified bacteria related to members of the Lachnospiraceae and Pasteurellaceae families was detected, suggesting that these microbial groups may be involved in rumen biohydrogenation.Supplementation of feeds with SOP alters the rumen bacterial community, including bacteria responsible for the hydrogenation of  to stearic acid, thereby modifying the FA profile of the rumen liquor.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23842207>Differences in rate of ruminal hydrogenation of C18 fatty acids in clover and ryegrass.</a></h1><p>Biohydrogenation of C18 fatty acids in the rumen of cows, from polyunsaturated and monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids, is lower on clover than on grass-based diets, which might result in increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the milk from clover-based diets affecting its nutritional properties. The effect of forage type on ruminal hydrogenation was investigated by in vitro incubation of feed samples in rumen fluid. Silages of red clover, white clover and perennial ryegrass harvested in spring growth and in third regrowth were used, resulting in six silages. Fatty acid content was analysed after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h of incubation to study the rate of hydrogenation of unsaturated C18 fatty acids. A dynamic mechanistic model was constructed and used to estimate the rate constants (k, h) of the hydrogenation assuming mass action-driven fluxes between the following pools of C18 fatty acids: C18:3 (linolenic acid), C18:2 (linoleic acid), C18:1 (mainly ) and C18:0 (stearic acid) as the end point. For k(C18:1,C18:2) the estimated rate constants were 0.0685 (red clover), 0.0706 (white clover) and 0.0868 (ryegrass), and for k(C18:1,C18:3) it was 0.0805 (red clover), 0.0765 (white clover) and 0.1022 (ryegrass). Type of forage had a significant effect on k(C18:1,C18:2) (P < 0.05) and a tendency to effect k(C18:1,C18:3) (P < 0.10), whereas growth had no effect on k(C18:1,C18:2) or k(C18:1,C18:3) (P > 0.10). Neither forage nor growth significantly affected k(C18:0,C18:1), which was estimated to be 0.0504. Similar, but slightly higher, results were observed when calculating the rate of disappearance for linolenic and linoleic acid. This effect persists regardless of the harvest time and may be because of the presence of plant secondary metabolites that are able to inhibit lipolysis, which is required before hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids can begin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21792736>Effect of synthetic ligands of PPAR α, β/δ, γ, RAR, RXR and LXR on the fatty acid composition of phospholipids in mice.</a></h1><p>Nuclear hormone receptors are transcription factors that can be activated by nutrition-derived ligands and alter the expression of various specific target genes. Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase (SCD1) converts palmitic acid (16:0) to palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) as well as stearic acid (18:0) to oleic acid (18:1n-9). At the same time, elongase 6 (ELOVL6) elongates 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-9 to  (18:1n-7) and eicosenoic acid (20:1n-9). We examined how synthetic selective ligands of nuclear hormone receptors alter the gene expression of hepatic enzymes in mice. In addition, we examined how the regulation of these two enzymes influences fatty acid composition of phospholipids in liver and plasma. Mice were gavaged daily for 1 week with synthetic ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, β/δ, γ, liver X receptor (LXR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid-X receptor (RXR) for 1 week. Phospholipids from liver and plasma were analysed using ESI-MS/MS and GC after saponification. Hepatic gene expression of SCD1 and ELOVL6 was measured using QRT-PCR. SCD1 and ELOVL6 expression increased after the gavage of LXR and RXR ligands. The analysis of fatty acid composition of total phospholipids in plasma and liver showed increased percentage contributions of the SCD1 and ELOVL6 products 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7 and 20:1n-9 after LXR and RXR ligand application. Analysis of total phospholipids from plasma and liver revealed a significant increase in monounsaturated fatty acids bound in phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and lysophosphatidylcholine (PtdEtn) after LXR and RXR ligand administration. Increased hepatic gene expression of SCD1 and ELOVL6 after gavage of selective RXR or LXR ligands to mice resulted in increased concentrations of their  products in phospholipids of liver and plasma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434333>Milk fatty acid composition, rumen microbial population, and animal performances in response to diets rich in linoleic acid supplemented with chestnut or quebracho tannins in dairy ewes.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to evaluate milk fatty acid (FA) profile, animal performance, and rumen microbial population in response to diets containing soybean oil supplemented or not with chestnut and quebracho tannins in dairy ewes. Eighteen Comisana ewes at 122±6 d in milking were allotted into 3 experimental groups. Diets were characterized by chopped grass hay administered ad libitum and by 800 g/head and day of 3 experimental concentrates containing 84.5 g of soybean oil/kg of dry matter (DM) and 52.8 g/kg of DM of bentonite (control diet), chestnut tannin extract (CHT diet), or quebracho tannin extract (QUE diet). The trial lasted 4 wk. Milk yield was recorded daily, and milk composition and blood parameters were analyzed weekly. At the end of the experiment, samples of rumen fluid were collected to analyze pH, volatile fatty acid profile, and the relative proportions of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in the rumen microbial population. Hepatic functionality, milk yield, and gross composition were not affected by tannin extracts, whereas milk FA composition was characterized by significant changes in the concentration of linoleic acid (CHT +2.77% and QUE +9.23%),  (CHT +7.07% and QUE +13.88%), rumenic acid (CHT -1.88% and QUE +24.24%), stearic acid (CHT + 8.71% and QUE -11.45%), and saturated fatty acids (CHT -0.47% and QUE -3.38%). These differences were probably due to the ability of condensed versus hydrolyzable tannins to interfere with rumen microbial , as indirectly confirmed by changes in the relative proportions of B. fibrisolvens and B. proteoclasticus populations and by changes in the molar proportions of volatile fatty acids. The effect of the CHT diet on the milk FA profile and microbial species considered in this trial was intermediate between that of QUE and the control diet, suggesting a differential effect of condensed and hydrolyzable tannins on rumen microbes. Compared with control animals, the presence of B. fibrisolvens increased about 3 times in ewes fed CHT and about 5 times in animals fed QUE. In contrast, the abundance of B. proteoclasticus decreased about 5- and 15-fold in rumen liquor of ewes fed CHT and QUE diets, respectively. The use of soybean oil and a practical dose of QUE or CHT extract in the diet of dairy ewes can be an efficient strategy to improve the nutritional quality of milk.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Twelve dairy cows (90 ± 22 d in milk, 523 ± 88 kg of body weight, 7,908 ± 719 kg of milk production in the previous lactation) were housed in individual tiestalls and assigned to treatments according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design replicated 4 times. Treatments were 100% TMR (T100), 75% TMR plus 25% FF (T75), and 50% TMR plus 50% FF (T50). The experiment lasted 60 d, divided into 3 periods of 20 d each; the first 12 d of each period were used for diet adaptation and the last 8 d for data collection. The TMR (18.1% crude protein, 24.6% acid detergent fiber) and FF (Lolium multiflorum; 15.1% crude protein, 24.1% acid detergent fiber) were prepared and cut daily and offered to each cow individually. The highest DMI was reached in T100 and T75, which was reflected in greater intake of the different nutrients than T50. No differences were detected in the apparent total digestibility of the nutrients, mean ruminal pH, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations among treatments. Cows in T50 resulted in the lowest ruminal N-NH concentration and the lowest microbial N flow to the duodenum. Milk yield was 8.5% higher from cows in T100 and T75 compared with T50, but we observed no differences for milk fat or milk protein yield among treatments. Milk fat of cows fed T50 had 8% more unsaturated fatty acids (FA) than that of cows fed T100, mostly because of a higher content of monounsaturated FA. Additionally, cows in T50 had a higher concentration of linoleic acid, , and rumenic acid than T100. Meanwhile, the concentration of linoleic acid and  in cows fed T75 was higher than T100. The milk fat of the cows fed T50 and T75 had a lower n-6:n-3 ratio than T100. We concluded that including up to 29% of FF in the total DMI in combination with a TMR did not affect the intake or digestion of nutrients or the productive response in dairy cows and resulted in a higher concentration of desirable FA from a consumer's perspective.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In this study, we investigated the effect of VA on insulin secretion in vivo in rats and in vitro in human and rat islets after diabetogenic insult.Hyperglycemic clamp showed that VA dietary supplementation for 8 weeks significantly increased glucose turnover in rats with type 2 diabetes (T2D), accompanied by an elevated plasma C-peptide concentration, indicating improved insulin secretion. The β-cell area and proliferation rate were higher in T2D+VA than T2D group. Isolated islets from T2D+VA rats had higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) than T2D group. In vitro, VA treatment for 24 and 48 h significantly enhanced GSIS in rat and human islets after diabetogenic challenges. The mRNA expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and regenerating islet-derived 1α (REG-1α) were consistently increased by VA in both rat and human islets.These results indicate that VA may improve insulin secretion and growth of islets in T2D, at least partly by altering GPR40 and REG-1α mRNA expression.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To test this hypothesis, 26 Comisana lambs were divided into 3 groups and for 56 d were fed a barley-based concentrate diet (CON; 8 lambs) or 2 diets in which barley was replaced with 24% (CIT24; 9 lambs) or 35% (CIT35; 9 lambs) dried citrus pulp. An overall improvement of the fatty acid composition of LM from lambs fed citrus pulp-containing diets was found. The PUFA/SFA ratio was lower (P < 0.05) in the LM from lambs in the CON group compared with both the CIT24 and CIT35 groups. The thrombogenic index was lower (P < 0.05) in meat from lambs fed the CIT35 diet compared with those fed the CON diet. The CIT35 diet increased the proportion of C20:5 n-3 in the LM (P < 0.05), whereas the CIT24 diet enhanced that of C22:6 -3 (P < 0.05) compared with the CON diet. Some of these results might be explained considering that feeding the CIT24 and CIT35 diets increased the intake of total fatty acids (P < 0.05) and of C18:3 n-3 (P < 0.01) compared with feeding the CON treatment. On the other hand, phenolic compounds present in citrus pulp could have inhibited the ruminal biohydrogenation of PUFA. This is supported by the fact that regardless of the level of inclusion in the diet, citrus pulp increased the proportion of rumenic acid (P < 0.001) in LM compared with the CON diet. The plasma from lambs fed both CIT24 and CIT35 diets had a greater percentage of  (VA; < 0.001) compared with that from lambs fed the CON diet, and the CIT35 diet increased the proportion of rumenic acid in plasma compared with the CON treatment (P < 0.05). In the ruminal fluid, stearic acid (SA) tended to decrease, and the sum of CLA tended to increase (P = 0.09) with increasing level of citrus pulp in the diets. Furthermore, the SA/(SA + VA) ratio tended to be lower (P = 0.10) in the ruminal fluid from lambs fed the CIT35 diet compared with that of the CON group. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that replacing barley with citrus pulp in the diet of growing lambs improves intramuscular fatty acid composition and underline the need for specific studies to clarify the mechanisms by which feeding citrus pulp affects the fatty acid  in ruminants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28448837>Genetic analysis of meat quality traits in maternal lines of rabbit and their diallel cross.</a></h1><p>Young rabbits, the dams of which came from a full diallel cross among four maternal lines (A, V, H and LP) and the sires from a single paternal line (R), that produce sixteen genetic groups, was carried out to evaluate the genetic groups and to estimate the crossbreeding genetic parameters of meat quality. The meat quality traits were recorded by NIRS from a sample of 285 longissimus lumborum muscles. Crossbreeding parameters were estimated according to Dickerson model.

Significant differences for these traits appeared between the crossbred AH and VV (in favor of AH).

Two treatments could be tested simultaneously and were arranged along 6 periods. The milk FA profile was characterized by increments in the proportion of linoleic (LA) and α-linolenic acid (α-LNA) (QTE = 10 and 6.1%; QTE = 28 and 25%, respectively) compared to CON, which might indicate reduced ruminal biohydrogenation (BH) of both dietary LA and α-LNA.  (VA) in the milk fat was reduced (QTE 8.9% and QTE 12%) compared to CON, which may be linked to inhibited BH of LA and α-LNA. Rumenic acid (RA), a conjugated LA (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid) and an important human health promoter, was unfortunately decreased (QTE 8.3% and QTE 16%) in the milk compared with CON, probably because of inhibited ruminal BH of LA. However, reduced RA in the milk was probably due to reduced availability of VA produced in the rumen and the consequently low VA available to be desaturated to RA in the mammary gland by Δ-desaturase. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased with QTE and QTE by 4.7 and 15% compared to CON, respectively, and the long-chain FA proportions were also increased (QTE 2.0% and QTE 8.2%). Moreover, myristic and palmitic acid were reduced by QTE (9.6 and 3.3%, respectively) compared to CON, which also contributed to increasing the nutritional quality of milk because they are recognized to increase high-density lipoprotein in humans. Branched-chain FA in milk was reduced with QTE treatments, which indicates inhibited ruminal BH and microbial activity. In general, our findings suggest that dietary QTE have the potential to modulate FA profile of milk fat, and this effect is dosage dependent. Because QTE influenced the FA profile of milk fat both positively and negatively, further research is needed before concluding that QTE may improve the nutritional quality of cow milk fat in human diets.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Abundant behavioral evidence indicates that female spiders release sex pheromones to guide mate-searching behavior of conspecific mature males. However, the chemical nature of spider pheromones is poorly understood. Females of the funnel-web spider, Allagelena difficilis, employ sit-and-wait tactics for mating. Field observations indicate that males leave their retreats to search for potential mates during the breeding season. Therefore, we investigated whether virgin females release a sex attractant to conspecific males and then explored the chemical nature of the female pheromone. Four fatty acids extracted from the female bodies (palmitic acid, linoleic acid, cis- and stearic acid) constitute a multiple-component sex attractant to conspecific males in A. difficilis. Unexpectedly, mated females also produce the same fatty acids, but at trace levels. Two-choice experiments showed that males were significantly attracted by the blend of the four fatty acids in appropriate concentrations while avoiding the blend consisting of the same acids at very low concentrations, suggesting that mate-searching males are able to discriminate virgin females from mated females by the quantities of female-specific fatty acids in the funnel-web spider A. difficilis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632039>Comparative effect of dairy fatty acids on cell adhesion molecules, nitric oxide and relative gene expression in healthy and diabetic human aortic endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Dairy intake, despite its high saturated fatty acid (SFA) content, is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This in vitro study determined the effect of individual fatty acids (FA) found in dairy, and FA mixtures representative of a high SFA and a low SFA dairy lipid on markers of endothelial function in healthy and type II diabetic aortic endothelial cells.Cells were incubated for 24 h with FA mixtures (400 μM) and individual FA: oleic acid (OA; 150 μM); palmitic acid (PA; 150 μM); stearic acid (SA: 40 μM); trans-palmitelaidic acid (trans-PA; 20 μM); trans- (trans-VA; 20 μM); α-linolenic acid (ALA; 20 μM) and linoleic acid (LA; 20 μM). Cellular adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured using ELISA and a chemiluminescent-based assay, respectively. Relative gene expression of these markers, including the insulin receptor, was performed using real-time PCR as well as FA compositions of cell pellets by gas chromatography.FA mixtures affected sE-selectin concentrations (P = 0.008), with concentrations lower following the high SFA compared to the low SFA mixture (P = 0.004), while NO concentrations were higher in diabetic compared to healthy cells (P = 0.029). Individual FA affected NO (P = 0.007) and sE-selectin (P = 0.040) concentrations with an increase following PA incubation relative to all other FA treatments (P < 0.05). PA increased sE-selectin compared with other FA treatments (P < 0.05). sE-selectin concentrations were also higher in healthy compared to diabetic cells (P = 0.023). Expression of ICAM-1 and insulin receptor was up-regulated in healthy compared to diabetic cells (P = 0.014 and P = 0.006 respectively).Healthy and type II diabetic cells respond differently to incubation with FA treatments. Overall, physiological concentrations of dairy FA, but not dairy FA mixtures, substantially affected markers of endothelial function.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Food intake studies have provided estimates for TFA concentrations in the US population; however, there is a need for data on TFA blood concentrations in the population. The objective of this study was to determine plasma TFA concentrations in a nationally representative group of fasted adults in the US population in NHANES samples from 1999-2000 and 2009-2010. Four major TFAs [palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t),   (C18:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t), and linoelaidic acid (C18:2n-6t,9t)] were measured in plasma in 1613 subjects from NHANES 1999-2000 and 2462 subjects from NHANES 2009-2010 by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Geometric means and distribution percentiles were calculated for each TFA and their sum by age, sex, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American), and covariate-adjusted geometric means were computed by using a model that included these demographic and other dietary factors, as well as survey year and any significant interaction terms. These nationally representative data for the adult US population show that TFA concentrations were 54% lower in NHANES 2009-2010 than in NHANES 1999-2000. Covariate-adjusted geometric means for the sum of the 4 TFAs were 81.4 μmol/L (95% CI: 77.3, 85.6 μmol/L) and 37.8 μmol/L (95% CI: 36.4, 39.4 μmol/L) in NHANES 1999-2000 and 2009-2010, respectively. Even with the large decline in TFA concentrations, differences between demographic subgroups were comparable in the 2 surveys. The results indicate an overall reduction in TFA concentrations in the US population and provide a valuable baseline to evaluate the impact of the recent regulation categorizing TFAs as food additives.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310811> of nC11 fatty acid fed to Trichoderma koningii and Penicillium janthinellum II: Production of intracellular and extracellular lipids.</a></h1><p>Little is known about the fungal  of nC10 and nC11 fatty acids and their conversion into lipids. A mixed batch culture of soil fungi, T. koningii and P. janthinellum, was grown on undecanoic acid (UDA), a mixture of UDA and potato dextrose broth (UDA+PDB), and PDB alone to examine their  conversion during growth. We quantified seven intracellular and extracellular lipid classes using Iatroscan thin-layer chromatography with flame ionization detection (TLC-FID). Gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was used to quantify 42 individual fatty acids. Per 150 mL culture, the mixed fungal culture grown on UDA+PDB produced the highest amount of intracellular (531 mg) and extracellular (14.7 mg) lipids during the exponential phase. The content of total intracellular lipids represented 25% of the total biomass-carbon, or 10% of the total biomass dry weight produced. Fatty acids made up the largest class of intracellular lipids (457 mg/150 mL culture) and they were synthesized at a rate of 2.4 mg/h during the exponential phase, and decomposed at a rate of 1.8 mg/h during the stationary phase, when UDA+PDB was the carbon source. Palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2) and  (C18:1) accounted for >80% of the total intracellular fatty acids. During exponential growth on UDA+PDB, hydrocarbons were the largest pool of all extracellular lipids (6.5 mg), and intracellularly they were synthesized at a rate of 64 μg/h. The mixed fungal species culture of T. koningii and P. janthinellum produced many lipids for potential use as industrial feedstocks or bioproducts in biorefineries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797122>Association between plasma concentrations of elaidic acid, a major trans fatty acid, and depression in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.</a></h1><p>Previous studies on health effects of trans fatty acids (TFA) have focused mainly on cardiovascular health. Little is known about the association of TFA with brain or mental health. In this study, we examined the associations of objectively-measured plasma TFA concentrations with depression in a large population-based cross-sectional study among U.S. adults.We included 2136 non-pregnant participants aged 20 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. Four major TFAs, including palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t),  (C18:1n-7t), and linoelaidic acid (C18:2n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9.Participants with depressive symptoms had a higher plasma concentration of total TFA compared with those without depressive symptoms (6.6 vs 6.0 μmol/g lipids, P = 0.046). After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratio (OR) of depressive symptoms comparing the highest with lowest tertile of TFAs was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.86-2.39) for total TFAs (P for trend 0.15). For each individual type of TFA, the corresponding OR was 1.78 (1.03-3.07) for elaidic acid (P for trend 0.049), 1.23 (0.76-2.00) for linoelaidic acid (P for trend 0.37), 1.19 (0.75-1.87) for palmitelaidic acid (P for trend 0.46), and 1.20 (0.75-1.94) for  (P for trend 0.43).The cross-sectional study design limited causal inferences of the findings.In a nationally representative population, plasma elaidic acid, a major trans fatty acid, was positively associated with depressive symptoms in adults.

To elucidate the effect of cis/trans configuration, the cells were exposed to either oleic acid (C18:1 cis-9), elaidic acid (C18:1 trans-9),  (C18:1 trans-11), linoleic acid (C18:2), or palmitic acid (C16:0), and multivariate data analysis revealed a strong effect of fatty acid on the lipophilic metabolite fraction. Inspection of the spectra revealed that the difference between the observed responses could be ascribed to the appearance of resonances from conjugated double bonds (5.65, 5.94, and 6.28 ppm) in cells exposed to , revealing that  upon uptake by the HepG2 cells is converted into a conjugated fatty acid. Upon exposure of the HepG2 cells to either butyric acid (C4:0), caproic acid (C6:0), lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), or palmitic acid (C16:0), an effect of fatty acid length was also evident, and data indicated that short-chain fatty acids (C4-C6) are immediately converted, whereas medium-long-chain fatty acids (C12-16) are incorporated into triglycerides and deposited in the cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that (1)H NMR spectroscopy is a useful method for studying the uptake of fatty acids in in vitro cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27101703>[Effect of cis-vaccinate acid on swarming ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].</a></h1><p>To study the effect of fatty acids composition on swarming mobility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.We constructed a fabF-knockout mutant of PAO1 (YFF-1) by double exchange principle, overexpressed FabF in YFF-1 mutant to recover the mobility, and compared the swarming ability of wild type, YFF-1 mutant and mutant with plasmid pUCP18Gm-fabF. The change of fatty acids composition was analyzed using gas chromatography to explain the difference of swarming ability.Swarming ability disappeared in YFF-1 mutant and was recovered in YFF-1 with plasmid pUCP18Gm-fabF. Gas chromatography analysis revealed that fatty acids composition changed in YFF-1. The cis-vaccinate acid (C18:1delta11) content decreased from 33.6% to 8.9%, and the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (UFA: SFA) was deduced from 0.96 to 0.74. The recovery of cis-vaccinate acid content was 20.9% and UFA:SFA 1.09 after expression of fabF.Expression level of FabF played an important role in regulating swarming ability of PAO1. The decrease of cis-vaccinate acid content and unsaturation degree of fatty acids, especially the sharp decrease of cis-vaccinate acid, may be vital causes of swarming ability disappearance in YFF-1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216387>Lipid profile changes in erythrocyte membranes of women with diagnosed GDM.</a></h1><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a glucose intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy. It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty acid profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic acid significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the oleic acid and  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic acid levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis- concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty acid profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22427892>Conversion of t11t13 CLA into c9t11 CLA in Caco-2 cells and inhibition by sterculic oil.</a></h1><p>Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), and principally c9t11 CLA, are suspected to have numerous preventive properties regarding non-infectious pathologies such as inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis and several types of cancer. C9t11 CLA is produced in the rumen during biohydrogenation of linoleic acid, but can also be synthesized in mammalian tissues from trans- (C18:1 t11) through the action of delta-9 desaturase (D9D). For several years, it is also known that c9t11 CLA can be synthesized from conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), i.e. c9t11c13 CLnA and c9t11t13 CLnA. This study aimed at investigating to which extent and by which route c9t11 CLA can be produced from another isomer of CLA, the t11t13 CLA that is structurally very similar to c9t11t13 CLnA, in Caco-2 cells.Caco-2 cells were incubated for 24 h with 20 µmol/l of t11t13 CLA in the absence or presence of sterculic oil used as an inhibitor of D9D. Caco-2 cells were able to convert t11t13 CLA into c9t11 CLA, and c9t11t13 CLnA was formed as an intermediate compound. In the presence of sterculic oil, the production of this intermediate was decreased by 46% and the formation of c9t11 CLA was decreased by 26%. No other metabolite was detected.These results not only highlight the conversion of t11t13 CLA into c9t11 CLA but demonstrate also that this conversion involves first a desaturation step catalysed by D9D to produce c9t11t13 CLnA and then the action of another enzyme reducing the double bond on the Δ13 position.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27334716>Identification of the oleic acid ethanolamide (OEA) isomer cis- ethanolamide (VEA) as a highly abundant 18:1 fatty acid ethanolamide in blood plasma from rats and humans.</a></h1><p>The endocannabinoid system is important in various physiological , especially the regulation of food intake. It consists of endocannabinoids like 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) or the fatty acid ethanolamide archachidonoyl-ethanolamide (AEA) with binding affinity to cannabinoid receptors. Further, fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEAs) influence the endocannabinoid system without affecting cannabinoid receptors by using independent physiological . Among FAEAs, oleic acid ethanolamide (OEA) gained importance because of its promising ability to reduce food intake. By ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS), we detected a chromatographically separated molecule in plasma samples from rats and humans with identical mass and fragmentation patterns as those of OEA. Via synthesis and extensive analysis of ethanolamides of different cis/trans- and position isomers of oleic acid (cis9-18:1), we could identify the unknown molecule as  (cis11-18:1) ethanolamide (VEA).

The objective of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between circulating concentrations of individual FAs and T2D incidence among Japanese adults. We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 4754 employees, aged 34-69 y, who attended a comprehensive health checkup in 2008-2009 and donated blood samples for the Hitachi Health Study. During 5 y of follow-up, diabetes was identified on the basis of plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and self-report. Two controls matched to each case by sex, age, and date of checkup were randomly chosen by using density sampling, resulting in 336 cases and 678 controls with FA measurements. GC was used to measure the FA composition in serum phospholipids. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs after adjusting for potential confounders. We examined the association of T2D risk with 25 different individual and combinations of FAs. T2D risk was positively associated with serum dihomo-γ-linoleic acid concentration (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.11; trend = 0.02) and inversely associated with Δ5-desaturase activity (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.99; trend = 0.02), independent of body mass index (BMI). There were also inverse associations between T2D risk with serum total n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic acid, and -, but these were attenuated and became nonsignificant after adjustment for BMI. Serum n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were not associated with T2D risk. T2D risk was associated with circulating concentrations of the n-6 PUFA dihomo-γ-linoleic acid and Δ5-desaturase activity but not with n-3 PUFA or SFA concentrations in Japanese adults.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315997>Trans Fatty Acids Suppress TNF-α-Induced Inflammatory Gene Expression in Endothelial (HUVEC) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HepG2) Cells.</a></h1><p>Trans fatty acids (TFA) intake has been linked to cardiovascular diseases and liver diseases; yet the effect of TFA on inflammation remains controversial. Accordingly, the objective of this paper was to determine the in vitro effects of TFA on inflammatory gene expression. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were treated for 24 h with either trans- (tVA), trans-palmitoleic acid (tPA) or elaidic acid (EA) at concentrations of 5-150 µM, or with a mixture of tVA and tPA (150/50 µM). All TFA were highly incorporated into cell membranes, as determined by gas chromatography, representing 15-20% of total fatty acids in HUVEC and 3-8% in HepG2 cells. Incorporation of EA, a common industrial TFA, increased the ratio of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), a key enzyme involved in fatty acid . Ruminant TFA, including tVA, tPA and the mixture of tVA and tPA, significantly reduced the TNF-α-induced gene expression of TNF, VCAM-1 and SOD2 in HUVEC, as well as TNF and IL-8 in HepG2 cells. EA also decreased inflammatory gene expression in HUVEC, but not in HepG2 cells. The inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ did not influence the effects of TFA on gene expression. Overall, physiological and supraphysiological concentrations of TFA, especially tVA and tPA, prevented inflammatory gene expression in vitro. This effect is independent of PPAR-γ activation and may be due to an alteration of fatty acid  in cell membranes caused by the high incorporation of TFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077002>Palmitoleic (16:1 cis-9) and cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11) acid alter lipogenesis in bovine adipocyte cultures.</a></h1><p>Our objectives were to: (1) confirm elongation products of palmitoleic acid (16:1 cis-9) elongation in vitro using stable isotopes and (2) evaluate if exogenous supplementation of palmitoleic acid, elongation products, or both are responsible for decreased desaturation and lipogenesis rates observed with palmitoleic acid supplementation in bovine adipocytes. Stromal vascular cultures were isolated from adipose tissue of two beef carcasses, allowed to reach confluence, held for 2 days, and differentiated with a standard hormone cocktail (day 0). On day 2, secondary differentiation media containing 1 of 4 fatty acid treatments [0 μM fatty acid (control), or 150 μM palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic, or cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11)] was added for 4 days. On day 6, cells were incubated with [(13)C] 16:1, [(13)C] 2, or [(13)C] 18:0 to estimate elongation, lipogenic, and desaturation rates using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Enrichment of [(13)C] 18:1 cis-11 confirmed 18:1 cis-11 is an elongation product of 16:1. Additionally, [(13)C] label was seen in 20:1 cis-13 and cis-9, cis-11 CLA. Synthesis of [(13)C] 16:0 from [(13)C] 2 was reduced (P < 0.05) in palmitoleic acid and cis--treated compared with control cells following 36 h incubation. By 12 h of [(13)C] 18:0 incubation, cells supplemented with palmitoleic acid had reduced (P < 0.05) [(13)C] 18:1 cis-9 compared with all other treatments. Gene expression and fatty acid results support isotopic data for lipogenesis and desaturation. Therefore, palmitoleic acid is actively elongated in vitro and its elongation product, cis-, can also reduce lipogenesis. However, inhibition of desaturation can be directly attributed to palmitoleic acid and not its elongation products, 18:1 cis-11 or 20:1 cis-13.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27372435>Radical formation in the FMN-photosensitized reactions of unsaturated fatty acids bearing double bonds at different positions.</a></h1><p>Although the reaction mechanisms through which flavin mononucleotide works as an endogenous photosensitizer have been investigated (Baier et al., 2006; Edwards and Silva, 2001; Pajares et al., 2001; Criado et al., 2003; Massad et al., 2008) [23-27], few studies have been performed for the reactions of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids. To examine the reactions of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids bearing a double bond at different positions, an electron spin resonance, a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance and a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass spectrometry were employed. The control reaction mixtures contained 25μmolL(-1) of flavin mononucleotide, 1.0mmolL(-1) of FeSO4(NH4)2SO4, 10mmolL(-1) of cholic acid, 30mmolL(-1) of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1molL(-1) of α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone in deuterium oxide. In addition, it also contained 4.3mmolL(-1) of one of the following: (z)-, (z)-6-octadecenoic acid, (z)-9-octadecenoic acid or (z, z)-9, 12-octadecadienoic acid. The control reaction mixtures without FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone were exposed to the visible light at 436nm (7.8Jcm(-2)). After the irradiation, α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was added. The reactions started from adding FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and performed at 25°C for 1min. Electron spin resonance measurements of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent signals (α(N)=1.58mT and α(Hβ)=0.26mT). High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent peaks at the retention times of 31.1min {(z)-6-octadecenoic acid}, 39.6min {(z)-9-octadecenoic acid}, 44.9min {(z)-} and 40.2min {(z, z)-9, 12-octadecadienoic acid}. High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed that 4-carboxybutyl, 7-carboxyheptyl and 9-carboxynonyl radicals formed in the control reaction mixtures of (z)-6-octadecenoic acid, (z)-9-octadecenoic acid {or (z, z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid} and (z)-, respectively. The 4-carboxybutyl, 7-carboxyheptyl and 9-carboxynonyl radicals are all generated through β-scission of alkoxy radicals formed on carboxyl ends of the double bonds of the unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, we could reveal reactive sites of unsaturated fatty acids in the photosensitized reaction of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids bearing a double bond at different positions.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) and overall reactive uptake coefficients (γ) values were derived according to the changes in absorbance from infrared spectra. Results have shown reaction rates are highly dependent on structures of unsaturated fatty acids. Cis-isomer has faster reaction kinetics than trans-isomer, and conjugated system between CC and CO bonds can greatly inhibit reactivity. Also, it is found that a longer carbon chain length between CC bond and COOH group or a shorter chain length between CC bond and last carbon seemingly enhances reaction kinetics. In addition, changes in redox activity and hydrophilicity of oleic acid samples before and after exposure ozone have been reported for the first time. Results have revealed that ozone-initiated heterogeneous reaction can markedly increase redox activity and hydrophilicity of unsaturated carboxylic acids.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

FADS1 and FADS2 code for enzymes required for highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) biosynthesis, but FADS3 function remains elusive. We generated the first Fads3 knockout (KO) mouse with an aim to characterize its  phenotype and clues to in vivo function. All mice (wild type (WT) and KO) were fed facility rodent chow devoid of HUFA. No differences in overt phenotypes (survival, fertility, growth rate) were observed. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) levels in the brain of postnatal day 1 (P1) KO mice were lower than the WT (P < 0.05). The ratio of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-3) to DHA in P1 KO liver was higher than in WT suggesting lower desaturase activity. Concomitantly, 20:4n-6 was lower but its elongation product 22:4n-6 was greater in the liver of P1 KO mice. P1 KO liver Fads1 and Fads2 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated whereas expression levels of elongation of very long chain 2 (Elovl2) and Elovl5 genes were upregulated compared to age-matched WT. No Δ13-desaturation of  was observed in liver or heart in WT mice expressing FADS3 as was reported in vitro. Taken together, the fatty acid compositional results suggest that Fads3 enhances liver-mediated 22:6n-3 synthesis to support brain 22:6n-3 accretion before and during the brain growth spurt.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study compared the nutrient composition of retail cow and goat milk (basic solids, fatty acids, minerals, and phytoestrogens) throughout the year and quantified the potential implications on the consumers' nutrient intakes. When compared to cow milk, goat milk demonstrated nutritionally desirable traits, such as lower concentrations of C12:0, C14:0, C16:0 and Na: K ratio, and the higher concentrations of  polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), isoflavones, B, Cu, Mg, Mn, P and I, although the latter may be less desirable in cases of high milk intakes. However, in contrast with nutritional targets, it had lower concentrations of omega-3 PUFA, , lignans, Ca, S and Zn. The extent of these differences was strongly influenced by season and may demonstrate a combination of differences on intrinsic species , and farm breeding/husbandry practices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21787922>Effect of solar radiation and flaxseed supplementation on milk production and fatty acid profile of lactating ewes under high ambient temperature.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of protection from solar radiation and whole flaxseed supplementation on milk yield and milk fatty acid profile in lactating ewes exposed to high ambient temperature. The experiment was conducted during summer and involved 40 ewes divided into 4 groups. The ewes were either exposed (not offered shade) or protected from solar radiation (offered shade). For each solar radiation treatment, ewes were supplemented with whole flaxseed or not. Milk samples from each ewe were collected at the morning and afternoon milking every week, and analyzed for pH, total protein, casein, fat, and lactose content, somatic cell count, and renneting parameters (clotting time, rate of clot formation, and clot firmness after 30 min). At the beginning of the experiment, and then at d 23 and 44, milk samples were analyzed for milk fatty acids using gas chromatography. Flaxseed supplementation significantly increased milk yield, fat, protein, and casein yields, and somatic cell count, and increased fat and lactose contents of milk. A decrease of saturated fatty acids from C6:0 to C16:0 and an increase of C18:1 trans-11 and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 was observed in milk from flaxseed-supplemented ewes. Flaxseed supplementation decreased saturated fatty acids content and increased total monounsaturated fatty acids content, the total content of isomers of conjugated linoleic acid, and polyunsaturated fatty acids content in milk. Flaxseed also increased the α-linolenic acid content of milk. As a result, milk from supplemented groups showed an increase in n-3 fatty acid content. Flaxseed supplementation decreased short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids, and increased long-chain fatty acid content of milk. On average, flaxseed supplementation increased the C18:2 cis-9,trans-11/C18:1 trans-11 Δ(9)-desaturase index starting from d 23 of the experiment, in correspondence with the highest C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 content of milk from flaxseed-supplemented ewes. Flaxseed decreased atherogenic and thrombogenic indices of milk. Protection from solar radiation during summer did not improve yield and composition of ewe milk. Nevertheless, milk from ewes exposed to solar radiation showed decreased long-chain fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids contents, and in particular, decreased , rumenic acid, and total conjugated linoleic acid contents.Copyright © 2011 American Dairy Science Association.

Few prospective studies have used fatty acid biomarkers to assess associations with type 2 diabetes.We investigated associations of major circulating SFAs [palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0)] and MUFA [oleic acid (18:1n-9)] in the DNL pathway with  risk factors and incident diabetes in community-based older U.S. adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We secondarily assessed other DNL fatty acid biomarkers [myristic acid (14:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), and  (18:1n-7)] and estimated dietary SFAs and MUFAs.In 3004 participants free of diabetes, plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured in 1992, and incident diabetes was identified by medication use and blood glucose. Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with  risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and insulin resistance (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas oleic acid showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each). During 30,763 person-years, 297 incident diabetes cases occurred. With adjustment for demographics and lifestyle, palmitic acid (extreme-quintile HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.83; P-trend = 0.001) and stearic acid (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41; P-trend = 0.006) were associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas oleic acid was not significantly associated. In secondary analyses,  was inversely associated with diabetes (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83; P-trend = 0.005). Other fatty acid biomarkers and estimated dietary SFAs or MUFAs were not significantly associated with incident diabetes.In this large prospective cohort, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were associated with higher diabetes risk, and  was associated with lower diabetes risk.

Pasture and dietary lipid supplementation have been reported to be reliable strategies in ruminant nutrition, in order to increase the content of α-linolenic acid (ALA), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and  (VA), and decrease SFA in milk fat. In the present study, we aimed at verifying whether consumption of a sheep cheese, naturally enriched in ALA, CLA and VA, would modify the plasma lipid and endocannabinoid profiles in mildly hypercholesterolaemic subjects. A total of forty-two adult volunteers (nineteen males and twenty-three females) with diagnosed mildly hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol 5·68-7·49 mmol/l) were randomly assigned to eat 90 g/d of a control or enriched cheese for 3 weeks, with a cross-over after 3 weeks of washout. Plasma lipids, endocannabinoids, adipokines and inflammatory markers were measured. The intake of enriched cheese significantly increased the plasma concentrations of CLA, VA, the n-3 fatty acids ALA and EPA, and more remarkably decreased that of the endocannabinoid anandamide. LDL-cholesterol decreased significantly (7%). No changes were detected in the levels of inflammatory markers; however, a significant correlation was found between the plasma levels of anandamide and leptin. The control cheese modified none of the parameters measured. The results obtained do not support the view that intake of dairy fat is detrimental to hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Indeed, they show that a naturally enriched cheese possesses beneficial properties, since it ameliorates the plasma lipid profile, and more remarkably reduces endocannabinoid biosynthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572061>Cellular toxicity of dietary trans fatty acids and its correlation with ceramide and diglyceride accumulation.</a></h1><p>High fatty acid (FA) levels are deleterious to pancreatic β-cells, largely due to the accumulation of biosynthetic lipid intermediates, such as ceramides and diglycerides, which induce ER stress and apoptosis. Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of lipid intermediates and the severity of cell damage. Our findings reveal important  characteristics of TFAs that might underlie a long term toxicity and hence deserve further investigation.Copyright © 2018.

Considering the effect of interactions between food and age on , here we depict the lipid framework of 12 tissues isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats fed standard rodent chow over 1 year, an age below which animals are commonly studied. The aim is to define relevant markers of lipid  influenced by age in performing a fatty acid (FA) and dimethylacetal profile from total lipids. First, our results confirm impregnation of adipose and muscular tissues with medium-chain FA derived from maternal milk during early infancy. Secondly, when animals were switched to standard croquettes, tissues were remarkably enriched in n-6 FA and especially 18:2n-6. This impregnation over time was coupled with a decrease of the desaturation index and correlated with lower activities of hepatic Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases. In parallel, we emphasize the singular status of testis, where 22:5n-6, 24:4n-6, and 24:5n-6 were exceptionally accumulated with growth. Thirdly, 18:1n-7, usually found as a discrete FA, greatly accrued over the course of time, mostly in liver and coupled with Δ9-desaturase expression. Fourthly, skeletal muscle was characterized by a surprising enrichment of 22:6n-3 in adults, which tended to decline in older rats. Finally, plasmalogen-derived dimethylacetals were specifically abundant in brain, erythrocytes, lung, and heart. Most notably, a shift in the fatty aldehyde moiety was observed, especially in brain and erythrocytes, implying that red blood cell analysis could be a good indicator of brain plasmalogens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687443>The anti-inflammatory effect of 10-oxo-trans- (KetoC) on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.</a></h1><p>There is rapidly developing interest into the role of several anti-inflammatory agents to resolve inflammation in periodontal disease. A bioactive polyunsaturated fatty acid, 10-oxo-trans- (KetoC), is known to have various beneficial physiological effects; however, the effect of KetoC on inflammation remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of KetoC on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, and explored the intracellular mechanism responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects.RAW 264.7 cells were pre-treated with or without KetoC, and then stimulated with or without P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. Levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific antagonists for G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)40 and GPR120 were used to clarify the receptor for KetoC. The intracellular mechanism was investigated using western blotting analysis to separate nuclear and cytosolic NF-κB p65 protein.KetoC (5 μmol/L) was not toxic to RAW 264.7 cells, and significantly reduced the expression of TNFα and IL-6 mRNA and protein, and IL-1β mRNA. No protein production of IL-1β was observed. Additionally, when bound to GPR120, KetoC trended to downregulate nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels. However, the antagonist for GPR40 failed to diminish the action of KetoC.KetoC suppressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β via NF-κB p65, by binding to its receptor GPR120. KetoC is a promising candidate in future studies as a bioactive anti-inflammatory agent in treating periodontal disease.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Forty-four lactating German Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods composed of 13 d of adaptation to diets followed by an 8-d sampling phase. Experimental diets offered as total mixed ration consisted of a constant forage-to-concentrate ratio (75:25) with target proportions of RCS to maize silage of 15:60 (RCS), 30:45 (RCS), 45:30 (RCS), and 60:15 (RCS) on a dry matter basis. Increasing the level of RCS in the diet was accompanied by a reduction of linoleic acid content in the diet and decreased linearly the proportions of linoleic acid in the milk up to 4%. Proportions of α-linolenic acid in milk increased 2-fold with RCS compared with RCS, which resulted from the linear increase in α-linolenic acid intake with incremental levels of RCS.  in the milk fat was reduced by 24%. Rumenic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid) considered to be a human health promoter, was also decreased by 22%. Reduced rumenic acid in the milk fat was probably due to a reduced amount of  produced in the rumen and, consequently, to the low amount of  to be desaturated to rumenic acid in the mammary gland by Δ-desaturase. Oleic acid was enriched in the milk fat, although the dietary concentration of oleic acid decreased. Stearic acid proportions remained constant with increasing levels of RCS. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased by 12%, and the long-chain FA proportions increased linearly with increasing levels of RCS. Myristic acid was reduced linearly, but palmitic acid remained constant. Saturated FA was reduced linearly by 2%. Branched-chain FA, which are presumed to possess anticarcinogenic properties, were reduced to a small extent only (quadratic effect). We conclude that replacing maize silage with RCS appears to alter milk FA composition by reducing linoleic acid intake and ruminal biohydrogenation. Feeding RCS represents a strategy to increase intake of α-linolenic acid in dairy cows. However, because changes in the FA profile show positive as well as negative effects, no distinct conclusions can be drawn with regard to human health benefits.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that plasma and erythrocyte MUFA levels are associated with cardiometabolic disorders, including CVD, T2D, and  syndrome (MS). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified seven loci for plasma and erythrocyte palmitoleic and oleic acid levels in populations of European origin. To identify additional MUFA-associated loci and the potential functional variant at each locus, we performed ethnic-specific GWAS meta-analyses and trans-ethnic meta-analyses in more than 15,000 participants of Chinese and European ancestry. We identified novel genome-wide significant associations for  at  and  [log(Bayes factor) ≥ 8.07] and for gondoic acid at  and  [log(Bayes factor) ≥ 6.22], and also observed improved fine-mapping resolutions at  and  loci.

(VA) and elaidic acid (EA) are the predominant trans monoenes in ruminant fats and vegetable oil, respectively. Here, we investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by VA and EA on primary rat ventricular myofibroblasts (rVF). The MTT assay demonstrated that both VA and EA (200μM, 0-72 h) reduced cell viability in rVF (P<0.001). The FACS assay confirmed that both VA and EA induced apoptosis in rVF, and this was concomitant with elevation in cleaved caspase-9, -3 and -7, but not caspase-8. VA and EA decreased the expression ratio of Bcl2:Bax, induced Bax translocation to mitochondria and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ). BAX and BAX/BAK silencing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) inhibited VA and EA-induced cell death compared to the corresponding wild type cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that VA and EA also induced macroautophagosome formation in rVF, and immunoblot analysis confirmed the induction of several autophagy markers: LC3-β lipidation, Atg5-12 accumulation, and increased beclin-1. Finally, deletion of autophagy genes, ATG3 and ATG5 significantly inhibited VA and EA-induced cell death (P<0.001). Our findings show for the first time that trans fat acid (TFA) induces simultaneous apoptosis and autophagy in rVF. Furthermore, TFA-induced autophagy is required for this pro-apoptotic effect. Further studies to address the effect of TFA on the heart may reveal significant translational value for prevention of TFA-linked heart disease.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Trans fatty acids might play their atherogenic effects through lipid  alteration of vascular cells. Accumulation of lipids in vascular smooth muscle cells is a feature of atherosclerosis and a consequence of lipid  alteration. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (scd1) catalyses the production of monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g. oleic acid) and its expression is associated with lipogenesis induction and with atherosclerosis development. We were interested in analysing the regulation of delta-9 desaturation rate and scd1 expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) exposed to cis and trans C18:1 fatty acid isomers (cis-9 oleic acid, trans-11  or trans-9 elaidic acid) for 48 h at 100 μM. Treatment of HASMC with these C18:1 fatty acid isomers led to differential effects on delta-9 desaturation; oleic acid repressed the desaturation rate more potently than trans-11 , whereas trans-9 elaidic acid increased the delta-9 desaturation rate. We then correlated the delta-9 desaturation rate with the expression of scd1 protein and mRNA. We showed that C18:1 fatty acids controlled the expression of scd1 at the transcriptional level in HASMC, leading to an increase in scd1 mRNA content by trans-9 elaidic acid treatment, whereas a decrease in scd1 mRNA content was observed with cis-9 oleic acid and trans-11  treatments. Altogether, this work highlights a differential capability of C18:1 fatty acid isomers to control scd1 gene expression, which presumes of different consequent effects on cell functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21615837>Fatty acid composition of ruminal bacteria and protozoa, and effect of defaunation on fatty acid profile in the rumen with special reference to conjugated linoleic acid in cattle.</a></h1><p>Objectives of this study were to compare fatty acid (FA) composition of ruminal bacterial (B) and protozoal (P) cells, and to investigate effect of protozoa on FA profile in the rumen of cattle. Three cows were used to prepare ruminal B and P cells. Four faunated and three defaunated cattle (half-siblings) were used to study effect of protozoa on ruminal FA profile. Proportions of C16:0 and C18:0 in total fatty acids in B cells were 20.7% and 37.4%, whereas those in P cells were 33.4% and 11.6%, respectively. Proportions of trans- (VA) and cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in B cells were 3.9% and 1.0%, and those in P cells were 5.5% and 1.6%, respectively, being higher in P cells. Proportions of C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 in P cells were two to three times higher than in B cells. Proportions of unsaturated fatty acids, VA and CLA in B cells of faunated cattle were higher than those of defaunated. VA and CLA in the ruminal fluid of faunated were also 1.6 to 2.5 times higher than those of defaunated. This tendency was similar for cell-free fraction of ruminal fluid. These results indicate that protozoa contribute greatly in VA and CLA production in the rumen.© 2011 The Authors.

The quadruple mutant (QM, dga1Δ lro1Δ are1Δ are2Δ) deficient in enzymes responsible for triacylglycerol and steryl ester synthesis has been previously shown to be highly sensitive to exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. We have found that cis- accumulated during cultivation in the QM cells but not in the corresponding wild type strain. This accumulation was accompanied by a reduction in palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) content in the QM cells that is consistent with the proposed formation of cis- by elongation of palmitoleic acid. Fatty acid analysis of individual lipid classes from the QM strain revealed that cis- was highly enriched in the free fatty acid pool. Furthermore, production of cis- was arrested if the mechanism of fatty acids release to the medium was activated. We also showed that exogenous cis- did not affect viability of the QM strain at concentrations toxic for palmitoleic or oleic acids. Moreover, addition of cis- to the growth medium provided partial protection against the lipotoxic effects of exogenous oleic acid. Transformation of palmitoleic acid to cis- is thus a rescue mechanism enabling S. cerevisiae cells to survive in the absence of triacylglycerol synthesis as the major mechanism for unsaturated fatty acid detoxification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24954070>Identification of caleosin and two oleosin isoforms in oil bodies of pine megagametophytes.</a></h1><p>Numerous oil bodies of 0.2-2 μm occupied approximately 80% of intracellular space in mature pine (Pinus massoniana) megagametophytes. They were stably isolated and found to comprise mostly triacylglycerols as examined by thin layer chromatography analysis and confirmed by both Nile red and BODIPY stainings. Fatty acids released from the triacylglycerols of pine oil bodies were mainly unsaturated, including linoleic acid (60%), adrenic acid (12.3%) and  (9.7%). Proteins extracted from pine oil bodies were subjected to immunological cross-recognition, and the results showed that three proteins of 28, 16 and 14 kDa were detected by antibodies against sesame seed caleosin, sesame oleosin-L and lily pollen oleosin-P, respectively. Complete cDNA fragments encoding these three pine oil-body proteins, tentatively named caleosin, oleosin-L and oleosin-G, were obtained by PCR cloning and further confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. Consistently, phylogenetic tree analyses showed that pine caleosin was closely-related to the caleosin of cycad megagametophyte among known caleosin sequences. While pine oleosin-L was found clustered with seed oleosin isoforms of angiosperm species, oleosin-G was distinctively grouped with the oleosin-P of lily pollen. The oleosin-G identified in pine megagametophytes seems to represent a new class of seed oleosin isoform evolutionarily close to the pollen oleosin-P.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Thioesterases play a significant dual role in the triacylglyceride and wax ester biosynthesis by either providing or removing acyl-CoA from this pathway. Therefore, 4 different thioesterase genes were cloned from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and expressed in Escherichia coli to investigate their contribution to free fatty acids (FFAs) accumulation. Overexpression of the genes tesA' (a leaderless form of the gene tesA) and tesC resulted in increased accumulation of FFAs when compared with the host E. coli strain. Overexpression of tesA' showed a 1.87-fold increase in production of long-chain fatty acids (C16 to C18) over the host strain. Unlike TesC and the other investigated thioesterases, the TesA' thioesterase also produced shorter chain FFAs (e.g., myristic acid) and unsaturated FFAs (e.g., cis- (18:1Δ11)). A comparison of the remaining 3 A. baylyi ADP1 thioesterases (encoded by the tesB, tesC, and tesD genes) revealed that only the strain containing the tesC gene produced statistically higher levels of FFAs over the control, suggesting that it possesses the acyl-ACP thioesterase activity. Both E. coli strains containing the tesB and tesD genes produced levels of FFAs similar to those of the plasmid-free control E. coli strain, which indicates that TesB and TesD lack the acyl-ACP thioesterase activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24070791>Trans-vaccenate is Δ13-desaturated by FADS3 in rodents.</a></h1><p>Fatty acid desaturases play critical roles in regulating the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in all biological kingdoms. As opposed to plants, mammals are so far characterized by the absence of desaturases introducing additional double bonds at the methyl-end site of fatty acids. However, the function of the mammalian fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene remains unknown. This gene is located within the FADS cluster and presents a high nucleotide sequence homology with FADS1 (Δ5-desaturase) and FADS2 (Δ6-desaturase). Here, we show that rat FADS3 displays no common Δ5-, Δ6- or Δ9-desaturase activity but is able to catalyze the unexpected Δ13-desaturation of trans-vaccenate. Although there is no standard for complete conclusive identification, structural characterization strongly suggests that the Δ11,13-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) produced by FADS3 from trans-vaccenate is the trans11,cis13-CLA isomer. In rat hepatocytes, knockdown of FADS3 expression specifically reduces trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturation. Evidence is presented that FADS3 is the first "methyl-end" fatty acid desaturase functionally characterized in mammals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26286349>In vitro fermentation of nuts results in the formation of butyrate and c9,t11 conjugated linoleic acid as chemopreventive metabolites.</a></h1><p>The consumption of foods rich in dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as nuts can contribute to a healthy diet. Therefore, the formation of fermentation end-products which might exert chemopreventive effects regarding colon cancer was investigated after an in vitro simulated digestion and fermentation of nuts using human fecal microbiota.Fermentation supernatants (FS) and pellets (FP) were obtained after an in vitro fermentation of hazelnuts, almonds, macadamia, pistachios and walnuts. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids (BA) in FS as well as fatty acids in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of SCFA compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty acid methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA deoxycholic-/iso-deoxycholic acid (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal microbiota to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite. In addition, the production of butyrate and reduction in potential carcinogens such as secondary BA and lipid peroxidation products might contribute to the protective effects of nuts regarding colon cancer development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726670>[cis and trans conformational changes of bacterial fatty acids in comparison with analogs of animal and vegetable origin].</a></h1><p>The conditions of the formations of trans isomers of fatty acids, depending on the method of processing and storage of the raw material of microbial, plant and animal origin, were investigated.

Recently, the different effects of industrial trans fatty acids (elaidic acid, 9t18:1) and ruminant trans fatty acids (, 11t18:1) on CHD have been reported in epidemiological and animal studies, however, the mechanism was not fully studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the underlying mechanism by which 9t18:1 and 11t18:1 affect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) . We found that 9c11t-CLA modulated the  of HUVECs induced by 9t18:1 and 11t18:1. Fatty acid composition, pro-inflammatory factors, phosphorylation of MAPKs, and the TLR4 level in HUVECs altered by 11t18:1 induction, collectively suggest that the bio-conversion of 11t18:1 to 9c11tCLA might be the cause why 11t18:1 and 9t18:1 have distinct influences on endothelial injuries.

Special focus is put on feeds available and research carried out in Thailand. A differentiated consideration concerning the value of different n-3 fatty acids and isomers of CLAs is necessary. In ruminants, it is difficult to enrich the meat with n-3 fatty acids due to the extensive ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids, but several possibilities to enhance the proportion of the most desired CLA isomer, rumenic acid, exist. By contrast, pork and poultry meat can be easily enriched with n-3 fatty acids. With purified CLA sources, CLAs also can be enhanced, but it is difficult to achieve this exclusively for rumenic acid. An interesting approach might consist in supplementing the CLA precursor  instead. Possible constraints for meat quality and in the fatty acid levels achieved are outlined.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Under these feeding conditions, the rumen wall, and the rumen epithelial cells (REC) in particular, are directly exposed to high amounts of CLA. This study determined the effect of CLA on the fatty acid (FA)  of REC and expression of genes known to be modulated by FA. Cultured REC were incubated with c9t11, t10c12, and the structurally similar FA linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), and trans- (TVA) for 48 h at a concentration of 100 µM. Cellular FA levels were determined by gas chromatography. Messenger RNA expression levels of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4 were quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Fatty acid evaluation revealed significant effects of CLA, LA, OA, and TVA on the amount of FA metabolites of β-oxidation and elongation and of metabolites related to desaturation by SCD. The observed changes in FA content point (among others) to the ability of REC to synthesize c9t11 from TVA endogenously. The mRNA expression levels of SCD identified a decrease after CLA, LA, OA, or TVA treatment. In line with the changes in mRNA expression, we found reduced amounts of C16:1n-7 cis-9 and C18:1n-9 cis-9, the main products of SCD. The expression of MCT1 mRNA increased after c9t11 and t10c12 treatment, and CLA c9t11 induced an upregulation of MCT4. Application of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α antagonist suggested that activation of PPARα is involved in the changes of MCT1, MCT4, and SCD mRNA expression induced by c9t11. Participation of PPARγ in the changes of MCT1 and SCD mRNA expression was shown by the application of the respective antagonist.

Oilseed rape () is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to . We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid  between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.© 2017 The author(s).

A GC stationary phase based on a highly polar ionic liquid (IL) was selected, aimed to enhance the separation of isomeric FAMEs with particular emphasis on positional and geometrical isomers of monounsaturated 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acyl chains. The occurrence of 18:1 cis-Δ(9) (oleic) acid, a positional isomer of the well-known and most predominant 18:1 cis-Δ(11) (cis-vaccenic) acid, has been demonstrated here for the first time. Furthermore a methyl branched 18:1 FA was also identified and its structure tentatively assigned as 11-methyl-Δ(12)-octadecenoic acid (most likely as trans isomer). The unprecedented observation about 18:1 cis-Δ(9) FA occurrence in R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 is, even indirectly, supported by a biosynthetic pathway postulated with the aid of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The concurrent presence of 16:1 cis-Δ(7) and 18:1 cis-Δ(9) FAs suggested the existence of parallel and/or complementary processes to those invoked for the formation of most common 16:1 cis-Δ(9) and 18:1 cis-Δ(11) FAs.

FADS3 may therefore be the first methyl-end trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase functionally characterized in mammals, but the proof of this concept is so far lacking in vivo. The present study therefore aimed at investigating further the putative in vivo synthesis of trans11,cis13-CLA from dietary trans- in rodents. During one week of pregnancy and two weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed two diets either high (10.0% of fatty acids and 3.8% of  intake) or low (0.4% of fatty acids and 0.2% of  intake) in trans-. The trans11,cis13-CLA was specifically detected, formally identified and reproducibly quantified (0.06% of total fatty acids) in the mammary gland phospholipids of lactating female rats fed the high trans--enriched diet. This result was consistent with FADS3 mRNA expression being significantly higher in the lactating mammary gland than in the liver. Although the apparent metabolic conversion is low, this physiological evidence demonstrates the existence of this new pathway described in the lactating mammary gland and establishes the FADS3 enzyme as a reliable mammalian trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is not yet clear whether these effects are attributed to its endogenous partial conversion to c9,t11-CLA, which is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. We compared the cytokine reducing potential of tVA to c9,t11-CLA in human T-helper (Th) cells as a main source of cytokine production during inflammation. Secondly, we assessed whether a bioconversion of tVA to c9,t11-CLA via stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) encoded activity takes place in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to relate the outcomes of intracellular cytokine measurement to the degree of conversion. TVA reduced the percentage of both IL-2 and TNF-α expressing Th cells significantly, but to a lesser extent compared to c9,t11-CLA, as determined by flow cytometry after alloreactive stimulation of PBMC. Pre-treatment with the selective PPARγ antagonist T0070907 largely re-established the IL-2 and TNF-α positive Th cell population in both tVA and c9,t11-CLA treated cultures. Interestingly, while the portion of tVA dose-dependently increased within the cellular lipid fraction, the initially marginal amount of c9,t11-CLA remained unaltered. However, SCD mRNA although abundantly expressed in PBMC was not regulated by tVA. Conclusively, these results suggest that the cytokine reducing effect of tVA in human T cells is independent of c9,t11-CLA, since no bioconversion occurred. Moreover, the data provide evidence that tVA mechanistically acts in a manner similar to c9,t11-CLA.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Subcutaneous fat, including all layers, was removed from the LM for fatty acid profile analysis, and ground beef patties (80:20) were produced with lean from the brisket and fat from the plate for retail color analysis (1, 2, 4, 7 d). Supplemental fat source did not influence feedlot performance for any of the traits measured (P > 0.12) or any carcass traits related to yield, quality, or LM color at the 12th- to 13th-rib interface (P > 0.15). Supplemental fat source did not affect Warner-Bratzler shear force or any sensory traits (P > 0.20), but LM steaks became more tender as postmortem aging time increased up to 14 d (P < 0.01). During retail display of LM steaks and beef patties, the only difference was LM steaks from ECS were darker (lower L* value) than TAL or TAL/ECS steaks (P < 0.02). As display time increased, LM steak and beef patty objective and subjective color deteriorated (P < 0.01). Although feeding FFECS compared with tallow increased linoleic acid (C18:2(n-6)) in both intramuscular and subcutaneous fat (P < 0.04), this did not lead to an increase in total CLA content (P > 0.90). Full-fat extruded cottonseed pellets are interchangeable with tallow in heifer finishing diets without impacting feeding performance, meat quality, shelf life color, or CLA content of adipose sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25702712>Structure and reaction mechanism of a novel enone reductase.</a></h1><p>Recently, a novel gut-bacterial fatty acid , saturation of polyunsaturated fatty acid, that modifies fatty acid composition of the host and is expected to improve our health by altering lipid  related to the onset of  syndrome, was discovered in Lactobacillus plantarum AKU 1009a. Enzymes constituting the pathway catalyze sequential reactions of free fatty acids without CoA or acyl carrier protein. Among these enzymes, CLA-ER was identified as an enone reductase that can saturate the C=C bond in the 10-oxo-trans- (KetoB) to produce 10-oxo-octadecanoic acid (KetoC). This enzyme is the sole member of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase family that has been identified to exert an enone reduction activity. Here, we report both the structure of holo CLA-ER with cofactor FMN and the KetoC-bound structure, which elucidate the structural basis of enone group recognition of free fatty acids and provide the unique catalytic mechanism as an enone reductase in the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase family. A 'cap' structure of CLA-ER underwent a large conformational change upon KetoC binding. The resulting binding site adopts a sandglass shape and is positively charged at one side, which is suitable to recognize a fatty acid molecule with enone group. Based on the crystal structures and enzymatic activities of several mutants, we identified C51, F126 and Y101 as the critical residues for the reaction and proposed an alternative electron transfer pathway of CLA-ER.

After 80 days of age calves also had access to concentrate (maximum of 3 kg/day), while mothers did not. At slaughter, Limousin calves were heavier (P<0.01) and provided better carcass yield (P<0.05) and conformation (P<0.001) than Tudanca calves. Tudanca beef provided higher fat content (P<0.05) was less tough (P<0.05), and was scored as more tender and juicy (P<0.1) with higher acceptability than Limousin beef (P<0.1). In general, Tudanca had a better fatty acid profile than Limousin beef, especially in terms of the content of polyunsaturated (P<0.05), long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (P<0.05) and their n-6/n-3 ratios (P<0.1), as well as  (P<0.1) and the overall trans-18:1 isomer profile.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This increase may be associated with obesity. It has been suggested that trans-fatty acids (TFAs) play an important role in non-communicable diseases.We examined the link between liver tests, fatty liver index (FLI) and plasma TFAs. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of adiposity on this link.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was used to obtain the data on TFAs and liver function biomarkers. We took account of complex NHANES data, masked variance and weighting methodology.Of the 4252 participants, 46.4% were men. The mean age was 50.6 years overall; 51.3 years for men and 49.8 years for women (p = 0.206). In a fully adjusted model (demographic and clinical factors), FLI increased as trans-9-hexadecenoic acid and trans- levels increased; FLI was 38.1 and 42.3 for the first quarter (Q1) of trans-9-hexadecenoic acid and trans-, respectively, reaching 65.1 and 69.3 for the highest quarters (Q4) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Multivariable logistic regression showed for all four studied TFAs, the likelihood of NAFLD (determined by FLI) increased with increasing TFAs levels (quartiles) in a stepwise manner (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Based on moderation analysis, a strong impact of body mass index (BMI) on the link between FLI and TFAs was observed.Our results suggest a direct significant association between plasma TFAs, liver tests and NAFLD (assessed by FLI). Furthermore, BMI was shown to mediate this relationship. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding TFAs consumption in order to minimize cardiometabolic risk.Copyright © 2018.

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of RO and flaxseed oil (FO) supplementation on nutrients digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters and rumen FA profile of dairy cows. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of four treatments for 8 weeks, including basal diet (CON) or the basal dietary supplemented with 4% RO, 4% FO or 2% RO plus 2% FO on a DM basis. Compared with CON, dietary oil supplementation improved the total tract apparent digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fibre and ether extracts ( P 0.05), whereas oil groups significantly changed the volatile fatty acid (VFA) profile by increasing the proportion of propionate whilst decreasing total VFA concentration, the proportion of acetate and the ratio of acetate to propionate ( P 0.05). In addition, dietary oil supplementation increased the total unsaturated FA proportion in the rumen by enhancing the proportion of trans-11 C18:1  (VA), cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) ( P &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that dietary supplementation with RO and FO could improve nutrients digestibility, ruminal fermentation and ruminal FA profile by enhancing the VA, cis-9, trans-11 CLA and ALA composition of lactating dairy cows. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of RO in livestock production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865506>Synthesis of the suspected trans-11,cis-13 conjugated linoleic acid isomer in ruminant mammary tissue by FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of .</a></h1><p>The octadecadienoic conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer with trans-11 and cis-13 double bonds (trans-11,cis-13 CLA) has been described in ruminant milk. For now, this specific CLA is suspected to derive exclusively from ruminal biohydrogenation of dietary α-linolenic acid. However, in rodents, the fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene was recently shown to code for an enzyme able to catalyze the unexpected Δ13-desaturation of , producing a Δ11,13-CLA with all the structural characteristics of the trans-11,cis-13 isomer, although no commercial standard exists for complete conclusive identification. Because the FADS3 gene has already been reported in bovine animals, we hypothesized in the present study that an alternative direct FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of  in mammary tissue may therefore co-exist with α-linolenic acid biohydrogenation to explain the final ruminant milk trans-11,cis-13 CLA presence. Here, we first confirm that the FADS3 gene is present in ruminant mammal genomic sequence databases. Second, we demonstrate that the Δ11,13-CLA found in milk fat and the highly probable trans-11,cis-13 CLA isomer produced by rodent FADS3 possess exactly the same structural characteristics. Then, we show that bovine mammary MAC-T and BME-UV epithelial cells express both FADS3 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) mRNA and are able to synthesize both the suspected trans-11,cis-13 CLA and cis-9,trans-11CLA (rumenic acid) isomers when incubated with . Finally, the concomitant presence of the suspected trans-11,cis-13 CLA isomer with FADS3 mRNA was shown in goat mammary tissue, whereas both were conversely very low or even absent in goat liver. Therefore, this study provides several lines of evidence that, by analogy with rumenic acid, trans-11,cis-13 CLA may originate both from ruminal biohydrogenation and from direct FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of  in mammary tissue.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

A standard dairy fat (SDF) with a 70% SFA content and a naturally enriched dairy fat (EDF) in vaccenic, rumenic and α-linolenic acids and low in SFA (54%) have been examined in a 4-week repeated dose oral toxicity study as a daily dose of 2000 mg/kg bw by gavage in rats. Comparisons were established with a third group of rats (control) which did not receive fat administration. Both fats were well tolerated, and no adverse events or mortality were observed during the treatment nor after a 2-week observation period. EDF and SDF did not cause significant differences with respect to a control group in body weight gain, food consumption, clinical observations, organ weight ratios, histopathological findings and most of the hematological and biochemical parameters including total cholesterol and cholesterol fractions in plasma. In rats treated with SDF, a significant increase of triglycerides was observed as compared to the control group. By contrast, in rats treated with EDF, a significant decrease in triglycerides was detected. EDF orally administered to rats was safe, and no treatment-related toxicity was detected.

In this cross-sectional study the proportions of erythrocyte membrane fatty acids (EMFA) and the concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and adiponectin were measured and their confounder-adjusted associations examined in 1373 randomly selected Finnish men aged 45-70 years participating in the population based Metsim study in Eastern Finland. The sum of n-6 EMFAs, without linoleic acid (LA), was positively associated with concentrations of CRP and IL-1Ra (r partial=0.139 and r partial=0.115, P<0.001). These associations were especially strong among lean men (waist circumference <94 cm; r partial=0.156 and r partial=0.189, P<0.001). Total n-3 EMFAs correlated inversely with concentrations of CRP (r partial=-0.098, P<0.001). Palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) correlated positively with CRP (r partial=0.096, P<0.001). Cis- (18:1n-7) was associated with high concentrations of adiponectin (r partial=0.139, P<0.001). In conclusion, n-6 EMFAs, except for LA, correlated positively with the inflammatory markers.

Studies have shown that iNKT cells are required for protective responses to Gram-positive pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and that these cells recognize bacterial diacylglycerol antigens presented by CD1d, a non-classical antigen-presenting molecule. The combination of a lipid backbone containing an unusual fatty acid, , as well as a glucose sugar that is weaker or not stimulatory when linked to other lipids, is required for iNKT cell stimulation by these antigens. Here we have carried out structural and biophysical studies that illuminate the reasons for the stringent requirement for this unique combination. The data indicate that  bound to the CD1d groove orients the protruding glucose sugar for TCR recognition, and it allows for an additional hydrogen bond of the glucose with CD1d when in complex with the TCR. Furthermore, TCR binding causes an induced fit in both the sugar and CD1d, and we have identified the CD1d amino acids important for iNKT TCR recognition and the stability of the ternary complex. The studies show also how hydrogen bonds formed by the glucose sugar can account for the distinct binding kinetics of the TCR for this CD1d-glycolipid complex. Therefore, our studies illuminate the mechanism of glycolipid recognition for antigens from important pathogens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21816049>Influence of in vitro supplementation with lipids from conventional and Alpine milk on fatty acid distribution and cell growth of HT-29 cells.</a></h1><p>To date, the influence of milk and dairy products on carcinogenesis remains controversial. However, lipids of ruminant origin such as conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are known to exhibit beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of milk lipids of different origin and varying quality presenting as free fatty acid (FFA) solutions on cellular fatty acid distribution, cellular viability, and growth of human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29).FAME of conventional and Alpine milk lipids (MLcon, MLalp) and cells treated with FFA derivatives of milk lipids were analyzed by means of GC-FID and Ag+-HPLC. Cellular viability and growth of the cells were determined by means of CellTiter-Blue®-assay and DAPI-assay (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride), respectively.Supplementation with milk lipids significantly decreased viability and growth of HT-29 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. MLalp showed a lower SFA/MUFA ratio, a 8 fold increased CLA content, and different CLA profile compared to MLcon but did not demonstrate additional growth-inhibitory effects. In addition, total concentration and fatty acid distribution of cellular lipids were altered. In particular, treatment of the cells yielded highest amounts of two types of milk specific major fatty acids (μg FA/mg cellular protein) after 8 h of incubation compared to 24 h; 200 μM of MLcon (C16:0, 206 ± 43), 200 μM of MLalp (C18:1 c9, (223 ± 19).  (C18:1 t11) contained in milk lipids was converted to c9,t11-CLA in HT-29 cells. Notably, the ratio of t11,c13-CLA/t7,c9-CLA, a criterion for pasture feeding of the cows, was significantly changed after incubation for 8 h with lipids from MLalp (3.6 - 4.8), compared to lipids from MLcon (0.3 - 0.6).Natural lipids from conventional and Alpine milk showed similar growth inhibitory effects. However, different changes in cellular lipid composition suggested a milk lipid-depending influence on cell sensitivity. It is expected that similar changes may also be evident in other cell lines. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a varied impact of complex milk lipids on fatty acid distribution in a colon cancer cell line.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28444841>The effect of grapeseed oil on performance, rumen fermentation, antioxidant status and subcutaneous adipose fatty acid profile in lambs.</a></h1><p>This experiment was carried out to examine the effect of grapeseed oil (GSO) on performance, rumen fermentation, antioxidant status and subcutaneous adipose fatty acid (FA) profile in lambs. Eighteen Baluchi lambs, 196 ± 14 days of age and 39.8 ± 1.7 kg body weight, were randomly assigned to three experimental diets: (i) diet without GSO (control), (ii) diet containing 2% of GSO (GSO2) and (iii) diet containing 4% of GSO (GSO4) for 42 days. Results showed that the experimental diets had no significant effect on dry matter intake and performance (p > 0.05). The supplemented diets with GSO had no effect on pH and NH -N of rumen fluid (p > 0.05), but GSO4 increased (p = 0.003) the concentration of propionic acid and reduced (p = 0.002) the concentration of acetate acid compared to the control. Inclusion 4% of GSO to the diet increased total antioxidant activity and decreased malondialdehyde in serum and muscle (p < 0.001). The level of blood glutathione peroxidase in diets containing GSO was higher than control diet (p = 0.02), but diets had no effect on superoxide dismutase in blood and muscle tissues (p > 0.05). The concentration of , rumenic acid and linoleic acid and thus polyunsaturated fatty acid in subcutaneous fat was affected by experimental diets (p < 0.001), as control had the lowest amount of these FAs and GSO4 had the highest amount of them. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of GSO up to 4% improves the antioxidant status and adipose fatty acid profile in lambs without effects on performance.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22417701>Cis- and the Framingham risk score predict chronic kidney disease: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA).</a></h1><p>Data on the associations of fatty acids with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are sparse.We performed a cross-sectional study of 2792 men and women from the MESA cohort of African-American, Caucasian, Chinese and Hispanic adults without known cardiovascular disease.

Plasma samples collected at 12-18 weeks (MIROS cohort; n=65) and 38-41 weeks of pregnancy (CHUL cohort; n=21) were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis followed by liquid-liquid extraction in order to extract total F2-isoPs for quantification by HPLC-MS/MS. Several positive correlations were found between F2-isoPs and TFA, measured by GC-FID in plasma phospholipids, such as 6t-18:1, 9t-18:1 and 9t,12c-18:2 (r>0.306; p<0.045). Despite its low level, the 9t,12c-18:2 trans isomer, known to be associated to cardiovascular diseases, showed the most significant correlations with F2-isoPs. No correlation was observed between F2-isoPs and 9t-16:1 or 11t-18:1. In summary, this study suggests either a concomitant phenomenon or a competition between lipid peroxidation and cis-trans isomerisation of the cis precursor fatty acid in vivo during pregnancy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Palmitoleic acid (POA) has been described as an anti-inflammatory FA. However, its effects on ECs are underexplored. This study compares the effects of POA with those of palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) on EC inflammatory responses.EAHy926 cells (EC lineage) are exposed to PA, OA, or POA, and stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Associated with the FA's own incorporation, PA induces a twofold increase in arachidonic acid, while POA increases the amount of cis-. PA, but not OA, enhances the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in response to TNF-α. In contrast, POA decreases production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 compared to PA. TNF-α increases surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression previously decreased by POA. TNF-α stimulation increases the expression of NFκB, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, MCP-1, and IL-6 genes and reduces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α gene. PA enhances the expression of MCP-1, IL-6, and COX-2 genes, while POA downregulates these genes, decreases expression of NFκB, and upregulates PPAR-α gene expression.POA has anti-inflammatory effects on ECs stimulated with TNF-α and may counter endothelial dysfunction.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The expression resulted in the conversion of palmitic acid (16:0) to 16:1Δ9 in soybean seeds. 16:1Δ9 and its elongation product cis- (18:1Δ11) were increased to 17 % of the total fatty acids by plastid-targeted expression of the enzyme.

Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a fat-free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high-fat diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of obesity, fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of oleic acid (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23522678>Physicochemical properties of Scamorza ewe milk cheese manufactured with different probiotic cultures.</a></h1><p>The present study was undertaken to produce functional Scamorza cheese from Gentile di Puglia ewe milk by incorporating probiotic strains into the cheese matrix and to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of Scamorza ewe milk cheese.

Sixteen Malagueña goats were used in a 4×4 Latin square experiment with 21-d periods and 4 goats per treatment. The basal diet comprised 30% alfalfa hay and 70% pelleted concentrate. Experimental treatments were control (basal diet without added oil) and the basal diet supplemented with 48g/d of high oleic sunflower oil (HOSFO), regular sunflower oil (RSFO), or linseed oil (LO). Dry matter intake and body weight were not affected by treatments. Milk production was higher in HOSFO treatment and milk fat content was higher in RSFO and LO treatments, although no differences in milk energy production or milk renneting properties were found. The RSFO and LO treatments increased the proportion of  in milk fat more so than the HOSFO diet, and rumenic acid followed the same pattern. The content of trans10-18:1 remained low in all experimental diets (<0.7% of total fatty acid methyl esters) although HOSFO and RSFO diets increased it. The variations in the fatty acid profiles observed with the 4 diets, mainly the unsaturated fatty acid isomer contents, are extensively discussed. Compared with that in the control diet, the n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio in milk fat substantially decreased with the LO, increased with RSFO, and did not change with HOSFO. The addition of moderate amounts of LO to the diets of dairy goats has favorable effects on milk fatty acid composition from the point of view of the human consumer, without negative effects on animal performance.Copyright © 2011 American Dairy Science Association.

We aimed to evaluate the association of plasma TFAs levels (elaidic acid, , palmitelaidic acid, and linoelaidic acid) with mortality.Utilizing 1999-2000 Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and linked mortality data, we performed a cohort study with 1456 participants and used Cox proportional hazards models and penalized smoothing spline plots to elucidate the relationships between TFAs and all-cause, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer mortality.During 16,034 person-years of follow-up, a total of 221 deaths occurred. In the multivariate model, including mutual adjustment for the 4 TFA subtypes, elaidic acid associated with higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18 to 3.40, fourth quartiles versus second quartiles) and CVD mortality (HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.07 to 2.50, per 10 units increase). Higher palmitelaidic acid levels were associated with increased cancer mortality (HR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.09 to 7.81, fourth quartiles versus second quartiles). A J-shaped pattern was observed in the regression curve of elaidic acid and all-cause mortality, as well palmitelaidic acid and cancer mortality.Plasma elaidic acid levels are associated with higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality, and palmitelaidic acid levels are associated with higher cancer mortality in later life. Further studies are needed to investigate current inconsistent results in this field and the possible underlying mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704429>Effects of coconut oil on glycemia, inflammation, and urogenital microbial parameters in female Ossabaw mini-pigs.</a></h1><p>Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether  induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10), arachidonic acid and plasma insulin, but increased levels of . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of  did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty acid metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of  and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25962361>Effects of dietary trans-9 octadecenoic acid, trans-11  and cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid in mice.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of dietary trans fatty acids in mice. Following the administration of a 0.5/100 g diet of trans-9 octadecenoic acid (EA), trans-11  (TVA) or cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for 4 weeks, the body weights and the weights of the liver, testis and mediastinal adipose tissue (MAT) of the animals gradually decreased (P<0.05). The EA group exhibited the lowest levels of magnesium and triglycerides (P<0.05). CLA increased villus length (P<0.05), while EA and TVA decreased villus length (P<0.05). The TVA group exhibited the lowest levels of low-density lipoprotein and tumor necrosis factor-α (P<0.05). Taken together, EA, TVA and CLA affected the physiological conditions of mice differently. The potential effects of three well-known fatty acids, including trans-9 octadecenoic acid (EA), trans-11  (TVA) and cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), in animals or humans remain to be elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, 32 animals were randomly divided into four groups and administered a 0.5/100 g diet of EA, TVA or CLA for 4 weeks. The results demonstrated that the body weights and the weights of the liver, testis and mediastinal adipose tissue (MAT) of the animals gradually decreased (P<0.05). Blood was collected individually via the external jugular veins and the EA group exhibited the lowest levels of magnesium and triglycerides (P<0.05). CLA increased villus length (P<0.05), while EA and TVA decreased villus length (P<0.05). The TVA group exhibited the lowest levels of low-density lipoprotein and tumor necrosis factor-α (P<0.05). Taken together, EA, TVA and CLA affected the physiological conditions of mice differently and these may further our understanding of the various effects of these fatty acids on animals and humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453308>Jacaric acid and its octadecatrienoic acid geoisomers induce apoptosis selectively in cancerous human prostate cells: a mechanistic and 3-D structure-activity study.</a></h1><p>Plant-derived non-essential fatty acids are important dietary nutrients, and some are purported to have chemopreventive properties against various cancers, including that of the prostate. In this study, we determined the ability of seven dietary C-18 fatty acids to cause cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis in various types of human prostate cancer cells. These fatty acids included jacaric and punicic acid found in jacaranda and pomegranate seed oil, respectively, three octadecatrienoic geometric isomers (alpha- and beta-calendic and catalpic acid) and two mono-unsaturated C-18 fatty acids (trans- and cis-). Jacaric acid and four of its octadecatrienoic geoisomers selectively induced apoptosis in hormone-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (PC-3) human prostate cancer cells, whilst not affecting the viability of normal human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). Jacaric acid induced concentration- and time-depedent LNCaP cell death through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic  resulting in cleavage of PARP-1, modulation of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and increased cleavage of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Moreover, activation of a cell death-inducing signalling cascade involving death receptor 5 was observed. Jacaric acid induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells by activation of the intrinsic pathway only. The spatial conformation cis, trans, cis of jacaric and punicic acid was shown to play a key role in the increased potency and efficacy of these two fatty acids in comparison to the five other C-18 fatty acids tested. Three-dimensional conformational analysis using the PubChem Database (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) showed that the cytotoxic potency of the C-18 fatty acids was related to their degree of conformational similarity to our cytotoxic reference compound, punicic acid, based on optimized shape (ST) and feature (CT) similarity scores, with jacaric acid being most 'biosimilar' (ST(ST-opt)=0.81; CT(CT-opt)=0.45). This 3-D analysis of structural similarity enabled us to rank geoisomeric fatty acids according to cytotoxic potency, whereas a 2-D positional assessment of cis/trans structure did not. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that nutrition-derived non-essential fatty acids have chemopreventive biological activities and Exhibit 3-D structure-activity relationships that could be exploited to develop new strategies for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer regardless of hormone dependency.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on lipid , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), lauric acid (C12:0), tridecanoic acid (C13:0), myristic acid (C14:0), pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and behenic acid (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (palmitoleic acid (C16:1), oleic acid (18:1w9), trans- (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (linoleic acid (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6), arachidonic acid (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Six lactating goats were divided into 2 groups. One group was given an intravenous bolus injection of TVA (150mg) twice daily over 4 d; the other group received saline injections. Treatment with TVA increased the concentration of cis-9,trans-11 CLA and TVA in goat milk. Additionally, TVA treatment increased the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in mammary tissue. Using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 3 proteins affected by infusions of TVA were identified. Proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit α type 5 (PSMA5) was upregulated, whereas peroxiredoxin-1 and translationally controlled tumor protein 1 were downregulated in TVA-treated animals compared with the vehicle-injected controls. Only the effect of TVA on PSMA5 could be confirmed by Western blot analysis. To further explore the regulation of PSMA5 in mammary epithelial cells when TVA is converted into CLA, we used a differentiated bovine mammary epithelial cell line treated with TVA for 6h. Changes in cis-9,trans-11 CLA concentrations and mRNA expression patterns of both SCD and PSMA5 were monitored. The concentration of cis-9,trans-11 CLA increased after TVA treatment. The mRNA expression level of PSMA5 was significantly elevated to 6h, but SCD mRNA expression only increased in 2h after TVA treatment. These results indicate that PSMA5 is highly expressed in goat mammary tissue and bovine mammary epithelial cells when TVA is converted into CLA. Our data suggest that PSMA5 protein is associated with CLA biosynthesis in mammary tissue.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The proportions of adipose tissue fatty acids not synthesised endogenously in humans, such as TFA, usually correlate well with the dietary intake. Hence, the use of these biomarkers may provide a more accurate measure of habitual TFA intake than that obtained with dietary questionnaires. The objective of the present study was to investigate the associations between the proportions of specific TFA in adipose tissue and subsequent changes in weight and waist circumference (WC). The relative content of fatty acids in adipose tissue biopsies from a random sample of 996 men and women aged 50-64 years drawn from a Danish cohort study was determined by GC. Baseline data on weight, WC and potential confounders were available together with information on weight and WC 5 years after enrolment. The exposure measures were total trans-octadecenoic acids (18:1t), 18:1 Δ6-10t,  (18:1 Δ11t) and rumenic acid (18:2 Δ9c, 11t). Data were analysed using multiple regression with cubic spline modelling. The median proportion of total adipose tissue 18:1t was 1.52% (90% central range 0.98, 2.19) in men and 1.47% (1.01, 2.19) in women. No significant associations were observed between the proportions of total 18:1t, 18:1 Δ6-10t,  or rumenic acid and changes in weight or WC. The present study suggests that the proportions of specific TFA in adipose tissue are not associated with subsequent changes in weight or WC within the exposure range observed in this population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22078495>Association of an ACSL1 gene variant with polyunsaturated fatty acids in bovine skeletal muscle.</a></h1><p>The intramuscular fat deposition and the fatty acid profiles of beef affect meat quality. High proportions of unsaturated fatty acids are related to beef flavor and are beneficial for the nutritional value of meat. Moreover, a variety of clinical and epidemiologic studies showed that particularly long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from animal sources have a positive impact on human health and disease.To screen for genetic factors affecting fatty acid profiles in beef, we initially performed a microsatellite-based genome scan in a F(2) Charolais × German Holstein resource population and identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for fatty acid composition in a region on bovine chromosome 27 where previously QTL affecting marbling score had been detected in beef cattle populations. The long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) gene was identified as the most plausible functional and positional candidate gene in the QTL interval due to its direct impact on fatty acid  and its position in the QTL interval. ACSL1 is necessary for synthesis of long-chain acyl-CoA esters, fatty acid degradation and phospholipid remodeling. We validated the genomic annotation of the bovine ACSL1 gene by in silico comparative sequence analysis and experimental verification. Re-sequencing of the complete coding, exon-flanking intronic sequences, 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and partial promoter region of the ACSL1 gene revealed three synonymous mutations in exons 6, 7, and 20, six noncoding intronic gene variants, six polymorphisms in the promoter region, and four variants in the 3' UTR region. The association analysis identified the gene variant in intron 5 of the ACSL1 gene (c.481-233A>G) to be significantly associated with the relative content of distinct fractions and ratios of fatty acids (e.g., n-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated, n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, trans ) in skeletal muscle. A tentative association of the ACSL1 gene variant with intramuscular fat content indicated that an indirect effect on fatty acid composition via modulation of total fat content of skeletal muscle cannot be excluded.The initial QTL analysis suggested the ACSL1 gene as a positional and functional candidate gene for fatty acid composition in bovine skeletal muscle. The findings of subsequent association analyses indicate that ACSL1 or a separate gene in close proximity might play a functional role in mediating the lipid composition of beef.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692006>Short communication: Changes under low ambient temperatures in the milk lipodome and metabolome of mid-lactation cows after dehorning as a calf.</a></h1><p>Horns are living tissue and cows can use their horns for thermoregulatory purposes. We investigated the effect of the presence of horns on the metabolome of milk serum and lipidome of milk fat, to assess the physiological effect of dehorning. Milk sampling took place at low ambient temperatures of -6 to 2°C. Horned and dehorned cows were kept in a mixed herd of Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows. The hypothesis was that horned cows needed to increase their metabolism to compensate for additional heat loss through the presence of their horns. No differences were observed in milk yield, milk solids, and somatic cell counts between horned and dehorned cows. For the milk metabolome, horned cows showed an upregulation of several glucogenic AA that could be transformed into glucose for  supply and a downregulation of sugar intermediates and γ-glutamylcysteine compared with dehorned cows. The fatty acid (FA) composition in horned cows showed a shift toward decreased odd medium-chain FA (C7:0, C9:0, and C11:0) and increased cis- (C18:1n-7 cis-11) and stearidonic acid (C18:4n-3). The changes in milk composition related to additional heat loss in horned cows indicate a competition in C3 metabolism for glucose synthesis and de novo FA synthesis under cold stress.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Characterization of the natural products in C. esculenta was done using the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) technique. The experiment lasted for 3 months.GC-MS analysis of methanol/chloroform extract of the flour of C. esculenta indicated the presence of eight compounds, namely hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (0.43%), octadecanoic acid (20.91%), 9,12-octadecadienoyl chloride (0.77%),  methyl ester (2.12%), 9-octadecenoic acid (64.37%), 3-hexadecyloxycarbonyl-5-(2-hydroxylethyl)-4-methylimidazolium(1.36%), hexanedioic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl)ester (1.36%) and 3,5-di-t-butyl phenol (3.27%). The total phenolic content of C. esculenta was 15.15 ± 0.35 mg Gallic Acid Equivalence/g and it was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the total flavonoid (8.50 ± 0.42 mg Quercetin Equivalence/g) and condensed tannin (4.40 ± 0.14 mg Catechin Equivalence/g) contents, respectively. C. esculenta possessed strong antioxidant capacity though it was lower than that of standard quercetin.Results showed that C. esculenta possesses strong antioxidant activity and also contains some important bioactive compounds that justify its medicinal properties as used in ethno-medicine.</p></html>
