Given the demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of endocannabinoids, the present study was designed to test whether anandamide (AEA) or its metabolites diminish NLRP3 inflammasome activation and prevent podocyte injury and associated glomerular damage during hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcys). AEA (100 μM) inhibited Hcys-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cultured podocytes, as indicated by elevated caspase-1 activity and interleukin-1β levels, and attenuated podocyte dysfunction, as shown by reduced vascular endothelial growth factor production. These effects of AEA were inhibited by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (CEL). In mice in vivo, AEA treatment attenuated glomerular NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by hHcys accompanying a folate-free diet, on the basis of inhibition of hHcys-induced colocalization of NLRP3 molecules and increased interleukin-1β levels in glomeruli. Correspondingly, AEA prevented hHcys-induced proteinuria, albuminuria, and glomerular damage observed microscopically. Hcys- and AEA-induced effects were absent in NLRP3-knockout mice. These beneficial effects of AEA against hHcys-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and glomerular injury were not observed in mice cotreated with CEL. We further demonstrated that prostaglandin E2-ethanolamide (), a COX-2 product of AEA, at 10 μM had a similar inhibitory effect to that of 100 μM AEA on Hcys-induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation in cultured podocytes. From these results, we conclude that AEA has anti-inflammatory properties, protecting podocytes from Hcys-induced injury by inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation through its COX-2 metabolite, .Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23542062>Characterisation of the prostaglandin E2-ethanolamide suppression of tumour necrosis factor-α production in human monocytic cells.</a></h1><p>Prostaglandin ethanolamides or prostamides are naturally occurring neutral lipid derivatives of prostaglandins that have been shown to be synthesised in vivo following COX-facilitated oxygenation of arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide). Although the actions of prostaglandins have been extensively studied, little is known about the physiological or pathophysiological effects of prostamides. Since prostaglandin E2 has potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulating actions, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the derivative, prostaglandin E2 ethanolamide (), could modulate the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α in human blood and human monocytic cells and indicate whether this action involved the same receptor systems/signals as PGE2.Whole human blood, monocytes isolated from the blood or the human monocytic cell line THP-1 was incubated with LPS and the level of TNF-α produced was measured by ELISA assay. The actions of  were assessed on the LPS-induced TNF-α release. In addition, in order to ascertain the receptors involved, the levels of cyclic AMP in cells were measured in monocytes and THP-1 cells in response to  and directly compared to those of PGE2. The effect of  on the binding of radiolabelled PGE2 to cells was also measured. Cells were incubated with radiolabelled arachidonic acid and ethanolamine to estimate the production of . potently suppressed TNF-α production in blood, monocytes and the cell line THP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. This occurred via cyclic AMP  as indicated by agents which interfere with these  and also direct ligand binding experiments. It was also shown that the cells were able to endogenously produce .This study reports that  can downregulate the production of TNF-α by human mononuclear cells in response to an immune stimulus, i.e. LPS-activated TLR4, and that this appears to occur via a cAMP-dependent mechanism that most likely involves binding to the EP2 receptor.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are important in the generation and maintenance of . While colitis is associated with upregulated COX-2 -derived prostanoids and nitric oxide (NO), the direct activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines on human colonic neuromuscular function is less clear. This study investigated the effects of IBD-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, TNF-α, IL-1β and LPS on human colonic muscle strip contractility, alone and following inhibition of COX-2 or nitric oxide production. In addition, human colonic epithelial Caco-2 cell monolayers were treated with LPS or COX-2 mediators including prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2α) or their corresponding ethanolamides ( or PGF2α-EA) over 48h and trans-epithelial electrical resistance used to record permeability changes. Longitudinal muscle strips were obtained from healthy colonic resection margins and mounted in organ baths following IL-17, TNF-α, IL-1β and bacterial LPS incubations in an explant setting over 20h. Contraction in response to acetylcholine (ACh) was then measured, before and after either COX-2 inhibition (nimesulide; 10(-5)M) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition (l-NNA; 10(-4)M). None of the cytokine or LPS explant incubations affected the potency or maximum cholinergic contraction in vitro, and subsequent COX-2 blockade with nimesulide revealed a significant but similar decrease in potency of ACh-evoked contraction in control, LPS and cytokine-incubated muscle strips. Pre-treatment with l-NNA provided no functional differences in the potency or maximum contractile responses to ACh in cytokine or LPS-incubated colonic longitudinal smooth muscle. Only PGE2 transiently increased Caco-2 monolayer permeability at 24h, while LPS (10μg/ml) increased permeability over 24-48h. These findings indicate that cholinergic contractility in the human colon can be decreased by the blockade of COX-2 generated excitatory prostanoids, but major pro-inflammatory cytokines or LPS do not alter the sensitivity or amplitude of this contraction ex vivo. While PGE2 transiently increase epithelial permeability, LPS generates a significant and sustained increase in permeability indicative of an important role on barrier function at the mucosal interface.Crown Copyright © 2016.

In the present study we have investigated whether treatment of DU145 human prostate cancer cells affects anandamide (AEA) catabolic pathways. Additionally, we have investigated whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) can regulate the uptake of AEA into cells. Levels of AEA synthetic and catabolic enzymes were determined by qPCR. AEA uptake and hydrolysis in DU145 and RAW264.7 macrophage cells were assayed using AEA labeled in the arachidonic and ethanolamine portions of the molecule, respectively. Levels of AEA, related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), prostaglandins (PG) and PG-ethanolamines (PG-EA) in DU145 cells and medium were quantitated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. TNFα treatment of DU145 cells increased mRNA levels of PTSG2 (gene of COX-2) and decreased the mRNA of the AEA synthetic enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine selective phospholipase D. mRNA levels of the AEA hydrolytic enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase were not changed. AEA uptake in both DU145 and RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by FAAH inhibition, but not by COX-2 inhibition, even in RAW264.7 cells where the expression of this enzyme had greatly been induced by lipopolysaccharide + interferon γ treatment. AEA and related NAEs were detected in DU145 cells, but PGs and  were only detected when the cells had been preincubated with 100 nM AEA. The data demonstrate that in DU145 cells, TNFα treatment changes the relative expression of the enzymes involved in the hydrolytic and oxygenation catabolic pathways for AEA. In RAW264.7 cells, COX-2, in contrast to FAAH, does not regulate the cellular accumulation of AEA. Further studies are necessary to determine the extent to which inflammatory mediators are involved in the abnormal endocannabinoid signalling system in prostate cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26031663>Identification of prostamides, fatty acyl ethanolamines, and their biosynthetic precursors in rabbit cornea.</a></h1><p>Arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide) and pros-taglandin ethanolamines (prostamides) are biologically active derivatives of arachidonic acid. Although available through different precursor phospholipids, there is considerable overlap between the biosynthetic  of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids and anandamide-derived prostamides. Prostamides exhibit physiological actions and are involved in ocular hypotension, smooth muscle contraction, and inflammatory pain. Although topical application of bimatoprost, a structural analog of prostaglandin F2α ethanolamide (PGF2α-EA), is currently a first-line treatment for ocular hypertension, the endogenous production of prostamides and their biochemical precursors in corneal tissue has not yet been reported. In this study, we report the presence of anandamide, palmitoyl-, stearoyl-, α-linolenoyl docosahexaenoyl-, linoleoyl-, and oleoyl-ethanolamines in rabbit cornea, and following treatment with anandamide, the formation of PGF2α-EA, , PGD2-EA by corneal extracts (all analyzed by LC/ESI-MS/MS). A number of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines, precursors of anandamide and other fatty acyl ethanolamines, were also identified in corneal lipid extracts using ESI-MS/MS. These findings suggest that the prostamide and fatty acid ethanolamine  are operational in the cornea and may provide valuable insight into corneal physiology and their potential influence on adjacent tissues and the aqueous humor.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30344089>Eicosanoid pathway expression in bovine endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in response to lipopolysaccharide, interleukin 1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha.</a></h1><p>During endometrial , bovine endometrium responds by increasing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and eicosanoids. The purpose of this study was to establish and characterize an in vitro model of endometrial  using bovine endometrial epithelial (bEEL) and stromal (bCSC) cell lines. We evaluated the effects of the infectious agent (bacterial lipopolysaccharide; LPS) and pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and TNFα) on eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway gene expression and production by bEEL and bCSC cells. Based on concentration-response experiments, the optimal concentrations for responses were 1 μg/mL LPS, 10 ng/mL IL-1β and 50 ng/mL TNFα. Real-time PCR results show that there was an upregulation of relative mRNA expression of PTGS2 when bEEL and bCSC were treated with LPS, IL-1β and TNFα. An increase in PTGES3 expression was observed when bEEL cells were treated with LPS and IL-1β and PTGES2 when treated with IL-1β. In bCSC cells, FAAH relative mRNA was decreased upon treatments. Rate of production of PGE, PGF, PGE-EA and PGF-EA were also determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Our results show that eicosanoid production was increased in both cell lines in response to LPS, IL-1β, and TNFα. We suggest that the characteristics of bEEL and bCSC cell lines mimic the physiological responses found in mammals with endometrial infection, making them excellent in vitro models for intrauterine environment studies.Copyright © 2018 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.

However, the physiological function of COX-2 oxidative metabolites of eCBs is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that PGE2-G, a COX-2 oxidative metabolite of 2-AG, induced a concentration-dependent increase in the frequency ofminiature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, an effect opposite to that of 2-AG. This increase was not inhibited by SR141716, a CB1 receptor antagonist, but was attenuated by an IP3 or MAPK inhibitor. In addition, we also examined the effects of other prostanoids derived from COX-2 oxygenation of eCBs on mIPSCs. PGD2-G, PGF2alpha-G and PGD2-EA, but not  or PGF2alpha-EA, also increased the frequency of mIPSCs. The eCB-derived prostanoid-induced responses appeared to be different from those of corresponding arachidonic acid-derived prostanoids, implying that these effects are not mediated via known prostanoid receptors. We further discovered that the inhibition of COX-2 activity reduced inhibitory synaptic activity and augmented depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), whereas the enhancement of COX-2 augmented the synaptic transmission and abolished DSI. Our results, which show that COX-2 oxidative metabolites of eCBs exert opposite effects to their parent molecules on inhibitory synaptic transmission, suggest that alterations in COX-2 activity will have significant impact on endocannabinoid signalling in hippocampal synaptic activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28258202>The Endocannabinoid Metabolite Prostaglandin E (PGE)-Glycerol Inhibits Human Neutrophil Functions: Involvement of Its Hydrolysis into PGE and EP Receptors.</a></h1><p>The endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol and -arachidonoyl-ethanolamine mediate an array of pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. These effects are related, in part, to their metabolism by eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes. For example, -arachidonoyl-ethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol can be metabolized by cyclooxygenase-2 into PG-ethanolamide (PG-EA) and PG-glycerol (PG-G), respectively. Although PGE is a recognized suppressor of neutrophil functions, the impact of cyclooxygenase-derived endocannabinoids such as PGE-EA or PGE-G on neutrophils is unknown. This study's aim was to define the effects of these mediators on neutrophil functions and the underlying cellular mechanisms involved. We show that PGE-G, but not PGE-EA, inhibits leukotriene B biosynthesis, superoxide production, migration, and antimicrobial peptide release. The effects of PGE-G were prevented by EP/EP receptor antagonist AH-6809 but not the EP antagonist ONO-AE2-227. The effects of PGE-G required its hydrolysis into PGE, were not observed with the non-hydrolyzable PGE-serinol amide, and were completely prevented by methyl-arachidonoyl-fluorophosphate and palmostatin B, and partially prevented by JZL184 and WWL113. Although we could detect six of the documented PG-G hydrolases in neutrophils by quantitative PCR, only ABHD12 and ABHD16A were detected by immunoblot. Our pharmacological data, combined with our protein expression data, did not allow us to pinpoint one PGE-G lipase, and rather support the involvement of an uncharacterized lipase and/or of multiple hydrolases. In conclusion, we show that PGE-G inhibits human neutrophil functions through its hydrolysis into PGE, and by activating the EP receptor. This also indicates that neutrophils could regulate  by altering the balance between PG-G and PG levels in vivo.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16099783>The endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, induces cell death in colorectal carcinoma cells: a possible role for cyclooxygenase 2.</a></h1><p>Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is upregulated in most colorectal cancers and is responsible for  of the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, into prostaglandin-ethanolamides (PG-EAs). The aims of this study were to determine whether anandamide and PG-EAs induce cell death in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells, and whether high levels of COX-2 in CRC cells could be utilised for their specific targeting for cell death by anandamide.We determined the effect of anandamide on human CRC cell growth by measuring cell growth and cell death, whether this was dependent on COX-2 protein expression or enzyme activity, and the potential involvement of PG-EAs in induction of cell death.Anandamide inhibited the growth of CRC cell lines HT29 and HCA7/C29 (moderate and high COX-2 expressors, respectively) but had little effect on the very low COX-2 expressing CRC cell line, SW480. Induction of cell death in HT29 and HCA7/C29 cell lines was partially rescued by the COX-2 selective inhibitor NS398. Cell death induced by anandamide was neither apoptosis nor necrosis. Furthermore, inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase potentiated the non-apoptotic cell death, indicating that anandamide induced cell death was mediated via  of anandamide by COX-2, rather than its degradation into arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Interestingly, both  and PGD2-EA induced classical apoptosis.These findings suggest anandamide may be a useful chemopreventive/therapeutic agent for colorectal cancer as it targets cells that are high expressors of COX-2, and may also be used in the eradication of tumour cells that have become resistant to apoptosis.</p></html>
