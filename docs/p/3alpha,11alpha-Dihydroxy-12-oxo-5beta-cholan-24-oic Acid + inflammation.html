This study was conducted to evaluate the anti- mechanism of Schizonepeta tenuifolia (ST) extract and ST purified chemicals on the PMA plus A23187-induced stimulation of HMC-1 human mast cells. ST, rosmarinic , pulegone, and 2α,3α,24-thrihydrooxylen-12en-28oic  treatment of HMC-1 cells led to significant suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) in a dose dependent manner. In addition, the results of the microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that ST regulates several pathways, including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (CCRI), MAPK, and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. ST may be useful for the treatment of  disease via anti- activity that occurs through inhibition of the CCRI, MAPK, and TLR signaling pathways.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical studies show that intranasal insulin improves memory in AD patients without peripheral hypoglycemia. However, neuroprotective molecular mechanism of the beneficial effect of intranasal insulin in AD pathology is unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the role of intranasal insulin on intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impairment in rats as evaluated in the Morris water maze test. STZ (ICV) treated rats had shown memory impairment along with a significant decrease in IR signaling molecules (IR, pIRS-1, pAkt, and pGSK-3α/β expression) and IDE expression in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Intranasal insulin delivery prevented these changes. Moreover, intranasal insulin was found to inhibit significantly glial cell activation (GFAP and Iba-1 expression), neuroinflammation (COX-2 expression, NFκB translocation, TNF-α, and IL-10 level) and amyloidogenic protein expression (BACE-1 and Aβ expression) in STZ (ICV)-injected rats. STZ (ICV)-induced caspase activation and postsynaptic neurotoxicity were also prevented by treatment with intranasal insulin. Our findings reveal that insulin has the neuroprotective effect and clearly signifies the potential use of intranasal insulin delivery for the treatment of AD.

As reported by clinical observations, variation in hormonal levels might alter disease susceptibility and progression. Specifically, decreased levels of testosterone in males are reported to be permissive for disease onset. Accordingly, testosterone seems to exert protective effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this context, it is important to highlight that testosterone is further metabolized into 17β-estradiol or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In this study, we aimed to explore the protective effects of DHT treatment in EAE Dark Agouti rats (i.e. an experimental model showing a protracted relapsing EAE). Data obtained 45 days after EAE induction showed that DHT exerts a beneficial effect on clinical scores, coupled with decreased gliosis (i.e. glial fibrillary acidic protein and major histocompatibility complex of class II staining) and  (i.e. translocator protein 18 kDa, interleukin-1β, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB expression) in the spinal cord. Moreover, parameters linked to oxidative stress and tissue damage, like thiobarbituric -reactive substance levels and Bcl-2-associated X protein expression, and to mitochondrial activity (i.e. content of mitochondrial DNA and proteins), were improved after DHT administration. This neuroactive steroid may be further metabolized into 3α- or 3β-diol. However, assessment of the levels of these metabolites after DHT treatment seems to suggest that the protective effects observed here are due to DHT itself. Altogether, the present results indicate that DHT was effective in reducing the severity of chronic EAE and, consequently, may represent an interesting perspective for multiple sclerosis treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20932756>Lupane-type triterpenoids from the steamed leaves of Acanthopanax koreanum and their inhibitory effects on the LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.</a></h2><p>Two new compounds, (20R)-3α-hydroxy-29-dimethoxylupan-23,28-dioic  (1) and 3α-hydroxylup-20(29)-ene-23,28-dioic  28-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl] ester (2), and eight known lupane-type triterpenoids (3-10), were isolated from steamed leaves of Acanthopanax koreanum.

They respond to a large number of chemoattractants, but their response to epithelial cell-derived human beta-defensins (hBD) has not been investigated. Here we report that hBD-2, but not hBD-1, is a specific chemoattractant for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-treated human neutrophils. The optimal concentration required for maximal chemotactic activity was 5 micro g/ml. The effect of hBD-2 on neutrophils was dependent on the G-protein-phospholipase C pathway, as demonstrated by inhibition by pertussis toxin and U-73122. In addition, ligand-receptor analysis indicated that the binding of hBD-2 was markedly inhibited by macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-, a specific and unique ligand for CCR6. Furthermore, anti-CCR6 antibody could almost completely suppress the cell migration induced by hBD-2, suggesting that hBD-2 mainly utilizes CCR6 as a functional receptor. Thus, our finding that hBD-2 is a potent chemoattractant for human neutrophils through specific receptors provides a novel mechanism by which this peptide contributes to the host defence system by recruiting neutrophils to /infection sites. This also suggests an important link between epithelial cell-derived antibacterial peptides and neutrophils during infection or .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21473903>Apoptogenic activity of 2α,3α-dihydroxyurs-12-ene-28-oic  from Prunella vulgaris var. lilacina is mediated via mitochondria-dependent activation of caspase cascade regulated by Bcl-2 in human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells.</a></h2><p>The dried spikes of Prunella vulgaris var. lilacina (Labiatae) have been used for traditional herbal medicine to treat fever, , dropsy, gonorrhea and cancer in Korea, Japan and China. The present study evaluated the apoptotic effect of 2α,3α-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic  (DHURS), purified from the dried spikes on human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells.Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) loss, apoptotic change of the cell cycle, and apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometric analysis. Mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspase cascade were determined by Western blot analysis. Caspase-12 activity and caspase-3 activity were assayed using the Fluorometric Assay Kit and the Colorimetric Assay Kit, respectively.Treatment of Jurkat T cells with DHURS (20-25 μg/ml) caused cytotoxicity and apoptotic DNA fragmentation along with Δψm loss, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9, -7, -3, and -8, and PARP degradation. However, these apoptotic events were abrogated by overexpression of Bcl-2. Pretreatment of the cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), the caspase-9 inhibitor (z-LEHD-fmk) or the caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) to prevent DHURS-induced apoptosis could block the activation of caspase-7 and -8, and PARP degradation, but not the Δψm loss, activation of caspase-9 and -3. Both FADD- and caspase-8-positive wild-type Jurkat clone A3, FADD-deficient Jurkat clone I2.1, and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat clone I9.2 exhibited similar susceptibilities to the cytotoxicity of DHURS, excluding an involvement of Fas/FasL system in triggering the apoptosis. The IC(50) value for Jurkat T cells was ∼22 μg/ml, whereas that for human peripheral T cells was 25 μg/ml.These results indicate that DHURS-induced apoptogenic activity in Jurkat T cells, which was less potent in normal peripheral T cells, was mediated by Δψm loss, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and -3, leading to activation of caspase-7 and -8, which could be regulated by Bcl-2.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Present study found that miR-19b was significantly downregulated in active Crohn's disease (CD). Using bioinformatics analysis, suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a physiological regulator of innate and adaptive immunity that controls several immuno-inflammatory diseases, was predicted to be a potential target of miR-19b. An inverse correlation between miR-19b and SOCS3 protein levels, but not mRNA, was identified in active-CD intestinal tissue samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-19b in Caco2 cells and HT29 cells, it was experimentally validated that miR-19b is a direct regulator of SOCS3. Using a luciferase reporter assay, it was confirmed that miR-19b directly recognizes the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SOCS3. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-19b decreased SOCS3 expression, leading to increased production of macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) in Caco2 cells. In contrast, knockdown of miR-19b increased SOCS3 and decreased MIP-3α. Finally, intracolonically delivered miR-19b decreased the severity of colitis induced with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic  (TNBS). Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-19b suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting SOCS3 to modulate chemokine production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thereby prevents the pathogenesis of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12879250>Prevention of primary non-function of islet xenografts in autoimmune diabetic NOD mice by anti-inflammatory agents.</a></h2><p>High levels of  locally in the graft during the initial days after transplantation can cause primary non-function (PNF) of grafted xenogeneic islets in NOD mice. The aim of this study was to explore in a model of spontaneous diabetes, the NOD mouse, the potential of anti-inflammatory agents in the prevention of PNF after xenogeneic islet transplantation.Spontaneously diabetic NOD mice were transplanted with 300 rat islets. Animals were treated with acetylsalicylic  (AsA), rofecoxib, TGF-beta or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Intra-graft expression of -related molecules was measured by real time PCR 8 h post-transplantation. At the same time point, plasma nitrite levels were measured.Xenogeneic islets transplanted in control spontaneously diabetic mice resulted in PNF in 16 out of 38 mice (42%). Initial graft loss was not altered by administration of rofecoxib (30%) or TGF-beta (25%). AsA reduced the rate of rapid graft loss to 8% ( p<0.05 vs controls) and administration of IL-1ra even totally prevented PNF (0%, p<0.05 vs controls). Furthermore, all therapies prolonged the mean survival time of xenogeneic islet grafts. The inhibition of PNF by AsA was associated with decreased intra-islet levels of -related molecules (IL-1, TNF-alpha, iNOS, COX-2) and chemokines (MCP-1 and MIP-). Finally, also a diminished production of systemic nitrite levels was observed in AsA- and IL-1ra-treated islet recipients.These data show that treatment with AsA or IL-1ra prevents PNF after islet transplantation in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. Moreover, the involvement of non-specific  is recognized in xenogeneic islet PNF in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22732453>A novel C(28)-hydroxylated lupeolic  suppresses the biosynthesis of eicosanoids through inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A(2).</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids are potent lipid mediators derived from phospholipase (PL)-released arachidonic  (AA) coupled to subsequent metabolism by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/2 or lipoxygenases (LO) which are involved in a variety of homeostatic biological functions and . We have investigated three lupeolic  (LA) from the gum resin of Boswellia carterii for their ability to interfere with eicosanoid biosynthesis in human blood cells. A novel, yet unknown C(28)-hydroxylated LA, that is, 3α-acetoxy-28-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-4β-oic  (Ac-OH-LA) was found to inhibit the biosynthesis of COX-, 5-LO- and 12-LO-derived eicosanoids from endogenous AA in activated platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes from human blood with consistent IC(50) values of 2.3-6.9 μM. In contrast, two other LAs lacking the C(28)-OH moiety were essentially inactive in this respect. Inhibition of eicosanoids by Ac-OH-LA correlated with reduced release of AA in intact cells. When AA was exogenously provided as substrate for cellular eicosanoid biosynthesis the inhibitory effects of Ac-OH-LA were essentially reversed, even though some inhibition of 5-LO and COX-1 product formation still remained. Finally, by means of a cell-free phospholipid hydrolysis assay using human recombinant cytosolic PLA(2)α, we show that Ac-OH-LA may directly interfere with cPLA(2)α activity (IC(50) = 3.6 μM). Together, we identified a novel, naturally occuring C(28)-hydroxylated LA which acts as efficient inhibitor of cPLA(2)α and consequently suppresses eicosanoid biosynthesis in intact cells.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We previously found that mPGES-1 is inhibited by boswellic  (IC50 = 3-30 μM), which are bioactive triterpene  present in the anti-inflammatory remedy frankincense. Here we show that besides boswellic , additional known triterpene  (i.e., tircuallic, lupeolic, and roburic ) isolated from frankincense suppress mPGES-1 with increased potencies.

To further understand the cellular and molecular events that mediate these responses, we characterized the effects of IL-13 on monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCPs) and compared the tissue effects of transgenic IL-13 in mice with wild-type (+/+) and null (-/-) CCR2 loci. Transgenic IL-13 was a potent stimulator of MCP-1, -2, -3, and -5. This stimulation was not specific for MCPs because macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-2, MIP-, thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine, thymus-expressed chemokine, eotaxin, eotaxin 2, macrophage-derived chemokines, and C10 were also induced. The ability of IL-13 to increase lung size, alveolar size, and lung compliance, to stimulate pulmonary , hyaluronic  accumulation, and tissue fibrosis, and to cause respiratory failure and death were markedly decreased, whereas mucus metaplasia was not altered in CCR2(-/-) mice. CCR2 deficiency did not decrease the basal or IL-13-stimulated expression of target matrix metalloproteinases or cathepsins but did increase the levels of mRNA encoding alpha1-antitrypsin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, -2, and -4, and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor. In addition, the levels of bioactive and total TGF-beta(1) were decreased in lavage fluids from IL-13 transgenic mice with -/- CCR2 loci.

Shiya tea (leaves of Adinandra nitida), a traditional Chinese tea, is widely consumed due to its palatable flavor and various curative effects, such as reducing blood pressure and blood lipids, as well as anti-inflammation, etc. However, no relevant research on the antiobesity effects of Shiya tea has been reported. In particular, no health-benefiting compounds, other than flavonoids, in Shiya tea have been reported. Thus, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes have been used as a bioactivity-guided identification model to verify the inhibitory effects of Shiya tea on adipogenesis, as well as to identify antiadipogenic compounds. Four triterpenoid saponins (1-4), including one new compound (2α,3α-dihydroxyursolic  28- O-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester, compound 1), and a flavonoid (5) have been identified using NMR (1D and 2D NMR) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS techniques. Compound 1, the major antiadipogenic constituent with an IC value of 27.6 μg/mL, has been identified for the first time in Shiya tea. To understand the structure-activity relationship, three hydrolytic compounds (1s, 2s, and 5s) were obtained to provide an inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. The inhibitory effect of the triterpenoid (1s) possessing no sugar group decreased significantly, while the flavonoid (5s) also without a sugar group showed increased activity.

The aim of this study was to compare levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in SF, serum and/or EDTA plasma.SF and blood from rats subjected to Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA; n = 48) or monoiodoacetate (MIA; n = 88) monoarthritis and from control rats were collected over time. SF, EDTA plasma and serum were obtained from six individuals with OA of the knee and healthy controls. Levels of IL-6, KC/GRO, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 3α (MIP-3α), IL-1β, TNF and l(+)-lactate were assessed either by immune assay or by a colorimetric method.Elevated levels of biomarkers were shown in monoarthritic animals in SF compared with the control groups, although with considerably lower magnitude in the MIA groups, which also indicated a biphasic pattern. Levels of KC/GRO and MIP-3α in serum from the FCA model and IL-6 in the MIA model followed the pattern of SF. In serum samples from OA individuals, MIP-3α correlated significantly with levels in SF.While we found increased levels of markers in joint fluid and blood, no single systemic biochemical biomarkers that were a common denominator between the animal models and the patient material could be identified. Our data indicate that it is critical to delineate the temporal profile of multiple local and systemic factors in order to pinpoint soluble biomarkers for OA.© The Author 2014.

The use of positive allosteric modulators of these receptors, specifically expressed in the spinal cord, may represent an interesting strategy to limit or block pain expression. In this study, we have used stereoisomers of progesterone metabolites, acting only via non-genomic effects, in order to evaluate the contribution of GlyRs and GABAARs for the reduction of mechanical and thermal heat hypernociception. We show that  neurosteroids were particularly efficient to elevate nociceptive thresholds in naive animal. It also reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal heat hyperalgesia in the carrageenan model of inflammatory pain. This effect is likely to be mediated by GABAA receptors since 3beta isomer was inefficient. More interestingly, 3alpha5beta neurosteroid was only efficient on mechanical allodynia while having no effect on thermal heat hyperalgesia. We characterized these paradoxical effects of 3alpha5beta neurosteroid using the strychnine and bicuculline models of allodynia. We clearly show that 3alpha5beta neurosteroid exerts an antinociceptive effect via a positive allosteric modulation of GABAARs but, at the same time, is pronociceptive by reducing GlyR function. This illustrates the importance of the inhibitory amino  receptor channels and their allosteric modulators in spinal pain processing. Moreover, our results indicate that neurosteroids, which are synthesized in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and have limited side effects, may be of significant interest in order to treat pathological pain symptoms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9862452>Molecular cloning, functional characterization and mRNA expression analysis of the murine chemokine receptor CCR6 and its specific ligand MIP-.</a></h2><p>We have cloned the murine CCR6 receptor and its ligand, the beta-chemokine mMIP-.

NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile  that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause  and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with lithocholic and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death.

Blood incubated with LPS to induce a gross inflammatory response exhibited a time dependent (2 - 12 h) reduction in aggregation to U46619 but maintained a consistent response to collagen. Under these conditions, as in control blood, none of the isoprostanes tested induced aggregation. In fact, the inhibitory actions of isoprostanes on U46619-induced aggregation were enhanced in blood treated with LPS. L-NAME inhibited aggregation induced by U46619 in fresh blood and in blood treated with LPS. In the presence of L-NAME, (with or without LPS) none of the isoprostanes tested induced aggregation but retained their inhibitory action. Thus, in human whole blood the action of 8-iso PGE(1), 8-iso PGE(2), 8-iso PGF(2alpha), 8-iso PGF(), and 8-iso-13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF(2alpha) is antiaggregatory. Moreover, this inhibitory capacity is still apparent and may be enhanced in blood subjected to inflammatory stimulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855729>Evaluation of hepatic integrin αvβ3 expression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model mouse by F-FPP-RGD PET.</a></h2><p>Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which express integrin αvβ3, are a major fibrogenic factor in NASH pathophysiology. F-labeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic  penta-peptide (F-FPP-RGD) has been used as a PET probe for tumors expressing integrin αvβ3. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of PET with F-FPP-RGD to detect hepatic integrin αvβ3 expression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model mice.Thirty-two male C57BL/6 mice aged 6 weeks were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino -defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 3 and 8 weeks. F-FPP-RGD PET imaging of the liver was performed at 3 and 8 weeks after CDAHFD feeding. After PET scanning, levels of hepatic integrin αvβ, 3α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen type 1 alpha 1(col1a1) were measured. Histopathological analysis of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, as well as blood biochemistry analysis, was also performed. CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks produced a moderate-to-severe steatosis and inflammation of the liver in mice. NAFLD activity score (NAS) in mice fed the CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks were more than 4 indicating NASH or borderline NASH pathology. Fibrosis was observed only in mice fed the CDAHFD for 8 weeks. PET imaging showed that the hepatic standardized uptake value, SUV, was increased with prolonged CDAHFD feeding compared with the respective controls (CDAHFD 3 weeks 0.32 ± 0.06 vs 0.48 ± 0.05, p < 0.01; CDAHFD 8 weeks 0.35 ± 0.04 vs 0.75 ± 0.07, p < 0.01, respectively). Prolonged CDAHFD feeding increased hepatic mRNA and protein levels of integrin αv and β3 at 3 and 8 weeks. Hepatic F-FPP-RGD uptake and amount of integrin αv and β3 protein were well correlated (r = 0.593, p < 0.05 and r = 0.835, p < 0.001, respectively). Hepatic F-FPP-RGD uptake also showed a positive correlation with Sirius red-positive area.The hepatic uptake of F-FPP-RGD correlated well with integrin αv and β3 expression and histological fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH, suggesting the predictability of fibrosis in NASH pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584465>Interleukin-4 Boosts Insulin-Induced Energy Deposits by Enhancing Glucose Uptake and Lipogenesis in Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis as the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia, is closely associated with chronic inflammation. We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing lipid deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy metabolism. Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic metabolism was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 2 expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free   uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the  were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16624352>Crotalic and emarginellic : two triterpenes from Crotalaria emarginella and anti-inflammatory and anti-hepatotoxic activity of crotalic .</a></h2><p>The aerial parts of Crotalaria emarginella Vatke (Leguminosae) has afforded two triterpenes, characterized as -hydroxy-arbor-12-ene-28-carboxylic , designated as crotalic  (1), and 2beta,3beta,21-trihydroxy-arbor-12-ene-29-carboxylic , designated as emarginellic  (2).

Babies breastfeeding at the time of BMT were also enrolled on the human milk arm. Human milk was administered from day -3 until day +14 after BMT. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing and metabolomics of stool, plasma cytokines, and regenerating islet-derived 3α (REG3α) levels were measured at enrollment and day +14. Human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR), CD38, and CD69 expression on T cells were evaluated at day +21.Forty-six children were enrolled, 32 received human milk (donor milk n = 23, breastfeeding babies n = 9), and 14 were controls who received standard feeds supervised by a BMT dietician. Twenty-four patients received at least 60% of goal human milk and were evaluable. Plasma interleukin (IL)-8 (p = 0.04), IL-10 (p = 0.02), and REG3α (p = 0.03) were decreased in the human milk cohort. Peripheral blood CD69 CD8 T cells were higher in controls (p = 0.01).

The purposes of this work are: 1) to examine whether or not gene expression is altered in different ways by these two PPARalpha agonists and 2) to find genes whose expression has not been previously reported to be affected by PPARalpha agonists. Mice were treated orally with 100 mg/kg fenofibrate, or 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg Wy-14,643, and the liver was collected on Day 2 or 3. mRNA was extraction from liver, and subjected to microarray analysis. Previously reported induction or reduction of gene expression, e.g. genes involved in beta-oxidation and lipid metabolism, was confirmed in our study. Scatter plot analysis indicated that the changes of gene expression pattern induced by fenofibrate and Wy-14,643 were almost identical. However, expression levels of metallothionein 1 and 2 mRNAs were different: no change of hepatic metallothionein 1 and 2 mRNA expression was induced by 100 mg/kg fenofibrate on Day 2 or 3, while 30 mg/kg Wy-14,643 administration increased expression of both genes by 1.8-fold on Day 3. In addition to previously reported gene expression changes by PPARalpha agonists, we found expression changes of other genes, including cis-retinol/-hydroxysterol short chain dehydrogenase, vanin-1, RecA-like protein, and serum amyloid A (SAA) 2. Among them, the change of SAA2 mRNA level was noteworthy; it showed a decrease to as little as one-seventh. Seven-day fenofibrate pre-treatment of mice completely inhibited the acute-phase elevation of plasma SAA concentration triggered by acetaminophen challenge. This finding suggests that fenofibrate treatment may reduce plasma SAA concentration in patients with secondary amyloidosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29075644>Royal Jelly Inhibits  Adherence and Reduces Excessive Inflammatory Responses in Human Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p> is a Gram-negative bacterium and causes respiratory infection especially in elderly patients.

Wild-type strain PAO1 and clinical isolates of  were used for antibacterial assay and antiadherent assay to abiotic surface and epithelial cells, which are pharynx (Detroit 562) and lung (NCI-H292) epithelial cells. In anti-inflammatory assay, epithelial cells were pretreated with royal jelly before bacterial exposure to investigate its inhibitory effect on interleukin (IL-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein-3/CCL20 overproduction. Although royal jelly did not have antibacterial activity at concentration of 50% w/v, antiadherent activity was confirmed on the abiotic surface and epithelial cells under concentration of 25%. Pretreatment with royal jelly significantly inhibited overproduction of IL-8 and CCL20 from both cells.

Recently, it was reported that impressic  has inhibitory effects on the LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and on the nuclear factor of activated T-cells transcription factor activity. Thus, to investigate whether impressic  has effects on the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), luciferase reporter assays were used. The effects on the expression of NF-κB and PPARγ target genes were also examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

We investigated whether iron (III) complex of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic  [DTPA Fe(III)], a scavenger of NO as well as other oxidant mediators, has similar divergent effects in E. coli challenged rats.Animals with venous and arterial catheters and challenged with intrabronchial or intravenous E. coli were randomized to treatment with DTPA Fe(III) in doses from 3 to 800 mg/kg or placebo. Mean blood pressure (MBP) was measured in all animals and plasma NO, cytokines, and blood and lung leukocyte and bacteria counts in animals administered intrabronchial E. coli and DTPA Fe(III) 50 mg/kg or placebo. Animals received antibiotics and were observed 168 h.Independent of drug regimen or infection site, compared to placebo, DTPA Fe(III) increased MBP although this was greater with high vs. lower doses. Despite increased MBP, DTPA Fe(III) worsened the hazards ratio of survival . At 6 and 24 h DTPA Fe(III) decreased NO but not significantly and decreased four cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins 1 and 10, and macrophage inflammatory protein ) and lung lavage neutrophils. From 6 to 24 h DTPA Fe(III) increased blood bacteria.DTPA Fe(III) while increasing blood pressure has the potential to worsen outcome in sepsis.

The involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also evaluated. Rats were injected with Salmonella-derived lipopolysaccharide or saline. After 6 h, endothelial function of mesenteric resistance arteries was evaluated. In controls, acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation was inhibited by the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) and unaffected by 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl)-phenyl-2(5H)-furanone (DFU) (COX-2 inhibitor). In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats, the response to ACh was blunted compared with controls, less sensitive to l-NMMA, and enhanced by DFU. COX-2 blockade also improved the inhibitory effect of l-NMMA on cholinergic relaxation. SC-560 [5-(4-clorophenyl)-1-(4-metoxyphenyl)-3-trifluoromethylpirazole] (COX-1 inhibitor) did not modify the response to ACh in both groups. LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction was unaffected by the thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) receptor antagonist SQ-29548 (7-[3-[[2-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]hydrazino]methyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1] hept-2-yl]-[1S(1alpha,2alpha(Z),,4alpha)]-5-heptenoic ). In vivo inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibition by S-methylisothiourea partly attenuated LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction. The antioxidants ascorbic  and superoxide dismutase normalized endothelium-dependent relaxation and restored the inhibitory action of l-NMMA on ACh. Responses to sodium nitroprusside were similar in both groups. In LPS-treated rats, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed a marked increase in mesenteric iNOS and COX-2 expressions, whereas endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and COX-1 were unchanged. LPS-induced COX-2 overexpression was reduced but not abrogated by S-methylisothiourea. LPS-induced COX-2 up-regulation was also documented by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, mesenteric resistance vessels from endotoxemic rats show impaired endothelial function due to reduced NO availability, a condition that is partly ascribable to an iNOS-dependent enhanced COX-2 expression, whereas TxA(2) does not seem to be involved. Oxidative stress is the main mechanism responsible for reduced NO availability, and COX-2 might act as a source of ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15528449>Prostaglandin D2-induced eosinophilic airway  is mediated by CRTH2 receptor.</a></h2><p>Mast cell-derived prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) is one of the essential modulators of eosinophilic airway  in asthma and allergic rhinitis. Two G protein-coupled receptors for PGD(2), prostaglandin D(2) receptor (DP) and chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th(2) cells (CRTH2), are both expressed on the surface of eosinophils, and CRTH2 has been demonstrated to mediate PGD(2)-induced eosinophil mobilization in vitro. However, it has not yet been determined whether PGD(2) and its receptors mediate in vivo eosinophil trafficking into the airways or other organs. We demonstrated that intratracheal administration of PGD(2) in rats pretreated with systemic interleukin-5 (IL-5) injection induced marked airway eosinophilia, determined by the differential counts of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung histology, within 2 h. Systemic IL-5 alone significantly increased the number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood but showed no effect on airway eosinophilia. Three CRTH2-specific agonists (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD(2), 11-deoxy-11-methylene-15-keto-PGD(2), and indomethacin) demonstrated equivalent induction of BAL eosinophilia to that of PGD(2), but a DP agonist (BW 245C [5-(6-carboxyhexyl)-1-(3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropyl)-hydantoin]) or a thromboxane A(2) receptor (TP) agonist ([1S-1alpha,2beta(5Z), (1E,3R*),4alpha)]-7-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-(4'-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo-[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-heptenoic ) showed no effect.

W.Smith (AGS), as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. Our results demonstrated that HLEDA concentration-dependently reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), signiﬁcantly suppressed LPS-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-1β at the mRNA and protein levels in RAW264.7 cells. Further analysis revealed that HLEDA could reduce the secretion of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1). Additionally, the results showed that HLEDA efficiently decreased nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation by inhibiting the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα. These results suggest that HLEDA exerts anti-inflammatory properties in LPS-induced macrophages, possibly through inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which mediates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results warrant further studies that would concern candidate therapy for diseases, such as fulminant hepatitis and rheumatology of triterpenoids in AGS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540502>-Eicosapentaenoyl Dopamine, A Conjugate of Dopamine and Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), Exerts Anti-inflammatory Properties in Mouse and Human Macrophages.</a></h2><p>A large body of evidence suggests that dietary -3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), contribute to a reduced inflammatory tone thereby lowering the risk for several chronic and degenerative diseases. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain these anti-inflammatory effects, including those involving endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like molecules. In this context, fatty  amides (FAAs), conjugates of fatty  with amines or amino , are an emerging class of compounds. Dopamine conjugates of DHA (-docosahexaenoyl dopamine, DHDA) and EPA (-eicosapentaenoyl dopamine, EPDA) have previously been shown to induce autophagy, apoptosis, and cell death in different tumor lines. Additionally, DHDA has displayed anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. Here, we tested the immune-modulatory properties of EPDA in mouse RAW 264.7 and human THP-1 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). EPDA suppressed the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in both cell lines, and nitric oxide (NO), and macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (MIP3A) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. At a transcriptional level, EPDA attenuated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in both cell lines and that of MCP-1, IL-6, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in THP-1 macrophages. Although further research is needed to reveal whether EPDA is an endogenous metabolite, our data suggest that this EPA-derived conjugate possesses interesting immune-modulating properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546615>Melatonin decreases muscular oxidative stress and  induced by strenuous exercise and stimulates growth factor synthesis.</a></h2><p>Strenuous exercise is detrimental to athletes because of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Melatonin, a classic antioxidant, has been shown to exhibit beneficial effects regarding intense exercise and tissue repair. In this study, we evaluated the onset and resolution of  in melatonin-treated and nontreated rats subjected to a strenuous exercise session. We also analyzed the formation of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Control and treated rats were subjected to exhaustive exercise after a period of 10 days of melatonin treatment (20 mg/dL). Plasma and muscle levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2-alpha/beta (CINC-2α/β), l-selectin, macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha (MIP-3α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured prior to, immediately after, and 2 hr after exercise. Our data revealed decreases in the muscle concentrations of IL-1β (35%), TNF-α (13%), IL-6 (48%), and TBARS (40%) in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We also observed decreases in the plasma concentrations of IL-1β (17%) in the melatonin-treated group. VEGF-α concentrations and SOD activity increased by 179% and 22%, respectively, in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We concluded that muscle  and oxidative stress resulting from exhaustive exercise were less severe in the muscles of melatonin-treated animals than in the muscles of control animals. Thus, melatonin treatment may reverse exercise-induced skeletal muscle  and stimulate growth factor synthesis.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This lack of data prompted us to evaluate the aqueous (AE) and hexane (HE) extracts from A. adstringens in two models of acute : 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema. The results showed that HE possesses dose-dependent activity, while AE showed no anti-inflammatory effect on TPA-induced edema. Reverse effects were found in the carrageenan test, wherein AE showed a 73.5% of inhibition of edema, while HE showed only a 14.4% activity at 100 mg/kg body weight. These results could indicate that AE and HE possess different anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action. On the other hand, it is known that masticadienonic (1) and -hydroxymasticadienonic (2)  are the main constituents of the organic extract of A. adstringens bark. Because of this knowledge, we tested 1 and 2 in the same experimental models. The results showed that 2 possesses a dose-dependent effect, while 1 does not show a dose-dependent response in TPA-induced edema. In carrageenan-induced edema tests, both 1 and 2 showed almost the same activity (approximately 44% inhibition at 100 mg/kg body weight). In order to determine whether the anti-inflammatory activities of AE, HE, 1 and 2 are involved in the alteration of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, we evaluated these substances by examining nitric oxide generation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated peritoneal macrophages. The results showed that 1 presented the highest activity (93.3%), followed by 2 (86.5%), while AE (57%) and HE (33.6%) showed the lowest.

In this study, we show that PEDF changes microglial morphology within 1 h of exposure, to a more deactivated form, while having no effect on the expression of such activation markers as OX-42 and ED-1. In contrast, urea activates  phosphatase, and PEDF blocks that activation. PEDF also activates NFkappaB, accompanied by the induction of mRNAs and proteins for the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha, MIP-2, and MIP-. All the chemokines stimulate  phosphatase activity, and high doses of MIP-2 and MIP-), alter the morphology of the microglia at 1 h after treatment.

Polyunsaturated species of LPA were especially increased following segmental allergen challenge. LPA levels did not strongly correlate with the number or percentages of eosinophils, neutrophils of lymphocytes, whereas MIP- (CCL20) levels correlated significantly with the allergen-driven influx of lymphocytes. The levels of LPA from control sites correlated inversely with BAL protein content, suggesting that LPA promoted epithelial barrier integrity at baseline. Experiments using primary human bronchial epithelial cells confirmed that LPA tightened the epithelial cell barrier.Lysophosphatidic  is detectable in human BAL fluids at baseline and its expression increases during allergic . LPA does not appear to be a dominant chemoattractant for eosinophils or lymphocytes during allergic airway . In the absence of ongoing , LPA may promote epithelial barrier integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022842>Capsaicin Analogues Derived from -3 Polyunsaturated Fatty  (PUFAs) Reduce Inflammatory Activity of Macrophages and Stimulate Insulin Secretion by β-Cells In Vitro.</a></h2><p>In this study, two capsaicin analogues, -eicosapentaenoyl vanillylamine (EPVA) and -docosahexaenoyl vanillylamine (DHVA), were enzymatically synthesized from their corresponding -3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty  eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), both dietary relevant components. The compounds significantly reduced the production of some lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (CCL20) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2), by RAW264.7 macrophages. Next to this, only EPVA increased insulin secretion by pancreatic INS-1 832/13 β-cells, while raising intracellular Ca and ATP concentrations. This suggests that the stimulation of insulin release occurs through an increase in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio in the first phase, while is calcium-mediated in the second phase. Although it is not yet known whether EPVA is endogenously produced, its potential therapeutic value for diabetes treatment merits further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23707652>Intrathecal neurosteroids and a neurosteroid antagonist: effects on -evoked thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia.</a></h2><p>Neurosteroids regulate neuronal excitability though binding sites associated with the ionotropic γ-aminobutyric  (GABAA) receptor. We sought to characterize the spinal analgesic actions in rats of two 5α-reduced neurosteroids, allopregnanolone and alphaxalone, on nociceptive processing and to determine whether a putative neurosteroid antagonist attenuates this effect: (3α,5α)-17-phenylandrost-16-en-3-ol (17PA). Intrathecal (IT) injection of allopregnanolone (1-30 μg/10 μL in 20% cyclodextrin) delivered through lumbar catheters produced a dose-dependent analgesia in rats as measured by thermal thresholds in the ipsilateral (inflamed by intraplantar carrageenan) and in the contralateral (un-inflamed paws). Similar observations were made with alphaxalone (30-60 μg in 20% cyclodextrin). Effective doses were not associated with suppressive effects on pinnae, blink or placing and stepping reflex. Effects of allopregnanolone (30 μg) on the normal and hyperalgesic paw were completely prevented by IT 17PA (30 μg). Reversal by IT 17PA of an equi-analgesic dose of alphaxalone occurred only at higher antagonist dosing. These results suggest that a spinal neurosteroid-binding site with which 17PA interacts may regulate spinal nociceptive processing in normal and inflamed tissue.Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24239672>Etifoxine analgesia in experimental monoarthritis: a combined action that protects spinal inhibition and limits central inflammatory processes.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the joint are major causes of chronic pain. Long-lasting pain symptoms are thought to result from a central sensitization of nociceptive circuits. These processes include activation of microglia and spinal disinhibition. Using a monoarthritic rat model of pain, we tried to potentiate neural inhibition by using etifoxine (EFX), a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic that acts as an allosteric-positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric  type A (GABAA) receptor function. Interestingly, EFX also can bind to the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) complex and stimulate the synthesis of 3α-reduced neurosteroids, the most potent positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptor function. Here we show that a curative and a preventive treatment with 50mg/kg of EFX efficiently reduced neuropathic pain symptoms. In the spinal cord, EFX analgesia was accompanied by a reduction in microglial activation and in the levels of proinflammatory mediators. Using electrophysiological tools, we found that EFX treatment not only amplified spinal GABAergic inhibition, but also prevented prostaglandin E2-induced glycinergic disinhibition and restored a "normal" spinal pain processing. Because EFX is already distributed in several countries under the trade name of Stresam for its anxiolytic actions in humans, new clinical trials are now required to further extend its therapeutic indications as pain killer.Copyright © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Recently, we have shown that colonic epithelial cell production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-, a CD4 T cell-directed chemokine, is elevated in inflammatory bowel disease. However, the functional relevance of MIP- production during intestinal  is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether MIP- production is increased during murine 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis and to examine the effect of anti-MIP- neutralizing monoclonal antibody administration in this model. We found that the administration of TNBS significantly increased colonic MIP- protein levels in Balb/c mice. Consistent with this, a marked increase in the number of CCR6-bearing lamina propria CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was also observed in TNBS-treated animals. Treatment of mice with an anti-MIP- neutralizing monoclonal antibody significantly reduced TNBS-mediated increases in colonic weight-to-length ratio, mucosal ulceration, histological damage, and myeloperoxidase activity. TNBS-mediated increases in the number of CCR6-bearing lamina propria T cells were also substantially reduced by anti-MIP- neutralizing monoclonal antibody treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate that blockade of MIP- bioactivity can significantly reduce TNBS-mediated colonic injury and T cell recruitment, suggesting a role for this chemokine in the pathophysiology of intestinal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29634983>Peripheral GABA receptor-mediated signaling facilitates persistent inflammatory hypersensitivity.</a></h2><p>Unlike in the central nervous system (CNS), in the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS), activation of GABA receptors (GABAR) is excitatory because of the relatively high concentration of intracellular chloride in these neurons. Indeed, exogenous GABA and muscimol, a GABAR agonist, exacerbate acute inflammatory hypersensitivity in rodents. However, it remains unclear whether peripheral GABAR and the endogenous GABA play an important role in persistent inflammatory hypersensitivity. In this study, we thus investigated how peripheral GABAR affects pain hypersensitivity by using the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced persistent inflammatory pain mouse model. We found that intraplantar (i.pl.) administration of GABAR antagonists, picrotoxin, and 1(S),9(R)-(-)-bicuculline methiodide significantly inhibited both spontaneous nociceptive (paw licking and flinching) behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity in CFA-injected mice at day 3 (D3), but not in naïve mice. Interestingly, CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was significantly reversed by anti-GABA antibody (anti-GABA, i.pl.). In addition, RT-qPCR revealed that glutamate decarboxylase Gad1 (GAD 67) and Gad2 (GAD 65) mRNA expression was also upregulated in the ipsilateral hind paw of CFA-injected mice at D3. Finally, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (3α,5α-THP), a selective positive allosteric modulator of GABAR, produced mechanical hypersensitivity in naïve mice in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results indicate that peripheral GABAR and endogenous GABA, possibly produced by the inflamed tissue, potentiate CFA-induced persistent inflammatory hypersensitivity, suggesting that they can be used as a therapeutic target for alleviating inflammatory pain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Macroscopic analyses were performed on wounds in rats with or without palmitoleic  treatment, and the results showed that palmitoleic  directly hastened wound closure. The topical treatment of wounds with palmitoleic  resulted in smaller wounds than those observed in the control group. The anti-inflammatory activity of palmitoleic  may be responsible for healing, especially in the stages of granulation tissue formation and remodelling. Palmitoleic  modified TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CINC-2α/β, MIP-3α and VEGF-α profiles at the wound site 24, 48, 120, 216 and 288 hours post-wounding. Assays assessing neutrophil migration and exudate formation in sterile inflammatory air pouches revealed that palmitoleic  had potent anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting the LPS-induced release of TNF-α (73.14%, p≤0.05), IL-1β (66.19%, p≤0.001), IL-6 (75.19%, p≤0.001), MIP-3α (70.38%, p≤0.05), and l-selectin (16%, p≤0.05). Palmitoleic  also inhibited LPS-stimulated neutrophil migration. We concluded that palmitoleic  accelerates wound healing via an anti-inflammatory effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25701747>Identification of anti-inflammatory constituents from Kalimeris indica with UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS and GC-MS.</a></h2><p>Kalimeris indica is a Miao׳s medicinal plant in Guizhou province of China employing to treat various -related diseases in clinical. The study aims to determine the active fractions of K. indica for its anti-inflammatory activity and to identify their chemical constituents.The dried K. indica herb was extracted with 50% aqueous ethanol and then successively separated with macroporous resin and MCI column chromatography to give five fractions (A-E). The anti-inflammatory effects were determined by measuring the NO and TNF-α production in murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells after exposure to LPS. The chemical constituents of the anti-inflammatory fractions were analyzed by the method of UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS or GC-MS.Five fractions (A-E) of different polarities were prepared from the 50% ethanol extract. Factions C and E showed significant inhibition of NO and TNF-α production. Six constituents, namely 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic  (1), 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic  (2), 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic  (3), rutin (4), 1-malonyl-3,5-dicaffeoylquinic  (5), and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic  (6) were identified from the active fraction C by UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS. Four compounds including 13-tetradecenal (7), (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic  (8), (3α)-12-oleanen-3-yl acetate (9), and (+)-3-oxo-urs-12-en-24-oic  methyl ester (10) were identified from the active fraction E by GC-MS.K. indica possessed pronounced anti-inflammatory effect. Dicaffeoylquinic  and their dirivatives, rutin, as well as oleanolic and fatty  derivatives are the major constituents and possibly the anti-inflammatory principles of the active fractions of K. indica. All the compounds were identified in K. indica for the first time. The work provided evidence for further development and utilization of K. indica and formed a basis for the establishment of quality control methods and standards for K. indica and its pharmaceutical preparations.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this change remain unclear. Here, we report that TGF-β1- or PDGF-induced CAFs switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. We identify downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α (IDH3α) as a marker for this switch. Furthermore, miR-424 downregulates IDH3α during CAF formation. Downregulation of IDH3α decreases the effective level of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by reducing the ratio of α-KG to fumarate and succinate, resulting in PHD2 inhibition and HIF-1α protein stabilization. The accumulation of HIF-1α, in turn, promotes glycolysis by increasing the uptake of glucose, upregulating expression of glycolytic enzymes under normoxic conditions, and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation by upregulating NDUFA4L2. CAFs from tumor samples exhibit low levels of IDH3α, and overexpression of IDH3α prevents transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs. Our studies reveal IDH3α to be a critical metabolic switch in CAFs.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although CHI3L1 is described as a biomarker of , the function of this protein is not completely understood. In the present study, we examined the regulation of CHI3L1 in primary human skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, we analysed potential autocrine effects of CHI3L1. We show that myotubes express CHI3L1 in a differentiation-dependent manner. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines up-regulate CHI3L1 expression (6-fold) and release (3-fold). Importantly, CHI3L1 treatment blocked TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α)-induced  by inhibiting NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) activation in skeletal muscle cells. We show that this effect is mediated via PAR2 (protease-activated receptor 2). In addition, CHI3L1 treatment diminished the TNFα-induced expression and secretion of IL (interleukin)-8, MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) and IL-6. In addition, impaired insulin action at the level of Akt and GSK3α/β (glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β) phosphoryl-ation and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was normalized by CHI3L1. In conclusion, the novel myokine CHI3L1, which is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, can counteract TNFα-mediated  and insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle cells, potentially involving an auto- and/or para-crine mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30681907>Role of gut metabolism of adrenal corticosteroids and hypertension: clues gut-cleansing antibiotics give us.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria can metabolize sterols, bile , steroid hormones, dietary proteins, fiber, foodstuffs, and short chain fatty . The metabolic products generated by some of these intestinal bacteria have been linked to a number of systemic diseases including  with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, some forms of inflammation, and more recently, systemic hypertension. In this review, we primarily focus on the potential role selected gut bacteria play in metabolizing the endogenous glucocorticoids corticosterone and cortisol. Those generated steroid metabolites, when reabsorbed in the intestine back into the circulation, produce biological effects most notably as inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) types 1 and 2. Inhibition of the dehydrogenase actions of 11β-HSD, particularly in kidney and vascular tissue, allows both corticosterone and cortisol the ability to bind to and activate mineralocorticoid receptors with attended changes in sodium handling and vascular resistance leading to increases in blood pressure. In several animal models of hypertension, administration of gut-cleansing antibiotics results in transient resolution of hypertension and transfer of intestinal contents from a hypertensive animal to a normotensive animal produces hypertension in the recipient. Moreover, fecal samples from hypertensive humans transplanted into germ-free mice resulted in hypertension in the recipient mice. Thus, it appears that the intestinal microbiome may not just be an innocent bystander but certain perturbations in the type and number of bacteria may directly or indirectly affect hypertension and other diseases.</p></html>
