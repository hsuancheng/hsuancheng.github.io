No available antimalarial drugs specifically target the endothelial disruptions underlying this complication, which is responsible for the majority of malaria-associated deaths. Here, we have demonstrated that ruptured Pf-iRBCs induce activation of β-catenin, leading to disruption of inter-endothelial cell junctions in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Inhibition of β-catenin-induced TCF/LEF transcription in the nucleus of HBMECs prevented the disruption of endothelial junctions, confirming that β-catenin is a key mediator of P. falciparum adverse effects on endothelial integrity. Blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) or stimulation of the type 2 receptor (AT2) abrogated Pf-iRBC-induced activation of β-catenin and prevented the disruption of HBMEC monolayers. In a mouse model of cerebral malaria, modulation of angiotensin II receptors produced similar effects, leading to protection against cerebral malaria, reduced cerebral hemorrhages, and increased survival. In contrast, AT2-deficient mice were more susceptible to cerebral malaria. The interrelation of the β-catenin and the angiotensin II signaling pathways opens immediate host-targeted therapeutic possibilities for cerebral malaria and other diseases in which brain endothelial integrity is compromised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26143190>Treating Ebola patients: a 'bottom up' approach using generic statins and angiotensin receptor blockers.</a></h2><p>The international community has responded to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa with a 'top down' approach. This has contributed to outbreak control, but has done much less to reduce the high mortality rate in individual patients. Ebola patients experience a breakdown in endothelial  integrity that leads to massive fluid losses and vascular collapse. Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) maintain or restore endothelial  integrity. Local physicians in Sierra Leone have treated approximately 100 consecutive Ebola patients with atorvastatin and , and all but two inadequately treated patients have survived. The results of this experience have not been released and they need to be reviewed and validated. Unlike other treatments that target the Ebola virus itself, this 'bottom up' approach to treatment represents a paradigm shift by targeting the host response to infection. Treatment with these safe, inexpensive generic agents could be implemented readily throughout West Africa.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.</p></html>
