A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain   in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain  . The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the  in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630224>Risk profiling using metabolomic characteristics for susceptible individuals of drug-induced  injury caused by Polygonum multiflorum.</a></h2><p>Idiosyncratic drug-induced  injury (IDILI) is a rare but potentially severe adverse drug reaction. To date, identifying individuals at risk for IDILI remains challenging. This is a prospective study, where a nested case-control (1:5) design was adopted. For six patients who had abnormalities in  function test after Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PM) ingestion (susceptible group), 30 patients with normal  function were matched (tolerant group). Based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, metabolomics analysis was done on serum samples prior to PM ingestion, to screen the differential metabolites and characterize metabolomic profiles of patient serum in the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that there were remarkable separations between susceptible and tolerant groups. A total of 25 major differential metabolites were screened out, involving glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism,   metabolism, histidine metabolism and aromatic amino  metabolism. Wherein, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of metabolites PE 22:6, crotonoyl-CoA, 2E-tetradecenoyl-CoA, phenyllactic , indole-5,6-quinone, phosphoribosyl-ATP were all greater than 0.9. The overall serum metabolic profile comprising of 25 metabolites could clearly distinguish susceptible and tolerant groups. This proof-of-concept study used metabolomics to characterize the metabolic profile of IDILI risk individuals before drug ingestion for the first time. The metabolome characteristics in patient serum before PM ingestion may predict the risk of  injury after PM ingestion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558861>Allyl isothiocyanate ameliorates lipid accumulation and inflammation in nonalcoholic  disease  the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a classic anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic agent, was recently identified as a potential treatment for obesity and insulin resistance. However, little is known about its direct impact on the .To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic  disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate  for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its lipogenesis target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in   β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate -induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626136>Risk factors for the development of hyperuricemia: A STROBE-compliant cross-sectional and longitudinal study.</a></h2><p>Hyperuricemia has received increasing attention as a major public health problem. This study aims to investigate the risk factors for hyperuricemia and to explore the relationship between changes in biochemical variables and incident hyperuricemia.A cross-sectional and subsequently prospective study was performed among adults who took their health checkups at Zhejiang University Hospital. The participants who were free of hyperuricemia at baseline received annual follow-up examinations during a 6-year period. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to calculate the risks for incident hyperuricemia.Of the 9238 participants enrolled, 1704 (18.4%) were diagnosed as hyperuricemia. During 21,757 person-years of follow-up, 1492 incident hyperuricemia cases were identified. The incidence of hyperuricemia was 68.58 cases per 1000 person-year of follow-up in the overall participants. The prevalence and the incidence of hyperuricemia increased greatly in female older than 50 years. High levels of BMI, SBP, FPG, TG, LDL-C, ALT, BUN, and creatinine increased the risk of hyperuricemia. Suffering  also increased the risk of hyperuricemia. Subjects with increasing DBP, TG, BUN, creatinine, or decreasing HDL-C were more likely to incident hyperuricemia.This study revealed that the change of diastolic blood pressure (DBP), serum triglycerides (TG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level were independently associated with incident hyperuricemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576746>Dose-Dependent Effects of Triclocarban Exposure on Lipid Homeostasis in Rats.</a></h2><p>Environmental exposure to triclocarban (TCC), a common antibacterial agent widely used in thousands of personal care products, poses a potential risk for human health. Previous in vitro studies about biological effects of TCC have yielded a variety of inconsistent results and apparently not been verified in vivo. In the current study, dose-dependent effects of TCC exposure on lipid homeostasis in rats were investigated using a combination of untargeted H NMR metabolomics, targeted metabolite profiling (LC/GC-MS), histopathological assessments, and biological assays. Our results revealed that TCC dose-dependently activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and its transcriptional targets such as  and  in the  of rats, suggesting that TCC may be a potent AHR agonist. Although TCC exhibited dose-dependent toxicity, oral exposure with relatively low dose TCC caused more significant hepatic lipogenesis of rats than relatively high and moderate doses of TCC. It was mainly manifested by histopathological observations and promotion of de novo  , phospholipid, and ceramide biosynthesis and gut microbiota fermentation. Our findings provide new insights into health effects of TCC exposure with different dosages in vivo, especially on the induction and progression of nonalcoholic  disease, and further our understanding in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases induced by environmental pollutants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with  damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic  disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile  metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with  damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on  damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free   caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on  damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the .

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the -gut axis and especially the role of bile  in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other  diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile  metabolism and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in  of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the  of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1),   synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured.  tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in , and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group.

The eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) composition decreased with increasing inclusion level of LO (P < 0.05). With increasing LO inclusion level, triglyceride (TAG) content of serum increased significantly, however, there was a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (P < 0.05). LO substitution of FO up-regulated the gene expression level of lipid metabolism-related genes   Desaturases 6 (FAD6), Acetyl-Coa Carboxylase (ACCα), Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1 (SREBP-1), and Sterol O- Acyl Transferase 2 (SOAT2), and down-regulated the gene expression level of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor a (PPARα) (P < 0.05).

However, the intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NAFLD have not yet been fully elucidated.  We obtained the gene expression datasets of NAFLD through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Subsequently, robust rank aggregation (RRA) method was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between NAFLD patients and controls. Gene functional annotation and PPI network analysis were performed to explore the potential function of the DEGs. Finally, we used a sequencing dataset GSE126848 to validate our results.  In this study, GSE48452, GSE66676, GSE72756, GSE63067, GSE89632, and GSE107231 were included, including 125 NAFLD patients and 116 control patients. The RRA integrated analysis determined 96 significant DEGs (50 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated) and the most significant gene aberrantly expressed in NAFLD was ENO3 (-value = 7.17E-05), followed by CYP7A1 (-value = 9.04E-05), and P4HA1 (-value = 1.67E-04). Carboxylic  metabolic process (GO:0019752; -value = 1.39E-03) was the most significantly enriched for biological process in GO (gene ontology) analysis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that steroid hormone biosynthesis (hsa00140; -value = 6.68E-03) and PPAR signaling pathway (hsa03320; -value = 9.95E-03) were significantly enriched. Based on the results of the PPI and the results of the RRA, we finally defined the four most critical genes as the hub genes, including ENO3, CYP7A1, P4HA1, and CYP1A1.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that  is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain   (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577934>Dietary Sugars Alter Hepatic   Oxidation via Transcriptional and Post-translational Modifications of Mitochondrial Proteins.</a></h2><p>Dietary sugars, fructose and glucose, promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis and modify the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of insulin resistance. Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and   oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of   oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased   oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

They exert various effects in eukaryotes, ranging from structural roles in plasma membranes to cellular signaling.  sphingolipid synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the condensation of the activated C   palmitoyl-CoA and the amino  L-serine is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is then converted into more complex sphingolipids by additional ER-bound enzymes, resulting in the formation of ceramides. Since sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial to numerous cellular functions, improved assessment of sphingolipid metabolism will be key to better understanding several human diseases. To date, no assay exists capable of monitoring  synthesis sphingolipid in its entirety. Here, we have established a cell-free assay utilizing rat  microsomes containing all the enzymes necessary for bottom-up synthesis of ceramides. Following lipid extraction, we were able to track the different intermediates of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway, namely 3-ketosphinganine, sphinganine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide. This was achieved by chromatographic separation of sphingolipid metabolites followed by detection of their accurate mass and characteristic fragmentations through high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem-mass spectrometry. We were able to distinguish, unequivocally, between  synthesized sphingolipids and intrinsic species, inevitably present in the microsome preparations, through the addition of stable isotope-labeled palmitate-d and L-serine-d. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a method monitoring the entirety of ER-associated sphingolipid biosynthesis. Proof-of-concept data was provided by modulating the levels of supplied cofactors (e.g., NADPH) or the addition of specific enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fumonisin B). The presented microsomal assay may serve as a useful tool for monitoring alterations in sphingolipid  synthesis in cells or tissues. Additionally, our methodology may be used for metabolism studies of atypical substrates - naturally occurring or chemically tailored - as well as novel inhibitors of enzymes involved in sphingolipid  synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Wigger, Gulbins, Kleuser and Schumacher.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003).

Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors.

ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628911>Association between the perturbation of bile  homeostasis and valproic -induced hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Valproic  (VPA), a widely prescribed antiepileptic drug, is known to induce hepatotoxicity. However, the mechanisms underlying this toxicity are not well understood. In this study, we performed a nontargeted metabolomic analysis of children with epilepsy treated with VPA (n = 23). Metabolic pathway analysis showed that the   pathway, citrate cycle, urea cycle, amino  metabolism, and bile  pathway were altered in children with epilepsy exhibiting VPA hepatotoxicity. In particular, the VPA-induced perturbation of bile  homeostasis has not been observed previously. Based on these findings, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis to characterize bile  profiles and further determined the effects of VPA on the synthesis, transport, and regulation of bile  in mice. The bile  metabolomic profiles of the livers of mice treated with VPA indicated an increase in most bile , especially chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA), as well as unconjugated bile . The upregulation of genes related to bile  synthesis (CYP7A1 and CYP8B1) and the downregulation of genes related to conjugation (BAAT and BACS) and regulation (FXR and SHP) were detected in the , suggesting that hydrophobic bile  production was increased and FXR signaling was impaired. Our results suggest that the perturbation of bile  homeostasis and impaired FXR signaling are involved in VPA-induced hepatotoxicity, providing a novel insight into VPA hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesised that the mechanism behind this is the alteration of bile  and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) metabolism. We further explored this mechanism by supplementing betaine (1%) to the diet of a farmed fish Megalobrama amblycephala. Four diet groups were designed: control (CD, 27.11% carbohydrates), high-carbohydrate (HCD, 36.75% carbohydrates), long-term betaine (HCB, 35.64% carbohydrates; 16 weeks) and short-term betaine (HC4B; 12 weeks HCD + 4 weeks HCB) diets. We analysed the histology of the  (hematoxylin and eosin staining), the metabolites related to TMAO in plasma (high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), the expression of the relative gene in the  and gut microbiota (qPCR), and the composition of gut microbiota (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism). HCD elevated lipid accumulation in the  and decreased the gene expression of bile  transport, trimethylamine (TMA) formation and the diversity of gut microbiota compared to CD. HCB reversed these patterns, and elevated the gene expression of bile  receptors and decreased the total cholesterol and TMAO concentration (all compared to HCD). HCD and HCB both increased the gene expression of bile  synthesis (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, we hypothesise that HCB decreased  lipid accumulation caused by a high-carbohydrate diet through improvement of the gut microbial community (the diversity of gut microbiota), TMA formation (the expression of associated microbial genes and bacterial taxa), TMAO metabolism (the formation of TMAO) and bile  metabolism (the gene expression of the synthesis and transport of bile  and their receptors).

Traditional markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are commonly used to estimate glomerular filtration rate. However, these markers have several limitations including poor specificity and sensitivity. A number of serum and urine biomarkers have recently been described to detect kidney damage caused by drugs such as cisplatin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and tacrolimus. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), -type  -binding protein (L-FABP), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and cystatin C have been identified as biomarkers for early kidney damage. Hy's Law is widely used as to predict a high risk of severe drug-induced  injury caused by drugs such as acetaminophen. Recent reports have indicated that glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), Keratin-18 (k18), MicroRNA-122 and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT) are more sensitive markers of hepatotoxicity compared to the traditional markers including the blood levels of amiotransferases and total bilirubin.

Previous studies indicate that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a complex role in NAFLD. As the only precursor of RAS, decreased angiotensinogen (AGT) profoundly impacts RAS bioactivity. Here we investigated the role of hepatocyte-derived AGT in  steatosis. AGT floxed mice (hepAGT+/+) and hepatocyte-specific AGT deficient mice (hepAGT-/-) were fed on western diet and normal laboratory diet for 12 weeks, respectively. Compared with hepAGT+/+ mice, western diet-fed hepAGT-/- mice gained less body weight with improved insulin sensitivity. The attenuated severity of  steatosis in hepAGT-/- mice was evidenced by histologic changes and reduced intrahepatic triglycerides. The abundance of SREBP1 and its down-stream molecules ACC, FASN was suppressed in hepAGT-/- mice. Furthermore, serum derived from hepAGT+/+ mice stimulated hepatocyte SREBP1 expression, which could be diminished by Akt/mTOR inhibition in vitro. Administration of losartan did not affect diet-induced body weight gain,  steatosis severity, and hepatic p-Akt, p-mTOR, and SREBP1 protein abundance in hepAGT+/+ mice. These data suggest that attenuation of western diet-induced  steatosis in hepAGT-/- mice is associated with the alternation of Akt/mTOR/SREBP-1c pathway.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583093>Disrupted tubular parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone receptor signaling and damaged tubular cell viability possibly trigger postsurgical kidney injury in patients with advanced hyperparathyroidism.</a></h2><p>Parathyroidectomy (PTX) that alleviates clinical manifestations of advanced hyperparathyroidism, including hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, is considered the best protection from calcium overload in the kidney. However, little is known about the relationship between postsurgical robust parathyroid hormone (PTH) reduction and perisurgical renal tubular cell viability. Post-PTX kidney function is still a crucial issue for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and tertiary hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation (THPT).As a clinical study, we examined data from 52 consecutive patients (45 with PHPT, 7 with THPT) who underwent PTX in our center between 2015 and 2017 to identify post-PTX kidney injury. Their clinical data, including urinary -type  -binding protein (L-FABP), a tubular biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI), were obtained from patient charts. An absolute change in serum creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) on Day 2 after PTX defines AKI. Post-PTX calcium supplement dose adjustment was performed to strictly maintain serum calcium at the lower half of the normal range. To mimic post-PTX-related kidney status, a unique parathyroidectomized rat model was produced as follows: 13-week-old rats underwent thyroparathyroidectomy (TPTX) and/or 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (NX). Indicated TPTX rats were given continuous infusion of a physiological level of 1-34 PTH using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed by polyclonal antibodies against PTH receptor (PTHR) and a possible key modulator of kidney injury, Klotho.Patients' estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not have any clinically relevant change (62.5 ± 22.0 versus 59.4 ± 21.9 mL/min/1.73 m, NS), whereas serum calcium (2.7 ± 0.18 versus 2.2 ± 0.16 mmol/L, P < 0.0001) and phosphorus levels (0.87 ± 0.19 versus 1.1 ± 0.23 mmol/L, P < 0.0001) were normalized and PTH decreased robustly (181 ± 99.1 versus 23.7 ± 16.8 pg/mL, P < 0.0001) after successful PTX. However, six patients who met postsurgical AKI criteria had lower eGFR and greater L-FABP than those without AKI. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed eGFR <35 mL/min/1.73 m had 83% accuracy. Strikingly, L-FABP >9.8 µg/g creatinine had 100% accuracy in predicting post-PTX-related AKI. Rat kidney PTHR expression was lower in TPTX. PTH infusion (+PTH) restored tubular PTHR expression in rats that underwent TPTX. Rats with TPTX, +PTH and 5/6 NX had decreased PTHR expression compared with those without 5/6 NX. 5/6 NX partially cancelled tubular PTHR upregulation driven by +PTH. Tubular Klotho was modestly expressed in normal rat kidneys, whereas enhanced patchy tubular expression was identified in 5/6 NX rat kidneys. This Klotho and expression and localization pattern was absolutely canceled in TPTX, suggesting that PTH indirectly modulated the Klotho expression pattern. TPTX +PTH recovered tubular Klotho expression and even triggered diffusely abundant Klotho expression. 5/6 NX decreased viable tubular cells and eventually downregulated tubular Klotho expression and localization.Preexisting tubular damage is a potential risk factor for AKI after PTX although, overall patients with hyperparathyroidism are expected to keep favorable kidney function after PTX. Patients with elevated tubular cell biomarker levels may suffer post-PTX kidney impairment even though calcium supplement is meticulously adjusted after PTX. Our unique experimental rat model suggests that blunted tubular PTH/PTHR signaling may damage tubular cell viability and deteriorate kidney function through a Klotho-linked pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to investigate the changes in serine biosynthetic pathways in humans and animal models of  and their contribution to the development of FLD.High-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis and methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis animal models were employed. Human serum samples were obtained from patients with FLD whose proton density fat fraction was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and transgenic mice overexpressing Phgdh (Tg-phgdh) were used to evaluate the role of serine metabolism in the development of FLD.Expression of Phgdh was markedly reduced in the animal models. There were significant negative correlations of the serum serine with the  fat fraction, serum alanine transaminase, and triglyceride levels among patients with FLD. Increased lipid accumulation and reduced NAD and SIRT1 activity were observed in Phgdh-knockout MEF and primary hepatocytes incubated with free  ; these effects were reversed by overexpression of Phgdh. Tg-Phgdh mice showed significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation compared with wild-type littermates fed a HFD, which was accompanied by increased SIRT1 activity and reduced expression of lipogenic genes and proteins.Human and experimental data suggest that reduced Phgdh expression and serine levels are closely associated with the development of FLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle   uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the , branched-chain α-keto  decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino  catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino  transaminase, branched-chain α-keto  dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino , thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino  in tissues such as skeletal muscle and , and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino , as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino , alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino  catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino  catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric , increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric  concentration, improving insulin resistance.

However, both animal experiments and human studies seem to support the view that dietary cholesterol may contribute to the transition from benign steatosis to the potentially fatal non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Cholesterol esters and cholesterol accumulate in the hepatocyte and impair its function. This leads to oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and rendering the hepatocyte more susceptible to apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Kupffer cells group around dying hepatocytes and phagocytose the hepatocyte debris and lipids. In addition, they are exposed to lipid peroxidation products released from hepatocytes. Kupffer cells, thus activated, release pro-inflammatory, chemotactic and profibrotic cytokines that promote inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, dietary cholesterol may be harmful to the , in particular when administered in combination with polyunsaturated   that favor lipid peroxidation.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced lipogenesis,  specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of   in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581733>Specific Wheat Fractions Influence Hepatic Fat Metabolism in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Low whole grain consumption is a risk factor for the development of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased  triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain  .

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid,  function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in  and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain   (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers  X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid metabolism. Our studies indicate that cholesterol and   synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the  X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for  X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that  X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus,  X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals.  X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551937>Non-alcoholic  Disease Induced by Perinatal Exposure to Bisphenol a Is Associated With Activated mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB Signaling Pathways in Offspring Rats.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence suggests a role of bisphenol A (BPA) in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), and its mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of lipogenic genes, but the mechanism of BPA induced lipogenic gene expression remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on NAFLD and its mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 or 10 μg/ml BPA from gestational day 6 to post-natal day 21. For 5 weeks after weaning, offspring drank normal water without BPA. Body weight, lipid profile and the expression of genes or proteins involved in mTOR mediated lipid metabolism and autophagy, as well as inflammatory response were investigated in the 8-wk-old offspring of different genders. The results showed that body weight was increased only in females, however, males, and females from dams treated with BPA had significantly excess visceral adipose tissue, which was consistent with adipocyte hypertrophy. Elevated TG levels and up-regulation of lipogenic genes or proteins in , such as sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and   synthase (FAS) were consistent with increased  lipid droplets in offspring exposed to BPA. Compared with controls, the protein levels of InsR, p-IRS-1, IRS-1, TSC1, and TSC2 were decreased, p-PI3K, p-Akt (S473), p-Akt (T308), p-mTOR, and mTOR were increased, and the impaired autophagic degradation was evidenced by increased protein levels of p62, although the levels of p-ULK1, Beclin1, and LC3B proteins were increased in  of BPA-exposed offspring. The levels of TLR4 and NF-κB proteins were also significantly increased, and ERα protein was significantly decreased in BPA-exposed offspring. Our findings indicate that perinatal exposure to BPA causes the development of NAFLD in both female and male offspring, which is associated with up-regulation of lipogenic genes, dysregulated autophagy and activated inflammatory response involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673534>Endogenously increased n-3 PUFA levels in fat-1 transgenic mice do not protect from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic  disease worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis.

It is also used as a tool and a detection index for the identification of cassiae semen, as stipulated by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Anthraquinones, the main components in cassiae semen, have been reported to show hepatotoxicity. This study investigates the hepatotoxicity of aurantio-obtusin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. We randomly divided the animals into a blank control group and treated three test groups with different doses of aurantio-obtusin: Low dose (4 mg/kg), medium dose (40 mg/kg), and high dose (200 mg/kg). Each group was treated with aurantio-obtusin for 28 days, whereas the control group was administered an equal volume of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na) aqueous solution. Subsequently, we conducted biochemical, hematological, and pathological investigations and determined the weight of different organs. We used serum metabolomics to identify possible biomarkers related to hepatotoxicity. The low-dose group showed no significant  injury, whereas the medium- and high-dose groups manifested obvious  injury. Compared with the control group, the test groups showed an increase in alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. The  organ coefficient also significantly increased. Additionally, we found significant changes in the hematological indices. Metabolomics analysis showed that aurantio-obtusin induced 28 endogenous markers related to  injury. Our data indicate that aurantio-obtusin induces hepatotoxicity in rat  in a dose-dependent manner and is mediated by pathways involving bile ,  , amino , and energy metabolism. In particular, changes in bile  content during treatment with therapeutic agents containing aurantio-obtusin deserve increased attention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639005>Therapeutic effect and autophagy regulation of myriocin in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Ceramide plays pathogenic roles in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) via multiple mechanisms, and as such inhibition of ceramide de novo synthesis in the  may be of therapeutically beneficial in patients with NAFLD. In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10).  histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with   with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults,  biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and  biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated  pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of   metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

However, their stratum corneum (SC) lipid composition differs from NHS causing a reduced skin barrier. The most pronounced differences in lipid composition are a reduction in lipid chain length and increased monounsaturated lipids. The -X-receptor (LXR) activates the monounsaturated lipid synthesis via stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1). Therefore, the aim was to improve the SC lipid synthesis of FTMs by LXR deactivation. This was achieved by supplementing culture medium with LXR antagonist GSK2033. LXR agonist T0901317 was added for comparison. Subsequently, epidermal morphogenesis, lipid composition, lipid organization and the barrier functionality of these FTMs were assessed. We demonstrate that LXR deactivation resulted in a lipid composition with increased overall chain lengths and reduced levels of monounsaturation, whereas LXR activation increased the amount of monounsaturated lipids and led to a reduction in the overall chain length. However, these changes did not affect the barrier functionality. In conclusion, LXR deactivation led to the development of FTMs with improved lipid properties, which mimic the lipid composition of NHS more closely. These novel findings may contribute to design interventions to normalize SC lipid composition of atopic dermatitis patients.Copyright © 2019.

Silybin (Sil), a naturally occurring hepatoprotective agent, was widely used for treating NAFLD. Whether Sil effects gut microbiota during its actions in treating NAFLD, which is unknown. We aimed to examine the effect of Sil on intestinal flora dysbiosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD).After 10 weeks of feeding normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD, mice were given daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were harvested for study of short chain   (SCFAs), bile  and gut microbiota alteration.Sil showed protective effects against dietary-induced obesity and  steatosis, accordingly gut microbiota composition changed. At phylum level, compared with HFD group, mice in the Sil-treated group had significant lower level of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P<0.05). At genus level, Sil-treated group have significant lower level of Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Mollicutes_RF9, which were reported to be potentially related to diet-induced obesity, and increased levels of Blautia (P<0.05), Akkermansia (P<0.05), Bacteroides(P<0.05) which were known to have beneficial effect on improving NAFLD. Sil also showed inhibitory effect on well-known beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus. Moreover, production of acetate, propionate and butyrate increased, while generation of formate and conversion of cytotoxic secondary metabolites (LCA, DCA) decreased in mice treated with Sil.Sil might have beneficial effects on ameliorating NAFLD and mediate HFD-induced change of gut microbiota composition, followed with major changes in secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs.This article is protected by copyright.

Although the mechanisms involved are likely complex, these associations suggest that lowering circulating ceramide levels could be protective against cardiovascular diseases. Conversely, dietary fibers, such as inulin, have been reported to promote cardiovascular and metabolic health. However, the mechanisms involved in these protective processes also are not well understood. We studied the effects of inulin on lipid metabolism with a model of atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice using lipidomics and transcriptomics. Plasma and tissues were collected at 10 days and/or 12 weeks after feeding mice an atherogenic diet supplemented with inulin or cellulose (control). Compared with controls, inulin-fed mice displayed a decreased C16:0/C24:0 plasma ceramide ratio and lower levels of circulating ceramides associated with VLDL and LDL.  transcriptomic analysis revealed that Smpd3, a gene that encodes neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase), was downregulated by 2-fold in inulin-fed mice. Hepatic NSMase activity was 3-fold lower in inulin-fed mice than in controls. Furthermore,  redox status and compositions of phosphatidylserine and free   species, the major factors that determine NSMase activity, also were modified by inulin. Taken together, these results showed that, in mice, inulin can decrease plasma ceramide levels through reductions in NSMase expression and activity, suggesting a mechanism by which fiber could reduce cardiometabolic disease risk.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610126>Reduction of Hepatic Lipogenesis by Loliolide and Pinoresinol from  via Degrading  X Receptors.</a></h2><p>The  X receptors (LXRs) are major regulators of lipogenesis, and their reduced activation by an inhibitor could be a treatment strategy for  disease. Small molecules originating from dietary food are considered suitable and attractive drug candidates for humans in terms of safety. In this study, an edible plant,  (LV), used as a traditional and medicinal food in East Asia was evaluated for lipogenesis decreasing effects. Activity-guided fractionation was performed, and the isolated compounds were identified using spectroscopic methods. We conducted in vitro real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting as well as histological and biochemical analyses following in vivo treatments. Using a high-fat diet animal model, we confirmed that LV extracts (LVE) decreased lipogenic metabolism and restored  function to control levels. To identify active components, we conducted activity-guided fractionation and then isolated compounds. Two compounds, loliolide and pinoresinol, were identified in the dichloromethane fraction, and they significantly attenuated the expression levels of lipogenic factors including sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1),   synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Importantly, loliolide and pinoresinol significantly accelerated the protein degradation of LXRs by enhanced ubiquitination, which inhibited lipogenesis. These results suggest that loliolide and pinoresinol might be potential candidate supplementary treatments for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) by reducing lipogenesis through increased ubiquitination of LXRs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615062>Acetate Affects the Process of Lipid Metabolism in Rabbit , Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Short-chain   (SCFAs) (a microbial fermentation production in the rabbit gut) have an important role in many physiological processes, which may be related to the reduced body fat of rabbits. In the present experiment, we study the function of acetate (a major SCFA in the rabbit gut) on fat metabolism. Ninety rabbits (40 days of age) were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group (injection of saline for four days); a group experiencing subcutaneous injection of acetate for four days (2 g/kg BM per day, one injection each day, acetate); and a pair-fed sham treatment group. The results show that acetate-inhibited lipid accumulation by promoting lipolysis and   oxidation and inhibiting   synthesis. Activated G protein-coupled receptor 41/43, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signal pathways were likely to participate in the regulation in lipid accumulation of acetate. Acetate reduced hepatic triglyceride content by inhibiting   synthesis, enhancing   oxidation and lipid output. Inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α () and activated AMPK and ERK1/2 signal pathways were related to the process in . Acetate reduced intramuscular triglyceride level via increasing   uptake and   oxidation.

SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and  triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic  and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic , fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic ; and decreased levels of the amino  metabolism products aspartic  and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited   synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592200>The Effect of Estrogen on Hepatic Fat Accumulation during Early Phase of  Regeneration after Partial Hepatectomy in Rats.</a></h2><p> is common in men and post-menopausal women, suggesting that estrogen may be involved in  lipid metabolism. The aim of this study is to be clear the role of estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in fat accumulation during  regeneration using the 70% partial hepatectomy (PHX) model in male, female, ovariectomized (OVX) and E-treated OVX (OVX-E) rats.  tissues were sampled at 0-48 hr after PHX and fat accumulation,   translocase (FAT/CD36), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and ERα were examined by Oil Red O, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Hepatic fat accumulation was abundant in female and OVX-E compared to male and OVX rats. FAT/CD36 expression was observed in female, OVX and OVX-E at 0-12 hr after PHX, but not in male rats. At 0 hr, SREBP1c and PPARα were elevated in female and male rats, respectively, but were decreased after PHX in all rats. The PCNA labeling index reached a maximum at 36 hr and 48 hr in OVX-E and OVX rats, respectively. ERα expression in OVX-E was higher than OVX at 0-36 hr after PHX. In conclusion, these results indicated that estrogen and ERα might play an important role in fat accumulation related to FAT/CD36 during early phase of rat  regeneration.2019 The Japan Society of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593687>Liraglutide ameliorates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis activation via mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a key step in the progression of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), which causes serious health problems worldwide. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor-containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and pyroptosis play crucial roles in the progression of NASH. Our team has provided clinical evidence of the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on the improvement in  function and histological resolution of NAFLD. Preliminary work has demonstrated that GLP-1 inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a mouse model of NAFLD. We further explored the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 analog, in the treatment of NASH. We established a HepG2 cell model of NASH using double stimulation with palmitic  and lipopolysaccharide to assess NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptotic cell activity and to evaluate mitochondrial function and mitophagy. Liraglutide reduced lipid accumulation, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis activation, attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species generation, augmented mitophagy in hepatocytes. Mitophagy inhibition with 3-methyladenine/PINK1-directed siRNA weakened the liraglutide-mediated suppression of inflammatory injury. We propose that liraglutide suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome-induced hepatocyte pyroptosis via mitophagy to slow the progression of NASH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell energy-producing system of mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free   (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the  and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise. Therefore, the results suggest that QH formulation is a safe dietary supplement for amelioration of fatigue and for promoting exercise performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579921>Dietary Garcinol Attenuates Hepatic Pyruvate and Triglyceride Accumulation by Inhibiting P300/CBP-Associated Factor in Mid-to-Late Pregnant Rats.</a></h2><p>Increased hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis are characteristic of pregnancy.The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of garcinol on the amelioration of hepatic pyruvate and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mid-to-late pregnant rats.Forty Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats (aged 9 wk, n = 10/diet) were fed a basal diet (control) or that diet plus garcinol at 100 ppm (Low Gar), 300 ppm (Mid Gar), or 500 ppm (High Gar) for 14 d.

Different strategies have been proposed to attenuate toxicity, including combined therapy with bioactive compounds. This review update mechanisms of action and toxicity of doxorubicin and the role of nutrients like vitamins (A, C, E), minerals (selenium) and n-3 polyunsaturated  . Protective activities against DOX toxicity in , kidney, skin, bone marrow, testicles or brain have been reported, but these have not been evaluated for all of the reviewed nutrients. In most cases oxidation-related effects were present either, by reducing ROS levels and/or increasing antioxidant defenses. Antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are also commonly reported. In some cases, interferences with autophagy and calcium homeostasis also have shown to be affected. Notwithstanding, there is a wide variety in duration and doses of treatment tested for both, compounds and DOX, which make difficult to compare the results of the studies. In spite of the reduction of DOX cardiotoxicity in health models, DOX anti-cancer activity in cancer cell lines or xenograft models usually did not result compromised when this has been evaluated.

Shifting sex hormones that signal the onset of puberty combined with a poor diet consumed in adolescence are likely to have sex-specific, long-term impacts on adult physiology. Here, we expanded upon existing literature to elucidate the sex-specific mechanisms driving physiological deficits following high fructose consumption. Male and female Wistar rats were fed a high fructose diet (55% fructose) beginning post-weaning for a duration of 10 weeks. Female rats on the fructose diet displayed elevated weight gain and extensive  pathology consistent with markers of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Males fed a high fructose diet exhibited increased circulating glucose along with moderate hepatic steatosis. Levels of cytokines and gene expression of inflammatory targets were not altered by fructose consumption in either sex. However, circulating levels of markers for  health, including alanine transaminase, uric , and markers for epithelial cell death, were altered by fructose consumption. Combined with elevated circulating triglycerides, it was evident that  health had deteriorated significantly and that a number of factors were at play. Both adult fructose-fed male and female rats displayed motor deficits that correlated with aberrant structural changes at the neuromuscular junction - however these deficits were exacerbated in males. These data indicate that consumption of a high fructose diet begun in adolescence leads to adult pathology that is modified by sex. Identifying these sex-specific changes has implications for treating clinical presentation of metabolic syndrome and related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581241>A computational model of postprandial adipose tissue lipid metabolism derived using human arteriovenous stable isotope tracer data.</a></h2><p>Given the association of disturbances in non-esterified   (NEFA) metabolism with the development of Type 2 Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic  Disease, computational models of glucose-insulin dynamics have been extended to account for the interplay with NEFA. In this study, we use arteriovenous measurement across the subcutaneous adipose tissue during a mixed meal challenge test to evaluate the performance and underlying assumptions of three existing models of adipose tissue metabolism and construct a new, refined model of adipose tissue metabolism. Our model introduces new terms, explicitly accounting for the conversion of glucose to glyceraldehye-3-phosphate, the postprandial influx of glycerol into the adipose tissue, and several physiologically relevant delays in insulin signalling in order to better describe the measured adipose tissues fluxes. We then applied our refined model to human adipose tissue flux data collected before and after a diet intervention as part of the Yoyo study, to quantify the effects of caloric restriction on postprandial adipose tissue metabolism. Significant increases were observed in the model parameters describing the rate of uptake and release of both glycerol and NEFA.

At present, some of these genes and proteins have been identified but their specific functions are largely unknown. This study was performed to clone and characterize the full-length cDNA sequences of nine key autolysosome-related genes ( and ) from yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. The expression of these genes and the transcriptional responses to a high-fat diet and   (FAs) (palmitic  (PA) and oleic  (OA)) were investigated. The mRNAs of these genes could be detected in heart, , muscle, spleen, brain, mesenteric adipose tissue, intestine, kidney and ovary, but varied with the tissues. In the , the mRNA levels of the nine autolysosome-related genes were lower in fish fed a high-fat diet than those fed the control, indicating that a high-fat diet inhibited formation of autolysosomes. Palmitic  (a saturated FA) significantly inhibited the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h incubation. In contrast, oleic  (an unsaturated FA) significantly induced the formation of autolysosomes at 12 h, but inhibited them at 24 h. At 48 h, the effects of OA incubation on autolysosomes were OA concentration-dependent in primary hepatocytes of P. fulvidraco. The results of flow cytometry and laser confocal observations confirmed these results. PA and OA incubation also increased intracellular non-esterified   (NEFA) concentration at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h, and influenced mRNA levels of   binding protein () and   transport protein 4 () which facilitate FA transport in primary hepatocytes of P. fulvidraco.

Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high-fat diet, develop severe NASH. Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse  revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the  cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher lipid content was present in postnatal day 2 (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in   β-oxidation, and   and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways. Hence, we propose that FSP1cre- mice, which accumulate lipids in their  in early life, may represent a useful animal model to study juvenile NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639589>Early life high-fat diet exposure maintains glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with a  and small brain size in the adult offspring.</a></h2><p>Diet during pregnancy has long lasting consequences on the offspring, warranting a study on the impact of early exposure to a high fat diet on the adult offspring. We hypothesized that a prenatal n-6 enriched diet will have adverse metabolic outcomes on the adult offspring that may be reversed with a postnatal n-3 enriched diet. To test this hypothesis, we examined the adult offspring from three groups: (1) n-6 group: during gestation and lactation, dams consumed an n-6 polyunsaturated   enriched diet, (2) n-3 group: gestational n-6 diet was followed by an n-3 enriched diet during lactation, and (3) a control (CD) group that received standard diet throughout gestation and lactation. Offspring from all groups weaned to a control diet ad libitum. Beginning at postnatal day 2 (P < .03) and persisting at 360 days in males (P < .04), an increase in hypothalamic AgRP expression occurred in the n-6 and n-3 groups, with an increase in food intake (P = .01), and the n-3 group displaying lower body (P < .03) and brain (P < .05) weights. At 360 days, the n-6 and n-3 groups remained glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive, with increased phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (P < .05). n-6 group developed hepatic steatosis with reduced hepatic reflected as higher plasma microRNA-122 (P < .04) that targets pAMPK. We conclude that early life exposure to n-6 and n-3 led to hypothalamic AgRP-related higher food intake, with n-6 culminating in a  partially mitigated by postnatal n-3. While both diets preserved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, postnatal n-3 displayed detrimental effects on the brain.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678516>Scavenger receptor class B, type 1 facilitates cellular   uptake.</a></h2><p>SR-B1 belongs to the class B scavenger receptor, or CD36 super family. SR-B1 and CD36 share an affinity for a wide array of ligands. Although they exhibit similar ligand binding specificity, SR-B1 and CD36 have some very specific lipid transport functions. Whereas SR-B1 primarily facilitates the selective delivery of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and cholesterol from HDL particles to the  and non-placental steroidogenic tissues, as well as participating in cholesterol efflux from cells, CD36 primarily mediates the uptake of long-chain   in high  -requiring organs such as the heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, CD36 also mediates cholesterol efflux and facilitates selective lipoprotein-CE delivery, although less efficiently than SR-B1. Interestingly, the ability or efficiency of SR-B1 to mediate   uptake has not been reported. In this paper, using overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SR-B1, we show that SR-B1 possesses the ability to facilitate   uptake. Moreover, this function is not blocked by BLT-1, a specific chemical inhibitor of HDL-CE uptake activity of SR-B1, nor by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, which inhibits   uptake by CD36.

This study aimed to determine if the ablation of AMPK β1-containing complexes potentiates acute OLZ-induced metabolic dysfunction and if the activation of AMPK β1 suppresses these effects. Female AMPK β1 or wild-type (WT) control mice were treated with OLZ, and changes in blood glucose, serum and  metabolites, whole-body fuel oxidation, and pyruvate-induced increases in blood glucose were measured. Additionally, WT mice were cotreated with OLZ and A769662, a specific AMPK β1 activator, and we determined if cotreatment protected against acute, OLZ-induced metabolic dysfunction. OLZ-induced increases in blood glucose were exacerbated in AMPK β1 mice compared with WT mice, and this was paralleled by greater OLZ-induced increases in markers of  glucose production, such as pyruvate tolerance, serum glucagon, and glucagon responsiveness. Cotreatment with A769662 attenuated OLZ-induced increases in blood glucose, serum nonesterified  , and glycerol. Furthermore, this effect was absent in AMPK β1 mice, consistent with A769662's specificity for the AMPK β1 subunit. Reductions in AMPK activity potentiate the effects of acute OLZ treatment on blood glucose, whereas specifically targeting AMPK β1-containing complexes is sufficient to protect against OLZ-induced hyperglycemia.-Shamshoum, H., Medak, K.

The present study was conducted to investigate transcriptomic responses in the  and jejunal mucosa of pigs to evaluate the effects of different feeding frequencies on the body's metabolism. Twelve Duroc × Landrance × Yorkshire growing pigs with an average initial weight (IW) of 14.86 ± 0.20 kg were randomly assigned to two groups: feeding one time per day (M1) and feeding two times per day (M2); each group consisted of six replicates (pens), with one pig per pen. During the one-month experimental period, pigs in the M1 group were fed on an ad libitum basis at 8:00 am; and the M2 group was fed half of the standard feeding requirement at 8:00 am and adequate feed at 16:00 pm. The results showed that average daily feed intake, average daily gain, feed:gain, and the organ indices were not significantly different between the two groups ( > 0.05). The total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in the serum, and the TG concentration in the  in the M2 groups were significant lower than those in the M1 group, while the T-CHO concentration in the  were significant higher in the M2 group ( < 0.05).

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of  cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and  cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the  and brain, but in the  it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis.

We examined, in rats, (1) the pharmacokinetic profile of oral URB937; (2) the compound's ability to elevate levels of the representative FAAH substrate, oleoylethanolamide (OEA); and (3) the compound's tolerability after oral administration.We developed a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method to measure URB937 and used a pre-existing LC/MS-MS assay to quantify OEA. FAAH activity was measured using a radioactive substrate. The tolerability of single or repeated (once daily for 2 weeks) oral administration of supramaximal doses of URB937 (100, 300, 1000 mg/kg) was assessed by monitoring food intake, water intake and body weight, followed by post-mortem evaluation of organ structure.URB937 was orally available in male rats (F = 36%), but remained undetectable in brain when administered at doses that maximally inhibit FAAH activity and elevate OEA in plasma and . Acute and subchronic treatment with high doses of URB937 was well-tolerated and resulted in FAAH inhibition in brain.Pain remains a major unmet medical need.

Studies have indicated, however, that the onset of NAFLD occurs during pre-diabetes, a condition that often precedes the onset of T2DM. Oleanolic  has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in diet-induced pre-diabetes; however, the effects of this triterpene on  function have not been evaluated.This study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effects of oleanolic  (OA) on selected markers of NAFLD in a pre-diabetes rat model.Pre-diabetes was induced by exposing Sprague Dawley rats to a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/ weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and  damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682409>Inhibition of Mitochondrial   Oxidation Contributes to Development of Nonalcoholic  Disease Induced by Environmental Cadmium Exposure.</a></h2><p>Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most prevalent toxic metal pollutants widely distributed in water and soil environments.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal  transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal  transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

However, chronic treatment with GCs in clinical settings has a series of side effects, such as metabolic disorders, gut microbiota dysbiosis and neurological impairment. Therefore, searching for a functional substance that can alleviate these side effects is greatly meaningful to clinical patients. Crocin is the main active ingredient of saffron, which has been reported to have numerous pharmacological activities. However, the action of crocin-I, one major member of the crocin family, on the physiological mediation in the individuals receiving GC treatment remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of crocin-I on lipid metabolism and the gut microbiota in a mouse model of chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment. Our findings showed that crocin-I reduced the levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol and the ratio of low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein in the serum of CORT-treated mice. In addition, transcriptome analysis revealed that crocin-I was effective in mediating the amelioration of lipid metabolism, mainly in   metabolism and steroid biosynthesis in CORT-treated mice. Moreover, metabolome analysis demonstrated that crocin-I could restore the disturbed metabolites in the  of CORT-treated mice, most of which are long-chain  . Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of 16s rRNA revealed that crocin-I could mitigate the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota caused by CORT at a dose of 40 mg kg-1, by resulting in a significant increase in the alpha diversity of the microbes in the cecal contents and a significant reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, whereas by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic  -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial   oxidation to inhibit hepatic   accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance.

Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of probiotics, bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), fecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the  and are currently being tested in different  diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the  offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the .

The zebrafish (Danio rerio), is a small freshwater fish considered an appropriate vertebrate model for investigating the toxicity of compounds. Previous investigations showed tissue-specific bioaccumulation and alterations in the expression of   binding proteins (fabps) in male and female zebrafish, potentially due to interactions between PFAS and   transporters. In addition, a number of neurological impacts have been reported as a result of human and animal exposure to PFAS. Therefore, this comprehensive study was designed to investigate whether PFOS exposure affects the expression of genes associated with   metabolism (fabp1a, fabp2, and fabp10a) in zebrafish , intestine, heart, and ovary and genes involved in the nervous system (ChAT, ngf, bdnf, AChE, and hdac6) in brain and muscle. Results indicate alterations in expression of genes associated with   metabolism and neural function that vary with both exposure concentration and sex. Additionally, our findings highlight that the expression of these genes differ according to exposure duration. Our results extend the knowledge base on PFOS effects to other tissues less often studied than the . The findings of this investigation provide a basis for future studies on the potential risks of PFOS as one of the most abundant PFAS in the environment. This article is protected by copyright.

It has been demonstrated that the total extracts from EL could significantly inhibit the joint swelling in MSU-induced acute gout arthritis rat model at middle and high doses (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), as meanwhile, better performance than that of positive control (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) has been observed at the dose of 10 g/kg. Aiming to search potential compounds and probable mechanisms, network pharmacology, molecular docking and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were adopted, leading to the hypothesis of 17 targets related to different pathogenesis of gout and 5 potential compounds (C36, C107, C124, C125 and C130) among 156 selected compounds, playing synergetic role with multiple targets. Instead of the guiding ideology of "a gene, a drug, a disease", varieties of compounds but not a single one from EL display holistic performance through multiple pathways with multi-targets. It was noteworthy that Xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH), Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2),  -binding protein,  (FABP1), Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) were the key targets with intensely interaction. Furthermore, the functional enrichment analysis indicated that EL probably produced the gout protection effects by synergistic regulation in multiple biological pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, etc.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and  carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7  cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and   oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and Hnf4A, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7  cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced   oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the  as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted   analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to   oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576253> slice culture as a model for lipid metabolism in fish.</a></h2><p>Hepatic lipid metabolism is traditionally investigated in vitro using hepatocyte monocultures lacking the complex three-dimensional structure and interacting cell types essential  function. Precision cut  slice (PCLS) culture represents an alternative in vitro system, which benefits from retention of tissue architecture. Here, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of the PCLS method in fish (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L.) and validate it in the context of lipid metabolism using feeding trials, extensive transcriptomic data, and   measurements. We observe an initial period of post-slicing global transcriptome adjustment, which plateaued after 3 days in major metabolic pathways and stabilized through 9 days. PCLS fed alpha-linolenic  (ALA) and insulin responded in a -like manner, increasing lipid biosynthesis gene expression. We identify interactions between insulin and ALA, where two PUFA biosynthesis genes that were induced by insulin or ALA alone, were highly down-regulated when insulin and ALA were combined. We also find that transcriptomic profiles of  slices are exceedingly more similar to whole  than hepatocyte monocultures, both for lipid metabolism and  marker genes. PCLS culture opens new avenues for high throughput experimentation on the effect of "novel feed composition" and represent a promising new strategy for studying genotype-specific molecular features of metabolism.© 2019 Harvey et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661783>A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic  (22:6, ω3) Mediated Attenuation of Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male  Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated   and arachidonic  (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576092>Zinc-α2-glycoprotein 1 attenuates non-alcoholic  disease by negatively regulating tumour necrosis factor-α.</a></h2><p>Zinc-α2-glycoprotein 1 (AZGP1) plays important roles in metabolism-related diseases. The underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic effects of AZGP1 remain unknown in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).To explore the effects and potential mechanism of AZGP1 on NAFLD  and .The expression of AZGP1 and its effects on hepatocytes were examined in NAFLD patients, CCl-treated mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), and human LO2 cells.AZGP1 levels were significantly decreased in  tissues of NAFLD patients and mice. AZGP1 knockdown was found to activate inflammation; enhance steatogenesis, including promoting lipogenesis [sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c,  X receptor (LXR),   synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD)-1], increasing lipid transport and accumulation [  transport protein (FATP), carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT)-1A, and adiponectin], and reducing   β-oxidation [farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α]; accelerate proliferation; and reverse apoptosis in LO2 cells. AZGP1 overexpression (OV-AZGP1) had the opposite effects. Furthermore, AZGP1 alleviated NAFLD by blocking TNF-α-mediated inflammation and intracellular lipid deposition, promoting proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis in LO2 cells. Finally, treatment with OV-AZGP1 plasmid dramatically improved  injury and eliminated  fat in NAFLD mice.AZGP1 attenuates NAFLD with regard to ameliorating inflammation, accelerating lipolysis, promoting proliferation, and reducing apoptosis by negatively regulating TNF-α.

The present study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of inhibiting lipid accumulation in free   (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells caused by bark and fruit extracts of  (TSB and TSF). FFA induced lipid and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, which was attenuated by TSB and TSF. TSB and/or TSF promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha upregulation. Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced  X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1,   synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism.

RNA-seq of ileum tissue revealed up-regulation of several genes involved in cell proliferation and stem cell renewal, and anti-microbial defense (including Alpi and Leap2) in fat-1 vs WT mice fed ethanol.  fat-1 mice were also resistant to ethanol-mediated down-regulation of genes important for xenobiotic/bile  detoxification.  Further, gut microbiome and plasma metabolomics revealed several changes in fat-1 vs. WT mice that may contribute to a reduced inflammatory response.  Finally, these data correlated with a significant reduction in  injury.  Our study suggests that w3-PUFA enrichment or treatment with resolvins can attenuate the disruption in alcohol-induced intestinal homeostasis caused by ethanol consumption and systemic inflammation with a concomitant reduction in  injury.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623374>A Nutraceutical Rich in Docosahexaenoic  Improves Portal Hypertension in a Preclinical Model of Advanced Chronic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the pathophysiology of advanced chronic  disease (ACLD) and portal hypertension (PH).

We investigated the effects of two-week DHA supplementation (500 mg/kg) on hepatic  , PH, oxidative stress, inflammation, and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) phenotype in rats with ACLD. Additionally, the effects of DHA were evaluated in murine macrophages and human HSC. In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, cirrhotic rats receiving DHA reestablished a healthy hepatic   profile, which was associated with an improvement in PH. The mechanisms underlying this hemodynamic improvement included a reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as a marked HSC deactivation, confirmed in human HSC. Experiments with cultured macrophages showed that treatment with DHA protects against pro-inflammatory insults. The present preclinical study demonstrates that a nutraceutical rich in DHA significantly improves PH in chronic  disease mainly by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress-driven HSC activation, encouraging its evaluation as a new treatment for PH and cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548551>First demonstration of protective effects of purified mushroom polysaccharide-peptides against  injury and the mechanisms involved.</a></h2><p> (FLD) disease is a consequence of metabolic syndrome, which is a health problem worldwide with a phenomenal rise in prevalence.

Attachment of ligand to the PPAR-γ receptor activates a series of genes that are involved in glucose and   metabolism, the overall effect being an increase in insulin effect. The thiazolidinediones reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and act additively with other antidiabetic medications. Troglitazone was the first thiazolidinedione that received approval for use in the United States (January 1997). However, within a year of its approval, reports of severe  injury and deaths from acute  failure began to appear. Cautionary statements and recommendations for monitoring of ALT levels were made, but after more than two dozen reports of hepatic failure and the introduction of two new thiazolidinediones in 1999, troglitazone was withdrawn from use in 2000. The newer thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been associated with only rare instances of acute  injury. Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are linked to increased weight gain, heart failure and fracture risk and they are considered second-line agents for type 2 diabetes and recommended only after failure of metformin and lifestyle modifications.

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The  insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001),  insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic  Metabolism and Signaling in  Cancer.</a></h2><p> cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for  cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic  disorders and their progression to  cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to  cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of  cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation,  steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of  fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both  fibrosis progression and  cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652406>The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic  in rats with orotic -induced non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Post-transplantation non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is common in  transplant recipients.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties.

IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free   oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free   into the , improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free   levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic  accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal  function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and  function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased lipogenesis and worsened   oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved lipogenesis and   oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether epigenetics and environmental factors interact to promote progressive NAFLD during IR. We examined the miRNA signature in insulin receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR-NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro. InsR+/- HSCs displayed 36 differentially expressed miRNAs ( < 0.05 vs. wt), whose expression was then analyzed in the  of InsR+/- mice fed an MCD diet. We found that miR-101-3p negatively associated with both InsR+/- genotype and MCD ( < 0.05) and the histological spectrum of  damage ( < 0.01). miR-101-3p was reduced in InsR+/- hepatocytes and HSCs and even more in InsR+/- cells exposed to insulin (0.33 µM) and   (0.25 mM), resembling the IR-NASH model. Conversely, insulin induced miR-101-3p expression in wt cells but not in InsR+/- ones ( < 0.05). In conclusion, IR combined with diet-induced  injury favors miR-101-3p downregulation, which may promote progressive NAFLD through HSC and hepatocyte transdifferentiation and proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612395>Curcumin Recovers Intracellular Lipid Droplet Formation Through Increasing Perilipin 5 Gene Expression in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells In Vitro.</a></h2><p>The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a major event during hepatic fibrogenesis. Restoration of intracellular lipid droplet (LD) formation turns the activated HSC back to a quiescent state. Our previous studies have shown that curcumin suppresses HSC activation through increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, gamma (PPARγ) and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities. This study aims at evaluating the effect of curcumin on lipid accumulation in HSCs and hepatocytes, and further elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Now we showed that curcumin increased LD formation in activated HSCs and stimulated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein and   synthase, and reduced the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase. Exogenous perilin5 expression in primary HSCs promoted LD formation. Perilipin 5 siRNA eliminated curcumin-induced LD formation in HSCs. These results suggest that curcumin recovers LD formation and lipid accumulation in activated HSCs by increasing perilipin 5 gene expression. Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK or PPARγ activity blocked curcumin's effect on Plin5 gene expression and LD formation. Our results provide a novel evidence in vitro for curcumin as a safe, effective candidate to treat  fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665653>Enrichment of brain docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is highly dependent upon the molecular carrier of dietary DHA: lysophosphatidylcholine is more efficient than either phosphatidylcholine or triacylglycerol.</a></h2><p>Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is highly concentrated in the brain, and its deficiency is associated with several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease. However, the currently used supplements do not appreciably enrich brain DHA, although they enrich most other tissues. We tested the hypothesis that the ability of the dietary carrier to augment brain DHA depends upon the generation of DHA-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), the preferred carrier of DHA across the blood brain barrier. We compared the efficacy of DHA-triacylglycerol (TAG), di-DHA phosphatidylcholine (PC) and DHA-LPC to enrich brain DHA following their gavage to normal rats for 30 days, all at a dose of 10 mg DHA/day. The results show that DHA from TAG, which is released as free DHA or monoacylglycerol during digestion and is absorbed as TAG in chylomicrons, was incorporated preferentially into adipose tissue and heart but not into brain. In contrast, LPC-DHA increased brain DHA by up to 100% but had no effect on adipose tissue. Di-DHA PC, which generates both free DHA and LPC-DHA during the digestion, enriched DHA in brain, as well as in heart and . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was increased by di-DHA PC and DHA-LPC, but not by TAG-DHA, showing that enrichment of brain DHA correlated with its functional effect. We conclude that dietary DHA from TAG or from natural PC (sn-2 position) is not suitable for brain enrichment, whereas DHA from LPC (at either sn-1 or sn-2 position) or from sn-1 position of PC efficiently enriches the brain and is functionally effective.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662869>Individualized risk prediction of significant fibrosis in non-alcoholic  disease using a novel nomogram.</a></h2><p>Fibrosis is deemed to be a pivotal determinant of the long-term prognosis in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).We aimed to develop a novel nomogram-based non-invasive model to accurately predict significant fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.We designed a prospective cohort study including 207 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Detailed anthropometric and fibrosis-related laboratory parameters were collected. A nomogram was established based on variables that were independently associated with significant fibrosis identified by the logistic regression model. Then it was compared with aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FIB-4 and BARD score. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed according to area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and decision curve analysis.Variables included in the nomogram were: waist-to-height ratio, hyaluronic , procollagen-III-peptide, chitinase-3-like protein 1, and cytokeratine-18 neoepitope M65. The discrimination ability of the nomogram (AUROC = 0.829, 95%CI 0.755-0.904) was significantly superior to APRI (AUROC = 0.670, 95%CI 0.563-0.777), NFS (AUROC = 0.601, 95%CI 0.480-0.722), FIB-4 (AUROC = 0.624, 95%CI 0.511-0.736) and BARD (AUROC = 0.579, 95%CI 0.459-0.699) for significant fibrosis (all  < 0.05). The nomogram showed a larger net benefit to aid in decision-making as to whether biopsy is required.This novel nomogram was more accurate, and achieved higher net benefit than APRI, NFS, FIB-4 and BARD to detect significant fibrosis.

Since skeletal muscle regenerative capacity is regulated by satellite cells, we aimed to investigate whether a high-fat diet impairs satellite cell function and whether this is linked to   uptake via CD36. We also aimed to determine whether loss of CD36 impacts on muscle redox homeostasis and skeletal muscle regenerative capacity.We studied the impact of a high-fat diet and CD36 deficiency on murine skeletal muscle morphology, redox homeostasis, satellite cell function, bioenergetics and lipid accumulation in the . We also determined the effect of CD36 deficiency on skeletal muscle regeneration.High-fat diet increased body weight, intramuscular lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in wild-type mice that were significantly mitigated in CD36-deficient mice. High-fat diet and CD36 deficiency independently attenuated satellite cell function on single fibres and myogenic capacity on primary satellite cells. CD36 deficiency resulted in delayed skeletal muscle regeneration following acute injury with cardiotoxin. CD36-deficient and wild-type primary satellite cells had distinct bioenergetic profiles in response to palmitate. High-fat diet induced hepatic steatosis in both genotypes that was more pronounced in the CD36-deficient mice.This study demonstrates that CD36 deficiency protects against diet-induced obesity, intramuscular lipid deposition and oxidative stress but results in impaired muscle satellite cell function, delayed muscle regeneration and hepatic steatosis.

Malignant transformation is an exceptionally rare complication of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1A)-inactivated hepatocellular adenomas. This subtype is characterized by loss of    binding protein immunoexpression. In this study, we characterized the histopathologic spectrum of 13    binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma cases showing malignant transformation from multiple centers. Clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients were evaluated. Stains for reticulin,    binding protein, beta-catenin and glutamine synthetase were applied to these lesions. Moreover, the findings were compared to patients with β-catenin mutated hepatocellular adenoma.    binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenomas with borderline features/carcinoma were seen predominantly in females (77%) with an average age of 46 ± 18 years and multiple lesions (77%; five patients with adenomatosis). Meanwhile, β-catenin mutated hepatocellular adenoma patients with malignant transformation were predominantly male (67%, p = 0.018) with single lesion (86%, p = 0.0009). The largest    binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma nodule in each patient ranged from 4 to 15.5 cm. Loss of    binding protein by immunohistochemistry was noted in all adenoma and borderline/carcinoma components. Features of malignant transformation were pseudoglandular architecture (85%), cytologic atypia (85%), architectural atypia (100%) and lack of steatosis (100%). Other findings included myxoid change (39%), peliosis (46%) and sinusoidal dilatation (46%). Molecular studies confirmed somatic inactivation of HNF1A in 3 cases and absence of TERT promotor and exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations in five cases. To summarize,    binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma with malignant transformation is most frequently seen in female patients with multiple lesions. Most of these lesions demonstrate pseudoglandular architecture, cytologic and architectural atypia, with lack of steatosis. The natural history of these lesions is relatively benign with the exception of disease recurrence in 1 patient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676438>Circadian profiling reveals distinct regulation of endocannabinoid system in the rat plasma,  and adrenal glands by light-dark and feeding cycles.</a></h2><p>Circadian clocks coordinate physiological and behavioral rhythms that allow the organism to anticipate and adapt to daily changes in environment. The clock-driven cellular oscillations are highly tissue specific to efficiently fine-tune local signaling, manage energy use and segregate incompatible processes. In most peripheral tissues, food acts as the main cue that entrains the oscillations to external time. Food intake and energy balance are under control of endocannabinoid (EC) signaling. Despite this obvious link between the circadian and EC systems, evidence for their interaction started to emerge only recently. We used targeted lipidomics to analyze circadian variations in EC tone in rat plasma,  and adrenal tissue. The results provide the evidence that ECs, monoacylglycerols, N-acylethanolamines and their precursors oscillate with a tissue-specific circadian phase in plasma and . We then identified a set of rhythmically expressed genes likely responsible for the variations in EC tissue tone. In contrast to the , EC levels did not oscillate in the adrenal glands. Instead, we revealed that local EC receptor genes are under circadian regulation. To explore the impact of metabolic signals on expression of these genes, we used daytime-restricted feeding schedule. We subsequently showed that daytime feeding strongly suppressed -expressed   binding protein 5 (Fabp5) and adrenal-expressed non-canonical endocannabinoid receptors Gpr55 and Trpv1, whereas it upregulated -expressed Trpv1 and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1 (Gde1).

Recently, we discovered that DNAs targeting microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) hold the potential for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders (type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD)) by turning fat-storing white adipocytes into fat-burning adipocytes. In this work, we explored the effects of chemical modifications, including phosphorothioate (PS), locked nucleic  (LNA), and peptide nucleic  (PNA), on the structure and energy of DNA analogs by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To achieve a reliable prediction of the hybridization free energy, the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the free energy perturbation technique were employed. The calculated hybridization free energies are generally compatible with previous experiments. For LNA and PNA, the enhanced duplex stability can be explained by the preorganization mechanism, i.e., the single strands adopt stable helical structures similar to those in the duplex. For PS, the S and R isomers (Sp and Rp) have preferences for C2'-endo and C3'-endo sugar puckering conformations, respectively, and therefore Sp is less stable than Rp in DNA/RNA hybrids. In addition, the solvation penalty of Rp accounts for its destabilization effect. PS-LNA is similar to LNA as the sugar puckering is dominated by the locked sugar ring. This work demonstrated that MD simulations with polarizable force fields are useful for the understanding and design of modified nucleic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614732>Sp1 is Involved in Vertebrate LC-PUFA Biosynthesis by Upregulating the Expression of  Desaturase and Elongase Genes.</a></h2><p>The rabbitfish  was the first marine teleost demonstrated to have the ability for the biosynthesis of long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated   (LC-PUFA) from C18 PUFA precursors, and all the catalytic enzymes including two  acyl desaturase 2 (Δ4 Fads2 and Δ6/Δ5 Fads2) and two elongases (Elovl4 and Elovl5) have been identified, providing a good model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in fish. Stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1) has been speculated to be a vital transcription factor in determining the promoter activity of Fads-like genes in fish, however its regulatory effects on gene expression and LC-PUFA biosynthesis have not been demonstrated. Bioinformatic analysis predicted potential Sp1 binding sites in the promoters of the rabbitfish Δ6/Δ5  and , but not in Δ4  promoter. Here we cloned full-length cDNA of the rabbitfish  gene, which encoded a putative protein of 701 amino , and was expressed in all tissues studied with highest levels in gill and eyes. The dual luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 line cells demonstrated the importance of the Sp1 binding site for the promoter activities of both Δ6/Δ5  and . Moreover, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed the direct interaction of Sp1 with the two promoters. Insertion of the Sp1 binding site of Δ6/Δ5  promoter into the corresponding region of the Δ4  promoter significantly increased activity of the latter. In the  hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells, mRNA levels of Δ6/Δ5  and  were positively correlated with the expression of  when  was overexpressed or knocked-down by RNAi or antagonist (mithramycin) treatment. Moreover, overexpression of  also led to a higher conversion of 18:2n-6 to 18:3n-6, 18:2n-6 to 20:2n-6, and 18:3n-3 to 20:3n-3, which related to the functions of Δ6/Δ5 Fads2 and Elovl5, respectively. These results indicated that Sp1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis by directly targeting Δ6/Δ5  and  in rabbitfish, which is the first report of Sp1 involvement in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640217>Characterization of Lipid Profiles after Dietary Intake of Polyunsaturated   Using Integrated Untargeted and Targeted Lipidomics.</a></h2><p>Illuminating the comprehensive lipid profiles after dietary supplementation of polyunsaturated   (PUFAs) is crucial to revealing the tissue distribution of PUFAs in living organisms, as well as to providing novel insights into lipid metabolism.

However, salmon can also convert α-linolenic  (18:3n-3) into eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3) by sequential desaturation and elongation reactions, which can be modified by 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 intake. In mammals, dietary 20:5n-3 + 22:6n-3 intake can modify Fads2 expression (Δ6 desaturase) via altered DNA methylation of its promoter. Decreasing dietary fish oil (FO) has been shown to increase Δ5fad expression in salmon . However, it is not known whether this is associated with changes in the DNA methylation of genes involved in polyunsaturated   synthesis. To address this, we investigated whether changing the proportions of dietary FO and vegetable oil altered the DNA methylation of Δ6fad_b, Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b promoters in  and muscle from Atlantic salmon and whether any changes were associated with mRNA expression. Higher dietary FO content increased the proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and decreased Δ6fad_b mRNA expression in , but there was no effect on Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b expression. There were significant differences between  and skeletal muscle in the methylation of individual CpG loci in all four genes studied. Methylation of individual Δ6fad_b CpG loci was negatively related to its expression and to proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the .

Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the  due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with  fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and  fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the  tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the  than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced   translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells.

The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic  to muricholic  (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non-NASH individuals to NASH individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of NASH: steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular inflammation (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of NASH patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict NASH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts.

BALB/cBy strain mice derived from BALB/c strain are deficient in SCAD activity because of a spontaneous deletion in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases () gene. Adiposity, lipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity were compared in BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice subjected to high-fat diets (HFDs). A whole hepatic transcriptome profiling experiment with microarrays was performed to evaluate the mechanisms by which SCAD deficiency protects against insulin resistance. -deficient mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance as compared with control mice. Reduced obesity results from decreased triglyceride content due to activation of AMPK in  that would reduce hepatic content of malonyl-CoA, resulting in decreased hepatic  lipogenesis. Improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced diacylglycerol content commensurate with reduced PKC-ε activity and increased protein kinase B (AKT) activation in  and skeletal muscle.

Saturated   (SFA) and mono unsaturated   (MUFA) were not increased in CLA treated groups. There was tissue specific sensing of CLA, since subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression of PPARA was downregulated, however, CPT1A tended to be upregulated in  of CLAL group only (P = 0.09).

Machine learning applied to high-resolution metabolomics and clinical phenotype data offers a novel framework for developing a NAFLD screening panel in youth. Here, untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on plasma samples from a combined cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents ages 2-25 years old with NAFLD (n = 222) and without NAFLD (n = 337), confirmed by  biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging. Anthropometrics, blood lipids,  enzymes, and glucose and insulin metabolism were also assessed. A machine learning approach was applied to the metabolomics and clinical phenotype data sets, which were split into training and test sets, and included dimension reduction, feature selection, and classification model development. The selected metabolite features were the amino  serine, leucine/isoleucine, and tryptophan; three putatively annotated compounds (dihydrothymine and two phospholipids); and two unknowns. The selected clinical phenotype variables were waist circumference, whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) based on the oral glucose tolerance test, and blood triglycerides. The highest performing classification model was random forest, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 97% for detecting NAFLD cases. A second classification model was developed using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance substituted for the WBISI.

The identified screening panel consisting of both metabolomics and clinical features has promising potential for screening for NAFLD in youth. Further development of this panel and independent validation testing in other cohorts are warranted.© 2019 The Authors.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the , is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in  biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in  progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the  of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing   β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic  disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the  in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid metabolism has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid metabolism as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and   derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of   –binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype. This chapter focuses on metabolic reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid metabolism as hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright: The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602228>Germacrone cooperates with dexmedetomidine to alleviate high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus via upregulating AMPKα1 expression.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of germacrone (GM) and dexmedetomidine (DEX) in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2DM rat model was established. The experimental rats were divided into the control group, HFD group, GM treatment group, DEX treatment group and GM + DEX treatment group. In addition, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C (CC) was used to inhibit AMPKα1 expression. All rats received their respective treatment daily for 21 days. Blood glucose and lipid levels, apoptosis of hepatic cells, and levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress indicators in serum samples were evaluated. Protein expression of AMPKα1 and its downstream targets were also investigated. Results demonstrated that blood glucose concentration, blood lipid indicators (endothelin, total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol), cell apoptosis in  tissues, total oxidant status, malondialdehyde, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β levels in serum were increased in the high-fat group compared to the control but decreased following GM and/or DEX treatment. By contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and antioxidative stress indicator superoxide dismutase (SOD) were decreased in the high-fat group but increased following GM and/or DEX treatment. Protein expression of AMPKα1 and the catabolic genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and acyl coenzyme A were decreased whilst anabolic genes, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c,   synthase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, were increased in the HFD group. These effects were attenuated by GM and/or DEX treatment. AMPKα1 inhibition resulted in decreased SOD and increased cell apoptosis in  tissues as well as increased IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β levels compared with the HFD group. However, these effects were abolished following treatment with CC, GM and DEX together. Taken together these results indicated that GM worked synergistically with DEX to attenuate symptoms of high-fat-induced T2DM, with the effect potentially involving an increase in AMPKα1 expression.Copyright: © Sun et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639282>Cadmium and nickel co-exposure exacerbates genotoxicity and not oxido-inflammatory stress in  and kidney of rats: Protective role of omega-3  .</a></h2><p>The present study examined the influence of co-exposure to cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) on hepatorenal function as well as the protective role of omega-3 polyunsaturated   (ω-3FA) in rats. The animals were exposed to Cd (5 mg/kg) and Ni (150 μg/L in drinking water) singly or co-exposed to both metals and ω-3FA at 20 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Results showed that hepatorenal injury resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was not aggravated in the co-exposure group. Moreover, ω-3FA markedly abrogated the reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities, the increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and lipid peroxidation induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure. Additionally, ω-3FA administration markedly suppressed the increase in hepatic and renal myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 β levels in the co-exposure group. Genotoxicity resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was intensified in the co-exposure group. However, ω-3FA administration markedly ameliorated the genotoxicity and histological lesions in the co-exposure group. Taken together, co-exposure to Cd and Ni aggravated genotoxicity and not oxido-inflammatory stress in the  and kidney of rats. ω-3FA abated hepatorenal injury and genotoxicity induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure in rats.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593012>The Prevalence of Nonalcoholic  Pancreas by Endoscopic Ultrasonography.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic steatosis or  pancreas refers to the fat accumulation in the pancreas, which can lead to inflammation and fibrosis, β-cell dysfunction, fibrosis, and, possibly, pancreatic cancer.

We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, gut microbiota and clinical symptoms.We included hospital inpatients with a history of chronic alcohol overconsumption. For comparison, we included control patients with a low alcohol intake. Cytokine levels (TGF-β1, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-γ, MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-1β and IL-17) were determined using a customized V-plex assay. We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of Proteobacteria and Faecalibacterium, percentage of the short-chain   butyrate, psychiatric symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and biochemical  variables.We included 28 patients with alcohol overconsumption (79% men), and 25 control patients (72% men). Patients with alcohol overconsumption had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.002), IFN-γ (p = 0.018) and MCP-1 (p = 0.006), and lower levels of TGF-β1 (p = 0.017) compared with control patients. Inverse correlations were found between Proteobacteria abundance and TNF-α (R = -0.55, p = 0.02) and IL-8 (R = -0.58, p = 0.014), and between Faecalibacterium and MCP-1 levels (R = -0.56, p = 0.02) in the control patients, but not in patients with alcohol overconsumption. Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more psychiatric symptoms, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and biochemical  variables, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin.Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic inflammatory activity, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1).

With the current study we aimed to verify the modulatory effect of endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)-signaling on perilipin 2 (PLIN2)-mediated lipophagy. Here, we demonstrate that a global knockout of the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CB1) reduced the expression of the lipid droplet binding protein PLIN2 in the livers of CB1 and hepatitis B surface protein (HBs)-transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. In addition, the pharmacologic activation and antagonization of CB1 in cell culture also caused an induction or reduction of PLIN2, respectively. The decreased PLIN2 expression was associated with suppressed lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and enhanced autophagy as shown by increased colocalization of LC3B with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in HBs/CB1 mice. The induction of autophagy was further supported by the increased expression of LAMP1 in CB1 and HBs/CB1 mice. LAMP1 and PLIN2 were co-localized in HBs/CB1 indicating autophagy of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) i.e., lipophagy. Lipolysis of lipid droplets was additionally indicated by elevated expression of lysosomal  lipase. In conclusion, these results suggest that loss of CB1 signaling leads to reduced PLIN2 abundance, which triggers lipophagy. Our new findings about the association between CB1 signaling and PLIN2 may stimulate translational studies analyzing new diagnostic and therapeutic options for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675670>Ginsenoside Rg1 ameliorates palmitic -induced insulin resistance in HepG2 cells in association with modulating Akt and JNK activity.</a></h2><p>Hepatic insulin resistance can be induced by excess dietary intake of saturated fat. Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate  diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic  (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance model in vitro.Insulin resistance in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic insulin resistance via preserving insulin signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Methyl ferulic  (MFA) is a biologically active monomer isolated from the root of  Hasskarl. It has been reported that MFA has a hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-induced  injury  and . However, the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced insulin resistance in ALD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether MFA could exert protective effects against hepatic insulin resistance in ethanol-induced L-02 cells and ALD rats. ALD was induced in vivo by feeding Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% (w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to Sprague-Dawley rats. Insulin resistance was induced  in human hepatocyte L-02 cells with 200 mM ethanol for 24 h followed by 10-7 nM insulin for 30 min. MFA exhibited the effects of inhibited insulin resistance, reduced enzymatic capacity for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis both  and . In addition, the results of transcriptome sequencing of  tissues in the ethanol- and MFA-treated groups indicated that "pyruvate metabolism," "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis," and "  metabolism" were significantly different between ethanol- and MFA-treated groups. Further studies suggested that MFA activated the hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway  and . Taken together, these findings suggested that MFA effectively ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in ALD at least partially by acting on the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619635>In Vivo Colonic Fermentation of Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.): Important Correlations Observed among the Physiological Parameters of Cecum, , Adipose Tissue and Fasting Serum Lipid Profile.</a></h2><p>High amylose corn starch (HAS), whole grain sorghum (S-Wh), refined sorghum (S-Rf) and α-corn starch (CON) diets were fed to animals for 1 mo aiming to examine the physiological effects of resistant starch inclusion in the diet from grains.

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting - β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553780>Lipid and   dynamics by maternal Pacific bluefin tuna.</a></h2><p>Lipid and   composition of female Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF, Thunnus orientalis) reproductive and somatic tissues in southwestern North Pacific and Sea of Japan spawning grounds are compared. Total lipid (TL) levels are higher in  than white muscle tissues. An increased gonadosomatic index (GSI) during the early spawning season coincided with decreased TL. Levels of triacylglycerols (TAG) in PBF  tissues from the Nansei Islands and Sea of Japan, and white muscle in fishes from the Sea of Japan, decreased during the spawning season, while TAG in ovary tissues did not. Concurrent reductions in TL and increases in GSI early in the spawning season suggest TAG depletion was caused by allocation from  and white muscle tissues to oocytes, that the  is one of the important lipid-storage organs in PBF, and this species mostly reliant on capital deposits as a mixed capital-income breeder.

Since the obesity epidemic coincided with societal change in dietary fat consumption, rather than amount, manipulation of   (FA) profile is an under-investigated area of study. Additionally, the binding of FAs to nuclear receptors may have persistent intergenerational, extranutritive endocrinological effects that interact with the actions of reproductive steroids causing sex-dependent effects. To determine the role of FA type in the effects underlying maternal HFD, we fed wild-type C57BL6/J mating pairs, from preconception through lactation, a HFD with high saturated fat levels from coconut oil or high linoleic  (LA) levels from vegetable oil. Male and female offspring body weight and food intake were measured weekly for 25 weeks. Assays for glucose metabolism, body composition, and calorimetry were performed at 25 weeks. Plasma metabolic peptides and  mRNA were measured terminally. Obesity was primarily affected by adult rather than maternal diet in males, yet in females, maternal HFD potentiated the effects of adult HFD. Maternal HFD high in LA impaired glucose disposal in males weaned onto HFD and insulin sensitivity of females. Plasma leptin correlated with adiposity, but insulin and insulin receptor expression in the  were altered by maternal LA in males.

We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human  biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by  fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of  biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and  assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total  cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile  output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced   β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in  glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in .These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we study the effect of Zingiber officinale and omega-3   on ER stress for treating NAFLD. Male Wistar rats were fed on a normal diet (control group) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. The HFD rats were later treated with vehicle, omega-3 or with Z. officinale extract. HFD group demonstrated significantly more body weight gain and higher plasma lipid profile, glucose, and hepatic enzymes. The expressions of lipogenic ChREBP and ER stress genes CHOP, XBP1, and GRP78 were increased. This was accompanied by intrahepatic fat accumulation visualized by hepatic morphology and H&E-stained sections. Treatment with Z. officinale and omega-3   reverted these changes into a normal healthy state. From these results, we prove that both therapeutic approaches can be potential drugs for treating NAFLD besides other ER stress-associated diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The effect of Zingiber officinale extract and omega-3   on ER stress associated with NAFLD was investigated. The results revealed that Z. officinale extract and omega-3   significantly inhibited ER stress and intrahepatic fat accumulation with the upper hand for Z. officinale extract. Both can be used as future promising therapies for the treatment of NAFLD patients and also treating different diseases that involve ER stress as a pathological modulator like diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601335>[Case-control study of the relationship between dietary   intake and non-alcoholic  disease in Nanping City, 2015-2017].</a></h2><p>To explore the relationship between different kinds of dietary   intake and non-alcoholic  disease(NAFLD).A 1↿ frequency matched case-control study was conducted among 546 NAFLD patients diagnosed by ultrasound as case group, 546 people without NAFLD randomly selected and matched by sex and age(±5) as control group from April 2015 to August 2017 in Nanping first hospital.

Although neonicotinoids display a high specificity for insects, their use has been recently debated since several studies led to the hypothesis that they may have adverse ecological effects and potential risks to mammals and even humans. Due to their hydrophobic nature, neonicotinoids need specific carriers to allow their distribution in body fluids. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant plasma protein, is a key carrier of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The in silico docking and ligand binding properties of acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam to HSA are here reported. Neonicotinoids bind to multiple   (FA) binding sites, preferentially to the FA1 pocket, with high affinity. Values of the dissociation equilibrium constant for neonicotinoid binding FA1 of HSA (i.e.,  K ) derived from in silico docking simulations (ranging between 3.9 × 10 and 6.3 × 10 M) agree with those determined experimentally from competitive inhibition of heme-Fe(III) binding (i.e.,  K ; ranging between 2.1 × 10 and 6.9 × 10 M). Accounting for the HSA concentration in vivo (~7.5 10 M), values of K here determined suggest that the formation of the HSA:neonicotinoid complexes may occur in vivo. Therefore, HSA appears to be an important determinant for neonicotinoid transport and distribution to tissues and organs, particularly to the  where they are metabolized.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582735>The contrary intracellular and extracellular functions of PEDF in HCC development.</a></h2><p>Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a classic angiogenic inhibitor, has been reported to function as a tumor suppression protein and to downregulate in many types of solid tumors. However, the expression level of PEDF and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are contradictory. The present study investigates the expression and different activities of secreted and intracellular PEDF during HCC development, as well as the underlying mechanism of PEDF on HCC lipid disorders. We found that PEDF had no association with patients' prognosis, although PEDF was highly expressed and inhibited angiogenesis in HCC tumor tissues. The animal experiments indicated that full-length PEDF exhibited equalizing effects on tumor growth activation and tumor angiogenesis inhibition in the late stage of HCC progression. Importantly, the pro-tumor activity was mediated by the intracellular PEDF, which causes accumulation of free   (FFAs) in vivo and in vitro. Based on the correlation analysis of PEDF and lipid metabolic indexes in human HCC tissues, we demonstrated that the intracellular PEDF led to the accumulation of FFA and eventually promoted HCC cell growth by inhibiting the activation of AMPK via ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, which causes increased de novo   synthesis and decreased FFA oxidation. Our findings revealed why elevated PEDF did not improve the patients' prognosis as the offsetting intracellular and extracellular activities. This study will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the diverse role of PEDF in HCC and provide a new selective strategy by supplement of extracellular PEDF and downregulation of intracellular PEDF for the prevention and treatment of  cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602953>[Mechanism of Calculus Bovis Sativus in inhibiting hepatocyte lipid deposition based on serum pharmacology].</a></h2><p>The aim of this paper was to investigate the molecular mechanism of Calculus Bovis Sativus( CBS) in alleviating lipid accumulation in vitro by serum pharmacology. The CBS-containing serum of mice was obtained by serum pharmacology method to evaluate its effect on the proliferation of LO2 hepatocytes. The lipid reducing effects of CBS-containing serum through Nrf2 was evaluated by fructose-induced LO2 hepatocyte steatosis model,nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2( Nrf2) agonist oltipraz combined intervention,cell oil red O staining and intracellular triglyceride( TG) content. The effects of CBS-containing serum on lipid peroxidation and hepatocytes apoptosis were evaluated by reactive oxygen species( ROS) and apoptosis assay,respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction( PCR) was used to detect the relative expression of lipid synthesis-related genes and apoptosis-related genes.RESULTS:: showed that CBS drug-containing serum had no significant effect on LO2 hepatocyte proliferation. As compared with the model group,CBS-containing serum could effectively reduce the formation of lipid droplets in fructose-induced LO2 hepatocytes,significantly reduce intracellular TG and ROS levels,and significantly reduce hepatocyte apoptosis rate( P < 0. 05). As compared with the model group,carbohydrate responsive element binding protein( ChREBP),sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 c( SREBP-1 c),  synthase( FAS),acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1( ACC1),stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1( SCD1),Bax and caspase-3 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in CBS drug-containing serum treatment group( P<0. 05). All of the above effects could be reversed by oltipraz.In conclusion,CBS-containing serum can significantly inhibit the fructose-induced LO2  fat deposition,and the mechanism may be related to reducing intracellular ROS level through the Nrf2 pathway and improving intracellular peroxidation state to reduce apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638173>Role and mechanisms of action of microRNA‑21 as regards the regulation of the WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of non‑alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of microRNA‑21 (miR‑21) in regulating the classical WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway by targeting low‑density lipoprotein‑related receptor 6 (LRP6) in non‑alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). For this purpose, we established a NAFLD model by feeding C57BL/6J mice a methionine‑choline‑​deficient diet. Antagomir‑21 was then injected via the tail vein, and the expression levels of WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway‑related proteins, such as LRP6, glycogen synthase kinase‑3β (GSK3β), p‑β‑catenin, β‑catenin and the downstream protein, peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ (PPAR‑γ), and lipid metabolism‑related genes, including sterol regulatory element‑binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP1c),   synthase (FAS), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α (CPT1α) and adenosine 5‑monophosphate (AMP)‑activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), were detected. The results revealed that in the NAFLD model, LRP6 expression was negatively associated with miR‑21 expression. After antagonizing the expression of miR‑21, the protein level of LRP6 was increased. In addition, the WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway was activated, and lipid accumulation and inflammation were alleviated in the . However, the expression of PPAR‑γ was not inhibited following the upregulation of the WNT signaling pathway. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that the inhibition of miR‑21 expression can alleviate NAFLD by targeting LRP6 to activate the WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565580>Dietary fermented products using  mold and sweet potato- distillery by-product promotes hepatic and serum cholesterol levels and modulates gut microbiota in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that fermented products (FPs) prepared from sweet potato- distillery by-product suppressed weight gain and decreased serum cholesterol levels in mice under normal dietary conditions. Furthermore, from the information gained from the above data regarding health benefits of the FPs, the aim of this study was evaluating the effects of dietary FPs on lipid accumulation and gut microbiota in mice with or without cholesterol-load in the diet. C57BL/6N mice were fed normal (CO) diet, CO with 10% FPs (CO + FPs) diet, cholesterol loaded (HC) diet, or HC with 10% FPs (HC + FPs) diet for 8 weeks. The mice were then euthanized, and blood samples, tissue samples, and feces were collected. The adipose tissue weight and  triglyceride levels in the HC + FPs diet groups were significantly reduced compared to that in the HC diet groups. However, FPs significantly increased the serum non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the ratio of non-HDL-C to HDL-C and hepatic total cholesterol levels in mice fed cholesterol-loaded diet compared with that of the HC diet group. Since dietary FPs significantly decreased the protein expression levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase 1 in the HC + FPs diet groups, the cholesterol accumulation in FPs group may be explained by insufficient catabolism from cholesterol to bile . In addition, the dietary FPs tended to increase  cluster IV and XIVa, which are butyrate-producing bacteria. Related to the result, -butyrate was significantly increased in the CO + FPs and the HC + FPs diet groups compared to their respective control groups. These findings suggested that dietary FPs modulated the lipid pool and gut microbiota.© 2019 Kosakai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677841>Widespread basal cytochrome P450 expression in extrahepatic bovine tissues and isolated cells.</a></h2><p>Periparturient cattle face increased risk of both metabolic and infectious diseases. Factors contributing to this predisposition include oxidized polyunsaturated  , also known as oxylipids, whose production is altered during the periparturient period and in diseased cattle. Alterations in the production of oxylipids derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are over-represented during times of increased disease risk and clinical disease, such as mastitis. Many of these same CYP450 enzymes additionally regulate metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D, and E. These vitamins are essential to maintaining immune health, yet circulating concentrations are diminished near calving. Despite this, a relatively small amount of research has focused on the roles of CYP450 enzymes outside of the . The aim of this paper is to describe the relative gene expression of 11 CYP450 in bovine tissues and common in vitro bovine cell models. Eight tissue samples were collected from 3 healthy dairy cows after euthanasia. In vitro samples included primary bovine aortic and mammary endothelial cells and immortalized bovine kidney and mammary epithelial cells. Quantitative real-time-PCR was carried out to assess basal transcript expression of CYP450 enzymes. Surprisingly, CYP450 mRNA was widely expressed in all tissue samples, with predominance in the . In vitro CYP450 expression was less robust, with several cell types lacking expression of specific CYP450 enzymes altogether. Overall, cell culture models did not reflect expression of tissue CYP450. However, when CYP450 were organized by activity, certain cell types consistently expressed specific functional groups. These data reveal the widespread expression of CYP450 in individual organs of healthy dairy cows. Widespread expression helps to explain previous evidence of significant changes in CYP450-mediated oxylipid production and fat-soluble vitamin metabolism in organ microenvironments during periods of oxidative stress or disease. As such, these data provide a foundation for targeted functional experiments aimed at understanding the activities of specific CYP450 and associated therapeutic potential during times of increased disease risk.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

A total of 80 C57BL/6J Narl mice were randomly divided into five groups: 3-month-old group, 9-month-old group, 14-month-old group, 20-month-old group, and FTZ treatment group (20 months old). The mice in the treatment group received a therapeutic dose of oral FTZ extract (1.0 g/kg, on raw material weight basis) once daily during the experiment. The other groups received the corresponding volume of oral normal saline solution.  samples of all five groups were collected after 12 weeks, and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to analyze metabolic changes. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to analyze the resulting data. Additionally, cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the  were determined.  The levels of TC, TG, AST, and ALT were increased, and  tissue structure was damaged. The secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the  also increased with aging. FTZ administration reduced the symptoms of  aging. The OPLS-DA score plot illustrated the effect of FTZ against  aging, with N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4, leukotriene E4, and arachidonic  among the key biomarkers. The pivotal pathways revealed by pathway analysis included arachidonic  metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated  . The mechanism by which FTZ reduces the symptoms of  aging in mice might be related to disorders of the abovementioned pathways.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free   (FFA)-palmitic and oleic -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice  were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis,   oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with   oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674780>γ-Mangostin ameliorates free  -induced lipid accumulation via the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK pathway in HepG2 and L02 cells.</a></h2><p>Lipid accumulation is a typical characteristic of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The inhibition of lipid accumulation is regarded as a potential treatment for NAFLD. In this study, we investigated the effects of γ-mangostin or α-mangostin on lipid accumulation in a cell model. Analysis of the inhibitory effects of γ-mangostin on lipid accumulation revealed that it downregulated NAFLD-related biochemical parameters and stimulated the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK pathway. Consequently, it suppressed lipid synthesis and enhanced   oxidation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the blockage of AMPK by the pharmacological inhibitor Compound C abrogated the promoting effect of AMPK. Similar results were also observed for α-mangostin. The effects of α-mangostin on lipid accumulation were inferior to those of γ-mangostin. The differences in CPT1A activity might be originated from their different chemical structures. Our results suggested that γ-mangostin and α-mangostin can be exploited as a potential candidate for NAFLD treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576649>Maresin 1 Regulates Hepatic FGF21 in Diet-Induced Obese Mice and in Cultured Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>To study the effects of Maresin 1 (MaR1), a docosahexaenoic--derived lipid mediator, on fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) production and to characterize the tissue-specific regulation of Fgf21 and its signaling pathway in , skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue (WAT).Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice are treated with MaR1 (50 µg kg , 10 days, oral gavage) and serum FGF21 levels and , muscle and WAT Fgf21, β-Klotho, Fgfr1, Egr1, and cFos mRNA expression are evaluated. Additionally, MaR1 effects are tested in mouse primary hepatocytes, HepG2 human hepatocytes, C2C12 myotubes, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In DIO mice, MaR1 decreases circulating FGF21 levels and HFD-induced hepatic Fgf21 mRNA expression. MaR1 increases hepatic β-Klotho, Egr1, and cFos in DIO mice. In WAT, MaR1 counteracts the HFD-induced downregulation of Fgf21, Fgfr1, and β-Klotho. In muscle, MaR1 does not modify Fgf21 but promoted Fgfr1 expression. In mouse primary hepatocytes, MaR1 decreases Fgf21 expression and downregulated Pparα mRNA levels. In HepG2 cells, MaR1 reverses the increased production of FGF21 and the downregulation of FGFR1, Β-KLOTHO, EGR1, and cFOS induced by palmitate. Preincubation with a PPARα antagonist prevents MaR1 effects on FGF21 secretion.The ability of MaR1 to modulate FGF21 can contribute to its beneficial metabolic effects.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We analyzed histology, mitochondrial function, targeted mitochondrial proteomics, and transcriptome in  tissue. Loss of MCAD led to a decreased capacity to oxidize octanoyl-CoA. This was not compensated for by altered protein levels of the short- and long-chain isoenzymes SCAD and LCAD.

Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and   transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels.

What are the molecular underpinnings of seasonal metabolic plasticity during spring and autumn migrations in songbirds? What is the main finding and its importance? We report differences in mRNA levels of genes involved in the regulation of glucose and fat metabolism between photoinduced non-migratory and migratory states and between the spring and autumn migratory states. Higher expression of genes associated with fat mobilization and energy generation in the spring than in the autumn migration suggests differential activation of the metabolic pathways or alteration in the efficiency of existing functional machinery during annual journeys between nearly fixed destinations.The molecular underpinnings of metabolic plasticity underlying differential responses to spring and autumn migrations are not well understood. We investigated this by examining the differences in mRNA levels of metabolic genes in the , muscle and adipose tissues of night-migratory red-headed buntings between photostimulated non-migratory and migratory states and between spring and autumn migratory states. Buntings accumulated more subcutaneous fat and hepatic lipid, had higher body mass, larger adipose cells and higher circulating triglyceride and free   levels and exhibited more intense Zugunruhe in the spring migratory state than in the autumn migratory state. More importantly, we found differences in the hepatic expression of pdc and pdk genes, indicating a differential acetyl-CoA requirement, and of the mdh and ogdh genes, suggesting differential oxidative phosphorylation between the non-migratory and migratory states and between the spring and autumn migratory states. Differences in fasn, bmal1 and glut1 mRNA levels were consistent with this and suggested seasonal differences in lipogenesis and/or glucose uptake. Likewise, differences in mRNA levels of genes coding for lipases (atgl and lpl) suggested that adipose triglycerides and free   serve largely as the metabolic substrate. Furthermore, changes in mRNA levels of genes coding for the   binding protein (fabp3) and   translocases (cd36) were consistent with differential fat fuel supply (via circulating free  ) to aerobically exercising flight muscles between the spring and autumn migrations. These results show seasonal adaptation of genetic pathway(s) underlying seasonal metabolic plasticity that seems to mediate differential responses to spring and autumn migrations in latitudinal migratory songbirds.© 2019 The Authors.

The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration value for both the bAgNPs was 0.125 μg. Et-bAgNPs showed the highest antibacterial activity against  at 60 μg after 16 h and the diameter of inhibited zone was 28 mm. Lipid peroxidation assay using all the bacterial strains revealed the formation of malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric  adduct due to the oxidation of cell membrane   by bAgNPs. The bAgNPs showed excellent hemocompatibility against human as well as rat red blood cells. Furthermore, there was no significant toxicity observed when the levels of rat serum ALT, AST, γ-GT (i.e.,  function biomarkers), and creatinine (i.e., kidney function biomarker) were determined.Copyright © 2019 Hossain, Polash, Takikawa, Shubhra, Saha, Islam, Hossain, Hasan, Takeoka and Sarker.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548064>Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) administration to early-lactating dairy cows. II. Pharmacokinetics, whole-animal performance, and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Dairy cows cope with severe energy insufficiency in early lactation by engaging in intense and sustained mobilization of   from adipose tissue. An unwanted side effect of this adaptation is excessive lipid accumulation in the , which in turn impairs hepatic functions. Mice experiencing increased hepatic   flux are protected from this condition through coordinated actions of the newly described hormone fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) on  and adipose tissue. The possibility of an analogous role for FGF21 in dairy cows is suggested by its rapid increase in plasma levels around parturition followed by chronically elevated levels in the first few weeks of lactation. To test this hypothesis, dairy cows were randomly assigned on d 12.6 ± 2.2 (± standard error) of lactation to receive either an excipient (control; n = 6) or recombinant human FGF21 (n = 7), first as an FGF21 bolus of 3 mg/kg of body weight (BW) followed 2 d later by a constant i.v. infusion of FGF21 at a rate of 6.3 mg/kg of metabolic BW for 9 consecutive days. After bolus administration, human FGF21 circulated with a half-life of 194 min, and its constant infusion increased total plasma concentration 117-fold over levels in excipient-infused cows. The FGF21 treatment had no effect on voluntary feed intake, milk yield, milk energy output, or net energy balance measured over the 9-d infusion or on final BW. Plasma   circulated at lower concentrations in the FGF21 group than in the control group for the 8-h period following bolus administration, but this reduction was not significant during the period of constant i.v. infusion. Treatment with FGF21 caused a 50% reduction in triglyceride content in  biopsies taken at the end of the constant i.v. infusion without altering the mRNA abundance of key genes involved in the transport, acyl coenzyme A activation, or oxidation of  . In contrast, FGF21 treatment ablated the recovery of plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 seen in control cows during the 9-d i.v. infusion period despite a tendency for higher plasma growth hormone. This effect was associated with increased hepatic mRNA abundance of the intracellular inhibitor of growth hormone receptor trafficking, LEPROT. Overall, these data confirm the ability of FGF21 to reduce lipid accumulation in bovine  and suggest the possibility that FGF21 does so by attenuating the hepatic influx of adipose tissue-derived  .Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic  (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal   oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic , Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial   oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

We assessed correlations between Δglucose and clinical parameters such as diabetic duration, BMI, HbA1c, beta cell function, serum free   (FFA) which is known to stimulate gluconeogenesis,  function, the indices of  function, renal function, and urinary albumin excretion (UAE).In correlation analysis, Δglucose positively correlated to FFA and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but inversely to serum creatinine and cystatin C, although Δglucose showed no correlation with both  function and the indices of residual  function. Multiple regression analysis revealed that Δglucose was an independent determinant for the eGFR after 1 year, equally BMI, HbA1c, serum lipids, and UAE, which are known as the predictors for the development of chronic kidney disease.Our results suggest that Δglucose during GST might be related to gluconeogenesis in the kidney and could be the determinant of future renal function in type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669601>Alteration of mitochondrial DNA homeostasis in drug-induced  injury.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for 13 proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process. In , genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease   oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to  failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced  injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Fibrates are derivatives of fibric . Therapy with fibrates in humans leads to a lowering of serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels leading to decreases in triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Several fibrates have also been found to decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) and increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, but their effects are, in general, less than what can be achieved with the statins. The fibrates are currently used largely in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and are used in combination with statins to treat hypercholesterolemia. The mechanism by which the fibrates lower lipid levels is unknown, but they may act through interactions with the hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) which regulate gene transcription of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and secretion. The fibrates bind specifically to a PPAR alpha isozyme, which is found largely in the  and which regulates   oxidation, increasing lipoprotein lipase levels which, in turn, enhances clearance of triglyceride rich lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623522>The Triglyceride Paradox Is Related to Lipoprotein Size, Visceral Adiposity and Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Activity in Black Versus White Women.</a></h2><p> In black women, triglycerides are paradoxically normal in the presence of insulin resistance.

Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS, insulin sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC   profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to insulin resistance and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668723>Dietary n-6 to n-3   ratio is related to  fat content independent of genetic effects: Evidence from the monozygotic co-twin control design.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes focusing on diet and exercise remain the cornerstone of the treatment of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free   (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the  and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction.

To evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of insoluble- (BIF) and soluble fibers (BSF) enzymatically isolated from barley, a conventional rat model and a type 2 diabetes rat model were used. Our results showed that 4-week treatment of BIF or BSF effectively reduced FBG in the diabetic condition, with caecal level of propionic  and minor SCFAs increased by BIF and that of butyric  and insulin sensitivity improved by BSF, respectively. The two treatments further ameliorated  function, judged by the recovered serum level of ALT, albumin and total protein levels. BIF and BSF also increased HDL-C and decreased serum MDA. In normal rats, BIF and BSF showed a hypolipidaemic effect in triglycerides and LDL-C, reduced body weight and enhanced the caecal production of minor SCFAs. Furthermore, the two treatments reduced the caecal level of butyric  while BSF increased that of propionic .

Lean or nonobese was defined by body mass index cutoffs reported by authors in original studies. NAFLD prevalence based on community, population, or health checkups was combined with random-effect model after logit transformation. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were further performed to investigate the heterogenicity.A total of 45 studies were enrolled in the final analysis, with 55,936 lean/nonobese subjects included, among whom 7351 NAFLD patients were diagnosed. Overall, the pooled NAFLD prevalence of the lean or nonobese population was 10.2% (95% confidence interval: 7.6%-13.6%) and 15.7% (95% confidence interval: 12.5%-19.6%), respectively. Compared with western studies, the NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population was lower in eastern studies. In addition, the NAFLD prevalence in both the lean and nonobese population showed a general upward trend during recent years. The prevalence was similar in community-based and health checkup-based studies. Lean/nonobese NAFLD patients had significantly lower rates of hypertension, lower uric  and fasting plasma glucose, and a higher level of high-density lipoprotein than nonlean/obese patients.The prevalence of NAFLD in the lean/nonobese population is not rare in either the western or eastern regions of the world.

In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated  enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function.

No obvious differences were noted in the concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and bile  in the  of 4-month-old FR30 rats whatever the post-weaning diet used.

Although vitamin A is generally recognized as the major vitamin A, vitamin A is found in some birds and mammals that eat fish containing vitamin A. Plasma concentration of retinyl esters, but not retinol, is known to increase postprandially in humans. The objectives of this study were to confirm the presence of vitamin A in fish fed to penguins, and in penguin plasma, and the postprandial changes in vitamin A concentration in penguin plasma. Blood was collected from six male African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) before and after feeding on jack mackerels (Trachurus japonicus) along with a vitamin premix containing vitamin A. Vitamin A concentration in fish was much higher than the requirement, and was 5-fold higher than the vitamin A concentration. Vitamin A was present in plasma but its concentration was at least 100-fold below that of plasma retinol, suggesting that vitamin A is much less bioavailable than vitamin A in penguins.

NAFLD is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and cardiovascular disease and begins with intrahepatic triacylglycerol accumulation. Under healthy conditions, the  regulates lipid metabolism to meet systemic energy needs in the fed and fasted states. The processes of   uptake,   synthesis and the intracellular partitioning of   into storage, oxidation and secretion pathways are tightly regulated. When one or more of these processes becomes dysregulated, excess lipid accumulation can occur. Although genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the development of NAFLD, it remains unclear why an imbalance in these pathways begins. The regulation of   partitioning occurs at several points, including during triacylglycerol synthesis, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis. These processes are influenced by enzyme function, intake of dietary fats and sugars and whole-body metabolism, and are further affected by the presence of obesity or insulin resistance. Insight into how the  controls   metabolism in health and how these processes might be affected in disease would offer the potential for new therapeutic treatments for NAFLD to be developed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605509>Kidney injury biomarkers after cardiac angiography in children with congenital heart disease.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the changes in renal function and levels of urinary biomarkers before and after cardiac angiography in children with congenital heart disease (CHD).Children with CHD are at a risk for kidney injury during contrast exposure in cardiac angiography.We measured urinary protein, albumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), β2-microglobulin (BMG), and -type  -binding protein (L-FABP) levels, as well as serum creatinine and cystatin C levels, before and after cardiac angiography in 33 children with CHD.No significant decrease was noted in either the creatinine-based or cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate at 24 hours after angiography compared with that before angiography. Urinary protein, NAG, BMG, and L-FABP levels were significantly increased at 24 hours after angiography, all of which returned to baseline levels at more than 7 days after angiography. An increase in urinary level of protein, albumin, NAG, or BMG was mostly associated with increased urinary L-FABP level. An increase in both urinary BMG and L-FABP, but not that in urinary L-FABP alone, was associated with increased levels of urinary protein and NAG, as well as the greater dose of contrast media.Transient increases of kidney injury biomarkers following cardiac angiography are not necessarily associated with the impairment of renal function in a short time period; however, the increase in urinary protein, albumin, NAG, or BMG level may indicate greater stresses to the kidneys than the increase in urinary L-FABP alone in children with CHD.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554265> Polysaccharides Ameliorate Hyperlipidemia in High-Fat Diet-Induced Rats via Short-Chain   Production and Lipid Metabolism Regulation.</a></h2><p> polysaccharides (HLP) are expected to become potential resources for the treatment of hyperlipidemia because of their various bioactivities. In the study, the treatment of HLP on improving hyperlipidemia in rats was explored. Oral administration of HLP at 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight effectively alleviated serum lipid levels and  histological abnormalities in high-fat-diet rats. HLP regulated abnormal mRNA, lipogenesis-related hormones and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interleukin-12) levels.

In 2017, it caused nearly half a million deaths out of 219 million infections. Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Once in the bloodstream, Plasmodium merozoites invade erythrocytes and proliferate until the cells lyses and release new parasites that invade other erythrocytes. Remarkably, they can manipulate the vertebrate host's lipid metabolism pathways, since they cannot synthesize lipid classes that are essential for their development and replication. In this study, we show that mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi present a completely different plasma profile from control mice, with marked hyperproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoglycemia, and hypocholesterolemia. In addition, white adipose and hepatic tissue and analyses from infected animals revealed the accumulation of triacylglycerol in both tissues and free   and free cholesterol in the . Hepatic mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes and transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism were also altered by P. chabaudi infection, leading to a lipogenic state. The enzyme 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cell energetic metabolism, was also modulated by the parasite, which reduced AMPK phosphorylation levels upon infection. Pretreatment with metformin for 21 days followed by infection with P. chabaudi was effective in preventing infection of mice and also lowered the hepatic accumulation of lipids while activating AMPK. Together, these results provide new and important information on the specific molecular mechanisms induced by the malaria parasite to regulate hepatic lipid metabolism in order to facilitate its development, proliferation, and lifespan in its vertebrate host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555219>Gut Dysfunction and Non-alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has emerged as one of the leading  diseases worldwide. NAFLD is characterized by hepatic steatosis and may progress to an inflammatory condition termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),  cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It became evident in the last years that NAFLD pathophysiology is complex and involves diverse immunological and metabolic pathways. An association between intestinal signals (e.g., derived from the gut microbiota) and the development of obesity and its metabolic consequences such as NAFLD are increasingly recognized. Pre-clinical studies have shown that germ-free mice are protected against obesity and hepatic steatosis. Several human studies from the past years have demonstrated that NAFLD contains a disease-specific gut microbiome signature. Controlled studies propose that certain bacteria with rather pro-inflammatory features such as Proteobacteria or  are dominantly present in these patients. In contrast, rather protective bacteria such as  are decreased in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, various bacterial metabolites and microbiota-generated secondary bile  are involved in NAFLD-associated metabolic dysfunction. Although these findings are exciting, research currently lack evidence that interference at the level of the gut microbiome is beneficial for these diseases. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to advance this aspect of NAFLD research and to support the notion that the intestinal microbiota is indeed of major relevance in this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554846>Circulating exosomes may identify biomarkers for cows at risk for metabolic dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Disease susceptibility of dairy cows is greatest during the transition from pregnancy to lactation. Circulating exosomes may provide biomarkers to detect at-risk cows to enhance health and productivity. From 490 cows, animals at high- (n = 20) or low-risk (n = 20) of transition-related diseases were identified using plasma non-esterified   and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations and  triacylglyceride concentrations during the two weeks post-calving. We isolated circulating exosomes from plasma of dairy cows at low-risk (LR-EXO) and high-risk (HR-EXO), and analyzed their proteome profiles to determine markers for metabolic dysfunction. We evaluated the effects of these exosomes on eicosanoid pathway expression by bovine endometrial stromal (bCSC) and epithelial (bEEL) cells. HR-EXO had significantly lower yield of circulating exosomes compared with LR-EXO, and unique proteins were identified in HR-EXO and LR-EXO. Exposure to LR-EXO or HR-EXO differentially regulated eicosanoid gene expression and production in bCSC and bEEL cells. In bCSC, LR-EXO exposure increased PGE and PGD production, whereas HR-EXO exposure increased PTGS2 gene expression. In bEEL, HR-EXO exposure caused a decrease in PGE PGF, PGD, PGFM and TXB production. The unique presence of serpin A3-7, coiled-coil domain containing 88A and inhibin/activin β A chain in HR-EXO, indicates potential biomarkers for cows at-risk for metabolic diseases. Our results are in line with the health status of the cow indicating a potential diagnostic role for exosomes in enhancing cows' health and fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586915>Lipid metabolism disorders contribute to hepatotoxicity of triclosan in mice.</a></h2><p>Previous in vivo exposure studies focused mainly on nuclear receptors involved in hepatotoxicity of triclosan (TCS).

In this study, we comprehensively assessed the effect of TCS exposure on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice. Our results showed that TCS induced significant changes in hepatic free   pool by upregulation of   uptake and de novo   synthesis. Besides, hepatic levels of lipids, including acyl carnitine (AcCa), ceramide (Cer), triacylglycerols (TG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were also increased, together with upreguation of genes associated to TG synthesis,   oxidation and inflammation in TCS exposure group. These changes in lipid homeostasis could contribute to membrane instability, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation.

Choline and methionine (Met) can promote energy balance and benefit  health in transition dairy cows; however, the regulating mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established the hepatocyte damage model by 1.5 mM NEFAs or BHBA treatment, and examined lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. The results showed that 1.5 mM NEFAs and 1.5 mM BHBA significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α as well as its target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α), acetyl-CoA carboxylase,   synthetase, and Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100). Choline and Met upregulated the phosphorylation level of AMPK-α, which was blocked by BML (an AMPK-α inhibitor). The mRNA expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), CPT-1α, and ApoB100 showed a similar trend. The expressions of  X recptoer α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) were decreased by choline and Met, while only the decrease of LXR-α was blocked by BML. These findings indicate that the high-level NEFAs and BHBA weaken the lipid metabolism by impairing the   oxidation, synthesis, and transport proteins. Choline and Met regulate PPAR-α and LXR-α transcriptional activity through AMPK-α phosphorylation and regulate SREBP-1c independently of AMPK-α to promote lipid oxidation and transport in NEFAs-treated hepatocytes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592021>Novel Lipid Long Intervening Noncoding RNA, Oligodendrocyte Maturation-Associated Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA, Regulates the  Steatosis Gene Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase As an Enhancer RNA.</a></h2><p>The global obesity epidemic is driving the concomitant rise in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).

Acots in the mitochondrial matrix are poised to mitigate β-oxidation overload and maintain CoA availability. Several Acots associate with mitochondria, but whether they all localize to the matrix, are redundant, or have different roles is unresolved. Here, we compared the suborganellar localization, activity, expression, and regulation among mitochondrial Acots (Acot2, 7, 9, and 13) in mitochondria from multiple mouse tissues and from a model of Acot2 depletion. Acot7, 9, and 13 localized to the matrix, joining Acot2 that was previously shown to localize there. Mitochondria from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney robustly expressed Acot2, 9, and 13; Acot9 levels were substantially higher in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria, as was activity for C4:0-CoA, a unique Acot9 substrate. In all tissues, Acot2 accounted for about half of the thioesterase activity for C14:0-CoA and C16:0-CoA. In contrast,  mitochondria from fed and fasted mice expressed little Acot activity, which was confined to long-chain CoAs and due mainly to Acot7 and Acot13 activities. Matrix Acots occupied different functional niches, based on substrate specificity (Acot9 vs. Acot2 and 13) and strong CoA inhibition (Acot7, 9, and 13, but not Acot2). Interpreted in the context of β-oxidation, CoA inhibition would prevent Acot-mediated suppression of β-oxidation, while providing a release valve when CoA is limiting. In contrast, CoA-insensitive Acot2 could provide a constitutive syphon for long-chain  acyl-CoAs. These results reveal how the family of matrix Acots can mitigate β-oxidation overload and prevent CoA limitation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h2><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases   oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces  triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression.  leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease  triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and -specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔ) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days.  triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in  tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔ mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔ mice reduced  triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar  lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Each participant completed a standard questionnaire, and provided blood samples for biochemical measurements. Visceral adiposity index,  index and lipid accumulation product were calculated by simple anthropometric and functional parameters. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric  ≥ 420 μmol/l for males and ≥ 360 μmol/l for females.The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 15.9% and gradually increased across tertiles of adiposity-based indices. The visceral adipose-based measurements (visceral adiposity index,  index, lipid accumulation product) had better power to discriminate hyperuricemia than body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and neck circumference, and visceral adiposity index exhibited the highest power, with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.662 (0.636-0.688).

Previous studies based on high-dose exposures indicate their hepatotoxicity. However, their mechanisms of toxicity or adverse outcome pathways and health risks remain largely unknown.This study aimed to evaluate metabolic consequences of chronic dietary exposure to SCCPs at low doses and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatotoxicity of SCCPs.A combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics, together with general pathophysiological tests were performed to assess the hepatic response of male rats exposed to SCCPs.Our results highlight two major modes of action: Inhibition of energy metabolism and activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Exposure to SCCPs suppressed oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and turnover of ATP-ADP-AMP and thus results in deficiencies of amino  and nucleotides in  of the rat. Exposure to SCCPs affected expression levels of 13 genes downstream of PPARα that encode proteins associated with metabolism of  . As a result, peroxisomal and mitochondrial   β-oxidation, microsomal   ω-oxidation, and lipogenesis were accelerated.Results of this work strongly support the conclusion that low-dose exposure to SCCPs can result in adverse outcomes in the rat model. Significant SCCP-induced inhibition of energy metabolism occurs at environmentally relevant dosages, which suggests that SCCPs exhibit metabolic toxicity.

Considering the functional correlation and the structural similarity of these compounds, a sensitive and efficient method was developed here for the first time to simultaneously profile BAFAs based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Through optimization of the chromatographic conditions, all BAFAs can be efficiently separated and quantified in 19 min with excellent peak shape. For comprehensive profiling of endogenous FAs without standards, a strategy was established to predict the retention times (RTs) of all theoretically possible FAs on the basis of the good multiple linear regression relationship between RT and FA carbon chain length and double bond number. High-resolution mass spectrometry was employed for the final confirmation of these predicted FAs. Twenty-eight FAs in rat serum were newly identified using this strategy. Though the regulation of collision energies (CEs) for highly abundant compounds, the problems of their poor quantification linearity and accuracy caused by MS signal saturation were solved, facilitating the simultaneous quantification of both high- and low-abundance BAFAs with good linearity and accuracy. The established UPLC-MS/MS method was further used to quantify BAFAs in rat serum and to explore the disturbance of BAFA metabolism in the Tripterygium glycoside-induced  injury rat model. A total of 25 BAs and 55 FAs in rat serum were identified and quantified. Several BAFAs, including nordeoxycholic , taurodeoxycholic  and some unsaturated FAs, were found to differ significantly in the control and model groups.

The  is the first organ to receive insulin and through a cascade of complex series of steps, insulin not only plays a key role in the intrahepatic regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism but also in the regulation of systemic glucose and lipid concentrations. Thus, when intra-hepatic insulin signalling becomes aberrant then this may lead to perturbations in intra-hepatic metabolic processes that have the potential to impact on metabolic health. For example, obesity is associated with intra-hepatic fat accumulation (known as non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD)) and hyperinsulinaemia, the latter as a result of insulin hypersecretion or impaired hepatic insulin extraction. Although insulin signalling directly alters intra- and extra-hepatic metabolism, the regulation of hepatic glucose and   metabolism is also indirectly driven by substrate availability.

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the . Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into  suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the  after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of   synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, Elovl4 may be particularly important in Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT; Thunnus thynnus) characterised by having high DHA to EPA ratios. The present study cloned and characterised both the function and expression of an elovl4 cDNA from ABT. The Elovl4 had an open reading frame of 915 base pairs encoding a putative protein of 304 amino . Alignment and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the Elovl4 isoform identified in the present study was an Elovl4b. Functional characterisation demonstrated that the Elovl4b enzyme had elongase activity towards all the polyunsaturated   (PUFA) substrates assayed. The ABT Elovl4b contributed to DHA biosynthesis by elongation of EPA and DPA to 24:5n-3, the latter being desaturated to 24:6n-3 by the action of fads2 (Δ6 desaturase). Additionally, the ABT Elovl4b has a role in the biosynthesis of very long-chain PUFA up to C, compounds of key structural roles in neural tissues such as eye and brain, which had high levels of elovl4b transcripts. Surprisingly, while the relative expression of fads2, required for the production of DHA from EPA, was increased in  of ABT fed a diet with reduced levels of EPA and DHA, expression of elovl4b was reduced. Results indicated that ABT has enzymes necessary for endogenous production of DHA from EPA and demonstrate that Elovl4b can effectively compensate for absence of Elovl2.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Saturated   induce autophagy dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to apoptosis in hepatocytes. However, unsaturated  , such as oleic , are nontoxic and can even prevent saturated  -induced toxicity in vitro. Although emerging evidence has suggested that ER calcium flux disruption in hepatocytes is involved in NAFLD pathogenesis, the roles of   in autophagy and ER calcium flux still remain unclear. We demonstrated that oleic  ameliorated palmitic -induced autophagy arrest and ER stress in parallel with ER calcium depletion in hepatocytes. Moreover, we found that the effect of oleic  against autophagy arrest was reversed by the pharmacological inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), which influxes calcium to ER. These data suggest that SERCA-mediated ER calcium flux is greatly involved in  -induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, and the prevention of ER calcium depletion may restore saturated  -induced autophagy arrest in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Primary end-points were serum levels of hepatic enzymes; other parameters of  function, metabolic syndrome and inflammation were secondary end-points. The coagulation-fibrinolysis balance was also thoroughly investigated, as NAFLD is associated with haemostatic alterations, which might contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk of this condition. Study design: double-blind, randomized, multicenter, controlled trial on two parallel groups. Subjects with NAFLD (18-80 years, either sex) received the active or control treatment for three months. All assays were performed before and at the end of supplementation, on 113 total subjects. The hepatic enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased after treatment from 23.2% to 3.7%, reaching statistical significance only for AST levels. However, there were no differences between control and active groups. Metabolic and inflammatory variables were unchanged, except for a slight (less than 10%) increase of cholesterol and glucose levels after the active treatment. Coagulation-fibrinolytic parameters were unaffected by either treatment. In conclusion, chronic supplementation with the mixture of dietary compounds was well tolerated and apparently safe in NAFLD subjects. The trial failed to demonstrate any efficacy on relevant physio-pathological markers, but its protocol and results may be useful to design future studies with natural compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614639>Allopurinol Prevents the Lipogenic Response Induced by an Acute Oral Fructose Challenge in Short-Term Fructose Fed Rats.</a></h2><p>We investigated whether short term high fructose intake may induce early hepatic dysfunction in rats and to test whether allopurinol treatment may have beneficial effects. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats received 20% fructose in drinking water (10 treated with allopurinol and 10 received vehicle) and 10 control rats received tap water. After 14 days, the hepatic response to an acute fructose load was evaluated, and in fasted animals, respirometry studies in freshly isolated mitochondria were performed. In fasting rats, we did not find differences in systemic or hepatic uric  and triglyceride concentrations among the groups, but mitochondrial respiratory control rate was significantly decreased by high fructose feeding and correlated with a reduced expression of Complex I, as well as decreased aconitase-2 activity. On the other hand, in fructose fed rats, an acute fructose load increased systemic and hepatic uric , triglycerides and oxidative stress. Fructose feeding was also associated with fructokinase and xanthine oxidase overexpression and increased  de novo lipogenesis program (  synthase (FAS) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) overexpression, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) overactivity and decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation). Allopurinol treatment prevented hepatic and systemic alterations. These data suggest that early treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors might provide a therapeutic advantage by delaying or even halting the progression of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681434>Mining Public Toxicogenomic Data Reveals Insights and Challenges in Delineating  Steatosis Adverse Outcome Pathways.</a></h2><p>Exposure to chemicals contributes to the development and progression of , or steatosis, a process characterized by abnormal accumulation of lipids within  cells. However, lack of knowledge on how chemicals cause steatosis has prevented any large-scale assessment of the 80,000+ chemicals in current use. To address this gap, we mined a large, publicly available toxicogenomic dataset associated with 18 known steatogenic chemicals to assess responses across assays ( and ) and species (i.e., rats and humans). We identified genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) in rat , rat , and human  studies in which rats or  primary cell lines were exposed to the chemicals at different doses and durations. Using these DEGs, we performed pathway enrichment analysis, analyzed the molecular initiating events (MIEs) of the steatosis adverse outcome pathway (AOP), and predicted metabolite changes using metabolic network analysis. Genes indicative of oxidative stress were among the DEGs most frequently observed in the rat  studies. , a pro-fibrotic gene, was down-regulated across these chemical exposure conditions. We identified eight genes (, , , , , , , and ) and one pathway (retinol metabolism), associated with steatogenic chemicals and whose response was conserved across the three  and  systems. Similarly, we found the predicted metabolite changes, such as increases of saturated and unsaturated  , conserved across the three systems. Analysis of the target genes associated with the MIEs of the current steatosis AOP did not provide a clear association between these 18 chemicals and the MIEs, underlining the multi-factorial nature of this disease. Notably, our overall analysis implicated mitochondrial toxicity as an important and overlooked MIE for chemical-induced steatosis. The integrated toxicogenomics approach to identify genes, pathways, and metabolites based on known steatogenic chemicals, provide an important mean to assess development of AOPs and gauging the relevance of new testing strategies.Copyright © 2019 AbdulHameed, Pannala and Wallqvist.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573550>The gut microbiome and metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors that, if left untreated, will often progress to greater metabolic defects such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic  disease. While these risk factors have been established for over 40 years, the definition of MetS warrants reconsideration in light of the substantial data that have emerged from studies of the gut microbiome. In this Review we present the existing recent literature that supports the gut microbiome's potential influence on the various risk factors of MetS. The interplay of the intestinal microbiota with host metabolism has been shown to be mediated by a myriad of factors, including a defective gut barrier, bile  metabolism, antibiotic use, and the pleiotropic effects of microbially produced metabolites. These data show that events that start in the gut, often in response to external cues such as diet and circadian disruption, have far-reaching effects beyond the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569521>Separation and Lipid Inhibition Effects of a Novel Decapeptide from .</a></h2><p>A novel lipid inhibition peptide Leu-Leu-Val-Val-Try-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg (PP1) (MW 1274.53 Da) was obtained from  using enzymatic hydrolysis, gel filtration chromatography, and LC-MS/MS. Its lipid inhibition effects indicated that the synthetic peptide PP1 exhibits a good inhibitory effect against porcine pancreatic lipase (PL) (47.95%) at 200 μg/mL, which could be attributed to its hydrogen binding into catalytic sites of PL (Ser153, Asp177, and His 264) by docking analysis. Furthermore, in 3T3-L1 cells, the synthetic PP1 remarkedly decreased the accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerol (27.9%, 600 μg/mL), which carried a similar consequence as the positive drug simvastatin (24.1%, 10 μM). Western blot revealed that PP1 inhibited the lipid accumulation and   synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in two pathways, primarily: nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathway (C/EBPα, SREBP-1c, AMPKα) and AMPK signaling pathway (SREBP-1c, PPARγ, AMPKα). In short, these results support that PP1 can be used as a potential agent against obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30687796>Metabolic profiling of adolescent non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p> Adolescent non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. The association between adolescent NAFLD and a wide range of metabolic biomarkers is unclear. We have attempted to determine the differences in metabolic profile of adolescents with and without markers of NAFLD.  We performed cross-sectional analyses in a sample of 3,048 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17. We used three indicators of NAFLD: ALT >40 U/l; AST >40 U/l and ultrasound scan-assessed steatosis. Associations between each measure of NAFLD and 154 metabolic traits, assessed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, were analyzed by multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex and BMI.  All three indicators of NAFLD were associated with ~0.5 standard deviation (SD) greater concentrations of all extremely large to small very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) measures. ALT >40U/l was associated with ~0.5SD greater concentrations of very small VLDLs, intermediate-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins. Concentrations of most cholesterols, including remnant cholesterol, all triglycerides and monounsaturated  , in addition to glycoprotein acetyls (inflammatory marker), were also higher in participants with NAFLD.  We have identified differing metabolic profiles between adolescents with and without indicators of NAFLD. These results provide the foundations for future research to determine whether these differences persist and result in adverse future cardiometabolic health.Copyright: © 2019 Hartley A et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572539>Apigenin reduces the excessive accumulation of lipids induced by palmitic  via the AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to diseases caused by excessive accumulation of lipids in the  with therapeutic agents derived from natural products offering an alternative treatment to conventional therapies. Among these therapeutic agents, apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has been proven to exert various beneficial biological effects. In the present study, the antiadipogenic effects of apigenin in HepG2 cells was investigated. It was demonstrated that the treatment of cells with different concentrations of apigenin for 24 h significantly decreased the palmitic -induced increases in total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels as well as intracellular lipid accumulation. In addition, apigenin increased the phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels but decreased the expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1,   synthase, and SREBP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner.

We evaluated whether fermented black radish ( L. var. ; FBR) ameliorates lipid accumulation, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis, which are characteristics of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Fermented black radish treatment reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which appeared to be associated with the downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and lipid accumulation-related genes including adipocyte protein-2 and   synthase. Administration of FBR to C57BL/6J mice challenged with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet significantly attenuated the increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and triglyceride. In addition, treatment with FBR interestingly repressed the hepatic inflammation induced with MCD diet, by lowering the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppressing the inactivation of macrophages and Kupffer cells in the . Fermented black radish was also shown to mitigate  fibrosis through the inhibition of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain. Our results indicate that FBR ameliorates NAFLD and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways, suggesting that FBR may be an effective dietary supplement for ameliorating NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

LHG has been utilized for the treatment of sore throats and hyperglycemia in folk medicine as a homology of medicine and food. The hypoglycemic pharmacology of LHG has attracted considerable attention, and mogrosides have been considered to be active ingredients against diabetes mellitus. We have found that these mogrosides could be metabolized into their secondary glycosides containing 1-3 glucose residues in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats in previous studies. These metabolites may be the antidiabetic components of LHG in vivo. Thus far, no reports have been found on reducing blood glucose of mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues.The aim of this study was to confirm that mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues were the active components of LHG for antidiabetic effects and to understand their potential mechanisms of action.First, the special fraction of mogrosides containing 1-3 glucose residues was separated from a 50% ethanol extract of LHG, and the chemical components were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and named low-polar Siraitia grosvenorii glycosides (L-SGgly). Second, the antidiabetic effects of L-SGgly were evaluated by HFD/STZ-induced (high-fat diet and streptozocin) obese T2DM rats by indexing fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), and insulin resistance, and then compared with other fractions in the separation process. The changes in serum lipid levels were also detected. Finally, possible mechanisms of antidiabetic activity of L-SGgly were identified as increasing GLP-1 levels and activating  AMPK in T2DM rats.The chemical analysis of L-SGgly showed that they contain 11-oxomogroside V, mogroside V, mogroside III, mogroside IIE, mogroside IIIA, mogroside IIA, and mogroside IA, respectively. The total content of the mogrosides in L-SGgly was 54.4%, including 15.7% mogroside IIA and 12.6% mogroside IA. L-SGgly showed excellent effects on obese T2DM rats compared with the other fractions of LHG extract, including significantly reducing the levels of FBG (p < 0.001) and modifying insulin resistance (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, they could significantly decrease the content of triglyceride (p < 0.01), total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01) and free   (p < 0.001) and increase the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001) in serum of T2DM rats. Moreover, L-SGgly can significantly increase (p < 0.01) GLP-1 levels and decrease (p < 0.01) IL-6 levels in T2DM rat serum. AMPK-activating activity in T2DM rats was also upregulated by L-SGgly, but no statistical significance was shown.L-SGgly, fractions separated from LHG extract, were verified to have obvious anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects on T2DM rats. Furthermore, L-SGgly regulated insulin secretion in T2DM rats by increasing GLP-1 levels. These findings provide an explanation for the antidiabetic role of LHG.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It possesses biological activity against metabolic diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of AH root water extract (AHR) on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. AHR inhibited lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation by downregulation of gene expression, such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and an adipogenic gene, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Oral administration of AHR significantly suppressed body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, serum leptin levels, and adipocyte cell size in HFD-induced obese mice. Moreover, AHR significantly decreased hepatic mRNA expression levels of cholesterol synthesis genes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBP)-2, and low-density lipoprotein receptor, as well as   synthesis genes, such as SREBP-1c and   synthase. Serum triglyceride levels were also lowered by AHR, likely as a result of the upregulating gene involved in   β-oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, in the . AHR treatment activated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, which might have promoted HSL and LPL-medicated lipolysis, thereby reducing white adipose tissue weight.
