Methyl 3α-acetoxy-7-oxo-cholanate (1), methyl 3α-acetoxy-12-oxo-cholanate (2) and methyl 3α,7α-diacetoxy-12-oxo-cholanate (3) were subjected to Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to provide homolactones (7-9) or to the Beckmann rearrangement of the corresponding oximes to give homolactams (16-18). Both reactions proceed regio- and stereoselectively. Ring B homolog of lithocholic  (20) was efficiently synthesized. Among these compounds, 7, 9 and 16 were found to have the significant activity, with IC50 values ⩽3μM against α-2,6-(N)-ST selectively, which are 5-fold lower than that of Lith-O-Asp. Given the reality that LCA and its analogue, Lith-O-Asp, have been revealed to improve inhibitory efficacy of ST and to have a wide range of antimetastatic activities in different human cancer cells, the up-to-date findings have noteworthy pharmacological significance as they open a promising path to the improvement of a prospective molecular targeted application of modified LCA analogues as agents for the treatment of cancer metastasis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, its extensive  and low polarity has limited the systemic availability of KBA. The present research was aimed to obtain and explore the various possible derivatives of KBA through biotransformation by Cunninghamella blakesleana AS 3.970.

The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the sulfate fraction of methenolone  by LC-high resolution (HR)MS and the estimation of the long-term detectability of its sulfate metabolites analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMSMS) compared with the current practice for the detection of methenolone misuse used by the anti-doping laboratories. Methenolone was administered to two healthy male volunteers, and urine samples were collected up to 12 and 26 days, respectively. Ethyl acetate extraction at weak alkaline pH was performed and then the sulfate conjugates were analyzed by LC-HRMS using electrospray ionization in negative mode searching for [M-H](-) ions corresponding to potential sulfate structures (comprising structure alterations such as hydroxylations, oxidations, reductions and combinations of them). Eight sulfate metabolites were finally detected, but four of them were considered important as the most abundant and long term detectable. LC clean up followed by solvolysis and GC/MS analysis of trimethylsilylated (TMS) derivatives reveal that the sulfate analogs of methenolone as well as of 1-methylene-5α-androstan-3α-ol-17-one, 3z-hydroxy-1β-methyl-5α-androstan-17-one and 16β-hydroxy-1-methyl-5α-androst-1-ene-3,17-dione were the major metabolites in the sulfate fraction. The results of the present study also document for the first time the methenolone sulfate as well as the 3z-hydroxy-1β-methyl-5α-androstan-17-one sulfate as metabolites of methenolone in human urine. The time window for the detectability of methenolone sulfate metabolites by LC-HRMS is comparable with that of their hydrolyzed glucuronide analogs analyzed by GC-MS. The results of the study demonstrate the importance of sulfation as a phase II  pathway for methenolone , proposing four metabolites as significant components of the sulfate fraction.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29679877>Pentacyclic triterpenoids from Cyclocarya paliurus and their antioxidant activities in FFA-induced HepG2 steatosis cells.</a></h1><p>Six undescribed pentacyclic triterpenoids including four triterpenoid aglycones, 1β,2a,3β,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-ursolic , 2a,3a,6β,19α,23-pentahydroxyurs-12-en-28-ursolic , 2α,3α,20β,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-ursolic  and 1β,2a,3β,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12,20(30)-dien-28-ursolic , and two triterpenoid glucosides, 2a,3a,23-trihydroxy-12,20(30)-dien-28-ursolic  28-O-β-d-glucopyranoside and 1-oxo-3β,23-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic  28-O-β-d-xylopyranoside, along with 5 known triterpenoids were isolated from a CHCl-soluble extract of the leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus.

The enzyme has been thought to act as a dehydrogenase for xenobiotic alcohols and some hydroxysteroids, but its physiological function remains unknown. We have purified rabbit 3HBD, isolated its cDNA, and examined its specificity for coenzymes and substrates, reaction directionality and tissue distribution. 3HBD is a member (AKR1C29) of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, and exhibited high preference for NADP(H) over NAD(H) at a physiological pH of 7.4. In the NADPH-linked reduction, 3HBD showed broad substrate specificity for a variety of quinones, ketones and aldehydes, including 3-, 17- and 20-ketosteroids and prostaglandin D₂, which were converted to 3α-, 17β- and 20α-hydroxysteroids and 9α,11β-prostaglandin F₂, respectively. Especially, α-diketones (such as isatin and diacetyl) and lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes (such as 4-oxo- and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenals) were excellent substrates showing low K(m) values (0.1-5.9 μM). In 3HBD-overexpressed cells, 3-oxohexobarbital and 5β-androstan-3α-ol-17-one were metabolized into 3-hydroxyhexobarbital and 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol, respectively, but the reverse reactions did not proceed. The overexpression of the enzyme in the cells decreased the cytotoxicity of 4-oxo-2-nonenal. The mRNA for 3HBD was ubiquitously expressed in rabbit tissues. The results suggest that 3HBD is an NADPH-preferring reductase, and plays roles in the metabolisms of steroids, prostaglandin D₂, carbohydrates and xenobiotics, as well as a defense system, protecting against reactive carbonyl compounds.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α) mediates lipid accumulation in the heart. Fatty  (FAs) upregulate GSK-3α, which phosphorylates PPARα at Ser280 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). This modification ligand independently enhances transcription of a subset of PPARα targets, selectively stimulating FA uptake and storage, but not oxidation, thereby promoting lipid accumulation. Constitutively active GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, was sufficient to drive PPARα signaling, while cardiac-specific knockdown of GSK-3α, but not GSK-3β, or replacement of PPARα Ser280 with Ala conferred resistance to lipotoxicity in the heart. Fibrates, PPARα ligands, inhibited phosphorylation of PPARα at Ser280 by inhibiting the interaction of GSK-3α with the LBD of PPARα, thereby reversing lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that GSK-3α promotes lipid anabolism through PPARα-Ser280 phosphorylation, which underlies the development of lipotoxic cardiomyopathy in the context of obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, two new brassinosteroid analogs with shorter side chains but keeping the diol function were synthesized. Thus, the synthesis of 2-deoxybrassinosteroids analogs of the 3α-hydroxy-24-nor, 22,23-dihydroxy-5α-cholestane side chain type is described. The starting material is a derivative from hyodeoxycholic  (), which was obtained with an overall yield of 59% following a previously reported five step route.

However, new vaccine, antigen and carrier technologies are required to combat emerging viral strains and enhance the efficacy of respiratory vaccines, particularly at the point of pathogen entry. New technologies, specifically metabolomic profiling, could be applied to identify metabolite immune-correlates representative of immune protection following vaccination aiding in the design and screening of vaccine candidates. This study for the first time demonstrates the ability of untargeted UPLC-MS metabolomic profiling to identify metabolite immune correlates characteristic of immune responses following mucosal vaccination in calves. Male Holstein Friesian calves were vaccinated with Pfizer Rispoval® PI3 + RSV intranasal vaccine and metabolomic profiling of post-vaccination plasma revealed 12 metabolites whose peak intensities differed significantly from controls. Plasma levels of glycocholic , N-[(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-Dihydroxy-7,24-dioxocholan-24-yl]glycine, uric  and biliverdin were found to be significantly elevated in vaccinated animals following secondary vaccine administration, whereas hippuric  significantly decreased. In contrast, significant upregulation of taurodeoxycholic  and propionylcarnitine levels were confined to primary vaccine administration. Assessment of such metabolite markers may provide greater information on the immune  stimulated from vaccine formulations and benchmarking early metabolomic responses to highly immunogenic vaccine formulations could provide a means for rapidly assessing new vaccine formulations.

In order to investigate how prenatal stress affects fear extinction, which is regarded as a form of new learning that counteracts the expression of Pavlovian's conditioned fear, a rat model of prenatal chronic mild stress (PNS) was used to evaluate the effects of PNS on fear extinction in adult offspring. The expression of hippocampal glycogen synthase kinase-3s (GSK-3α, β), N-methyl-d-aspartic  receptors (NMDARs)-2B and the hippocampal cell proliferation in dentate gyrus in the adult offspring during fear extinction were studied. Our results showed that PNS significantly reduced body weight of pups, indicating PNS might induce growth retardation in offspring. Moreover, PNS significantly enhanced the freezing behavior of offspring at the phase of extinction, suggesting PNS impaired the abilities of fear extinction learning. In addition, PNS significantly increased the levels of GSK-3α, β and NR2B, but reduced hippocampal cell proliferation during fear extinction. Taken together, our findings suggest that maternal stress during pregnancy can impair the fear extinction of adult offspring, probably by affecting the neural plasticity of brain.Copyright © 2014 ISDN.

In this study, we examined the effects of small molecules that interfere with ER stress-GSK3α/β signaling on the progression and regression of atherosclerosis in a mouse model.To examine atherosclerotic progression, low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (Ldlr) mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) and treated with the chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA, 3.8  g/L drinking water), or the GSK3α/β inhibitor, valproate (VPA, 625 mg VPA/kg diet), for 10 weeks. To examine potential effects on atherosclerotic regression, 4 week old Ldlr mice were placed on a HFD for 16 weeks. Subsets of mice were harvested at this time or switched to a chow (low fat) diet, or a chow diet with 4PBA or VPA treatment for 4 weeks.In the progression model, the 4PBA- and VPA-treated mice had significantly reduced lesion and necrotic core size. Treatments had no effect on  parameters, including plasma and hepatic lipid levels, or plaque composition. In the regression model, mice with 4PBA or VPA treatment showed no alterations in lesion size, but the lesions had significantly smaller necrotic cores, increased vascular smooth muscle cell content, and increased collagen content. These features are consistent with more stable plaques.The pharmacological attenuation of ER stress or inhibition of GSK3α/β impedes the development of atherosclerosis in Ldlr mice and appears to promote the stabilization of existing lesions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the potential interaction between TLR signaling and autophagy in cancer cells. Here we show that autophagy induced by TLR4 or TLR3 activation enhances various cytokine productions through promoting TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) ubiquitination and thus facilitates migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Stimulation of TLR4 and TLR3 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic  [poly(I:C)] respectively triggered autophagy in lung cancer cells. This was mediated by the adaptor protein, toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1/TRIF), and was required for TLR4- and TLR3-induced increases in the production of IL6, CCL2/MCP-1 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2], CCL20/MIP-3α [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20], VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), and MMP2 [matrix metallopeptidase 2 (gelatinase A, 72 kDa gelatinase, 72 kDa type IV collagenase)]. These cytokines appeared to be necessary for enhanced migration and invasion of lung cancer cells upon TLR activation. Remarkably, inhibition of autophagy by chemical or genetic approaches blocked TLR4- or TLR3-induced Lys63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 that was essential for activation of MAPK and NFKB (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells) , both of which were involved in the increased production of the cytokines. Collectively, these results identify induction of autophagy by TLR4 and TLR3 as an important mechanism that drives lung cancer progression, and indicate that inhibition of autophagy may be a useful strategy in the treatment of lung cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28207286>LC-MS/MS simultaneous analysis of allopregnanolone, epiallopregnanolone, pregnanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate in human plasma.</a></h1><p>Several neuropsychopharmacological properties have been attributed to the 3α-reduced pregnane steroids, allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, as well as to dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate because of their ability to modulate γ-aminobutyric  (GABA) receptors in the CNS. In order to understand better their role in several mechanisms in CNS, a new methodology is proposed to monitor these compounds in human plasma. Methodology & results: The analytes were first derivatized with 2-hydrazinopyridine and extracted from plasma using SPE. Then, the compounds were separated and detected by LC-MS/MS. A mobile phase of formic  (0.1%) in water and methanol through a gradient of composition and a flow rate of 0.3 ml min resulted in good separations of the analytes. Linear responses in wide range of concentrations and LOQs ranging from 10 (dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate) to 40 pg ml (dehydroepiandrosterone) were obtained in <9 min. The method proposed has been validated and then applied to monitor these neurosteroids in plasma samples from ten volunteers.For the first time, a straightforward and reliable method for the chromatographic separation of allopregnanolone, epiallopregnanolone and pregnanolone, as well as of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate was carried out, with optimal accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730514>Intranasal Insulin Administration Ameliorates Streptozotocin (ICV)-Induced Insulin Receptor Dysfunction, Neuroinflammation, Amyloidogenesis, and Memory Impairment in Rats.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with reduced insulin level and impairment of insulin receptor (IR) signaling in the brain, which correlates to amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and synaptic neurotoxicity. Clinical studies show that intranasal insulin improves memory in AD patients without peripheral hypoglycemia. However, neuroprotective molecular mechanism of the beneficial effect of intranasal insulin in AD pathology is unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the role of intranasal insulin on intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impairment in rats as evaluated in the Morris water maze test. STZ (ICV) treated rats had shown memory impairment along with a significant decrease in IR signaling molecules (IR, pIRS-1, pAkt, and pGSK-3α/β expression) and IDE expression in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Intranasal insulin delivery prevented these changes. Moreover, intranasal insulin was found to inhibit significantly glial cell activation (GFAP and Iba-1 expression), neuroinflammation (COX-2 expression, NFκB translocation, TNF-α, and IL-10 level) and amyloidogenic protein expression (BACE-1 and Aβ expression) in STZ (ICV)-injected rats. STZ (ICV)-induced caspase activation and postsynaptic neurotoxicity were also prevented by treatment with intranasal insulin. Our findings reveal that insulin has the neuroprotective effect and clearly signifies the potential use of intranasal insulin delivery for the treatment of AD.

GSK-3 is involved in various cellular functions and physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival as well as glycogen metabolism, protein synthesis, and apoptosis. There are two isoforms of human GSK-3 (named GSK-3α and GSK-3β) encoded by two distinct genes. Recently, GSK-3β has been reported to function as a powerful regulator of various transport processes across the cell membrane. This kinase, GSK-3β, either directly or indirectly, may stimulate or inhibit many different types of transporter proteins, including ion channel and cellular carriers. More specifically, GSK-3β-sensitive cellular transport regulation involves various calcium, chloride, sodium, and potassium ion channels, as well as a number of Na+-coupled cellular carriers including excitatory amino  transporters EAAT2, 3 and 4, high-affinity Na+ coupled glucose carriers SGLT1, creatine transporter 1 CreaT1, and the type II sodium/phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIa. The GSK-3β-dependent cellular transport regulations are part of the kinase functions in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Clearly, additional studies are required to examine the role of GSK-3β in many other types of cellular transporters as well as further elucidating the underlying mechanisms of GSK-3β-mediated cellular transport regulation.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25765436>Dihydrotestosterone as a Protective Agent in Chronic Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system. As reported by clinical observations, variation in hormonal levels might alter disease susceptibility and progression. Specifically, decreased levels of testosterone in males are reported to be permissive for disease onset. Accordingly, testosterone seems to exert protective effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this context, it is important to highlight that testosterone is further metabolized into 17β-estradiol or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In this study, we aimed to explore the protective effects of DHT treatment in EAE Dark Agouti rats (i.e. an experimental model showing a protracted relapsing EAE). Data obtained 45 days after EAE induction showed that DHT exerts a beneficial effect on clinical scores, coupled with decreased gliosis (i.e. glial fibrillary acidic protein and major histocompatibility complex of class II staining) and inflammation (i.e. translocator protein 18 kDa, interleukin-1β, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB expression) in the spinal cord. Moreover, parameters linked to oxidative stress and tissue damage, like thiobarbituric -reactive substance levels and Bcl-2-associated X protein expression, and to mitochondrial activity (i.e. content of mitochondrial DNA and proteins), were improved after DHT administration. This neuroactive steroid may be further metabolized into 3α- or 3β-diol. However, assessment of the levels of these metabolites after DHT treatment seems to suggest that the protective effects observed here are due to DHT itself. Altogether, the present results indicate that DHT was effective in reducing the severity of chronic EAE and, consequently, may represent an interesting perspective for multiple sclerosis treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30928400>Human and murine steroid 5β-reductases (AKR1D1 and AKR1D4): insights into the role of the catalytic glutamic .</a></h1><p>Mammalian steroid 5β-reductases belong to the Aldo-Keto Reductase 1D sub-family and are essential for the formation of A-ring 5β-reduced steroids. Steroid 5β-reduction is required for the biosynthesis of bile- and the metabolism of all steroid hormones that contain a Δ-3-ketosteroid functionally to yield the 5β-reduced metabolites. In mammalian AKR1D enzymes the conserved catalytic tetrad found in all AKRs (Y55, H117, K84 and D50) has changed in that the conserved H117 is replaced with a glutamic  (E120). E120 may act as a "superacid" to facilitate enolization of the Δ-ketosteroid. In addition, the absence of the bulky imidazole side chain of histidine in E120 permits the steroid to penetrate deeper into the active site so that hydride transfer can occur to the steroid C5 position. In murine steroid 5β-reductase AKR1D4, we find that there is a long-form, with an 18 amino- extension at the N-terminus (AKR1D4L) and a short-form (AKR1D4S), where the latter is recognized as AKR1D4 by the major data-bases. Both enzymes were purified to homogeneity and product profiling was performed. With progesterone and cortisol, AKR1D4L and AKR1D4S catalyzed smooth conversion to the 5β-dihydrosteroids. However, with Δ-androstene-3,17-dione as substrate, a mixture of products was observed which included, 5β-androstane-3,17-dione (expected) but 3α-hydroxy-5β- androstan-17-one was also formed. The latter compound was distinguished from its isomeric 3β-hydroxy-5β-androstan-17-one by forming picolinic  derivatives followed by LC-MS. These data show that AKR1D4L and AKR1D4S also act as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases when presented with Δ-androstene-3,17-dione and suggest that E120 alters the position the steroid to enable a correct trajectory for hydride transfer and may not act as a "superacid".Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the lipophilicity, a crucial physicochemical parameter for describing ADME properties of selected bile  and their oxo derivatives, and to compare two approaches: experimentally determined hydrophobicity parameters and calculated logP values.Commercially available bile  - deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic, hyodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic  were used to synthesize oxo derivatives. Lipophilicity was evaluated in two solvent systems: toluene/ethanol and toluene/butanol. Retention parameters were acquired by normal-phase TLC. The correlations between calculated logP values obtained using five different software and experimentally determined hydrophobicity parameters (RM(0)(tol/eth), RM(0)(tol/but), b(tol/eth) and b(tol/but)) were examined.Correlation analysis confirmed significant dependence between experimental RM(0) values and software calculated parameters. Results suggest satisfactory intestinal absorption after oral administration for all of the examined compounds as well as low volumes of distribution, and high affinity for binding with plasma proteins. Penetration through blood-brain barrier and skin is not satisfactory. All of the examined compounds show high affinity for binding with G-protein coupled receptors and consequently inhibition of ionic channels. Results also suggest possible binding with nuclear receptors.Established lipophilicity testing model of studied compounds showed excellent predictive ability and might represent significant tool in development of relations between chromatographic behavior and ADME properties.

The recombinant enzymes were characterized from each species and shown to preferentially reduce 12-oxolithocholic  to deoxycholic , with low activity against 12-oxochenodeoxycholic  and reduced activity when bile  were conjugated to taurine or glycine. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that 12α-HSDH is widespread among ,  in the  family, and human gut  12α-HSDH activity has been established in the medically important bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacteria , , and  Experiments with recombinant 12α-HSDHs from these strains are consistent with culture-based experiments that show a robust preference for 12-oxolithocholic  over 12-oxochenodeoxycholic . Phylogenetic analysis identified novel members of the gut microbiome encoding 12α-HSDH. Future reengineering of 12α-HSDH enzymes to preferentially oxidize cholic  may provide a means to industrially produce the therapeutic bile  ursodeoxycholic . In addition, a cholic -specific 12α-HSDH expressed in the gut may be useful for the reduction in deoxycholic  concentration, a bile  implicated in cancers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542386>Neurosteroid effects at α4βδ GABAA receptors alter spatial learning and synaptic plasticity in CA1 hippocampus across the estrous cycle of the mouse.</a></h1><p>Fluctuations in circulating levels of ovarian hormones have been shown to regulate cognition (Sherwin and Grigorova, 2011. Fertil. Steril. 96, 399-403; Shumaker et al., 2004. JAMA. 291, 2947-2958), but increases in estradiol on the day of proestrus yield diverse outcomes: In vivo induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a model of learning, is reduced in the morning, but optimal in the afternoon (Warren et al., 1995. Brain Res. 703, 26-30). The mechanism underlying this discrepancy is not known. Here, we show that impairments in both CA1 hippocampal LTP and spatial learning observed on the morning of proestrus are due to increased dendritic expression of α4βδ GABAA receptors (GABARs) on CA1 pyramidal cells, as assessed by electron microscopic (EM) techniques, compared with estrus and diestrus. LTP induction and spatial learning were robust, however, when assessed on the morning of proestrus in α4-/- mice, implicating these receptors in mediating impaired plasticity. Although α4βδ expression remained elevated on the afternoon of proestrus, increases in 3α-OH-THP (3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one) decreased inhibition by reducing outward current through α4βδ GABARs (Shen et al., 2007. Nat. Neurosci. 10, 469-477), in contrast to the usual effect of this steroid to enhance inhibition. Proestrous levels of 3α-OH-THP reversed the deficits in LTP and spatial learning, an effect prevented by the inactive metabolite 3β-OH-THP (10 mg/kg, i.p.), which antagonizes actions of 3α-OH-THP. In contrast, administration of 3α-OH-THP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the morning of proestrus improved spatial learning scores 150-300%. These findings suggest that cyclic fluctuations in ovarian steroids can induce changes in cognition via α4βδ GABARs that are dependent upon 3α-OH-THP.

High levels of TGR5 mRNA have been detected in human and rodent placenta, however, localization of the TGR5 protein has not been studied in this tissue. We aimed at characterizing TGR5 expression in placental tissue and investigated the effect of bile  and progesterone metabolites, which accumulate during intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), on receptor expression and localization.TGR5 mRNA levels and cell-specific localization were determined by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence, respectively.In human term placentas, TGR5 was mainly localized in fetal macrophages and to a lower extent in trophoblasts. In placentas from ICP patients and pregnant rats with obstructive cholestasis a marked down-regulation of TGR5 mRNA expression was observed. However, the cell-specific distribution of the TGR5 protein was unaffected. Besides bile , progesterone and its metabolites (5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one/5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one), which increase in serum during ICP, were able to dose-dependently activate TGR5. In addition, progesterone metabolites but not their sulfated derivatives nor taurolithocholic , significantly down-regulated TGR5 mRNA and protein expression in isolated human macrophages and a macrophage-derived cell line.Since fetal macrophages and trophoblast cells are exposed to changes in the flux of compounds across the placental barrier, the expression of TGR5 in these cells together with its sensitivity to bile  and progesterone metabolites regarding receptor activity and mRNA expression suggest that TGR5 may play a role in the effect of maternal cholestasis on the placenta.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The novel metabolites were elucidated to be 3α-acetoxy-27-hydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic  methyl ester (1, OA) and N-acetyl-9-syringinoside (9). Some compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity against human tumor cells. Among them, OA showed the highest cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cells A549 with an IC50 value of 8.03 ± 0.81 μm. OA had a potent anti-NSCLC cell activity by interfering with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and its downstream signaling, and could exert an antiproliferative effect by inactivation of EGFR-driven antiapoptotic pathway followed by the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which might prove to be a promising leading compound for the development of an anti-lung cancer drug.© 2016 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zürich.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29842795>Two new echinocystic  derivatives catalyzed by filamentous fungus  CGMCC 3.3657.</a></h1><p>Biotransformation of Echinocystic  (EA,) using  CGMCC 3.3657 has been investigated, which leads to the isolation and identification of two novel Echinocystic  derivatives, 4, 16α-dihydroxy-3,4-seco-olean-12-en-3,28-dioic  () and 16α-hydroxy, A-homo-3α-oxa-olean-12-en-3-one-28-oic  ().

Present study found that miR-19b was significantly downregulated in active Crohn's disease (CD). Using bioinformatics analysis, suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a physiological regulator of innate and adaptive immunity that controls several immuno-inflammatory diseases, was predicted to be a potential target of miR-19b. An inverse correlation between miR-19b and SOCS3 protein levels, but not mRNA, was identified in active-CD intestinal tissue samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-19b in Caco2 cells and HT29 cells, it was experimentally validated that miR-19b is a direct regulator of SOCS3. Using a luciferase reporter assay, it was confirmed that miR-19b directly recognizes the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SOCS3. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-19b decreased SOCS3 expression, leading to increased production of macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) in Caco2 cells. In contrast, knockdown of miR-19b increased SOCS3 and decreased MIP-3α. Finally, intracolonically delivered miR-19b decreased the severity of colitis induced with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic  (TNBS). Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-19b suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting SOCS3 to modulate chemokine production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thereby prevents the pathogenesis of CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24328955>Structural requirements of the human sodium-dependent bile  transporter (hASBT): role of 3- and 7-OH moieties on binding and translocation of bile .</a></h1><p>Bile  (BAs) are the end products of cholesterol . One of the critical steps in their biosynthesis involves the isomerization of the 3β-hydroxyl (-OH) group on the cholestane ring to the common 3α-configuration on BAs. BAs are actively recaptured from the small intestine by the human Apical Sodium-dependent Bile  Transporter (hASBT) with high affinity and capacity. Previous studies have suggested that no particular hydroxyl group on BAs is critical for binding or transport by hASBT, even though 3β-hydroxylated BAs were not examined. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the 3α-OH group on BAs binding and translocation by hASBT. Ten 3β-hydroxylated BAs (Iso-bile , iBAs) were synthesized, characterized, and subjected to hASBT inhibition and uptake studies. hASBT inhibition and uptake kinetics of iBAs were compared to that of native 3α-OH BAs. Glycine conjugates of native and isomeric BAs were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to identify topological descriptors related to binding and translocation by hASBT. Iso-BAs bound to hASBT with lower affinity and exhibited reduced translocation than their respective 3α-epimers. Kinetic data suggests that, in contrast to native BAs where hASBT binding is the rate-limiting step, iBAs transport was rate-limited by translocation and not binding. Remarkably, 7-dehydroxylated iBAs were not hASBT substrates, highlighting the critical role of 7-OH group on BA translocation by hASBT, especially for iBAs. Conformational analysis of gly-iBAs and native BAs identified topological features for optimal binding as: concave steroidal nucleus, 3-OH "on-" or below-steroidal plane, 7-OH below-plane, and 12-OH moiety toward-plane. Our results emphasize the relevance of the 3α-OH group on BAs for proper hASBT binding and transport and revealed the critical role of 7-OH group on BA translocation, particularly in the absence of a 3α-OH group. Results have implications for BA prodrug design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26177448>Impaired Itching Perception in Murine Models of Cholestasis Is Supported by Dysregulation of GPBAR1 Signaling.</a></h1><p>In cholestatic syndromes, body accumulation of bile  is thought to cause itching. However, the mechanisms supporting this effect remain elusive. Recently, GPBAR1 (TGR5) a G-protein coupled receptor has been shown to mediate itching caused by intradermal administration of DCA and LCA. 6α-ethyl-3α, 7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholan-23-ol (BAR502) is a non-bile  dual ligand for FXR and GPBAR1.Cholestasis was induced in wild type and GPBAR1-/- mice by administration of α-naphthyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT) or 17α-ethynylestradiol.In naïve mice skin application of DCA, TLCA, 6-ECDCA, oleanolic and betulinic  induces a GPBAR1 dependent pruritogenic response that could be desensitized by re-challenging the mice with the same GPBAR1 agonist. In wild type and GPBAR1-/- mice cholestasis induced by ANIT fails to induce spontaneous itching and abrogates scratching behavior caused by intradermal administration of DCA. In this model, co-treatment with BAR502 increases survival, attenuates serum alkaline phosphatase levels and robustly modulates the liver expression of canonical FXR target genes including OSTα, BSEP, SHP and MDR1, without inducing pruritus. Betulinic , a selective GPBAR1 ligand, failed to rescue wild type and GPBAR1-/- mice from ANIT cholestasis but did not induced itching. In the 17α-ethynylestradiol model BAR502 attenuates cholestasis and reshapes bile  pool without inducing itching.The itching response to intradermal injection of GPBAR1 agonists desensitizes rapidly and is deactivated in models of cholestasis, explain the lack of correlation between bile  levels and itching severity in cholestatic syndromes. In models of non-obstructive cholestasis, BAR502 attenuates liver injury without causing itching.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26007193>Relationship between High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Fingerprints and Uric -Lowering Activities of Cichorium intybus L.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to explore the spectrum-effect relationships between high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and the uric -lowering activities of chicory. Chemical fingerprints of chicory samples from ten different sources were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and then investigated by similarity analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Pharmacodynamics experiments were conducted in animals to obtain the uric -lowering activity information of each chicory sample. The spectrum-effect relationships between chemical fingerprints and the uric -lowering activities of chicory were established by canonical correlation analysis. The structures of potential effective peaks were identified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that a close correlation existed between the spectrum and effect of chicory.

Northern elephant seals are naturally adapted to prolonged periods (1-2 months) of food deprivation (fasting) which result in  changes that may activate HIF-1. However, the effects of prolonged fasting on HIFs are not well defined. We obtained the full-length cDNAs of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and partial cDNA of HIF-3α in northern elephant seal pups. We also measured mRNA and nuclear protein content of HIF-1α, -2α, -3α in muscle and adipose during prolonged fasting (1, 3, 5 & 7 weeks), along with mRNA expression of HIF-mediated genes, LDH and VEGF. HIF-1α, -2α and -3α are 2595, 2852 and 1842 bp and encode proteins of 823, 864 and 586 amino  residues with conserved domains needed for their function (bHLH and PAS) and regulation (ODD and TAD). HIF-1α and -2α mRNA expression increased 3- to 5-fold after 7 weeks of fasting in adipose and muscle, whereas HIF-3α increased 5-fold after 7 weeks of fasting in adipose. HIF-2α protein expression was detected in nuclear fractions from adipose and muscle, increasing approximately 2-fold, respectively with fasting. Expression of VEGF increased 3-fold after 7 weeks in adipose and muscle, whereas LDH mRNA expression increased 12-fold after 7 weeks in adipose. While the 3 HIFα genes are expressed in muscle and adipose, only HIF-2α protein was detectable in the nucleus suggesting that HIF-2α may contribute more significantly in the up-regulation of genes involved in the  adaptation during fasting in the elephant seal.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report that APE2 resection activity is regulated by DNA interactions in its Zf-GRF domain, a region sharing high homology with DDR proteins Topoisomerase 3α (TOP3α) and NEIL3 (Nei-like DNA glycosylase 3), as well as transcription and RNA regulatory proteins, such as TTF2 (transcription termination factor 2), TFIIS, and RPB9. Biochemical and NMR results establish the nucleic -binding activity of the Zf-GRF domain. Moreover, an APE2 Zf-GRF X-ray structure and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses show that the Zf-GRF fold is typified by a crescent-shaped ssDNA binding claw that is flexibly appended to an APE2 endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase (EEP) catalytic core. Structure-guided Zf-GRF mutations impact APE2 DNA binding and 3'-5' exonuclease processing, and also prevent efficient APE2-dependent RPA recruitment to damaged chromatin and activation of the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway in response to oxidative stress in Xenopus egg extracts. Collectively, our data unveil the APE2 Zf-GRF domain as a nucleic  interaction module in the regulation of a key single-strand break resection function of APE2, and also reveal topologic similarity of the Zf-GRF to the zinc ribbon domains of TFIIS and RPB9.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267167>Chenodeoxycholic : An Update on Its Therapeutic Applications.</a></h1><p>Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic , is a primary bile  generated in the liver from cholesterol. In liver cells CDCA is conjugated with glycine or taurine to form two bile salts, Glyco-CDCA and Tauro-CDCA, before being released into the bile ducts. In the intestine, CDCA is further metabolized to generate a 7β epimer, i.e., the ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), or dehydroxylate to generate lithocolic  (LCA). In humans, CDCA is the physiological ligand for the bile  sensor farnesoid X receptor (FXR), while LCA is a potent agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor, known as GPBAR1 (TGR5). Along with UDCA, CDCA has been clinically used for the dissolution of gallbladder stones at doses ranging from 375 to 750 mg/day, with a success rate of 8 to 18%. Because the efficacy of CDCA was significantly lower than that of UDCA and 18-30% of patients developed significant side effects, the most frequent being diarrhea and a reversible increase in aminotransferases plasma levels, this application has lost its therapeutic relevance. Additionally, the combination of CDCA with UDCA, generally at doses of 5-10 mg/kg each, has failed to provide significant advantages over UDCA alone. In 2017, CDCA has been approved as an orphan indication for the treatment of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) gene. Since CYP27A1 is essential for cholesterol breakdown, CTX patients develop abnormal lipid storage with increased plasma and tissue levels of cholestanol and very low/absent production of CDCA. CDCA is a potent inhibitor of CYP27A1, and early initiation of CDCA therapy, at doses up to 750 mg/day, is considered the standard medical therapy for CTX resulting in decreased plasma levels of cholestanol and stabilization of neurologic symptoms. Studies in CTX patients have also shown that CDCA might suppress the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase in the liver. Furthermore, CDCA promotes the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in diabetic patients, likely by activating GPBAR1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28278642>Biogenic guaianolide-type sesquiterpene lactones with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties from natural mangrove hybrid Rhizophora annamalayana.</a></h1><p>Previously undescribed guaianolide-type sesquiterpene lactones were isolated from the chloroform fraction of the natural hybrid mangrove Rhizophora annamalayana, and were characterised as (Z)-3α,4,5,6-tetrahydro-5α-isobutyl-2β-(methoxymethyl)-7-methyl-3H-cyclohepta[b]carbolactone (1) and (7Z)-isopentyl 3α,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-2β-((E)-11-methylbut-10-enyl)-1-oxo-2H-cyclohepta[b]furan-6-carboxylate (2).

In C57BL/6J mice, SI is associated with an altered hippocampal concentration of the neuroactive steroids 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (3α-5α-THP), an increased expression of the α4 and δ subunit of γ-aminobutyric  type A receptors (GABAARs) in the dentate gyrus (DG), and a parallel enhancement of the stimulatory action of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c] pyridin-3-ol (THIP) on GABAergic tonic currents recorded in voltage-clamped DG granule cells (DGGCs). In addition, SI in C57BL/6J mice determines an increase in voluntary EtOH consumption and EtOH preference when compared to group-housed (GH) control animals. Furthermore, in hippocampal slices of SI mice we also observed a marked reduction of both cellular excitability and long term potentiation (LTP) in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 hippocampal sub-region, effects that were prevented by the long term treatment of SI mice with the neuroactive steroid precursor progesterone.

Early identification and treatment from birth onward effectively provides a functional cure, but diagnosis is often delayed. We conducted a pilot study using a two-tier test for CTX to screen archived newborn dried bloodspots (DBSs) or samples collected prospectively from a high-risk Israeli newborn population. All DBS samples were analyzed with flow injection analysis (FIA)-MS/MS, and 5% of samples were analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Consecutively collected samples were analyzed to identify CTX-causing founder genetic variants common among Druze and Moroccan Jewish populations. First-tier analysis with FIA-MS/MS provided 100% sensitivity to detect CTX-positive newborn DBSs, with a low false-positive rate (0.1-0.5%). LC-MS/MS, as a second-tier test, provided 100% sensitivity to detect CTX-positive newborn DBSs with a false-positive rate of 0% (100% specificity). In addition, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol-3--β-D-glucuronide was identified as the predominant bile-alcohol disease marker present in CTX-positive newborn DBSs. In newborns identifying as Druze, a 1:30 carriership frequency was determined for the c.355delC  gene variant, providing an estimated disease prevalence of 1:3,600 in this population. These data support the feasibility of two-tier DBS screening for CTX in newborns and set the stage for large-scale prospective pilot studies.Copyright © 2018 DeBarber et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26969382>Anti-angiogenic activity and mechanism of kaurane diterpenoids from Wedelia chinensis.</a></h1><p>Wedelia chinensis is a traditional medicinal herb used in Asia and it has been reported to possess various bioactivities including anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. However, its anti-angiogenic activity has never been reported.To determine the most potent anti-angiogenic component in W. chinensis and its molecular mechanism of action.Initially, the active fraction of the plant was studied. Then, we determined the active components of the fraction and explored the mechanism of the most active compound.The ethanol extract of W. chinensis and its four fractions with different polarities were evaluated for their anti-angiogenic activity in the Zebrafish model using quantitative endogenous alkaline phosphatase (EAP) assay. The molecular mechanism of the most active compound from the active fraction was studied using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on Zebrafish embryos. The inhibitory effect of the most active compound on the proliferation, invasion and tube formation steps of angiogenesis was evaluated using the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) model, and the influences of the active compound on tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2) and its downstream signal pathway were evaluated by western blotting assay. Moreover, its anti-angiogenic effect was further evaluated by the VEGF-induced sprouts formation on aortic ring assay and the VEGF-induced vessel formation of mice on matrigel plug assay, respectively.Petroleum ether (PE) fraction of the plant displayed potent anti-angiogenic activity. Twelve kaurane diterpenoids (1-12) isolated from this fraction showed quite different effects. Compounds 9-12 could dose-dependently inhibit vessel formation in the Zebrafish embryos while the others showed little inhibitory effect. Among the active diterpenoids, compound 10, 3α-cinnamoyloxy-9ß-hydroxy-ent-kaura-16-en-19-oic  (CHKA), possessed the strongest effect, and it affected multiple molecular targets related to angiogenesis including VEGF and angiopoietin in Zerbrafish. Moreover, CHKA significantly inhibited a series of VEGF-induced angiogenesis processes including proliferation, invasion, and tube formation of endothelial cells. Besides, it directly inhibited VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity and its downstream signaling  in HUVECs. CHKA also obviously inhibited sprouts formation of aortic ring, and block vessel formation in mice.Our findings demonstrate that kaurane diterpenoids is one of anti-angiogenic components in W. chinensis, and CHKA may become a promising candidate for the development of anti-angiogenic agent.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Mood stabilizers lithium and valproic , used for treating bipolar disorder, cause cellular inositol depletion, which has been proposed as a therapeutic mechanism of action of both drugs. Despite the importance of inositol, the requirement for inositol synthesis in neuronal cells is not well understood. Here, we examined inositol effects on proliferation of SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. The essential role of inositol synthesis in proliferation is underscored by the findings that exogenous inositol was dispensable for proliferation, and inhibition of inositol synthesis decreased proliferation. Interestingly, the inhibition of inositol synthesis by knocking down INO1, which encodes inositol-3-phosphate synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of inositol synthesis, led to the inactivation of GSK-3α by increasing the inhibitory phosphorylation of this kinase. Similarly, the mood stabilizer valproic  effected transient decreases in intracellular inositol, leading to inactivation of GSK-3α. As GSK-3 inhibition has been proposed as a likely therapeutic mechanism of action, the finding that inhibition of inositol synthesis results in the inactivation of GSK-3α suggests a unifying hypothesis for mechanism of mood-stabilizing drugs. Inositol is an essential metabolite that serves as a precursor for inositol lipids and inositol phosphates. We report that inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of inositol synthesis leads to the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3α by increasing inhibitory phosphorylation of this kinase. These findings have implications for the therapeutic mechanisms of mood stabilizers and suggest that inositol synthesis and GSK 3α activity are intrinsically related.© 2014 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27531846>Simultaneous quantitation of nine hydroxy-androgens and their conjugates in human serum by stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the fatal form of prostate cancer, remains androgen dependent despite castrate levels of circulating testosterone (T) and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). To investigate mechanisms by which the tumor can synthesize its own androgens and develop resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, methods to measure a complete androgen profile are imperative. Here, we report the development and validation of a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (SID-LC-ESI-MS/MS) method to quantify nine human hydroxy-androgens as picolinates, simultaneously with requisite specificity and sensitivity. In the established method, the fragmentation patterns of all nine hydroxy-androgen picolinates were identified, and [C]-5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol and [C]-5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol used as internal standards were synthesized enzymatically. Intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy corresponds to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Criteria for Bioanalytical Method Validation. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of nine hydroxy-androgens is 1.0pg to 2.5pg on column. Diols which have been infrequently measured: 5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol and 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol can be determined in serum at values as low as 1.0pg on column. The method also permits the quantitation of conjugated hydroxy-androgens following enzymatic digestion. While direct detection of steroid conjugates by electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry has advantages the detection of unconjugated and conjugated steroids would require separate methods for each set of analytes. Our method was applied to pooled serum from male and female donors to provide reference values for both unconjugated and conjugated hydroxy-androgens. This method will allow us to interrogate the involvement of the conversion of 5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol to T, the backdoor pathway involving the conversion of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol to DHT and the inactivation of DHT to 5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol in advanced prostate cancer.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the FES of unbinding of the antagonist N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan (UniPR129) from its EphA2 receptor was reconstructed by META-D simulations. The characterization of the free- minima identified on this FES proposes a binding mode fully consistent with previously reported and new structure-activity relationship data. To validate this binding mode, new N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to displace ephrin-A1 from the EphA2 receptor. Among them, two antagonists, namely compounds 21 and 22, displayed high affinity versus the EphA2 receptor and resulted endowed with better physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties than the parent compound.

The main objective of this study was to determine the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of individual infiltrating T helper (Th)-1 and 17 cells of pSS patients using single-cell analysis. Single-cell analysis of ex-vivo infiltrating T cells demonstrated that pSS patients had higher frequencies of activated Th17 cells. Single-cell TCR sequencing revealed that TCRβ variable (TRBV)3-1/joint (J)1-2 (CLFLSMSACVW) and TRBV20-1/J1-1 (SVGSTAIPP*T) were expressed by activated Th1 and Th17 cells in both cohorts. Uniquely, TCRα variable (TRAV)8-2/J5 (VVSDTVLETAGE) was expressed by Th1 cells present only in patients and complementarity-determining region (CDR)3α-specific motif (LSTD*E) present in both Th1/Th17 cells. The study demonstrates that both activated Th1 and Th17 cells of pSS patients showed restricted clonal diversities of which two CDR3 motifs were present in controls and patients, with another two motifs unique to pSS.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To better understand the transmission dynamics of P. vivax parasites in China, the extent of genetic diversity of P. vivax populations circulating in Bozhou of Anhui province of China were investigated using three polymorphic genetic markers: merozoite surface proteins 1 and 3α (pvmsp-1 and pvmsp-3α) and circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp).Forty-five P. vivax clinical isolates from Bouzhou of Anhui province were collected from 2009 to 2010 and were analysed using PCR/RFLP or DNA sequencing.Seven and six distinct allelic variants were identified using PCR/RFLP analysis of pvmsp-3α with HhaI and AluI, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of pvmsp-1 (variable block 5) revealed that there were Sal-I and recombinant types but not Belem type, and seven distinct allelic variants in pvmsp-1 were detected, with recombinant subtype 2 (R2) being predominant (66.7%). All the isolates carried pvcsp with VK210 type but not VK247 or P. vivax-like types in the samples. Sequence analysis of pvcsp gene revealed 12 distinct allelic variants, with VK210-1 being predominant (41.5%).The present data indicate that there is some degree of genetic diversity among P. vivax populations in Anhui province of China.

Because APα was suggested to improve the symptoms of depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which involve synaptic dysfunction and loss, we examined whether APα affects excitatory synapses. Drebrin, which is an actin-binding protein, forms a unique stable actin structure in dendritic spines, and drebrin levels correlate positively with cognitive levels in AD and mild cognitive impairment. We investigated whether APα increases excitatory synapse density along dendrites of mature hippocampal neurons using drebrin-imaging-based evaluation of mature synapses. We prepared primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and either transfected them with GFP or immunostained them against drebrin. Morphological analysis of GFP-transfected neurons revealed that a 24-h exposure to 0.3 or 1 μM APα significantly increased dendritic spine density without any morphological changes to spines. Drebrin cluster density was also increased by 0.3 and 1 μM APα. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 inhibited the APα-induced increase in drebrin cluster density. These data demonstrate that APα increases mature excitatory synapses via activation of PKA. Therefore, the PKA-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway is likely to be involved in the APα-induced increase of mature excitatory synapses. Another possibility is that the PKA-dependent increase in AMPA receptors at dendritic spines mediates the APα function. In conclusion, our study indicates that APα may improve neuropsychiatric disorder outcomes via increasing the numbers of mature excitatory synapses.Copyright © 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show that besides boswellic , additional known triterpene  (i.e., tircuallic, lupeolic, and roburic ) isolated from frankincense suppress mPGES-1 with increased potencies. In particular, 3α-acetoxy-8,24-dienetirucallic  (6) and 3α-acetoxy-7,24-dienetirucallic  (10) inhibited mPGES-1 activity in a cell-free assay with IC50 = 0.4 μM, each.

COX-1 and -2 were hardly affected by the triterpene  (IC50 > 10 μM). Given the crucial role of mPGES-1 in inflammation and the abundance of highly active triterpene  in frankincence extracts, our findings provide further evidence of the anti-inflammatory potential of frankincense preparations and reveal novel, potent bioactivities of tirucallic , roburic , and lupeolic .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29207196>High-resolution metabolomics determines the mode of onset of type 2 diabetes in a 3-year prospective cohort study.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a progressive disease and the rate of progression from non-diabetes to DM varies considerably between individuals, ranging from a few months to many years. It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the progression of diabetes. In the present study, a high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) analysis was performed to detect potential biomarkers and  regulating the mode of onset by comparing subjects who developed and did not develop type 2 DM at the second year in a 3-year prospective cohort study.  profiles correlated with progression to DM were examined. The subjects (n=98) were classified into four groups: Control (did not develop DM for 3 years), DM (diagnosed with DM at the start of the study), DM onset at the third year and DM onset at the second year. The focus was on the comparison of serum samples of the DM groups with onset at the second and third year from the first year, where these two groups had not developed DM, yet. Analyses involved sample examination using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based HRM and multivariate statistical analysis of the data.  differences were identified across all analyses with the affected  involved in  associated with steroid biosynthesis and bile  biosynthesis. In the first year, higher levels of cholesterol {mass-to charge ratio (m/z) 369.35, (M+H-H2O)+}, 25-hydroxycholesterol [m/z 403.36, (M+H)+], 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestane [m/z 443.33, (M+K)+], 4α-methylzymosterol-4-carboxylate [m/z 425.34, (M+H‑H2O)+], and lower levels of 24,25-dihydrolanosterol [m/z 429.40, (M+H)+] were evident in the group with DM onset at the second year compared with those in the group with DM onset at the third year.

The 2 neuroactive steroids are being investigated as treatments for SE, including as a treatment for SE induced by chemical threat agents. Intramuscular injection is the preferred route of administration in the prehospital treatment of SE. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of intramuscular allopregnanolone and ganaxolone in the treatment of SE induced by the chemical threat agent tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS). The test agents were administered 40 minutes after the onset of SE when mice are refractory to treatment. Allopregnanolone and ganaxolone (each at 3 mg/kg) terminated SE in, respectively, 92% and 75% of animals, and prevented mortality in 85% and 50% of animals; the mean times to termination of behavioral seizures were, respectively, 172 ± 16 and 447 ± 52 seconds. In a separate series of experiments, mice were dosed with the neuroactive steroids by intramuscular injection, and plasma and brain levels were sampled at various time points following injection to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. Plasma C (maximum concentration) values for allopregnanolone and ganaxolone were 645 and 550 ng/mL, respectively. Brain exposure of both steroids was approximately 3-fold the plasma exposure. Two-compartment pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the central compartment V (volume of distribution), CL (clearance), t (terminal half-life), and F (intramuscular bioavailability) values for allopregnanolone and ganaxolone were, respectively, 4.95 L/kg 12.88 L/kg/h,16 minutes, 97%, and 5.07 L/kg, 8.35 L/kg/h, 25 minutes, 95%. Allopregnanolone and ganaxolone are effective in the treatment of TETS-induced SE when administered by the intramuscular route. Allopregnanolone is more rapidly acting and modestly more effective, possibly because it has greater potency on GABA receptors.Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2018 International League Against Epilepsy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913427>One step affinity recovery of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from cloned Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>3α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), from Comamonas Testosterone, catalyze reversibly the oxidoreduction of 3α-hydroxyl groups of the steroid hormones.

Bile salt compounds have been shown to be effective additive for drug permeation through several biological membranes. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of a mixed micelles made of phosphatidylcholine, sodium deoxycholate, and loaded with a cefotaxime-3α,7α-dihydroxy-12-keto-5β-cholanate complex to enhance the oral bioavailability of cefotaxime in rats.Thin-film hydration method was used to prepare cefotaxime-loaded mixed micelles using different bile salt concentrations (0.87-25 mM of sodium deoxycholate). Overall, micelle sizes ranging from 86.9 to 155.6 nm were produced with negative zeta potential values from -15.9 to -19.5 mV and drug loading from 10.5 to 18.9 %. The oral bioavailability of cefotaxime in mixed micellar formulation was assessed and the pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with cefotaxime-3α,7α-dihydroxy-12-keto-5β-cholanate complex and cefotaxime aqueous solution. 24 Male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 6, per group) to receive the following: (1) a single intravenous dose of cefotaxime (25 mg/kg) in sterilized normal saline solution for injection; (2) a single oral dose of mixed micelles (100 mg/kg of cefotaxime) in phosphate buffered saline administered by oral gavage; (3) a single oral dose of cefotaxime-3α,7α-dihydroxy-12-keto-5β-cholanate complex (100 mg/kg of cefotaxime) in phosphate buffered saline administered by oral gavage; (4) a single oral dose of free cefotaxime (100 mg/kg) in aqueous solution administered by oral gavage. Blood samples were collected for up to 24 h and cefotaxime analyzed using a validated HPLC assay.Pharmacokinetic data showed that the oral bioavailability of cefotaxime in mixed micelles was found to be 4.91 % higher compared to the cefotaxime in aqueous solution (1.30 %).

The precise regulation of the resolution of recombination intermediates is critical for the success of meiosis. Many proteins, including the RECQ DNA helicases (Sgs1/BLM) and Topoisomerase 3α (TOP3α), have essential functions in managing recombination intermediates. However, many other factors involved in this process remain to be defined. Here, we report the isolation of meiotic chromosome association 1 (MEICA1), a novel protein participating in meiotic recombination in rice (). Loss of MEICA1 leads to nonhomologous chromosome association, the formation of massive chromosome bridges, and fragmentation. MEICA1 interacts with MSH7, suggesting its role in preventing nonallelic recombination. In addition, MEICA1 has an anticrossover activity revealed by suppressing the defects of crossover formation in  compared with that in , showing the similar function with its interacted protein TOP3α. Thus, our data establish two pivotal roles for MEICA1 in meiosis: preventing aberrant meiotic recombination and regulating crossover formation.© 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

HIF-3α is a negative regulator of HIF-1α, whose mRNA is a potential target of miR-1290. AA could upregulate miR-1290 in non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells. This work aimed to investigate whether AA could inhibit hypoxia induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis through regulating the miR-1290/HIF3A/HIF-1α axis. The AC16 human myocardial cell line cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions was treated with various doses of AA for 24 h. Afterwards cell viability, apoptosis and the expression of miR-1290, HIF3A, and HIF1A were evaluated. Cells transfected with miR-1290 mimic or inhibitor were used to determine the role of miR-1290 in the anti-apoptosis effect of AA and the expression of HIF3A and HIF1A. Dual luciferase assay was performed to confirm miR-1290 targeting of HIF3A. HIF3A overexpression was achieved by transfection of HIF3A1 overexpressing lentivirus, and its effect on miR-1290 and AA-regulated survival of cardiomyocytes was evaluated. AA treatment protected cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and upregulated miR-1290 and HIF1A, but downregulated HIF3A under hypoxia. The protective effect of AA was abolished by miR-1290 knockdown, whereas enhanced by miR-1290 overexpression. In addition, miR-1290 knockdown increased HIF1A expression, but reduced HIF3A expression in cardiomyocytes. Dual luciferase assay confirmed miR-1290 direct targeting the 3' UTR of HIF3A. HIF3A overexpression counteracted the anti-apoptosis effect of AA or miR-1290. In conclusion, AA can protect cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-induced apoptosis through regulating the miR-1290/HIF3A/HIF-1α axis, and miR-1290 may be a potential target in the prevention of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.© 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(9):660-667, 2017.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24065526>Molecular characterization and expression analysis of three hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits, HIF-1α, -2α and -3α in hypoxia-tolerant Indian catfish, Clarias batrachus [Linnaeus, 1758].</a></h1><p>The present study aimed at characterization of three HIF-α subunits, HIF-1α -2α and -3α from hypoxia-tolerant Clarias batrachus, as well as to elucidate their expression pattern under short and long-term hypoxic conditions and identification of biomarker candidate. The complete cDNAs of HIF-1α, -2α and -3α were 2,833, 4,270 and 3,256 bp in length, encoding 774, 818 and 628 amino  residues, respectively. In C. batrachus, HIF-α subunits were structurally similar in DNA binding, dimerization, degradation and transcriptional activation domains, but differed in their oxygen-dependent degradation domains. Presence of c-Jun N-terminal kinase binding domain in HIF-α subunits was reported here for the first time in fish. In adult C. batrachus, three HIF-α mRNAs were detected in different tissues under normoxic conditions, however HIF-1α was highly expressed in all the tissues studied, in comparison to HIF-2α and -3α. Short-term hypoxia exposure caused significant increase in three HIF-α transcripts in brain, liver and head kidney, while after long-term hypoxia exposure, significant up-regulation of HIF-1α in spleen and -2α in muscle was observed and HIF-3α significantly down-regulated in head kidney. These observations suggest that the differential expression of HIF-α subunits in C. batrachus was hypoxic time period dependent and may play specialized roles in adaptive response to hypoxia. HIF-2α, with its highly elevated expression in muscle tissues, can be a robust biomarker candidate for exposure to hypoxic environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26181224>A new sesquiterpene from the entomogenous fungus Phomopsis amygdali.</a></h1><p>A new sesquiterpene, (+)-S-1-methyl-abscisic-6- (1), together with five known compounds, (+)-S-abscisic  (2), fusicoccin J (3), 3α-hydroxyfusicoccin J (4), (R)-5-hydroxymethylmellein (5) and 4-hydroxyphenethyl acetate (6) was isolated from the fermentation extract of Phomopsis amygdali, an entomogenous fungus isolated from Call midge.

COX-2 protein expression is highly induced by numerous factors and it has been reportedly overexpressed in various human malignancies. Although anti-tumorigenic effects of COX-2 inhibitors have been shown, several lines of evidence suggest that COX-2 inhibitors antagonize the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, on modulation of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced p53 accumulation. Non-selective and selective COX-2 inhibitors attenuated DOX-induced accumulation of wild type (WT) but not mutant p53. Nutlin-3α or MG132 abolished the suppressive effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on DOX-induced p53 increase. Moreover, the DOX-induced increase in p53 protein levels was reduced in COX-2 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to those in WT or COX-1 KO MEFs. DOX-induced accumulation of p53 was attenuated by a specific inhibitor or knockdown of Jun-N-terminal kinase (Jnk). In addition, DOX-induced Jnk activation was decreased in COX-2 KO MEFs or by COX-2 inhibition, suggesting that Jnk stabilizes p53 by a mechanism that involves COX-2. Pre-treatment with a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, attenuated DOX-induced Jnk activation and subsequent p53 accumulation. Furthermore, the absence or inhibition of COX-2 resulted in suppression of DOX-induced increase in ROS levels.

However, the continuous emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and their low urinary concentrations have challenged the scope and sensitivity of immunoassays. Consequently, specialized toxicology laboratories rely more and more on mass spectrometry (MS) based techniques. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS) is an especially attractive technique for comprehensive drug screening. The objective was to compare the performances of immunoassay and UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS in terms of scope, flexibility, sensitivity, and reliability of substance identification. A total of 279 post-mortem urine samples were analyzed using a method representative of each technique. The immunoassay method was an Emit II Plus enzyme immunoassay for the following drug groups: amphetamines, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, cannabis, and opiates. The UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS method was a recently published method covering hundreds of drugs: conventional drugs of abuse, abused prescription drugs, and NPS of various classes. UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS produced a lower number of false positive (FP) results for the drug groups covered by immunoassay. Many of the false negative (FN, n = 40) and FP (n = 22) immunoassay results were obviously due to the higher cut-off concentrations and interfering matrix, respectively. Moreover, the wider scope of UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS allowed detection of NPS and prescription drugs. UHPLC-HR-TOF-MS gave FP results related to a few particular substances. The future option of adjusting all compound-specific reporting parameters individually would allow the method's sensitivity and specificity to be fully exploited.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30877984>A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantitation of serum androstane-3α, 17β-diol and androstane-3β, 17β-diol in post-menopausal women.</a></h1><p>Sensitive and accurate measurement of androstane-3β,17β-diol and androstane-3α,17β-diol in the circulation is important for clinical research and accurate clinical diagnosis. This report describes a highly sensitive, specific, precise and reliable assay for the simultaneous accurate measurement of serum androstane-3α,17β-diol and androstane-3β,17β-diol in postmenopausal women. The LLOQ of 1 pg/mL has been achieved with nicotinic  derivatization, which is superior to picolinic  by a factor of 5 to 10 in terms of signal to noise ratio. The difference is attributed to the higher acidity of picolinic  which forms a more stable intermediate, thus decreasing derivatization efficiency. Potential interference from androstane-3α, 17α-diol, androstane-3β, 17α-diol, and 5-androstenediol has been well separated from the two target diols. The high level of specificity has been determined by well-developed chromatography and ion ratio monitoring. A good linearity in the range of 1 pg/mL to 200 pg/mL (0.03 pg to 6 pg on column) was obtained for both compounds at R > 0.998. The bias and coefficients of variation of all the QC levels are within the range of 10% while the recovery in both charcoal-stripped and unstripped human serum is around 85%. The matrix effect was evaluated and the results well met the acceptance criteria according to the guidelines of bioanalytical method development and validation. Using this newly developed method, the concentrations of both androstane-3α,17β diol and androstane-3β,17β diol were measured in normal postmenopausal serum, where the concentrations range from 2 pg/mL to 32 pg/mL for androstane-3α,17β diol and from 1 pg/mL to 10 pg/mL for androstane-3β,17β diol, respectively.Copyright © 2019.

With liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) and organic extraction from plasma and follicular fluid, a fast and efficient method was established for detecting the metabolites of human plasma and follicular fluid. Certain metabolites were closely related with human physiological activities, such as hormone, amino , estrogen and fatty , and estrogen fatty acyllipid lipid were successfully detected in human plasma and follicular fluid. The metabolites in follicular fluid and plasma on the day of oocyte retrieval were found to be similar. But those in the latter and basal plasma were partially different. Methyl (3α ,5β ,7α ,12α)-3,7,12-trihydroxycholan-24-oate, androst-4-ene-3,17-dione and tryptophan were identified and might be potential biomarkers on oocyte quality.

The aim of this study was to compare levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in SF, serum and/or EDTA plasma.SF and blood from rats subjected to Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA; n = 48) or monoiodoacetate (MIA; n = 88) monoarthritis and from control rats were collected over time. SF, EDTA plasma and serum were obtained from six individuals with OA of the knee and healthy controls. Levels of IL-6, KC/GRO, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 3α (MIP-3α), IL-1β, TNF and l(+)-lactate were assessed either by immune assay or by a colorimetric method.Elevated levels of biomarkers were shown in monoarthritic animals in SF compared with the control groups, although with considerably lower magnitude in the MIA groups, which also indicated a biphasic pattern. Levels of KC/GRO and MIP-3α in serum from the FCA model and IL-6 in the MIA model followed the pattern of SF. In serum samples from OA individuals, MIP-3α correlated significantly with levels in SF.While we found increased levels of markers in joint fluid and blood, no single systemic biochemical biomarkers that were a common denominator between the animal models and the patient material could be identified. Our data indicate that it is critical to delineate the temporal profile of multiple local and systemic factors in order to pinpoint soluble biomarkers for OA.© The Author 2014.

It is less well appreciated that progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone are also male hormones, as they are produced in both sexes by the adrenal glands. In addition, they are synthesized within the nervous system. Progesterone and allopregnanolone are associated with adaptation to stress, and increased production of progesterone within the brain may be part of the response of neural cells to injury. Progesterone receptors (PR) are widely distributed throughout the brain, but their study has been mainly limited to the hypothalamus and reproductive functions, and the extra-hypothalamic receptors have been neglected. This lack of information about brain functions of PR is unexpected, as the protective and trophic effects of progesterone are much investigated, and as the therapeutic potential of progesterone as a neuroprotective and promyelinating agent is currently being assessed in clinical trials. The little attention devoted to the brain functions of PR may relate to the widely accepted assumption that non-reproductive actions of progesterone may be mainly mediated by allopregnanolone, which does not bind to PR, but acts as a potent positive modulator of γ-aminobutyric  type A (GABA(A) receptors. The aim of this review is to critically discuss effects of progesterone on the nervous system via PR, and of allopregnanolone via its modulation of GABA(A) receptors, with main focus on the brain.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the potential anabolic effect, musk preparations have been included in the list of medical products containing prohibited substances employed for doping. The application of musk pod formulation was regarded as the reason of some adverse analytical findings in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. In order to investigate the influence of musk administration on the doping test, we executed a chemical analysis and excretion study. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis demonstrated the diversity of steroid concentrations in musk samples. Furthermore, the δ(13)C-values of steroids from wild deer musk showed more depleted than those of domestic deer musk by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) analysis. Because the steroids from some musk had δ(13)C-values in the range of naturally produced steroids in human body, the possible abuse of this kind of musk is very hard to be detected by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in doping control. Musk grains from wild and domestic deer were administrated for the excretion study respectively. Spot urine samples were collected from two male volunteers before and after 100 mg musk grains administration. The profiles and carbon isotope ratios of urinary steroids were determined by GC-MS and GC/C/IRMS. The ingestion of either wild or domestic deer musk did not lead to the adverse analytical finding of doping control in the single dosage of 100mg.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The principal reactions involved were (1) building of the cholesterol (iso-octane) side chain by 3-carbon elongation of the cholane (iso-pentane) one, (2) oxidation sequence to transform the 3α-hydroxy group of the steroidal A/B-ring to the desired 4-en-3-one system, and (3) appropriate protection strategy for hydroxy groups in the positions at C-7 and C-12 in the steroid nucleus. The absolute structure of 1a and 1b were confirmed by NMR and X-ray crystallography. The targeted compounds 1a and 1b, prepared in 11 steps from 2a and 2b respectively, should be useful for biochemical studies of bile  biosynthesis or clinical studies of bile  , as plasma levels of 1b (also termed C4) have been shown to correlate highly with the rate of bile  biosynthesis in man.Copyright © 2013 The Authors.

To monitor the use of norethisterone as part of a routine drug surveillance programme, knowledge of its  was required to enable detection.Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and selective derivatisation techniques have been used to identify urinary metabolites of norethisterone following oral administration to the greyhound. Metabolites were extracted using solid-phase and liquid-liquid extraction techniques.Several metabolites were identified, including reduced, mono-, di- and trihydroxylated steroids. The major metabolites observed were 17α-ethynyl-5β-estrane-3α,17β-diol, 17α-ethynyl-5α-estrane-3β,17β-diol, three 17α-ethynylestranetriol stereoisomers and two 17α-ethynylestranetetrol stereoisomers. The major metabolites were predominantly excreted as glucuronic  conjugates and detection of the administration of norethisterone was possible for up to 8 days post-dose using the methods described. The nandrolone metabolites, 19-norepiandrosterone, estranediol and 19-noretiocholanolone, were also identified in the post-administration samples collected up to 8 h after dosing the treated animals.The urinary metabolites identified in this study have further increased the knowledge of steroid  in the greyhound, providing information to support routine drug testing programmes for greyhound racing.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25671385>Oleanane-type triterpenoids of Aceriphyllum rossii and their diacylglycerol acyltransferase-inhibitory activity.</a></h1><p>Six known triterpenoid compounds, 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic  (1), gypsogenic  (2), 3α-hydroxyolean-12-en-27-oic  (3), 3β-hydroxyolean-12-en-27-oic  (4), aceriphyllic  A (5), and oleanolic  (6), were isolated from the roots of Aceriphyllum rossii. Their chemical structures were determined by comparison with available (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR data on known compounds. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for inhibitory activity against human diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 and 2. Most of the isolates exhibited a better inhibitory activity against diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (IC50: 11.6-44.2 µM) than against diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (IC50: 22.7-119.5 µM). In particular, compounds 1 and 5 showed strong inhibition efficacy towards diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 and 2, and appeared to act competitively against oleoyl-CoA in vitro. The results also indicated that both compounds reduced newly synthesized triacylglycerol in HuTu80 and HepG2 cells. Oral administration of compound 1 significantly reduced postprandial triacylglycerol in mice following an oral lipid challenge. In conclusion, the current study indicates that compound 1 suppresses both de novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis and resynthesis through the inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity, and therefore may be a useful agent for treating diseases associated with a high triacylglycerol level.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303744>Agonism for the bile  receptor GPBAR1 reverses  and vascular damage in a mouse model of steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality, suggesting that treatment of NASH might benefit from combined approaches that target the  and the cardiovascular components of NASH. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein-coupled bile -activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses  and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile  that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6β-ethyl-3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses  and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed  injury and promoted the browning of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6,TNF-α, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay.

In the present study, these five saponins were isolated from AGS by chromatography and their anti‑inflammatory activities were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑treated RAW264.7 macrophages. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β and NF‑κB p65 were measured by ELISA. The gene expression levels of TNF‑α and IL‑1β was detected by reverse‑transcription polymerase chain reaction. And high‑mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were analyzed by western blotting. The results demonstrated that these five saponins signiﬁcantly suppressed LPS‑induced expression of TNF‑α and IL‑1β at the mRNA and protein level in RAW264.7 cells. Further analysis revealed that acankoreoside A and acankoreoside B were able to reduce the secretion of HMGB1 and NF‑κB activity induced by LPS in RAW264.7 macrophages. Taken together, these results suggested that the anti‑inflammatory activity of AGS‑derived saponins may be associated with the downregulation of TNF‑α and IL‑1β, and the 'late‑phase' proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1, via negative regulation of the NF‑κB pathway in RAW264.7 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423320>Sequence and Structural Analyses Reveal Distinct and Highly Diverse Human CD8 TCR Repertoires to Immunodominant Viral Antigens.</a></h1><p>A diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is essential for controlling viral infections. However, information about TCR repertoires to defined viral antigens is limited. We performed a comprehensive analysis of CD8 TCR repertoires for two dominant viral epitopes: pp65 (NLV) of cytomegalovirus and M1 (GIL) of influenza A virus. The highly individualized repertoires (87-5,533 α or β clonotypes per subject) comprised thousands of unique TCRα and TCRβ sequences and dozens of distinct complementary determining region (CDR)3α and CDR3β motifs. However, diversity is effectively restricted by preferential V-J combinations, CDR3 lengths, and CDR3α/CDR3β pairings. Structures of two GIL-specific TCRs bound to GIL-HLA-A2 provided a potential explanation for the lower diversity of GIL-specific versus NLV-specific repertoires. These anti-viral TCRs occupied up to 3.4% of the CD8 TCRβ repertoire, ensuring broad T cell responses to single epitopes.

Recently, ethanol was reported to be either an inducer or inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A expression. According to our recent microarray data, chronic ethanol upregulates the expression of the genes associated with oxidative phase I drug , phase II conjugation reaction and phase III xenobiotic transport, most of which are known to be regulated by PXR. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic ethanol on the expression and activity of CYP3A11 in mice and the role of PXR. Ethanol was administrated to male ICR mice by feeding a standard Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 36 % ethanol for 4 weeks. Ethanol significantly increased hepatic mRNA expression of Pxr and Cyp3a11. Treatment of mice with ethanol increased nuclear translocation of PXR. Consistent with the increase in nuclear PXR, ethanol significantly increased the binding of PXR to the Cyp3a11 promoter. Hepatic cholesterol level and bile  synthesis are increased by ethanol treatment. The level of some cholesterol metabolites, such as 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholestene-3-one and lithocholic , that have been identified as potent PXR agonists are increased in the livers of ethanol-treated mice. In summary, chronic ethanol upregulates the expression of Pxr and Cyp3a11 mRNAs and proteins in mice by PXR activation mediated by enhanced cholesterol  and bile  synthesis.

CT and 7-KC were analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS as mono-dimethylglycine derivatives. Levels of 7-KC were high in most of the studied diseases, whereas those of CT were only high in NPC, LAL, and CTX patients.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease.

ICP is defined as an elevation of serum bile , typically accompanied by pruritus and elevated activities of liver aminotransferases. ICP is caused by impaired biliary lipid secretion, in which endogenous steroids may play a key role. Although ICP is benign for the pregnant woman, it may be harmful for the fetus. We evaluated the differences between maternal circulating steroids measured by RIA (17-hydroxypregnenolone and its sulfate, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and cortisol) and GC-MS (additional steroids), hepatic aminotransferases and bilirubin in women with ICP (n = 15, total bile  (TBA) >8 μM) and corresponding controls (n = 17). An age-adjusted linear model, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC), and multivariate regression (a method of orthogonal projections to latent structure, OPLS) were used for data evaluation.

However, others have argued that children homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia are treated with statins beginning at 1 year of age, that statins have low oral bioavailability, and risks to the breastfed infant are low, especially with rosuvastatin and pravastatin.[1] Until more data become available, an alternate drug may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034873>Induction of a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with autophagic characteristics with steroidal maleic anhydrides and 7β-hydroxycholesterol on glioma cells.</a></h1><p>Steroidal maleic anhydrides were prepared in one step: lithocholic, chenodeoxicholic, deoxicholic, ursocholic, and hyodeoxicholic  derivatives. Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with lithocholic and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death. It is concluded that these compounds trigger a non apoptotic mode of cell death, involving the mitochondria and associated with several characteristics of autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidative stress is a well-known phenomenon associated with Cisplatin toxicity. However, in Cisplatin treated group, abnormal animal behavior, decreased body weight, cellular and sub-cellular changes in the kidney and sperm abnormality were observed. Our investigation revealed that Cisplatin when administered in combination with a natural product derivative (Urs-12-ene-3α,24β-diol, labeled as IN0523) resulted in significant restoration of body weight and protection against the pathological alteration caused by Cisplatin to kidney and testis. Sperm count and motility were significantly restored near to normal. Cisplatin caused depletion of defense system i.e. glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase, which were restored close to normal by treatment of IN0523. Reduction in excessive lipid peroxidation induced by Cisplatin was also found by treatment with IN0523. The result suggests that IN0523 is a potential candidate for ameliorating Cisplatin induced toxicity in the kidney and testes at a dose of 100mg/kg p.o. via inhibiting the oxidative stress/redox status imbalance and may be improving the efflux mechanism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that using idiotypic determinants of a B-cell lymphoma's surface immunoglobulin as a tumor-specific marker, we can develop patient-specific chemokine-idiotype fusion DNA vaccines that induce an immune response against LPL. By activating the host immune system against the tumor antigen, we postulate that disease control of asymptomatic phase lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma can be maintained. These chemokine-idiotype fusion DNA vaccines provide protection in a lymphoma mouse model and have recently entered clinical trials. Herein, we describe procedures for the generation of therapeutic vaccines, particularly "second-generation" recombinant vaccines. Specifically, in the Methods section we describe how to identify lymphoma-associated immunoglobulin V (IgV) genes from patient biopsy and how to assemble these genes as single-chain variable gene fragment (scFv) in-frame with MIP-3α to generate novel DNA fusion vaccines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744202>Reduction of circulating and selective limbic brain levels of (3α,5α)-3-hydroxy-pregnan-20-one (3α,5α-THP) following forced swim stress in C57BL/6J mice.</a></h1><p>Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and GABAergic neuroactive steroids contribute to homeostatic regulation of this circuitry. Acute forced swim stress (FSS) increases plasma, cortical, and hypothalamic (3α,5α)-3-hydroxy-pregnan-20-one (3α,5α-THP) levels in rats. However, there have not been systemic investigations of acute stress on changes in plasma and brain levels of 3α,5α-THP in mouse models.The present experiments aimed to assess circulating and local brain levels of 3α,5α-THP following acute FSS in C57BL/6J mice.Mice were exposed to FSS (10 min), and 50 min later, blood and brains were collected. Circulating pregnenolone and 3α,5α-THP levels were assessed in serum. Free-floating brain sections (40 μm, four to five sections/region) were immunostained and analyzed in cortical and limbic brain structures.FSS decreased circulating 3α,5α-THP (-41.6 ± 10.4 %) and reduced 3α,5α-THP immunolabeling in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (-15.2 ± 5.7 %), lateral amygdala (LA, -31.1 ± 13.4 %), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) shell (-31.9 ± 14.6). Within the LA, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and vesicular GABA transporter were localized in 3α,5α-THP-positively stained cells, while in the NAcc shell, only VGLUT1 was localized in 3α,5α-THP-positively stained cells, suggesting that both glutamatergic and GABAergic cells within the LA are 3α,5α-THP-positive, while in the NAcc shell, 3α,5α-THP only localizes to glutamatergic cells.The decrease in circulating and brain levels of 3α,5α-THP may be due to alterations in the biosynthesis/ or changes in the regulation of the HPA axis following FSS. Changes in GABAergic neuroactive steroids in response to stress likely mediate functional adaptations in neuronal activity. This may provide a potential targeted therapeutic avenue to address maladaptive stress responsivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584465>Interleukin-4 Boosts Insulin-Induced Energy Deposits by Enhancing Glucose Uptake and Lipogenesis in Hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis as the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia, is closely associated with chronic inflammation. We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing lipid deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy metabolism. Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic metabolism was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 2 expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free   uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the  were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338318>Synthesis, Anti-HCV, Antioxidant and Reduction of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Generation of a Chlorogenic  Analogue with an Amide Bond Replacing the Ester Bond.</a></h1><p>Chlorogenic  is a well known natural product with important bioactivities.

The investigated neurosteroids are as follows: progesterone (P4), 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP), 5β-dihydroprogesterone, estrone, androstenedione (AE), cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone (CORT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), pregnanolone (3α,5β-THP), allopregnanolone (ALLO), 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), 11-deoxycortisol, pregnenolone (PREG), and 5α/5β-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (5α/5β-THDOC). Brain and plasma samples were processed using solid-phase extraction with methanol and acetic  (99:1), and derivatized with a hydroxylamine reagent. Separation was achieved within 13min at a flow rate of 0.4mL/min with a C18 column (3.0×50mm, 2.7μm). The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionization mode. Using this method, the neurosteroid level variation was quantitated and investigated in the brain and plasma upon immobilization stress in rats. As a result, AE, CORT, DOC, P4, 5α-DHP, 5α/5β-THDOC, DHEA, 3α,5β-THP, ALLO, and PREG levels were significantly altered in both the brain and plasma samples when stress was induced. These findings demonstrated that stress leads to the alteration of the GABAergic neurosteroid profile. The present results will be helpful for furthering an understanding of the role of neurosteroids in stressed conditions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the presence of enzymes involved in  and glycogenesis in in vitro-produced bovine embryos at five developmental stages leading up to blastocyst formation. The enzymes examined were: (1) glycolytic: hexokinase-I (HK-I), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), pyruvate kinase mutase 1/2 (PKM-1/2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and (2) glycogenic: glycogen synthase kinase-3 isoforms α/ β (GSK-3α/β). Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) was also analysed. The developmental stages examined were: (1) 2-4-cell, (2) 5-8-cell, (3) 16-cell, (4) morula and (5) expanded blastocyst. The enzymes HK-I, PFK-1, PKM-1/2, GAPDH and GLUT-1 were differentially expressed throughout all stages (P<0.05). GSK-3α and β were also differentially expressed from the 2-4-cell to the expanded blastocyst stage (P<0.05) and GLUT-1 was identified throughout. The general trend was that the abundance of PFK1, GAPDH and PKM-1/2 decreased whereas HK-I, phospho-GSK3α (P-GSK3α) and P-GSK3β levels increased as the embryo advanced. In contrast, GLUT-1 expression peaked at the 16-cell stage. These data combined suggest that in vitro bovine embryo metabolism switches from being glycolytic-centric to glycogenic-centric around the 16-cell stage, the developmental window also characterised by embryonic genome activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589596>[Effect of endotoxin pretreatment-induced glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibition on glycogen  in rat liver and the mechanism].</a></h1><p>To investigate the changes in the functional activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in the hepatic tissue after endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) tolerance and explore the effects of LPS-induced GSK-3 inhibition on glycogen  in the liver.Male SD rats were randomly divided into normal control, endotoxin pretreatment and GSK-3 inhibitor (lithium chloride) groups with corresponding pretreatments prior to a large dose of LPS challenge (10 mg/kg) to induce liver injury. Glycogen deposition and content in the hepatic tissue was detected using periodic -Schiff (PAS) staining and a glycogen quantification kit, respectively. Western blotting was performed for semi-quantitative analysis of protein level and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3, and a Coomassie brilliant blue G-250-based colorimetric assay was used to detect calpain activity in the liver.Glycogen content in the liver decreased significantly after LPS challenge in all the 3 groups (P<0.05) but showed no significant difference among the groups (P>0.05). Both LPS and lithium chloride pretreatments caused a significant increase of liver glycogen content (P<0.05). LPS pretreatment induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β (P<0.05) and partial cleavage of GSK-3α but did not affect the expression of GSK-3 protein (P>0.05). Large-dose LPS challenge significantly increased the activity of calpain in the liver tissue (P<0.05) to a comparable level in the 3 groups (P>0.05).Endotoxin pretreatment induces inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β and partial cleavage of GSK-3α and promotes the deposition of liver glycogen but does not affect the activity of calpain, which may contribute to an increased glycogen reserve for energy supply in the event of large-dose LPS challenge.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24169695>Two distinct allosteric binding sites at α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors revealed by NS206 and NS9283 give unique insights to binding activity-associated linkage at Cys-loop receptors.</a></h1><p>Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have the potential to improve cognitive function and alleviate pain. However, only a few selective PAMs of α4β2 receptors have been described limiting both pharmacological understanding and drug-discovery efforts. Here, we describe a novel selective PAM of α4β2 receptors, NS206, and compare with a previously reported PAM, NS9283. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, NS206 was observed to positively modulate acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked currents at both known α4β2 stoichiometries (2α:3β and 3α:2β). In the presence of NS206, peak current amplitudes surpassed those of maximal efficacious ACh stimulations (Emax(ACh)) with no or limited effects at potencies and current waveforms (as inspected visually). This pharmacological action contrasted with that of NS9283, which only modulated the 3α:2β receptor and acted by left shifting the ACh concentration-response relationship. Interestingly, the two modulators can act simultaneously in an additive manner at 3α:2β receptors, which results in current levels exceeding Emax(ACh) and a left-shifted ACh concentration-response relationship. Through use of chimeric and point-mutated receptors, the binding site of NS206 was linked to the α4-subunit transmembrane domain, whereas binding of NS9283 was shown to be associated with the αα-interface in 3α:2β receptors. Collectively, these data demonstrate the existence of two distinct modulatory sites in α4β2 receptors with unique pharmacological attributes that can act additively. Several allosteric sites have been identified within the family of Cys-loop receptors and with the present data, a detailed picture of allosteric modulatory mechanisms of these important receptors is emerging.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29621258>DIVA metabolomics: Differentiating vaccination status following viral challenge using metabolomic profiles.</a></h1><p>Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a major source of economic loss within the agricultural industry. Vaccination against BRD-associated viruses does not offer complete immune protection and vaccine failure animals present potential routes for disease spread. Serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is possible using antigen-deleted vaccines, but during virus outbreaks DIVA responses are masked by wild-type virus preventing accurate serodiagnosis. Previous work by the authors has established the potential for metabolomic profiling to reveal metabolites associated with systemic immune responses to vaccination. The current study builds on this work by demonstrating for the first time the potential to use plasma metabolite profiling to differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals following infection-challenge. Male Holstein Friesian calves were intranasally vaccinated (Pfizer RISPOVAL®PI3+RSV) and subsequently challenged with Bovine Parainfluenza Virus type-3 (BPI3V) via nasal inoculation. Metabolomic plasma profiling revealed that viral challenge led to a shift in acquired plasma metabolite profiles from day 2 to 20 p.i., with 26 metabolites identified whose peak intensities were significantly different following viral challenge depending on vaccination status. Elevated levels of biliverdin and bilirubin and decreased 3-indolepropionic  in non-vaccinated animals at day 6 p.i. may be associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen scavenging at periods of peak virus titre. During latter stages of infection, increased levels of N-[(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-dihydroxy-7,24-dioxocholan-24-yl]glycine and lysophosphatidycholine and decreased enterolactone in non-vaccinated animals may reflect suppression of innate immune response mechanisms and progression to adaptive immune responses. Levels of hexahydrohippurate were also shown to be significantly elevated in non-vaccinated animals from days 6 to 20 p.i. These findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic profiling to identify plasma markers that can be employed in disease diagnostic applications to both differentially identify infected non-vaccinated animals during disease outbreaks and provide greater information on the health status of infected animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27419371>Antitumor activity of sulfated hyaluronic  fragments in pre-clinical models of bladder cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumor cell-derived hyaluronidase HYAL-1 degrades hyaluronic  (HA) into angiogenic fragments (AGF: 10-12 disaccharides). AGF support tumor growth and progression. Urine and tissue HAase/HYAL-1 levels are sensitive markers for high-grade bladder cancer (BCa) and its metastasis. In preclinical models of BCa, we evaluated whether o-sulfated AGF (sHA-F) inhibits HAase activity and has antitumor activity. At IC50 for HAase activity inhibition (5-20 μg/ml [0.4-1.7 μM]), sHA-F significantly inhibited proliferation, motility and invasion of HYAL-1 expressing BCa cells (253J-Lung, HT1376, UMUC-3), P<0.001. sHA-F did not affect the growth of HYAL-1 non-expressing BCa (5637, RT4, T24, TCCSUP) and normal urothelial (Urotsa, SV-HUC1) cells. sHA-F treatment induced apoptosis by death receptor pathway. sHA-F downregulated transcript and/or protein levels of HA receptors (CD44, RHAMM), p-AKT, β-catenin, pβ-Catenin(S552), Snail and Twist but increased levels of pβ-Catenin(T41/S45), pGSK-3α/β(S21/S9) and E-cadherin. sHA-F also inhibited CD44/Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) complex formation and PI-3K activity. AGF addition or myristoylated-AKT overexpression attenuated sHA-F effects. Contrarily, HYAL-1 expression sensitized RT4 cells to sHA-F treatment. In the 253J-L and HT1376 xenograft models, sHA-F treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth (P<0.001), plausibly by inhibiting angiogenesis and HA receptor-PI-3K/AKT signaling. This study delineates that sHA-F targets tumor-associated HA-HAase system and could be potentially useful in BCa treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24003117>Synthesis and dissolution of hemicatenanes by type IA DNA topoisomerases.</a></h1><p>Type IA DNA topoisomerases work with a unique mechanism of strand passage through an enzyme-bridged, ssDNA gate, thus enabling them to carry out diverse reactions in processing structures important for replication, recombination, and repair. Here we report a unique reaction mediated by an archaeal type IA topoisomerase, the synthesis and dissolution of hemicatenanes. We cloned, purified, and characterized an unusual type IA enzyme from a hyperthermophilic archaeum, Nanoarchaeum equitans, which is split into two pieces. The recombinant heterodimeric enzyme has the expected activities in its preference of relaxing negatively supercoiled DNA. Its amino  sequence and cleavage site sequence analysis suggest that it is topoisomerase III, and therefore we named it "NeqTop3." At high enzyme concentrations, NeqTop3 can generate high-molecular-weight DNA . Biochemical and electron microscopic data indicate that the DNA  are connected through hemicatenane linkages. The hemicatenane formation likely is mediated by the single-strand passage through denatured bubbles in the substrate DNA under high temperature. NeqTop3 at lower concentrations can reverse hemicatenanes. A complex of human topoisomerase 3α, Bloom helicase, and RecQ-mediated genome instability protein 1 and 2 can partially disentangle the hemicatenane network. Both the formation and dissolution of hemicatenanes by type IA topoisomerases demonstrate that these enzymes have an important role in regulating intermediates from replication, recombination, and repair.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28236969>Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3: A Kinase for All ?</a></h1><p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is an unusual protein-serine kinase in that it is primarily regulated by inhibition and lies downstream of multiple cell signaling .

However, with few reported structural studies on PhK inhibitors, this hinders a structure based drug design approach. In this study, the inhibitory potential of 38 indirubin analogues have been investigated. 11 of these ligands had IC50 values in the range 0.170-0.360μM, with indirubin-3'-acetoxime (1c) the most potent. 7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (13b), an antitumor compound which induces caspase-independent cell-death (Ribas et al., 2006 [20]) is revealed as a specific inhibitor of PhK (IC50=1.8μM). Binding assay experiments performed using both PhK-holo and PhK-γtrnc confirmed the inhibitory effects to arise from binding at the kinase domain (γ subunit). High level computations using QM/MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations were in good agreement with experimental binding data, as determined using statistical analysis, and support binding at the ATP-binding site. The value of a QM description for the binding of halogenated ligands exhibiting σ-hole effects is highlighted. A new statistical metric, the 'sum of the modified logarithm of ranks' (SMLR), has been defined which measures performance of a model for both the "early recognition" (ranking earlier/higher) of active compounds and their relative ordering by potency. Through a detailed structure activity relationship analysis considering other kinases (CDK2, CDK5 and GSK-3α/β), 6'(Z) and 7(L) indirubin substitutions have been identified to achieve selective PhK inhibition.

A potential chemoenzymatic synthesis route of UDCA comprises the two-step reduction of dehydrocholic  to 12-keto-ursodeoxycholic  (12-keto-UDCA), which can be conducted in a multienzymatic one-pot process using 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSDH), 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7β-HSDH), and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) with glucose as cosubstrate for the regeneration of cofactor. Here, we present a dynamic mechanistic model of this one-pot reduction which involves three enzymes, four different bile , and two different cofactors, each with different oxidation states. In addition, every enzyme faces two competing substrates, whereas each bile  and cofactor is formed or converted by two different enzymes. First, the kinetic mechanisms of both HSDH were identified to follow an ordered bi-bi mechanism with EBQ-type uncompetitive substrate inhibition. Rate equations were then derived for this mechanism and for mechanisms describing competing substrates. After the estimation of the model parameters of each enzyme independently by progress curve analyses, the full process model of a simple batch-process was established by coupling rate equations and mass balances. Validation experiments of the one-pot multienzymatic batch process revealed high prediction accuracy of the process model and a model analysis offered important insight to the identification of optimum reaction conditions.© 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330189>Targeted Synthesis and Characterization of a Gene Cluster Encoding NAD(P)H-Dependent 3α-, 3β-, and 12α-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases from Eggerthella CAG:298, a Gut Metagenomic Sequence.</a></h1><p>Gut metagenomic sequences provide a rich source of microbial genes, the majority of which are annotated by homology or unknown. Genes and gene  that encode enzymes catalyzing biotransformation of host bile  are important to identify in gut metagenomic sequences due to the importance of bile  in gut microbiome structure and host physiology. Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDHs) are pyridine nucleotide-dependent enzymes with stereospecificity and regiospecificity for bile  and steroid hydroxyl groups. HSDHs have been identified in several protein families, including medium-chain and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase families as well as the aldo-keto reductase family. These protein families are large and contain diverse functionalities, making prediction of HSDH-encoding genes difficult and necessitating biochemical characterization. We located a gene cluster in  sp.

CDD59475 is a novel 12α-HSDH, and we determined that CDD59474 (3α-HSDH) and CDD59473 (3β-HSDH) constitute novel enzymes in an iso-bile  pathway. Phylogenetic analysis of these HSDHs with other gut bacterial HSDHs and closest homologues in the database revealed predictable clustering of HSDHs by function and identified several likely HSDH sequences from bacteria isolated or sequenced from diverse mammalian and avian gut samples. Bacterial HSDHs have the potential to significantly alter the physicochemical properties of bile , with implications for increased/decreased toxicity for gut bacteria and the host. The generation of oxo-bile  is known to inhibit host enzymes involved in glucocorticoid  and may alter signaling through nuclear receptors such as farnesoid X receptor and G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5.

This compound is described to possess selective androgen receptor modulator- and myostatin inhibitor-like properties. As YK11 is an experimental drug candidate and a non-approved substance for humans, scientific data on its metabolism is scarce. Due to its steroidal backbone and the arguably labile orthoester-derived moiety positioned at the D-ring, substantial metabolic conversion in vivo was anticipated. To unambiguously detect urinary metabolites of YK11, an elimination study with six-fold deuterated YK11 was conducted. Post-administration specimens were analyzed using hydrogen isotope ratio mass spectrometry coupled to single quadrupole mass spectrometry to identify metabolites alongside basic mass spectrometric data. Further characterization of those metabolites relevant to sports drug testing was accomplished using gas chromatography-high resolution-high accuracy mass spectrometry. Fourteen deuterated urinary metabolites were detected comprising unconjugated, glucuronidated, and sulfoconjugated metabolites. As expected, no intact YK11 was observed in the elimination study urine samples. While the unconjugated metabolites disappeared within 24 hours post-administration, both glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites were traceable for more than 48 hours. The chemical structures of the two most promising glucuronidated metabolites (5β-19-nor-pregnane-3α,17β,20-triol and 5β-19-nor-pregnane-3α,17β-diol-20-one) were verified by in-house synthesis of both metabolites and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. In order to elucidate their potential in sports drug testing, both were successfully implemented into the currently applied analytical method for the detection of anabolic agents.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27890531>Short-term effects of diabetes on neurosteroidogenesis in the rat hippocampus.</a></h1><p>Diabetes may induce neurophysiological and structural changes in the central nervous system (i.e., diabetic encephalopathy). We here explored whether the levels of neuroactive steroids (i.e., neuroprotective agents) in the hippocampus may be altered by short-term diabetes (i.e., one month). To this aim, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry we observed that in the experimental model of the rat raised diabetic by streptozotocin injection, one month of pathology induced changes in the levels of several neuroactive steroids, such as pregnenolone, progesterone and its metabolites (i.e., tetrahydroprogesterone and isopregnanolone) and testosterone and its metabolites (i.e., dihydrotestosterone and 3α-diol). Interestingly these brain changes were not fully reflected by the plasma level changes, suggesting that early phase of diabetes directly affects steroidogenesis and/or steroid metabolism in the hippocampus. These concepts are also supported by the findings that crucial steps of steroidogenic machinery, such as the gene expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (i.e., molecule involved in the translocation of cholesterol into mitochondria) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (i.e., enzyme converting cholesterol into pregnenolone) and 5α-reductase (enzyme converting progesterone and testosterone into their metabolites) are also affected in the hippocampus. In addition, cholesterol homeostasis as well as the functionality of mitochondria, a key organelle in which the limiting step of neuroactive steroid synthesis takes place, are also affected. Data obtained indicate that short-term diabetes alters hippocampal steroidogenic machinery and that these changes are associated with impaired cholesterol homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus, suggesting them as relevant factors for the development of diabetic encephalopathy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Several investigations revealed that the natural neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) exerts analgesic, neuroprotective, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. These effects result from AP ability to modulate GABA(A), glycine, L- and T-type calcium channels. It has been shown that AP treatment induced beneficial actions in humans and animal models with no toxic side effects. In particular, a multi-parametric analysis revealed that AP efficiently counteracted chemotherapy-evoked neuropathic pain in rats. It has also been demonstrated that the modulation of AP-producing enzyme, 3α-hydroxysteroid oxido-reductase (3α-HSOR), in the spinal cord regulates thermal and mechanical pain thresholds of peripheral nerve injured neuropathic rats. The painful symptoms were exacerbated by intrathecal injections of provera (pharmacological inhibitor of 3α-HSOR) which decreased AP production in the spinal cord. By contrast, the enhancement of AP concentration in the intrathecal space induced analgesia and suppression of neuropathic symptoms. Moreover, in vivo siRNA-knockdown of 3α-HSOR expression in healthy rat dorsal root ganglia increased thermal and mechanical pain perceptions while AP evoked a potent antinociceptive action. In humans, blood levels of AP were inversely associated with low back and chest pain. Furthermore, oral administration of AP analogs induced antinociception. Altogether, these data indicate that AP, which possesses a high therapeutic potential and a good toxicological profile, may be used to develop effective and safe strategies against chronic neuropathic pain.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Most experimental models of AD are transgenic or pharmacological in nature, and do not simulate the entire pathophysiology. In the present study, we developed a pharmacologically induced AD using the zebrafish, a species that can recapitulate most of the phenotypes of the disease. The pharmacological agent being used, okadaic  (OKA) has also been utilized to study AD in other species. In this model, the immunohistochemistry of phosphorylated glycogen synthase-3α/β, Aβ, p-tau, tau protein, and senile plaque formation in zebrafish brain were all significantly increased with increasing exposure to OKA. These represent the majority of the histological hallmarks of AD pathophysiology. The observed changes were also accompanied by learning and memory deficits which are also important components in AD pathophysiology. Zebrafish disease models are gaining popularity mostly due to their economic cost and relevance to human disease pathophysiology. Current pharmacological methods of inducing AD in zebrafish are not adequately developed and do not represent all the features of the disease. OKA-induced AD in zebrafish can become a cost efficient model to study drug discovery for AD. It may also be used to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex pathophysiology that leads to AD using relatively economical species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498015>Anomeric selectivity and influenza A virus inhibition study on methoxylated analogues of Pentagalloylglucose.</a></h1><p>Anomeric selectivity in galloylation of D-glucose and D-mannose with carboxylic  was explored under steglich conditions. Base catalyst 4-dimethylaminopyridine favored the formation of alpha-anomers, while adding an  and carbodiimide favored the formation of beta-anomers. Steric hindrance between α,β-unsaturated  and C-2 OH stereochemistry (adjacent carbon to anomeric) influenced anomeric selectivity for both D-glucose and D-mannose. The influenza A virus inhibition activities of the synthesized compounds were evaluated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line using the cytopathic effect inhibition assay. All the synthetic methoxylated analogues showed more considerable activity against influenza A virus than their corresponding , which indicated the sugar core as key functionality for anti-viral activity. The activities of trimethoxy-cinnamic  Pentagalloylglucose analogues, 3α, 3β, 4α, and 4β (IC50, 109.1 μM, 134.4 μM, 119.5 μM, 111.1 μM, respectively) were better than those of trimethoxy-benzoic  Pentagalloylglucose analogues, 1-αβ and 2α, 2β (IC50, 209.8 μM, 132.9 μM, 161.2 μM, respectively), which suggested that the double bond in cinnamic  Pentagalloylglucose analogues makes the major contribution for influenza A virus inhibitory activity. Notably, several anomeric mixtures showed better activities than pure alpha or beta anomer and were almost two times more effective than Ribavirin, a clinically used anti-viral drug.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

All compounds were tested in vitro for binding to γ-aminobutyric  (GABAA) receptor, some of them also in vivo for anticonvulsant action. 2α,3α-Epoxy-5α-pregnan-20-one inhibited the TBPS binding to the GABAA receptor and showed a moderate anticonvulsant action in immature rats. In contrast, its 3α,4α-isomer was inactive. More polar epoxide derivatives, modified at the side chain were less active or inactive. Noteworthy, diol 20, the product of trans-diaxial opening of the 2α,3α-epoxide 4, was not able to inhibit the TBPS binding, showing that the activity of the epoxide is due to the compound itself and not to its hydrolytic product. The 3α-hydroxyl group is known to be essential for the GABAA receptor binding. Despite the shortness of in vivo effects which are probably due to  inactivation of the products prepared, our results show that the 2α,3α-epoxy ring is another structural pattern with ability to bind the GABAAR.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, induced cellular responses by hypoxia are important for tumorigenesis and tumor growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulators of hypoxia induced cellular responses. Here we report that miR-147a is a novel and crucial hypoxia induced miRNA. HIF-1α up-regulates the expression of miR-147a, and miR-147a in turn stabilizes and accumulates HIF-1α protein via directly targeting HIF-3α, a dominant negative regulator of HIF-1α. Subsequent studies in xenograft mouse model reveal that miR-147a is capable of inhibiting tumor growth. Collectively, these data demonstrate a positive feedback loop between HIF-1α, miR-147a and HIF-3α, which provide a new insight into the mechanism of miR-147a induced cell proliferation arrest under hypoxia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27221120>Age-related impairments in skeletal muscle PDH phosphorylation and plasma lactate are indicative of  inflexibility and the effects of exercise training.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma lactate and skeletal muscle glucose regulatory , specifically PDH dephosphorylation, are impaired during hyperinsulinemic conditions in middle- to older-aged individuals and determine whether exercise training could improve key variables responsible for skeletal muscle PDH regulation. Eighteen young (19-29 yr; n = 9 males and 9 females) and 20 middle- to older-aged (57-82 yr; n = 10 males and 10 females) individuals underwent a 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Plasma samples were obtained at baseline and at 30, 50, 90, and 120 min for analysis of lactate, and skeletal muscle biopsies were performed at 60 min for analysis of protein associated with glucose . In response to insulin, plasma lactate was elevated in aged individuals when normalized to insulin action. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of skeletal muscle PDH on serine sites 232, 293, and 300 decreased in young individuals only. Changes in insulin-stimulated PDH phosphorylation were positively related to changes in plasma lactate. No age-related differences were observed in skeletal muscle phosphorylation of LDH, GSK-3α, or GSK-3β in response to insulin or PDP1, PDP2, PDK2, PDK4, or MPC1 total protein. Twelve weeks of endurance- or strength-oriented exercise training improved insulin-stimulated PDH dephosphorylation, which was related to a reduced lactate response. These findings suggest that impairments in insulin-induced PDH regulation in a sedentary aging population contribute to impaired glucose  and that exercise training is an effective intervention for treating  inflexibility.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25316122>An α-acetoxy-tirucallic  isomer inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling and induces oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Here we provide evidence that αATA(8,24) (3α-acetyloxy-tir-8,24-dien-21-oic ) inhibits Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. αATA(8,24) and other tirucallic  were isolated from the acetylated extract of the oleo gum resin of Boswellia serrata to chemical homogeneity. Compared with related tirucallic , αATA(8,24) was the most potent inhibitor of the proliferation of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, in prostate cancer xenografted onto chick chorioallantoic membranes. αATA(8,24) induced loss of cell membrane asymmetry, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation in vitro and in vivo. These effects were selective for cancer cells, because αATA(8,24) exerted no overt toxic effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the chick embryo. At the molecular level, αATA(8,24) inhibited the Akt1 kinase activity. Prior to all biochemical signs of cellular dysfunction, αATA(8,24) induced inhibition of the Akt downstream target mTOR as indicated by dephosphorylation of S6K1. This event was followed by decreased expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin B1, as well as cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK2 and phosphoretinoblastoma protein, which led to inhibition of the cell-cycle progression. In agreement with the mTOR inhibition, αATA(8,24) and rapamycin increased the volume of acidic vesicular organelles. In contrast to rapamycin, αATA(8,24) destabilized lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes and induced reactive oxygen species production in cancer cells. The ability of αATA(8,24) to inhibit Akt/mTOR signaling and to induce simultaneously oxidative stress could be exploited for the development of novel antitumor therapeutics with a lower profile of toxic side effects.Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26768415>Novel, major 2α- and 2β-hydroxy bile alcohols and bile  in the bile of Arapaima gigas, a large South American river fish.</a></h1><p>Bile alcohols and bile  from gallbladder bile of the Arapaima gigas, a large South American freshwater fish, were isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.

The novel bile salts identified were six variants of 2-hydroxy bile  and bile alcohols in the 5α- and 5β-series, with 29% of all compounds having hydroxylation at C-2. Three C27 bile alcohols were present (as ester sulfates): (24ξ,25ξ)-5α-cholestan-2α,3α,7α,12α,24,26-hexol; (25ξ)-5β-cholestan-2β,3α,7α,12α,26,27-hexol, and (25ξ)-5α-cholestan-2α,3α,7α,12α,26,27-hexol. A single C27 bile  was identified: (25ξ)-2α,3α,7α,12α-tetrahydroxy-5α-cholestan-26-oic , present as its taurine conjugate. Two novel C24 bile  were identified: the 2α-hydroxy derivative of allochenodeoxycholic  and the 2β-hydroxy derivative of cholic , both occurring as taurine conjugates.

In humans, corticosterone and its 5α-Ring A-reduced metabolites are excreted via the bile into the intestine and transformed by anaerobic bacteria to 21-dehydroxylated products: 11β-OH-progesterone or 11β-OH-(allo)-5α-preganolones (potent inhibitors of 11β-HSD2 and 11β-HSD1 dehydrogenase). Neomycin blocks the formation of these steroid metabolites and can blunt the hypertension in rats induced by either ACTH or corticosterone. 3α,5α-Tetrahydro-corticosterone, 11β-hydroxy-progesterone, and 3α,5α-tetrahydro-11β-hydroxy-progesterone strongly inhibit 11β-HSD2 and 11β-HSD1 dehydrogenase activity; all these compounds are hypertensinogenic when infused in adrenally intact rats. Urine obtained from a patient with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency demonstrated markedly elevated levels of endogenous glycyrrhetinic -like factors (GALFs) that inhibit 11β-HSD2 and 11β-HSD1 dehydrogenase activity (>300 times greater, and >400 times greater, respectively, than those in normotensive controls). Thus, in addition to DOC, corticosterone and its 5α-pathway products as well as the 11-oxygenated progesterone derivatives may play a previously unrecognized role in the increased Na(+) retention and BP associated with patients with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.Copyright © 2013.

A pathological counterpart of this developmental function is seen in human glioma, wherein Olig2 is required for maintenance of stem-like cells that drive tumor growth. The mitogenic/gliomagenic functions of Olig2 are regulated by phosphorylation of a triple serine motif (S10, S13, and S14) in the amino terminus. Here, we identify a set of three serine/threonine protein kinases (glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β [GSK3α/β], casein kinase 2 [CK2], and cyclin-dependent kinases 1/2 [CDK1/2]) that are, collectively, both necessary and sufficient to phosphorylate the triple serine motif. We show that phosphorylation of the motif itself serves as a template to prime phosphorylation of additional serines and creates a highly charged " blob" in the amino terminus of Olig2. Finally, we show that small molecule inhibitors of this forward-feeding phosphorylation cascade have potential as glioma therapeutics.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

NES is a synthetic progestin that may possess neuroprotective and myelin regenerative potential as added health benefits. In receptor transactivation experiments, NES displayed greater potency than progesterone to transactivate the human progesterone receptor (PR). This was confirmed by docking experiments where NES adopts the same docking position within the PR ligand-binding domain (LBD) as progesterone and forms additional stabilizing contacts between 17α-acetoxy and 16-methylene groups and PR LBD, supporting its higher potency than progesterone. The analog 13-ethyl NES also establishes similar contacts as NES with Met909, leading to comparable potency as NES. In contrast, NES is not stabilized within the human androgen receptor LBD, leading to negligible androgen receptor transactivation. Because progesterone acts in the brain by both PR binding and indirectly via binding of the metabolite allopregnanolone to γ-aminobutyric  type A receptor (GABAAR), we investigated if NES is metabolized to 3α, 5α-tetrahydronestorone (3α, 5α-THNES) in the brain and if this metabolite could interact with GABAAR. In female mice, low concentrations of reduced NES metabolites were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in both plasma and brain. Electrophysiological studies showed that 3α, 5α-THNES exhibited only limited activity to enhance GABAAR-evoked responses with WSS-1 cells and did not modulate synaptic GABAARs of mouse cortical neurons. Thus, the inability of reduced metabolite of NES (3α, 5α-THNES) to activate GABAAR suggests that the neuroprotective and myelin regenerative effects of NES are mediated via PR binding and not via its interaction with the GABAAR.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722238>Opposing functions of Akt isoforms in lung tumor initiation and progression.</a></h1><p>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulated protein kinase, Akt, plays an important role in the initiation and progression of human cancer. Mammalian cells express three Akt isoforms (Akt1-3), which are encoded by distinct genes. Despite sharing a high degree of amino  identity, phenotypes observed in knockout mice suggest that Akt isoforms are not functionally redundant. The relative contributions of the different Akt isoforms to oncogenesis, and the effect of their deficiencies on tumor development, are not well understood.Here we demonstrate that Akt isoforms have non-overlapping and sometimes opposing functions in tumor initiation and progression using a viral oncogene-induced mouse model of lung cancer and Akt isoform-specific knockout mice.Akt1 ablation significantly delays initiation of lung tumor growth, whereas Akt2 deficiency dramatically accelerates tumorigenesis in this mouse model. Ablation of Akt3 had a small, not statistically significant, stimulatory effect on tumor induction and growth by the viral oncogene. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and Ki67 immunostaining of lung tissue sections revealed that the delayed tumor induction in Akt1-/- mice was due to the inhibitory effects of Akt1 ablation on cell growth and survival. Conversely, the accelerated growth rate of lung tumors in Akt2-/- and Akt3-/- mice was due to increased cell proliferation and reduced tumor cell apoptosis. Investigation of Akt signaling in tumors from Akt knockout mice revealed that the lack of Akt1 interrupted the propagation of signaling in tumors to the critical downstream targets, GSK-3α/β and mTOR.These results demonstrate that the degree of functional redundancy between Akt isoforms in the context of lung tumor initiation is minimal. Given that this mouse model exhibits considerable similarities to human lung cancer, these findings have important implications for the design and use of Akt inhibitors for the treatment of lung cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30736477>Developing an Enzyme-Assisted Derivatization Method for Analysis of C Bile Alcohols and  by Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Enzyme-assisted derivatization for sterol analysis (EADSA) is a technology designed to enhance sensitivity and specificity for sterol analysis using electrospray ionization⁻mass spectrometry. To date it has only been exploited on sterols with a 3β-hydroxy-5-ene or 3β-hydroxy-5α-hydrogen structure, using bacterial cholesterol oxidase enzyme to convert the 3β-hydroxy group to a 3-oxo group for subsequent derivatization with the positively charged Girard hydrazine reagents, or on substrates with a native oxo group. Here we describe an extension of the technology by substituting 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) for cholesterol oxidase, making the method applicable to sterols with a 3α-hydroxy-5β-hydrogen structure. The 3α-HSD enzyme works efficiently on bile alcohols and bile  with this stereochemistry. However, as found by others, derivatization of the resultant 3-oxo group with a hydrazine reagent does not go to completion in the absence of a conjugating double bond in the sterol structure. Nevertheless, Girard P derivatives of bile alcohols and C  give an intense molecular ion ([M]⁺) upon electrospray ionization and informative fragmentation spectra.

Consistent with its action as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM), it had no direct activity in the absence of GABA. UCI-50027 protected against acute pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions with an ED50 of 6 mg/kg p.o. In the rotarod (RR) paradigm in mice, the AD50 (the ataxic dose where half of the animals fail the RR test) was found to be 38 mg/kg p.o., giving a therapeutic index (TI = RR AD50/PTZ ED50)∼6 versus 2.8 for ganaxolone. In the mouse-elevated plus maze (EPM) model for anxiety, UCI-50027 showed a minimum effective dose (MED) ≤0.3 mg/kg p.o.

As bile  concentration is closely related to the degree of hepatobiliary diseases, detecting it is a vital factor to understand the stage of the diseases. The prevalent determination for bile  is the enzymatic cycling method which has low sensitivity while reagent-consuming. It is desirable to develop a new method with lower cost and higher sensitivity. An indirect electrochemical detection (IED) for bile  in human serum was established using the screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). Since bile  do not show electrochemical signals, they were converted to 3-ketosteroids by 3-α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), which was reduced to NADH. NADH could then be oxidized on the surface of SPCE, generating a signal that was used to calculate the total bile  (TBA) concentration. A good linear calibration for TBA was obtained at the concentration range from 5.00μM to 400μM in human serum. Both the precisions and recoveries were sufficient to be used in a clinical setting. The TBA concentrations in 35 human serum samples by our IED method didn't show significant difference with the result by enzymatic cycling method, using the paired t-test.

We re-evaluated the influences of oxygens concentration on proliferation, stemness and differentiation of human umbilical cord Wharton Jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs).Primary cultures growing in 21% oxygen were either transferred into 5% O2 or continued to grow under standard 21% oxygen conditions. Cell expansion was estimated by WST1/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or cell counting. After 2 or 4 weeks of culture, cell phenotypes were evaluated using microscopic, immunocytochemical, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting and molecular methods. Genes and proteins typical of mesenchymal cells, committed neural cells or more primitive stem/progenitors (Oct4A, Nanog, Rex1, Sox2) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α-3α were evaluated.Lowering O2 concentration from 21% to the physiologically relevant 5% level substantially affected cell characteristics, with induction of stemness-related-transcription-factor and stimulation of cell proliferative capacity, with increased colony-forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-F) centers exerting OCT4A, NANOG and HIF-1α and HIF-2α immunoreactivity. Moreover, the spontaneous and time-dependent ability of WJ-MSCs to differentiate into neural lineage under 21% O2 culture was blocked in the reduced oxygen condition. Importantly, treatment with trichostatin A (TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor) suppressed HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression, in addition to blockading the cellular effects of reduced oxygen concentration.A physiologically relevant microenvironment of 5% O2 rejuvenates WJ-MSC culture toward less-differentiated, more primitive and faster-growing phenotypes with involvement of HIF-1α and HIF-2α-mediated and TSA-sensitive chromatin modification mechanisms. These observations add to the understanding of MSC responses to defined culture conditions, which is the most critical issue for adult stem cells translational applications.Copyright © 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

The identification was based on their having MS and NMR spectra identical to those of synthetic standards. A survey of biliary bile  of 10 additional species of angelfish found 7 with N-methyltaurine conjugation. In all 12 species, conjugated deoxycholic  (known to be formed by bacterial 7-dehydroxylation of cholic ) was a major bile . In all previous studies of biliary bile  in fish, deoxycholic  has been present in only trace proportions. In addition, bile  conjugation with N-methyltaurine has not been detected previously in any known vertebrate. N-methyltaurine conjugated bile  are resistant to bacterial deconjugation and dehydroxylation, and such resistance to bacterial enzymes should aid in the maintenance of high concentrations of bile  during lipid digestion. Our findings suggest that these species of angelfish have a novel microbiome in their intestine containing anaerobic bacteria, and describe the presence of N-methyltaurine conjugated bile  that are resistant to bacterial attack.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Uptake by the bile  transporters NTCP and OATP1B1 was evaluated with competition assays in transfected CHO and HEK cell lines and efflux by BSEP in membrane vesicles. PET-scans with the tracers were performed in wild-type mice ( = 3 per group): hepatobiliary transport was monitored and compared to a reference tracer, namely, 3-[F]FCA.Compounds 3-[F]FCA, 3-[F]FGCA, and 3-[F]FCDCA were synthesized in moderate radiochemical yields (4-10% n.d.c.) and high radiochemical purity (>99%); 7-[F]FCA and 12-[F]FCA could not be synthesized and included further in this study.  evaluation showed that 3-FCA, 3-FGCA, and 3-FCDCA all had a low micromolar -value for NTCP, OATP1B1, and BSEP.  3-[F]FCA, 3-[F]FGCA, and 3-[F]FCDCA displayed hepatobiliary transport with varying efficiency. A slight yet significant difference in uptake and efflux rate was noticed between the 3-[F]FCA and 3-[F]FCA epimers. Conjugation of 3-[F]FCA with glycine had no significant effect .

Our previous work proved that Xueshuan Xinmaining Tablet (XXT) could treat blood stasis through regulating the expression of F13a1, Car1 and Tbxa2r. In the current study, the effect and mechanism of XXT on BSS was comprehensively and holistically investigated based on a metabolomics approach. Urine and plasma samples of 10 BBS rats treated with XXT (XT), 9 BSS model rats (BM) and 11 normal control (NC) rats were collected and then determined by UPLC-Q/TOP-MS. Multivariate analyses were applied to distinguish differentiate urinary and plasma metabolite patterns between three groups. Results showed that a clear separation of three groups was achieved. XT group was located between BM group and NC group, and showing a tendency of recovering to NC group, which was consistent with the results of hemorheological studies. Some significantly changed metabolites like cortexolone, 3α,21-dihydroxy-5β-pregnane-11,20-dione and 19-hete and leukotriene A4, chiefly involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic   and lipid , were found and identified to explain the mechanism.

To explain these effects, different mechanisms are being proposed, including those involving endocannabinoids and related signaling molecules. Many of these compounds belong to the fatty  amides, conjugates of fatty  with biogenic amines. Conjugates of DHA with ethanolamine or serotonin have previously been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and potentially neuroprotective properties. Here, we synthesized another amine conjugate of DHA, N-docosahexaenoyl dopamine (DHDA), and tested its immune-modulatory properties in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and BV-2 microglial cells. N-Docosahexaenoyl dopamine significantly suppressed the production of nitric oxide (NO), the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the chemokines macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (CCL20) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), whereas its parent compounds, dopamine and DHA, were ineffective. Further exploration of potential effects of DHDA on key inflammatory mediators revealed that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA level and production of prostaglandin E (PGE) were concentration-dependently inhibited in macrophages. In activated BV-2 cells, PGE production was also reduced, without changes in COX-2 mRNA levels. In addition, DHDA did not affect NF-kB activity in a reporter cell line. Finally, the immune-modulatory activities of DHDA were compared with those of N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA) and similar potencies were found in both cell types. Taken together, our data suggest that DHDA, a potentially endogenous endocannabinoid, may be an additional member of the group of immune-modulating n-3 fatty -derived lipid mediators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084699>Bile  and bile alcohols from Muraenesox bagio, Pomadasys argenteus and Lobeo rohita.</a></h1><p>Gallbladders bile of three well known commercial fish of South Asia region named Muraenesox bagio (locally called bam), Pomadasys argenteus (dother) and Lobeo rohita (rohu) were analysed on GC-MS, after derivatising the bile alcohols and bile  as trimethylsilyl ether and trimethylsilyl-methyl ester, respectively.

The functional properties and subunit arrangement of these receptors are controversial. We predefined subunit arrangement by using subunit concatenation. α4, β2, and δ subunits were concatenated to dimeric, trimeric, and, in some cases, pentameric subunits. We constructed in total nine different receptor pentamers in at least two different ways and expressed them in Xenopus oocytes. The δ subunit was substituted in any of the five positions in the α1β2 receptor. In addition, we investigated all receptors with the 2:2:1 subunit stoichiometry for α4, β2, and δ. Several functional receptors were obtained. Interestingly, all of these receptors had very similar EC50 values for GABA in the presence of the neurosteroid 3α, 21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (THDOC). All functional receptors containing δ subunits were sensitive to 4-chloro-N-[2-(2-thienyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl]benzamide (DS2). Moreover, none of the receptors was affected by ethanol up to 30 mm These properties recapitulate those of non-concatenated receptors expressed from a cRNA ratio of 1:1:5 coding for α4, β2, and δ subunits. We conclude that the subunit arrangement of α4β2δ GABAA receptors is not strongly predefined but is mostly satisfying the 2:2:1 subunit stoichiometry for α4, β2, and δ subunits and that several subunit arrangements result in receptors with similar functional properties tuned to physiological conditions.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24027497>α4βδ GABAA receptors and tonic inhibitory current during adolescence: effects on mood and synaptic plasticity.</a></h1><p>The onset of puberty is associated with alterations in mood as well as changes in cognitive function, which can be more pronounced in females. Puberty onset in female mice is associated with increased expression of α4βδ γ-amino-butyric -A (GABAA) receptors (GABARs) in CA1 hippocampus. These receptors, which normally have low expression in this central nervous system (CNS) site, emerge along the apical dendrites as well as on the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons, adjacent to excitatory synapses where they underlie a tonic inhibition that shunts excitatory current and impairs activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, the trigger for synaptic plasticity. As would be expected, α4βδ expression at puberty also prevents long-term potentiation (LTP), an in vitro model of learning which is a function of network activity, induced by theta burst stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals to the CA1 hippocampus. The expression of these receptors also impairs spatial learning in a hippocampal-dependent task. These impairments are not seen in δ knock-out (-/-) mice, implicating α4βδ GABARs. α4βδ GABARs are also a sensitive target for steroids such as THP ([allo]pregnanolone or 3α-OH-5α[β]-pregnan-20-one), which are dependent upon the polarity of GABAergic current. It is well-known that THP can increase depolarizing current gated by α4βδ GABARs, but more recent data suggest that THP can reduce hyperpolarizing current by accelerating receptor desensitization. At puberty, THP reduces the hyperpolarizing GABAergic current, which removes the shunting inhibition that impairs synaptic plasticity and learning at this time. However, THP, a stress steroid, also increases anxiety, via its action at α4βδ GABARs because it is not seen in δ(-/-) mice. These findings will be discussed as well as their relevance to changes in mood and cognition at puberty, which can be a critical period for certain types of learning and when anxiety disorders and mood swings can emerge.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26002734>Regioselective Versatility of Monooxygenase Reactions Catalyzed by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4: Examples with Single Substrates.</a></h1><p>Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have broad and overlapping substrate specificity and catalyze a variety of monooxygenase reactions, including aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylations, N-hydroxylations, oxygenations of heteroatoms (N, S, P and I), alkene and arene epoxidations, dehalogenations, dehydrogenations and N-, O- and S-dealkylations.

Here, we demonstrated that toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, a family of pattern-recognition receptors, is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia-like symptoms. Psychotic symptoms such as hyperlocomotion, anxiolytic-like behaviors, prepulse inhibition deficits, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairments were observed in TLR-2 knock-out (KO) mice. Ventricle enlargement, a hallmark of schizophrenia, was also observed in TLR-2 KO mouse brains. Levels of p-Akt and p-GSK-3α/β were markedly higher in the brain of TLR-2 KO than wild-type (WT) mice. Antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol or clozapine reversed behavioral and biochemical alterations in TLR-2 KO mice. Furthermore, p-Akt and p-GSK-3α/β were decreased by treatment with a TLR-2 ligand, lipoteichoic , in WT mice. Thus, our data suggest that the dysregulation of the innate immune system by a TLR-2 deficiency may contribute to the development and/or pathophysiology of schizophrenia-like behaviors via Akt-GSK-3α/β signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769776>Increased Phenolic Content and Enhanced Antioxidant Activity in Fermented Glutinous Rice Supplemented with Fu Brick Tea.</a></h1><p>Glutinous rice-based foods have a long history are consumed worldwide.

In this study, we developed a novel fermented glutinous rice product with the supplementation of Fu brick tea. Using in vitro antioxidant evaluation and phenolic compounds analysis, fermentation with Fu brick tea increased the total phenolic content and enhanced the antioxidant activity of glutinous rice, including scavenging of 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical, 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic  (ABTS) radical, and hydroxyl radical, ferric-reducing antioxidant power, and ferric ion reducing power and iron chelating capability.

L3 was believed to be an inactive photoproduct of excessive UV radiation whose formation prevents excessive vitamin D production. Recently, we reported that L3 is present in serum and that CYP11A1 can act on L3 producing monohydroxy- and dihydroxy-metabolites which inhibit skin cell proliferation similarly to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In this study we tested the ability of human CYP27A1 to hydroxylate L3. L3 was metabolized by purified CYP27A1 to 3 major products identified as 25-hydroxyL3, (25R)-27-hydroxyL3 and (25S)-27-hydroxyL3, by NMR. These three products were also seen when mouse liver mitochondria containing CYP27A1 were incubated with L3. The requirement for CYP27A1 for their formation by mitochondria was confirmed by the inhibition of their synthesis by 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol, an intermediate in bile  synthesis which serves as an efficient competitive substrate for CYP27A1. CYP27A1 displayed a high k for the  of L3 (76 mol product/min/mol CYP27A1) and a catalytic efficiency (k/K) that was 260-fold higher than that for vitamin D3. The CYP27A1-derived hydroxy-derivatives inhibited the proliferation of cultured human melanoma cells and colony formation with IC values in the nM range. Thus, L3 is metabolized efficiently by CYP27A1 with hydroxylation at C25 or C27 producing metabolites potent in their ability to inhibit melanoma cell proliferation, supporting that L3 is a prohormone which can be activated by CYP-dependent hydroxylations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate its involvement in acquired cadmium (Cd) resistance, Cd-resistant cells (RH460) were established from H460 lung carcinoma cells. Cd resistance led to interruption of apoptosis and autophagy, as determined by an apoptotic sub-G1 population, procaspase-3 clevage, and LC3-II induction. Cd-induced autophagy preceded apoptosis as determined by 3-methyladenine or zVAD and time-course experiments after Cd treatment. Despite β-catenin accumulation, phospho(p)-Ser/Tyr GSK-3α/β increased in the nucleus until 12h after treatment and then p-Ser partly translocated to the cytoplasm. The GSK-3 inhibitor lithium augmented Cd-induced p-Ser GSK-3α/β, which accumulated in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and increased autophagy. SB216763 inhibited p-Ser/p-Tyr GSK-3α/β and subsequent autophagy. GSK-3β knockdown decreased Cd-induced autophagy. Cd exposure to RH460 cells overexpressed with pcDNA-GSK-3β-HA strongly phosphorylated Ser(9)/Tyr(216) residues and decreased LC3-II. Constitutively active pcDNA-GSK-3β(S9A)-HA overexpression phosphorylated Tyr(216) and decreased LC3-II, suggesting that p-Tyr inhibits autophagy. PI3K inhibitors decreased Cd-induced p-Ser GSK-3αβ and LC3-II, whereas a Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic , hyperphosphorylated Ser residues, which accumulated in the nucleus and cytosol, and enhanced LC3-II. The general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein suppressed Cd-induced p-Tyr/p-Ser GSK-3α/β and LC3-II. Mouse lung tissues respond to long-term Cd exposure increased p-Tyr, downregulated LC3-II, and accumulated full-length Bax and procaspase-3. Taken together, this study shows that acquired Cd resistance is regulated by GSK-3β phosphorylation state, but not activation state, and intracellular localization of p-Ser GSK-3 regulates Cd-induced autophagy and apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26786496>Identification of six new lupane-type triterpenoids from Acanthopanax koreanum leaves and their tyrosinase inhibitory activities.</a></h1><p>Chemical investigation of Acanthopanax koreanum leaves resulted in the isolation of 13 compounds (1-13), including six new (20,29)-dehydrolupane-type triterpenoids: 3α,11α,30-trihydroxylup-20(29)-en-23,28-dioic  (1), 3α,11α,30-trihydroxylup-20(29)-en-28-oic  (2), 3α,11α,30-trihydroxylup-23-al-20(29)-en-28-oic  (3), 3α, 11α-dihydroxy-20-oxo-30-norlupane-23,28-dioic  (5), (20S)-3α-hydroxy-30 oxolupane-23,28-dioic  (8), (20S)-3β,7β,29-trihydroxy-lupane-23-al-28-oic  (10), and one novel compound isolated for the first time, named 3α,20α,29-trihydroxylupane-23,28-dioic  (9), together with six known compounds (4, 6, 7, and 11-13).

We studied a total of 72 radical prostatectomy cases by immunohistochemistry, and identified that 21 cases exhibited positive immunoreactivities for both AKR1C3 and GABAR. In the dual positive cancer cases, AKR1C3 and GABAR subunit α were either expressed in the same cells or in neighboring cells. Among several possible substrates, AKR1C3 reduces 5α-dihydrotesterone (DHT) to form 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol (3α-diol). 3α-diol is a neurosteroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAR in the central nervous system (CNS). We examined the hypothesis that 3α-diol-regulated pathological effects in the prostate are GABAR-dependent, but are independent of the AR. In GABAR-positive, AR-negative human PCa PC-3 cells, 3α-diol significantly stimulated cell growth in culture and the in ovo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenograft model. 3α-diol also up-regulated expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors and activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and Src as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Inclusion of GABAR antagonists reversed 3α-diol-stimulated tumor cell growth, expression of EGF family members, and activation of EGFR and Src to the level observed in untreated cells. Results from the present study suggest that 3α-diol may act as an alternative intra-prostatic neurosteroid that activates AR-independent PCa progression. The involvement of AKR1C3-mediated steroid metabolisms in modulating GABAR activation and promoting PCa progression requires continued studies.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

W.Smith (AGS), as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. Our results demonstrated that HLEDA concentration-dependently reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), signiﬁcantly suppressed LPS-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-1β at the mRNA and protein levels in RAW264.7 cells. Further analysis revealed that HLEDA could reduce the secretion of High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1). Additionally, the results showed that HLEDA efficiently decreased nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation by inhibiting the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα. These results suggest that HLEDA exerts anti-inflammatory properties in LPS-induced macrophages, possibly through inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which mediates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results warrant further studies that would concern candidate therapy for diseases, such as fulminant hepatitis and rheumatology of triterpenoids in AGS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23803896>A highly sensitive electrically driven electrochemiluminescent assay for quantification of bile  in human serum.</a></h1><p>A capillary electrically driven assay with electrochemiluminescent (ECL) detection for total bile  in human serum was developed and fully validated. Quantification was performed by multiple reactions. First, the bile  react with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) under catalysis of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), which is converted to 3-ketosteroid and concomitantly NAD(+) turns into reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). And then Ru(bpy)3(2+) is oxidized to be Ru(bpy)3(3+), which serves as an electron mediator, and reacts immediately with NADH coexisting in a carrier solution and is converted to Ru(bpy)3(2+*). NADH transfers an electron to form NAD(+) and the unstable excited-state species, Ru(bpy)3(2+*), which emits photons and gives out light when it decays to the ground state, Ru(bpy)3(2+). Consequently, the concentration of total bile  could be determined by the electrochemiluminescent intensity. The assay was linear from 0.1 fmol L(-1) to 1000 fmol L(-1), with a detection limit of 0.02 fmol L(-1). The intra-day and inter-day precision had a coefficient of variation of less than 5.0%. The developed ECL assay had an acceptable correlation with an enzymatic cycling method commonly adopted in clinics for the determination of total bile  (r = 0.7216). Based on the above-mentioned principle, we established a simple, accurate and highly sensitive approach for the determination of total bile . Furthermore, this assay has been applied successfully to the detection of total bile  in human serum, indicating its practicality for bioanalysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740493>Characterization of neurosteroid effects on hyperpolarizing current at α4β2δ GABAA receptors.</a></h1><p>The neurosteroid 3α,5β-THP (3α-OH-5β-pregnan-20-one, pregnanolone) is a modulator of the GABAA receptor (GABAR), with α4β2δ GABARs the most sensitive. However, the effects of 3α,5β-THP at α4β2δ are polarity-dependent: 3α,5β-THP potentiates depolarizing current, as has been widely reported, but decreases hyperpolarizing current by accelerating desensitization.The present study further characterized 3α,5β-THP inhibition of hyperpolarizing current at this receptor and compared effects of other related steroids at α4β2δ GABARs.α4β2δ GABARs were expressed in HEK-293 cells, and agonist-gated current recorded with whole cell voltage-clamp techniques using a theta tube to rapidly apply agonist before and after application of neurosteroids.The GABA-modulatory steroids (30 nM) 3α,5α-THP (3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one, allopregnanolone) and THDOC (3α,21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one) inhibited hyperpolarizing GABA (10 μM)-gated current at α4β2δ GABARs similar to 3α,5β-THP, while the inactive 3β,5β-THP isomer had no effect. Greater inhibition was seen for current gated by the high efficacy agonist gaboxadol (THIP, 100 μM) than for GABA (0.1-1000 μM), consistent with an effect of 3α,5β-THP on desensitization. Inhibitory effects of the steroid were not seen under low [Cl(-)] conditions or in the presence of calphostin C (500 nM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Chimeras swapping the IL (intracellular loop) of α4 with α1, when expressed with β2 and δ, produced receptors (α[414]β2δ) which were not inhibited by 3α,5β-THP when GABA-gated current was hyperpolarizing, while α[141]β2δ exhibited steroid-induced polarity-dependent modulation.These findings suggest that numerous neurosteroids exhibit polarity-dependent effects at α4β2δ GABARs, which are dependent upon protein kinase C and the IL of α4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29132077>Lovastatin analogues and other metabolites from soil-derived Aspergillus terreus YIM PH30711.</a></h1><p>Eight previously undescribed metabolites including of lovastatin analogues, a pair of diastereoisomers, a cyclopentenone dimer, and three polyketides were isolated from the culture of Aspergillus terreus YIM PH30711. Two types of unprecedented skeletons, benzene-cyclopentanone complex and linear polyketide, and an unusual dimer structure were determined by spectral analysis. Compound, 3α-hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin L showed moderate activity against HMG-CoA reductase, with an inhibition ratio of 34% at the concentration of 50 μM, while lovastatin and dihydromonacolin K ethyl ester presented much stronger activity against HMGR with inhibition rates of 85% and 90% at the concentration of 50 μM, respectively. Aspereusin A was active against AChE with a ratio of 62% at the concentration of 50 μM, while its stereomers did not showed obvious inhibition (<10%). The configuration at C-4 of these three diastereoisomers was crucial in the inhibition against AChE, and the β-orientation of substituted methoxyl acrylic  should be beneficial to the combining with AChE.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurement of cortisol metabolites in fish bile could provide a method for assessing the stress level of wild fish because the time-lag for , conjugation and excretion into bile avoids the effects of sampling stress. To determine which biliary metabolite(s) to target, four Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L., were injected with radioactive cortisol. After 22 h, the bile was collected and found to contain 30% of the injected activity. Cortisol metabolites were extracted from diluted bile samples using solid phase extraction and the radioactive metabolites separated by several different chromatographic procedures. The metabolites were predominantly present as sulfates (95%) with the remainder being glucuronidated. Chromatography split the sulfates into at least seven peaks, and  solvolysis (which removes sulfate groups from steroids) generated four major radioactive steroids. These were identified, using microchemical reactions and re-crystallization to constant specific activity, as: 11β,17,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (cortisol), 3α,11β,17,21-tetrahydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one (tetrahydrocortisol; THF), 3α,17,21-trihydroxy-5β-pregnane-11,20-dione (tetrahydrocortisone; THE) and 3α,17,20β,21-tetrahydroxy-5β-pregnan-11-one (β-cortolone). The last of these was the most abundant, and thus a likely target for a biliary stress assay. Studies were also carried out to determine the best method for extraction and solvolysis of sulfates. Solid phase extraction (i.e. using octadecylsilane) was found to be too unreliable for routine use. Even though the extraction efficiency could be improved by acidifying the bile, this caused premature solvolysis of sulfated steroids.  solvolysis of unextracted bile worked best (c. 90% converted to free steroids) on volumes that were 1 μL or lower. Aryl sulfatase digestion of unextracted bile did not work well (only 20% of radioactivity was converted to free steroids).Crown Copyright © 2014. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we cloned and characterized 3-dehydroecdysone 3α-reductase (3DE 3α-reductase) in different tissues and developing stage of the silkworm, Bombyx mori L. The B. mori 3DE 3α-reductase cDNA contains an ORF 783 bp and the deduced protein sequence containing 260 amino  residues. Analysis showed the deduced 3DE 3α-reductase belongs to SDR family, which has the NAD(P)-binding domain. Using the Escherichia coli, a high level expression of a fusion polypeptide band of approx. 33 kDa was observed. High transcription of 3DE 3α-reductase was mainly presented in the midgut and hemolymph in the third day of fifth instar larvae in silkworm. The expression of 3DE 3α-reductase at different stages of larval showed that the activity in the early instar was high, and then reduced in late instar. This is parallel to the changes of molting hormone titer in larval. 3DE 3α-reductase is key enzyme in inactivation path of ecdysteroid. The data elucidate the regulation of 3DE 3α-reductase in ecdyteroid titer of its targeting organs and the relationship between the enzyme and metamorphosis.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652646>Confocal imaging with a fluorescent bile  analogue closely mimicking hepatic taurocholate disposition.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to characterize the in vitro hepatic transport mechanisms in primary rat and human hepatocytes of the fluorescent bile  derivative N-(24-[7-(4-N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole)]amino-3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-27-nor-5β-cholestan-26-oyl)-2'-aminoethanesulfonate (tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD), previously synthesized to study the activity of the bile salt export pump (BSEP). The fluorescent bile  derivative exhibited saturable uptake kinetics in suspended rat hepatocytes. Hepatic uptake was inhibited in the presence of substrates/inhibitors of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) family and Na(+) -taurocholate cotransporting peptide (Ntcp). Concentration-dependent uptake of the fluorescent bile  was also saturable in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with rNtcp, hNTCP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. The fluorescent bile  derivative was actively excreted in the bile canaliculi of sandwich-cultured rat and human hepatocytes (SCRH and SCHH), with a biliary excretion index (BEI) of 26% and 32%, respectively. In SCRH, cyclosporin A significantly decreased the BEI to 5%. Quantification by real-time confocal imaging further confirmed canalicular transport of the fluorescent bile  derivative (BEI = 75%). We conclude that tauro-nor-THCA-24-DBD is a useful probe to study interference of drugs with NTCP/Ntcp- and BSEP/Bsep-mediated transport in fluorescence-based in vitro assays.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29591887>Pathology of cigarettes on the reproductive system and ameliorative effects of alpha lipoic : A rat model study.</a></h1><p>Cigarette smoking (CS) has some detrimental effects that occur via oxidative stress (OS). The aim of this work was to demonstrate the pathological and immunohistochemical effects of CS and the protective effects of a strong antioxidant alpha lipoic  (ALA) on CS-induced genital system changes in a rat model. Twenty-eight female rats were randomly allocated to three groups as control, CS-exposed, and CS-exposed and ALA-treated. Reproductive tract organs were collected for biochemical and pathological examinations. In the CS group, OS markers increased in the tissues of both the ovary and fallopian tubes. Decreased follicle numbers in the ovary, marked cilial loss in the fallopian tubes, and pathologic changes in the uterus were observed in the CS group. Positive calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), caspase 3α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) immunoreactions were observed in uterine tissues and HIF-1α immunoreactions in tubal and uterine epithelial cells of the CS group. ALA reversed all these findings effectively. CS has negative effects on the female reproductive system via HIF-1α in tuba uterina and HIF-1α, HIF-2α, TNF-α, caspase 3, and CGRP in the uterus, and ALA could protect against the negative effects of CS on the female reproductive system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26193374>Expression, purification and functional characterization of a novel 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</a></h1><p>3α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) catalyzes the oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl group of steroids. The enzymatic conversion is a critical step in the enzymatic assay of urinary sulfated bile  (SBAs), which is a valuable diagnosis index of hepatobiliary diseases. However, the source of 3α-HSD for clinical applications is limited. In this study, an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a novel 3α-HSD was successfully cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Enzyme characterization studies revealed that the protein has 3α-HSD activity and the Km value for sodium cholate is 1.06 mmol L(-1). More than 60% relative enzyme activity was observed in a wide range of pH and temperature, with an optimum pH at 8.0 and an optimum temperature at 30°C. The enzyme's good thermostability under 40°C would be favorable in clinical applications. Ion interference experiments indicated that Zn(2+) was an activating cofactor which increased the enzyme activity 1.75-fold. With the favorable characteristics mentioned above, the new 3α-HSD is a promising enzyme for clinical applications. More importantly, the present work is the first report on a 3α-HSD from P. aeruginosa.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Melatonin, a classic antioxidant, has been shown to exhibit beneficial effects regarding intense exercise and tissue repair. In this study, we evaluated the onset and resolution of inflammation in melatonin-treated and nontreated rats subjected to a strenuous exercise session. We also analyzed the formation of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Control and treated rats were subjected to exhaustive exercise after a period of 10 days of melatonin treatment (20 mg/dL). Plasma and muscle levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-2-alpha/beta (CINC-2α/β), l-selectin, macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha (MIP-3α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured prior to, immediately after, and 2 hr after exercise. Our data revealed decreases in the muscle concentrations of IL-1β (35%), TNF-α (13%), IL-6 (48%), and TBARS (40%) in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We also observed decreases in the plasma concentrations of IL-1β (17%) in the melatonin-treated group. VEGF-α concentrations and SOD activity increased by 179% and 22%, respectively, in the melatonin-treated group compared with the control group. We concluded that muscle inflammation and oxidative stress resulting from exhaustive exercise were less severe in the muscles of melatonin-treated animals than in the muscles of control animals. Thus, melatonin treatment may reverse exercise-induced skeletal muscle inflammation and stimulate growth factor synthesis.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

They exert direct effects on adipocyte differentiation in a depot-specific manner, via the androgen receptor (AR), leading to modulation of adipocyte size and fat compartment expansion. Androgens also impact directly on key adipocyte functions including insulin signalling, lipid , fatty  uptake and adipokine production. Androgen excess and deficiency have implications for  health in both males and females, and these  effects may be mediated through adipose tissue via effects on fat distribution, adipocyte function and lipolysis. Research into the field of androgen  in human and animal adipose tissue has produced inconsistent results; it is important to take into account the sex-, depot- and organism-specific effects of androgens in fat. In general, studies point towards a stimulatory effect on lipolysis, with impairment of adipocyte differentiation, insulin signalling and adipokine generation. Observed effects are frequently gender-specific. Adipose tissue is an important organ of pre-receptor androgen , through which local androgen availability is rigorously controlled. Adipose androgen exposure is tightly controlled by isoenzymes of AKR1C, 5α-reductase and others, but regulation of the balance between generation and irreversible inactivation remains poorly understood. In particular, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 are crucial in the regulation of local androgen bioavailability within adipose tissue. These isoforms control the balance between activation of androstenedione (A) to testosterone (T) by the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (17β-HSD) of AKR1C3, or inactivation of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol by the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) activity of AKR1C2. Most studies suggest that androgen inactivation is the predominant reaction in fat, particularly in the abdominal subcutaneous (SC) depot. Modulation of local adipose androgen availability may afford future therapeutic options to improve  phenotype in disorders of androgen excess and deficiency.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested whether α4βδ trafficking and surface expression would be altered by in vitro exposure to flumazenil, a benzodiazepine ligand which reduces α4βδ expression in vivo. We first determined that flumazenil (100 nM-100 μM, IC50=∼1 μM) acted as a negative modulator, reducing GABA (10 μM)-gated current in the presence of 100 nM THP (to increase receptor efficacy), assessed with whole cell patch clamp recordings of recombinant α4β2δ expressed in HEK-293 cells. Surface expression of recombinant α4β2δ receptors was detected using a 3XFLAG reporter at the C-terminus of α4 (α4F) using confocal immunocytochemical techniques following 48 h exposure of cells to GABA (10 μM)+THP (100 nM). Flumazenil (10 μM) decreased surface expression of α4F by ∼60%, while increasing its intracellular accumulation, after 48 h. Reduced surface expression of α4β2δ after flumazenil treatment was confirmed by decreases in the current responses to 100 nM of the GABA agonist gaboxadol. Flumazenil-induced decreases in surface expression of α4β2δ were prevented by the dynamin blocker, dynasore, and by leupeptin, which blocks lysosomal enzymes, suggesting that flumazenil is acting to increase endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the receptor. Flumazenil increased the rate of receptor removal from the cell surface by 2-fold, assessed using botulinum toxin B to block insertion of new receptors. These findings may suggest new therapeutic strategies for regulation of α4β2δ expression using flumazenil.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have shown that AKR1C3 is involved in the development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and that it is a rational drug target for the treatment of CRPC. Baccharin, a component of Brazilian propolis, has been observed to exhibit a high inhibitory potency and selectivity for AKR1C3 over other AKR1C isoforms and is a promising lead compound for developing more potent and selective inhibitors. Here, we report the screening of fifteen baccharin analogs as selective inhibitors against AKR1C3 versus AKR1C2 (type 3 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase). Among these analogs, the inhibitory activity and selectivity of thirteen compounds were evaluated for the first time. The substitution of the 4-dihydrocinnamoyloxy group of baccharin by an acetate group displayed nanomolar inhibitory potency (IC50: 440 nM) and a 102-fold selectivity over AKR1C2. By contrast, when the cinnamic  group of baccharin was esterified, there was a dramatic decrease in potency and selectivity for AKR1C3 in comparison to baccharin. Low or sub-micromolar inhibition was observed when the 3-prenyl group of baccharin was removed, and the selectivity over AKR1C2 was low. Although unsubstituted baccharin was still the most potent (IC50: 100 nM) and selective inhibitor for AKR1C3, these data provide structure-activity relationships required for the optimization of new baccharin analogs. They suggest that the carboxylate group on cinnamic , the prenyl group, and either retention of 4-dihydrocinnamoyloxy group or acetate substituent on cinnamic  are important to maintain the high potency and selectivity for AKR1C3.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Herein, a novel electrochemical biosensor was fabricated using enzymatic reaction coupling with the double oxidation circular amplification strategy for the detection of human serum TBA. With the catalysis of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), 3α-bile  reacted specifically with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). And then, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was produced. After that, the NADH reacted with the electron mediator of tris(2,2'-bipyridine) ruthenium(Ⅲ) (Ru(bpy)), which was then transformed to Ru(bpy). Ultimately, Ru(bpy) was further oxidized to Ru(bpy) under a certain voltage, which was detected by the chronoamperometry assay. The detection was performed using a disposable unmodified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) without sample preparation. The proposed biosensor showed high sensitivity and accuracy with the linear range from 5.0 to 150.0 pmol/L in 10-fold dilution serum. The established method had a good correlation with the enzymatic cycling method (r = 0.9372, P < 0.001, n = 72) commonly used in clinic. The electrochemical biosensor is simple, ultrasensitive and without sample pretreatment, showing great potential for point-of-care testing (POCT) of serum TBA in clinical samples. In addition, the biosensor is cost-effective with a small volume of samples, especially suitable for those who have difficulties in blood collection, such as infants, children and some small animals.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To exert their effects, PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3 must be released to the extracellular space from cells, but the release mechanism has been unclear. We therefore investigated the contribution of ATP-binding cassette transporter C4 (ABCC4), which has been known as a prostanoids efflux transporter, to the release of PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3.ATP-dependent transport of PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3 via ABCC4 was investigated by using inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from ABCC4-overexpressing HEK293 cells. To evaluate the contribution of ABCC4 to the release of PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3, we measured the extracellular and intracellular levels of PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3 in A549 cells when we used ABCC4 inhibitors (dipyridamole, MK571, and probenecid) or ABCC4 siRNAs. The quantification of PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3 was performed by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The apparent Km values for ABCC4-mediated transport were 2.9±0.1 µM for PGE3, 12.1±1.3 µM for PGF(3α), and 11.9±1.4 µM for TXB3 and the ATP-dependent accumulation of PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3 into vesicles was decreased by using typical substrates and inhibitors of ABCC4. ABCC4 inhibitors and ABCC4 knockdown showed the reduction of extracellular/intracellular ratio of PGE3 (40-60% of control) and PGF(3α) (60-80% of control) in A549 cells.Our results suggest that PGE3, PGF(3α), and TXB3 are substrates of ABCC4 and ABCC4 partially contributes to the release of PGE3 and PGF(3α).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28068457>Cellular GABAergic Neuroactive Steroid (3α,5α)-3-Hydroxy-Pregnan-20-One (3α,5α-THP) Immunostaining Levels Are Increased in the Ventral Tegmental Area of Human Alcohol Use Disorder Patients: A Postmortem Study.</a></h1><p>The GABAergic neuroactive steroid (3α,5α)-3-hydroxy-pregnan-20-one (3α,5α-THP; allopregnanolone) enhances GABAergic activity and produces subjective effects similar to ethanol (EtOH). The effect of chronic alcohol exposure on 3α,5α-THP concentrations has been studied in mouse, rat, and monkey limbic brain areas. Chronic EtOH exposure produced divergent brain region and cell-specific changes in 3α,5α-THP concentrations in animal studies. However, 3α,5α-THP levels in similar human brain regions have never been examined in individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Therefore, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to examine 3α,5α-THP levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra pars medialis (SNM), and amygdala of human postmortem brains of patients diagnosed with AUD compared with social drinkers. The effects of sex and liver disease on 3α,5α-THP concentrations were examined in the aforementioned brain regions.Human postmortem brains of AUD patients and age-matched controls were obtained from the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource Center. IHC was performed using anti-3α,5α-THP antibody on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain sections to detect cellular 3α,5α-THP levels. Immunoreactivity was analyzed by pixel density/mm for the comparison between AUD patients and controls.3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity was increased by 23.2 ± 9% in the VTA of AUD patients compared with age-matched controls (p = 0.014). Moreover, a 29.6 ± 10% increase in 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity was observed in the SNM of male AUD patients compared with male controls (p < 0.01), but not in female subjects. 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity in the VTA and SNM regions did not differ between noncirrhotic and cirrhotic AUD patients. A sex difference in 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity (female 51 ± 18% greater than male) was observed among control subjects in the SNM, but no other brain region. 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdala and lateral amygdala was negatively correlated with the length of the tissue fixation time as well as the age of the subjects, precluding assessment of the effect of AUD.Cellular 3α,5α-THP levels in VTA are increased in human AUD patients, an effect that is likely independent of sex and liver disease. The differences between animal models and human studies should be factored into the interpretation of the physiological significance of elevated 3α,5α-THP levels in humans.Copyright © 2017 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607810>Neuroactive steroid treatment modulates myelin lipid profile in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy causes a decrease in the levels of dihydroprogesterone and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-diol) in the peripheral nerves. These two neuroactive steroids exert protective effects, by mechanisms that still remain elusive. We have previously shown that the activation of Liver X Receptors improves the peripheral neuropathic phenotype in diabetic rats. This protective effect is accompanied by the restoration to control values of the levels of dihydroprogesterone and 3α-diol in peripheral nerves. In addition, activation of these receptors decreases peripheral myelin abnormalities by improving the lipid desaturation capacity, which is strongly blunted by diabetes, and ultimately restores the myelin lipid profile to non-diabetic values. On this basis, we here investigate whether dihydroprogesterone or 3α-diol may exert their protective effects by modulating the myelin lipid profile. We report that both neuroactive steroids act on the lipogenic gene expression profile in the sciatic nerve of diabetic rats, reducing the accumulation of myelin saturated fatty  and promoting desaturation. These changes were associated with a reduction in myelin structural alterations. These findings provide evidence that dihydroprogesterone and 3α-diol are protective agents against diabetic peripheral neuropathy by regulating the de novo lipogenesis pathway, which positively influences myelin lipid profile.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to drug craving and lethargy, METH withdrawal is associated with stress-triggered anxiety. However, the cellular basis for this stress-triggered anxiety is not understood. The present results suggest that during METH withdrawal (24h) following chronic exposure (3mg/kg, i.p. for 3-5weeks) of adult, male mice, the effect of one neurosteroid released by stress, 3α,5α-THP (3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one), and its 3α,5β isomer reverse to trigger anxiety assessed by the acoustic startle response (ASR), in contrast to their usual anti-anxiety effects. This novel effect of 3α,5β-THP was due to increased (three-fold) hippocampal expression of α4βδ GABAA receptors (GABARs) during METH withdrawal (24h-4weeks) because anxiogenic effects of 3α,5β-THP were not seen in α4-/- mice. 3α,5β-THP reduces current at these receptors when it is hyperpolarizing, as observed during METH withdrawal. As a result, 3α,5β-THP (30nM) increased neuronal excitability, assessed with current clamp and cell-attached recordings in CA1hippocampus, one CNS site which regulates anxiety. α4βδ GABARs were first increased 1h after METH exposure and recovered 6weeks after METH withdrawal. Similar increases in α4βδ GABARs and anxiogenic effects of 3α,5β-THP were noted in rats during METH withdrawal (24h). In contrast, the ASR was increased by chronic METH treatment in the absence of 3α,5β-THP administration due to its stimulant effect. Although α4βδ GABARs were increased by chronic METH treatment, the GABAergic current recorded from hippocampal neurons at this time was a depolarizing, shunting inhibition, which was potentiated by 3α,5β-THP. This steroid reduced neuronal excitability and anxiety during chronic METH treatment, consistent with its typical effect. Flumazenil (10mg/kg, i.p., 3×) reduced α4βδ expression and prevented the anxiogenic effect of 3α,5β-THP after METH withdrawal. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism underlying stress-triggered anxiety after METH withdrawal mediated by α4βδ GABARs.Copyright © 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is an inducible and key enzyme in steroid degradation. Elucidating the mechanism of 3,17β-HSD gene (βhsd) regulation may help us to generate prospective C. testosteroni mutants for bioremediation. The genome of C. testosteroni ATCC11996 was sequenced in our previous work. Upon examining the genome with bioinformatics tools, a gene (brp) coding for a regulator protein (BRP) for 3,17β-HSD expression was found upstream of the βhsd gene. A Blast search revealed high identities to a nucleotide binding protein with unknown function in other bacteria. Two potential promoters and two repeat sequences (RS, 16 bp), spaced to each other by 1661 bp, were also found upstream of the βhsd gene C. testosteroni. The brp gene was cloned into plasmid pK18 and pET-15b, expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant BRP protein was purified on a Ni-column. In addition, a brp gene knock-out mutant of C. testosteroni was prepared. These knock-out mutants showed an enhanced expression of both the βhsd gene and the hsdA gene (the latter coding for 3α-HSD/CR) in the presence of testosterone. To characterize the BRP functional DNA domain, different fragments of the βhsd upstream regulatory region were tested in a cotransformation system. Our data reveal that the βhsd gene undergoes complex regulation involving the two promoters, a loop structure via the two repeat sequences, and the steroid testosterone. Furthermore, a proximal repressor gene for βhsd expression, phaR, had been identified in our previous investigations. The exact interplay between all these factors will be determined in future experiments.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AKR1C34 and AKR1C35 similarly oxidized various xenobiotic alicyclic alcohols using NAD(+), but differed in their substrate specificity for hydroxysteroids and inhibitor sensitivity. While AKR1C34 showed 3α/17β/20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities, AKR1C35 efficiently oxidized various 3β- and 17β-hydroxysteroids, including biologically active 3β-hydroxy-5α/β-dihydro-C19/C21-steroids, dehydroepiandrosterone and 17β-estradiol. AKR1C35 also differed from AKR1C34 in its high sensitivity to flavonoids, which inhibited competitively with respect to 17β-estradiol (Ki 0.11-0.69 μM). The mRNA for AKR1C35 was expressed liver-specific in male hamsters and ubiquitously in female hamsters, whereas the expression of the mRNA for AKR1C34 displayed opposite sexual dimorphism. Because AKR1C35 is the first 317Β-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE IN THE AKR SUPERFAMILY: , we also investigated the molecular determinants for the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity by replacement of Val54 and Cys310 in AKR1C35 with the corresponding residues in AKR1C34, Ala and Phe, respectively. The mutation of Val54Ala, but not Cys310Phe, significantly impaired this activity, suggesting that Val54 plays a critical role in recognition of the steroidal substrate.© The Authors 2015.

We measured the main physicochemical properties of these molecules, including ionization constants, water solubility, lipophilicity, detergency, and protein binding. Biliary secretion and  and plasma and hepatic concentrations were evaluated by high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry in bile fistula rat and compared with natural analogs chenodeoxycholic, cholic , and taurochenodexycholic  and intestinal bacteria  was evaluated in terms of 7α-dehydroxylase substrate-specificity in anaerobic human stool culture. The semisynthetic derivatives detergency, measured in terms of their critical micellar concentration, was quite similar to the natural analogs. They were slightly more lipophilic than the corresponding natural analogs, evaluated by their 1-octanol water partition coefficient (log P), because of the ethyl group in 6 position, which makes these molecules very stable toward bacterial 7-dehydroxylation. The hepatic  and biliary secretion were different: 6α-ethyl-3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic , as chenodeoxycholic , was efficiently conjugated with taurine in the liver and, only in this form, promptly and efficiently secreted in bile. 6α-Ethyl-23(S)-methyl-3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic  was poorly conjugated with taurine because of the steric hindrance of the methyl at C23(S) position metabolized to the C23(R) isomer and partly conjugated with taurine. Conversely, 6α-ethyl-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholan-23-sulfate was secreted in bile unmodified and as 3-glucuronide. Therefore, minor structural modifications profoundly influence the  and biodistribution in the target organs where these analogs exert therapeutic effects by interacting with FXR and/or TGR5 receptors.Copyright © 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27808511>Cytotoxic Lanostanoids from Poria cocos.</a></h1><p>Six new and 16 known lanostanoids were isolated from the sclerotia of Poria cocos.

Clinical and epidemiologic data provide strong evidence on the influence of androgens and estrogens on the risk of typical hormone-dependent malignancies, like breast and prostate cancer. Recent studies have focused on the role of androgen metabolites in regulating androgen concentrations in hormone-sensitive tissues. Steroid glucuronidation has been suggested to have a prominent role in controlling the levels and the biological activity of unconjugated androgens. It is well-established that serum levels of androgen glucuronides reflect androgen  in androgen-sensitive tissues. Quantitative analysis of androgen metabolites in blood specimens is the only minimally invasive approach permitting an accurate estimate of the total pool of androgens. During the past years, androgen glucuronides analysis most often involved radioimmunoassays (RIA) or direct immunoassays, both methods bearing serious limitations. However, recent impressive technical advances in mass spectrometry, and particularly in high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), have overcome these drawbacks enabling the simultaneous, quantitative analysis of multiple steroids even at low concentrations. Blood androgen profiling by LC-MS/MS, a robust and reliable technique of high selectivity, sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy emerges as a promising new approach in the study of human pathology. The present review offers a contemporary insight in androgen glucuronides profiling through the application of LC-MS/MS, highlighting new perspectives in the study of steroids and their implication in hormone-dependent malignancies.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Recent work suggests potential neuroprotective roles for the 3α-hydroxy, 5α-reduced metabolites of these hormones. Two such metabolites are 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-diol) and 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone; Allo), which may contribute to the overall protection conferred by their precursors (testosterone and progesterone, respectively) through mechanisms including potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) receptor (GABAR) activity. We have previously demonstrated that physiological concentrations of 3α-diol inhibit prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the associated neurotoxicity resulting from amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ42) exposure in vitro. In the present study, we sought to characterize the GABAR-dependency of 3α-diol's effects, compared to those of Allo, in SH-SY5Y human female neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons isolated from postnatal day 0-1 mice. Both 3α-diol and Allo prevented Aβ42-mediated ERK phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells, with substantially different concentration requirements (10 nM for 3α-diol, 100 nM for Allo). Pharmacological inhibition of GABAR with picrotoxin did not prevent this effect, indicating that neurosteroid-mediated ERK inhibition in SH-SY5Y cells may be GABAR-independent. While 10 nM and 100 nM concentrations of both neurosteroids inhibited ERK phosphorylation induced by Aβ42 in primary cortical neurons, which have high expression levels of GABARs, only the effects of Allo were significantly inhibited by picrotoxin. These results suggest that neurosteroid metabolites of testosterone and progesterone may contribute to neuroprotection by suppressing ERK phosphorylation through both GABAR-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Acute hypoxic stress is considered as one of the important factors inducing tissue damage. Here, we evaluate the influence of short-term hypoxia (1% O2 for 24 h) on perivascular adipose tissue-derived cells (ASCs) permanently expanded in tissue-related O2 (5%) microenvironment. After hypoxic exposure, ASCs retained high viability, stromal cell morphology and mesenchymal phenotype (CD73+, CD90+, CD105+ and CD45-). Mild oxidative damage was unveiled as elevation of reactive oxygen species and thiobarbituric -active products, while no reduction in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase and a 20% statistically significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity was detected. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-3α isoforms was differently regulated. HIF-1α displayed transient up-regulation, with maximum levels 30 min after acute hypoxic exposure, while HIF-3α was significantly up-regulated after 24 h. Up-regulation of ERK7, MEK1 and c-fos, and down-regulation of MKK6, p53, CCNA2, CCNB1 and CCNB2 were observed after 24 h of oxygen deprivation. Acute hypoxic exposure did not affect the gene expression of other mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and MAPK kinases, MAPK/ERK kinase-interacting proteins, MAPK-activated transcription factors and scaffolding proteins. Significant stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor α and interleukin-6 production was detected in ASC-conditioned medium. Thus, tissue O2-adapted ASCs are resistant to hypoxic stress, which can ensure their effective involvement in the regeneration of tissue damage under significant oxygen deprivation.© 2015 S.

For the first time, the levels of these molecules were assessed here in sterol regulatory element binding protein -1c knock-out male mice (i.e., an experimental model of peripheral neuropathy) and compared with observations in wild type animals. The levels of neuroactive steroids have been evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in plasma and sciatic nerve at 2 and 10 months of age and these analyses were implemented analyzing the gene expression of crucial steroidogenic enzymes in sciatic nerve. Data obtained at 2 months of age showed high levels of pregnenolone in sciatic nerve, associated with low levels of its first metabolite, progesterone, and further metabolites (i.e., 5α-pregnane-3,20-dione and 5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one). High levels of testosterone and 17β-estradiol were also observed. At 10 months of age, the neuroactive steroid profile showed some differences. Indeed, low levels of pregnenolone and high levels of 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one and 5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one were observed. The analysis of the gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes considered here generally followed these changes. Interestingly, the levels of pregnenolone and progesterone were unmodified in plasma suggesting a specific effect of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c on neurosteroidogenesis. Because this peripheral neuropathy is due to altered fatty  biosynthesis, data reported here support the belief that the cross-talk between this biosynthetic pathway and neuroactive steroids may represent a possible therapeutic strategy for peripheral neuropathy.© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24239507> and genes involved in steroid hormone  in male pigs: a review and update.</a></h1><p>This paper reviews state-of-the-art knowledge on steroid biosynthesis  in the pig and provides an updated characterization of the porcine genes involved in these  with particular focus on androgens, estrogens, and 16-androstenes. At least 21 different enzymes appear to be involved in these  in porcine tissues together with at least five cofactors. Until now, data on several porcine genes were scarce or confusing. We characterized the complete genomic and transcript sequences of the single porcine CYP11B gene. We analyzed the porcine AKR1 gene cluster and identified four AKR1C, one AKR1C like genes and one AKR1E2 gene. We provide evidence that porcine AKR1C genes are not orthologous to human AKR1C. A new nomenclature is thus needed for this gene family in the pig. Thirty-two genes are now described: transcript (30+2 characterized in this study) and genomic (complete: 18+1 and partial: 12+1) sequences are identified. However, despite increasing knowledge on steroid  in the pig, there is still no explanation of why porcine testes can produce androstenone and epiandrosterone, but not dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is also a reduced steroid.Crown Copyright © 2013.

A manifestation of such co- is the vast structural diversity of bile  (BAs) involving both oxidative stereochemistry and conjugation. Herein, we describe the development and validation of a LC-MS-based method for the analysis of human C24 BA metabolome in serum and urine. The method has high throughput covering the discrimination of oxidative stereochemistry of unconjugated species in a 15-min analytical cycle. The validated quantitative performance provided an indirect way to ascertain the conjugation patterns of BAs via enzyme-digestion protocols that incorporated the enzymes, sulfatase, β-glucuronidase, and choloylglycine hydrolase. Application of the method has led to the detection of at least 70 unconjugated BAs including 27 known species and 43 newly found species in the post-prandial serum and urine samples from 7 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients and 13 healthy volunteers. Newly identified unconjugated BAs included 3α, 12β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic , 12α-hydroxy-3-oxo-5β-cholan-24-oic , and 3α, 7α, 12β-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic . High-definition negative fragment spectra of the other major unknown species were acquired to facilitate future identification endeavors. An extensive conjugation pattern is the major reason for the "invisibility" of the newly found BAs to other common analytical methods. Metabolomic analysis of the total unconjugated BA profile in combination with analysis of their conjugation patterns and urinary excretion tendencies have provided substantial insights into the interconnected roles of host and gut microbiota in maintaining BA homeostasis. It was proposed that the urinary total BA profile may serve as an ideal footprint for the functional status of the host-gut microbial BA co-. In summary, this work provided a powerful tool for human C24 BA metabolome analysis that bridges the gap between GC-MS techniques in the past age and LC-MS techniques currently prevailing in biomedical researches. Further applications of the present method in clinical, translational research, and other biomedical explorations will continue to boost the construction of a host-gut microbial co- network of BAs and thus facilitate the decryption of BA-mediated host-gut microbiota crosstalk in health and diseases.

The specific functions of neurexins, however, remain largely unknown because no conditional neurexin knockouts are available and targeting all α- and β-neurexins produced by a particular gene is challenging. Using newly generated constitutive and conditional knockout mice that target all neurexin-3α and neurexin-3β isoforms, we found that neurexin-3 was differentially required for distinct synaptic functions in different brain regions. Specifically, we found that, in cultured neurons and acute slices of the hippocampus, extracellular sequences of presynaptic neurexin-3 mediated trans-synaptic regulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. In cultured neurons and acute slices of the olfactory bulb, however, intracellular sequences of presynaptic neurexin-3 were selectively required for GABA release. Thus, our data indicate that neurexin-3 performs distinct essential pre- or postsynaptic functions in different brain regions by distinct mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100021>Fine-Tuning of the RIG-I-Like Receptor/Interferon Regulatory Factor 3-Dependent Antiviral Innate Immune Response by the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/β-Catenin Pathway.</a></h1><p>Induction of an antiviral innate immune response relies on pattern recognition receptors, including retinoic -inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLR), to detect invading pathogens, resulting in the activation of multiple latent transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Upon sensing of viral RNA and DNA, IRF3 is phosphorylated and recruits coactivators to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and selected sets of IRF3-regulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as those for ISG54 (Ifit2), ISG56 (Ifit1), and viperin (Rsad2). Here, we used wild-type, glycogen synthase kinase 3α knockout (GSK-3α(-/-)), GSK-3β(-/-), and GSK-3α/β double-knockout (DKO) embryonic stem (ES) cells, as well as GSK-3β(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells in which GSK-3α was knocked down to demonstrate that both isoforms of GSK-3, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, are required for this antiviral immune response. Moreover, the use of two selective small-molecule GSK-3 inhibitors (CHIR99021 and BIO-acetoxime) or ES cells reconstituted with the catalytically inactive versions of GSK-3 isoforms showed that GSK-3 activity is required for optimal induction of antiviral innate immunity. Mechanistically, GSK-3 isoform activation following Sendai virus infection results in phosphorylation of β-catenin at S33/S37/T41, promoting IRF3 DNA binding and activation of IRF3-regulated ISGs. This study identifies the role of a GSK-3/β-catenin axis in antiviral innate immunity.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that transcriptionally regulates BA homeostasis. Mice with FXR ablation present hepatocarcinoma (HCC) due to high toxic BA levels. Mice with Abcb4 ablation accumulate toxic BA within the bile ducts and present HCC. We have previously shown that intestinal specific activation of FXR by transgenic VP16-FXR chimera is able to reduce BA pool size and prevent HCC. Here we tested chemical FXR activation by administering for 15 months the dual FXR/ membrane G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) agonist INT-767 (6α-ethyl-3α,7α,23-trihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholan-23-sulphate) to Fxr and Abcb4 mice. HCC number and size were significantly reduced by INT-767 administration. In contrast, no changes in HCC tumor number and size were observed in Fxr mice fed with or without INT-767. Notably, INT-767 preserved the hepatic parenchyma, improved hepatic function and down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, in Abcb4 mice INT-767 prevented fibrosis by reducing collagen expression and deposition. Thus, long term activation of FXR is able to reduce BA pool, reprogram BA  and prevent HCC. These data provide the impetus to address the bona fide therapeutic potential of FXR activation in disease with BA-associated development of HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26996013>Anti-allergic Inflammatory Triterpenoids Isolated from the Spikes of Prunella vulgaris.</a></h1><p>Twelve known triterpenoids (1-12) and two steroids (13 and 14) have been isolated from the spike of the plant Prunella vulgaris. Among them, 2α,3α,23-trihydroxyursa-12,20(30)-dien-28-oic  (10) was isolated for the first time from this plant. All isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and release of histamine in human mast cells. β-Amyrin (5), 10, and euscaphic  (12) showed suppression of histamine release with percentage inhibitions of 46.7, 57.9, and 54.2%, respectively. In addition, 5 and 10 showed strong inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 in the test for pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our results suggest that compounds 5 and 10 largely contribute to the anti-allergic inflammatory effect of P. vulgaris.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161887>New chemical constituents from the fruits of Zanthoxylum armatum and its in vitro anti-inflammatory profile.</a></h1><p>Chemical investigations on the fruits of Zanthoxylum armatum Roxb.

The chemical structures were established with the help of physical, chemical and spectroscopic methods. The anti-inflammatory potential of isolated compounds 1 and 2 was evaluated using in vitro target-based anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated primary peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice.

Similarly ten more known compounds were isolated from the resin of Boswellia sacra including one triterpene (20) and nine boswellic  (14-19 and 21-23). Herein the compound 2 was first time reporting from natural source along with complete NMR assignment, while compounds 3-11 are known, but reported for the first time from the resin of B. papyrifera. The structure elucidation was done by advance spectroscopic D and D NMR techniques viz., H, C, DEPT, HSQC, HMBC, and COSY, and NEOSY, ESI-MS and compared with the reported literature. All compounds were evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity and as result eight of them 1, 3, 10, 11, 15, and 17-19 were found significantly active against α-glucosidase with an IC value ranging from 15.0 ± 0.84 to 80.3 ± 2.33 µM, while 21 exhibited moderate activity with IC of 799.9 ± 4.98 µM. Furthermore, two compounds 24 and 25 were synthesised from 16 and 17 to see the effect of carboxyl group in structural-activity relationship (SAR) study. Compounds 24 and 25 retained good α-glucosidase inhibition as compared to 16 and 17, indicating that carboxylic group play a key role in SAR. In addition, the aforementioned activity of all the active compounds was first time reported for their α-glucosidase inhibition potential. The molecular docking studies showed that all the active compounds well accommodate in the active site of the enzyme. Moreover pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds were predicted in silico, suggesting that the compounds possess drug like properties and excellent ADMET profile.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, this strategy fails to properly determine two recently reported phase II metabolites of T conjugated with glucuronic  that remained mostly conjugated after the hydrolysis step. These metabolites were identified as glucuronides of 6β-hydroxyandrosterone (6β-OH-And) and 6β-hydroxyetiocholanolone (6β-OH-Etio) but their exact conjugation site remained undetermined. In this study, the four possible glucuronides of 6β-OH-And and 6β-OH-Etio were synthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Moreover, their chromatographic properties and MS spectra were compared to those obtained for the urine samples collected after administration of T. Results confirmed that the recently reported metabolites were the 3α-glucuronides of 6β-OH-And and 6β-OH-Etio. The synthesis and the elucidation of the exact structure of the metabolites presented in this study are crucial steps for the development of analytical methods in order to explore their role in T  and their potential usefulness as biomarkers of T misuse.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24239672>Etifoxine analgesia in experimental monoarthritis: a combined action that protects spinal inhibition and limits central inflammatory processes.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the joint are major causes of chronic pain. Long-lasting pain symptoms are thought to result from a central sensitization of nociceptive circuits. These processes include activation of microglia and spinal disinhibition. Using a monoarthritic rat model of pain, we tried to potentiate neural inhibition by using etifoxine (EFX), a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic that acts as an allosteric-positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric  type A (GABAA) receptor function. Interestingly, EFX also can bind to the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) complex and stimulate the synthesis of 3α-reduced neurosteroids, the most potent positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptor function. Here we show that a curative and a preventive treatment with 50mg/kg of EFX efficiently reduced neuropathic pain symptoms. In the spinal cord, EFX analgesia was accompanied by a reduction in microglial activation and in the levels of proinflammatory mediators. Using electrophysiological tools, we found that EFX treatment not only amplified spinal GABAergic inhibition, but also prevented prostaglandin E2-induced glycinergic disinhibition and restored a "normal" spinal pain processing. Because EFX is already distributed in several countries under the trade name of Stresam for its anxiolytic actions in humans, new clinical trials are now required to further extend its therapeutic indications as pain killer.Copyright © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Their impaired synthesis and production lead to adverse health effects. Some environmental toxicants, including phthalate esters (PAEs), are associated with endocrine disruption. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) also cause adrenal toxicity and alteration of GC biosynthesis and their functions. Using in silico tools of Schrodinger Maestro 9.4, we performed a molecular docking study of 32 ligands including PAEs of a known endocrine-disrupting potential with the selected enzymes of the GC biosynthesis pathway (GBP) such as CYP11A1, CYP11B2, CYP19A1, CYP17A1, CYP21A2 and 3α/20β-HSD. Binding affinities of the PAEs were compared with known inhibitors of these enzymes. Amongst PAEs, diphenyl benzene-1, 2 - dicarboxylate (DPhP) showed the lowest docking score of -8.95616 kcal mol against CYP21A1. Besides, benzyl butyl benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (BBzP), bis(7-methylnonyl) benzene-1,2 dicarboxylate (DIDP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (DEHP) also showed comparable molecular interaction with enzymes of GBP. DPhP showed a significant molecular interaction with different enzymes of GBP such as CYP21A1, CYP11A1 and CYP11B2. These interactions mainly included H-bonding, hydrophobic, polar and van dar Waals' interactions. Interestingly, this in silico study revealed that certain PAEs have more inhibitory potential against enzymes of GBP than their respective known inhibitors. Such studies become more relevant in the risk assessment of exposure to mixtures of phthalate eaters.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28155214>RA Differentiation Enhances Dopaminergic Features, Changes Redox Parameters, and Increases Dopamine Transporter Dependency in 6-Hydroxydopamine-Induced Neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y Cells.</a></h1><p>Research on Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug development is hampered by the lack of suitable human in vitro models that simply and accurately recreate the disease conditions. To counteract this, many attempts to differentiate cell lines, such as the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, into dopaminergic neurons have been undertaken since they are easier to cultivate when compared with other cellular models. Here, we characterized neuronal features discriminating undifferentiated and retinoic  (RA)-differentiated SH-SYSY cells and described significant differences between these cell models in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) cytotoxicity. In contrast to undifferentiated cells, RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells demonstrated low proliferative rate and a pronounced neuronal morphology with high expression of genes related to synapse vesicle cycle, dopamine synthesis/degradation, and of dopamine transporter (DAT). Significant differences between undifferentiated and RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells in the overall capacity of antioxidant defenses were found; although RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells presented a higher basal antioxidant capacity with high resistance against HO insult, they were twofold more sensitive to 6-OHDA. DAT inhibition by 3α-bis-4-fluorophenyl-methoxytropane and dithiothreitol (a cell-permeable thiol-reducing agent) protected RA-differentiated, but not undifferentiated, SH-SY5Y cells from oxidative damage and cell death caused by 6-OHDA. Here, we demonstrate that undifferentiated and RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells are two unique phenotypes and also have dissimilar mechanisms in 6-OHDA cytotoxicity. Hence, our data support the use of RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells as an in vitro model of PD. This study may impact our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of PD and the development of new therapies and drugs for the management of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29634983>Peripheral GABA receptor-mediated signaling facilitates persistent inflammatory hypersensitivity.</a></h1><p>Unlike in the central nervous system (CNS), in the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS), activation of GABA receptors (GABAR) is excitatory because of the relatively high concentration of intracellular chloride in these neurons. Indeed, exogenous GABA and muscimol, a GABAR agonist, exacerbate acute inflammatory hypersensitivity in rodents. However, it remains unclear whether peripheral GABAR and the endogenous GABA play an important role in persistent inflammatory hypersensitivity. In this study, we thus investigated how peripheral GABAR affects pain hypersensitivity by using the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced persistent inflammatory pain mouse model. We found that intraplantar (i.pl.) administration of GABAR antagonists, picrotoxin, and 1(S),9(R)-(-)-bicuculline methiodide significantly inhibited both spontaneous nociceptive (paw licking and flinching) behavior and mechanical hypersensitivity in CFA-injected mice at day 3 (D3), but not in naïve mice. Interestingly, CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was significantly reversed by anti-GABA antibody (anti-GABA, i.pl.). In addition, RT-qPCR revealed that glutamate decarboxylase Gad1 (GAD 67) and Gad2 (GAD 65) mRNA expression was also upregulated in the ipsilateral hind paw of CFA-injected mice at D3. Finally, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (3α,5α-THP), a selective positive allosteric modulator of GABAR, produced mechanical hypersensitivity in naïve mice in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results indicate that peripheral GABAR and endogenous GABA, possibly produced by the inflamed tissue, potentiate CFA-induced persistent inflammatory hypersensitivity, suggesting that they can be used as a therapeutic target for alleviating inflammatory pain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Neurosteroids such as testosterone modulate seizure susceptibility through its transformation to metabolites which show proconvulsant and anticonvulsant effects, respectively. Reduction of testosterone by aromatase generates proconvulsant 17-β estradiol. Alternatively, testosterone is metabolized into 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) by 5α-reductase, which is then reduced by 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase enzyme (3α-HSOR) to form anticonvulsant metabolite 3α-androstanediol (3α-Diol), a potent GABA receptor modulating neurosteroid. The present study evaluated whether inhibition of aromatase inhibitor letrozole protects against seizures and neuronal degeneration induced by kainic  (KA) (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in Swiss albino mice. Letrozole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) administered one hour prior to KA significantly increased the onset time of seizures and reduced the% incidence of seizures. Pretreatment with finasteride, a selective inhibitor of 5α-reductase and indomethacin, a selective inhibitor of 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase enzyme (3α-HSOR), reversed the protective effects of letrozole in KA-induced seizures in mice. Microscopic examination using cresyl violet staining revealed that letrozole did not modify KA-induced neurotoxicity in the CA1, CA3 and DG region of the hippocampus. Letrozole treatment resulted in the reduced levels of 17-β estradiol and elevated the levels of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 3α-Diol in the hippocampus. Finasteride and indomethacin attenuated letrozole-induced elevations of 5α-DHT and 3α-Diol. Our results indicate the potential anticonvulsant effects of letrozole against KA-induced seizures in mice that might be mediated by inhibiting aromatization of testosterone to 17β-estradiol, a proconvulsant hormone and by redirecting the synthesis to anticonvulsant metabolites, 5α-DHT and 3α-Diol. Acute aromatase inhibition, thus, might be used as an adjuvant in the treatment of status epilepticus and can be pursued further.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Pregnancy hormones induce, organise and maintain many of these adaptations. Steroid hormones play a critical role and of particular importance is the progesterone metabolite and neurosteroid, allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone is produced in increasing amounts during pregnancy both in the periphery and in the maternal and foetal brain. This review critically examines a role for allopregnanolone in both the maternal and foetal brain during pregnancy and development in protecting pregnancy and birth outcomes, with particular emphasis on its role in relation to stress exposure at this time. Late pregnancy is associated with suppressed stress responses. Thus, we begin by considering what is known about the central mechanisms in the maternal brain, induced by allopregnanolone, that protect the foetus(es) from exposure to harmful levels of maternal glucocorticoids as a result of stress during pregnancy. Next we discuss the central mechanisms that prevent premature secretion of oxytocin and consider a role for allopregnanolone in minimising the risk of preterm birth. Allopregnanolone also plays a key role in the foetal brain, where it promotes development and is neuroprotective. Hence we review the evidence about disruption to neurosteroid production in pregnancy, through prenatal stress or other insults, and the immediate and long-term adverse consequences for the offspring. Finally we address whether progesterone or allopregnanolone treatment can rescue some of these deficits in the offspring.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Bufadienolides constitute one of the two major classes of CTS, but little is known about how they interact with NKA. We report a remarkable stereoselectivity of NKA inhibition by native 3β-hydroxy bufalin over the 3α-isomer, yet replacing the 3β-hydroxy group with larger polar groups in the same configuration enhances inhibitory potency. Binding of the two (13)C-labelled glycosyl diastereomers to NKA were studied by solid-state NMR (SSNMR), which revealed interactions of the glucose group of the 3β- derivative with the inhibitory site, but much weaker interactions of the 3α- derivative with the enzyme. Molecular docking simulations suggest that the polar 3β-groups are closer to the hydrophilic amino  residues in the entrance of the ligand-binding pocket than those with α-configuration. These first insights into the stereoselective inhibition of NKA by bufadienolides highlight the important role of the hydrophilic moieties at C3 for binding, and may explain why only 3β-hydroxylated bufadienolides are present as a toxic chemical defence in toad venom.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28428226>Rapid Throughput Analysis of GABA Receptor Subtype Modulators and Blockers Using DiSBAC(3) Membrane Potential Red Dye.</a></h1><p>Fluorometric imaging plate reader membrane potential dye (FMP-Red-Dye) is a proprietary tool for basic discovery and high-throughput drug screening for G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. We optimized and validated this potentiometric probe to assay functional modulators of heterologous expressed GABA receptor (GABAR) isoforms (synaptic 132, extrasynaptic 43, and 3 homopentomers). High-resolution mass spectrometry identified FMP-Red-Dye as 5,5'-(1-propen-1-yl-3-ylidene)bis[1,3-dimethyl-2-thio-barbituric ]. GABAR-expressing cells equilibrated with FMP-Red-Dye exhibited depolarized equilibrium membrane potentials compared with GABAR-null cells. The channel blockers picrotoxin, fipronil, and tetramethylenedisulfotetramine, and the competitive antagonist bicuculline reduced fluorescence near the levels in GABAR-null cells indicating that FMR-Red-Dye, a barbiturate derivative, activates GABAR-mediated outward Cl current in the absence of GABA. GABA caused concentration-dependent increases in fluorescence with rank order of potencies among GABAR isoforms consistent with results from voltage-clamp experiments (EC values for 43, 132, and  homopentamers were 6 ± 1, 40 ± 11, and >18 mM, respectively), whereas GABAR-null cells were unresponsive. Neuroactive steroids (NAS) increased fluorescence of GABAR expressing cells in the absence of GABA and demonstrated positive allosteric modulation in the presence of GABA, whereas benzodiazepines only exhibited positive allosteric modulator (PAM) activity. Of 20 NAS tested, allopregnanolone, (3,5,20E)-3-hydroxy-13,24-cyclo-18-norcholan-20-ene-21-carbonitrile, eltanolone, 5-pregnan-3,21-diol-20-one, and ganaxolone showed the highest potency. The FMP-Red-Dye-based assay described here provides a sensitive and quantitative method of assessing the activity of GABAR agonists, antagonists, and PAMs on diverse GABAR isoforms.

The complex effects of neurosteroids on pLGICs suggest the presence of multiple binding sites in these receptors. Here, using a series of novel neurosteroid-photolabeling reagents combined with top-down and middle-down mass spectrometry, we have determined the stoichiometry, sites, and orientation of binding for 3α,5α-pregnane neurosteroids in the  ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a prototypic pLGIC. The neurosteroid-based reagents photolabeled two sites per GLIC subunit, both within the transmembrane domain; one site was an intrasubunit site, and the other was located in the interface between subunits. By using reagents with photoreactive groups positioned throughout the neurosteroid backbone, we precisely map the orientation of neurosteroid binding within each site. Amino  substitutions introduced at either site altered neurosteroid modulation of GLIC channel activity, demonstrating the functional role of both sites. These results provide a detailed molecular model of multisite neurosteroid modulation of GLIC, which may be applicable to other mammalian pLGICs.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434280>Human 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (3α-HSD3): the V54L mutation restricting the steroid alternative binding and enhancing the 20α-HSD activity.</a></h1><p>Human 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (3α-HSD3) has an essential role in the inactivation of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Notably, human 3α-HSD3 shares 97.8% sequence identity with human 20-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD) and there is only one amino  difference (residue 54) that is located in their steroid binding pockets. However, 20α-HSD displays a distinctive ability in transforming progesterone to 20α-hydroxy-progesterone (20α-OHProg). In this study, to understand the role of residue 54 in the steroid binding and discrimination, the V54L mutation in human 3α-HSD3 has been created. We have solved two crystal structures of the 3α-HSD3·NADP(+)·Progesterone complex and the 3α-HSD3 V54L·NADP(+)·progesterone complex. Interestingly, progesterone adopts two different binding modes to form complexes within the wild type enzyme, with one binding mode similar to the orientation of a bile  (ursodeoxycholate) in the reported ternary complex of human 3α-HSD3·NADP(+)·ursodeoxycholate and the other binding mode resembling the orientation of 20α-OHProg in the ternary complex of human 20α-HSD·NADP(+)·20α-OHProg. However, the V54L mutation directly restricts the steroid binding modes to a unique one, which resembles the orientation of 20α-OHProg within human 20α-HSD. Furthermore, the kinetic study has been carried out. The results show that the V54L mutation significantly decreases the 3α-HSD activity for the reduction of DHT, while this mutation enhances the 20α-HSD activity to convert progesterone.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing an exogenous control over these receptors represents an attractive strategy for the treatment of enterohepatic and  disorders. A number of dual GPBAR1/FXR agonists are known, however their therapeutic use is limited by multiple unwanted effects due to activation of the diverse downstream signals controlled by the two receptors. On the other hand, designing selective GPBAR1 and FXR agonists is challenging since the two proteins share similar structural requisites for ligand binding. Here, taking advantage of our knowledge of the two targets, we have identified through a rational drug design study a series of amine lithocholic  derivatives as selective GPBAR1 agonists. The presence of the 3α-NH2 group on the steroidal scaffold is responsible for the selectivity over FXR unveiling unprecedented structural insights into bile  receptors activity modulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28211011>TEOA, a triterpenoid from Actinidia eriantha, induces autophagy in SW620 cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress and ROS-dependent mitophagy.</a></h1><p>2α,3α,24-Thrihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oicacid (TEOA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, isolated from the roots of Actinidia eriantha, exhibits significant cytotoxicity against SW620, BGC-823, HepG-2, A549 and PC-3 cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of the anticancer activity of TEOA in SW620 cells. We demonstrated that TEOA induced apoptosis through cleavage of caspase-9 and PARP in SW620 cells. In addition, evidence of TEOA-mediated autophagy included the induction of autophagolysosomes and activation of autophagic markers LC-3B and p62. Further analysis illustrated that TEOA promoted the phosphorylation of PERK and elF2α, followed by up-regulation of the downstream protein CHOP, suggesting the involvement of PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway and ER stress in TEOA-induced autophagy in SW620 cells. Meanwhile, TEOA-mediated PINK1, Parkin, ubiquitin and p62 activation revealed that TEOA induced specific autophagy-mitophagy in SW620 cells. Additionally, an antioxidant NAC attenuated the TEOA-induced mitophagy, indicating that TEOA triggers mitophagy via a ROS-dependent pathway. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel cellular mechanism of TEOA in the colon cancer cell line SW620, thus providing a molecular basis for developing TEOA into an anti-tumor candidate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24031053>Post-prandial regulation of hepatic glucokinase and lipogenesis requires the activation of TORC1 signalling in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h1><p>To assess the potential involvement of TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) signalling in the regulation of post-prandial hepatic lipid and glucose -related gene expression in trout, we employed intraperitoneal administration of rapamycin to achieve an acute inhibition of the TOR pathway. Our results reveal that rapamycin inhibits the phosphorylation of TORC1 and its downstream effectors (S6K1, S6 and 4E-BP1), without affecting Akt and the Akt substrates Forkhead-box Class O1 (FoxO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β (GSK 3α/β). These results indicate that acute administration of rapamycin in trout leads to the inhibition of TORC1 activation. No effect is observed on the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and fatty  oxidation, but hepatic TORC1 inhibition results in decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) gene expression and suppressed fatty  synthase (FAS) and glucokinase (GK) at gene expression and activity levels, indicating that FAS and GK activity is controlled at a transcriptional level in a TORC1-dependent manner. This study demonstrates for the first time in fish that post-prandial regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and glucokinase in rainbow trout requires the activation of TORC1 signalling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602830>3-Methyl-Neurosteroid Analogs Are Preferential Positive Allosteric Modulators and Direct Activators of Extrasynaptic -Subunit -Aminobutyric  Type A Receptors in the Hippocampus Dentate Gyrus Subfield.</a></h1><p>Neurosteroids are powerful modulators of -aminobutyric  (GABA)-A receptors. Ganaxolone (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-pregnan-20-one, GX) and synthetic analogs of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (AP) are designed to treat epilepsy and related conditions. However, their precise mechanism of action in native neurons remains unclear. Here, we sought to determine the mode of action of GX and its analogs at GABA-A receptors in native hippocampal neurons by analyzing extrasynaptic receptor-mediated tonic currents and synaptic receptor-mediated phasic currents. Concentration-response profiles of GX were determined in two cell types: -containing dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) and 2-containing CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PCs). GX produced significantly greater potentiation of the GABA-A receptor-activated chloride currents in DGGCs (500%) than CA1PCs (200%). In the absence of GABA, GX evoked 2-fold greater inward currents in DGGCs than CA1PCs, which were 2-fold greater than AP within DGGCs. In hippocampus slices, GX potentiated and directly activated tonic currents in DGGCs. These responses were significantly diminished in DGGCs from -subunit knockout (KO) mice, confirming GX's selectivity for GABA-A receptors. Like AP, GX potentiation of tonic currents was prevented by protein kinase C inhibition. Furthermore, GX's protection against hippocampus-kindled seizures was significantly diminished in KO mice. GX analogs exhibited greater potency and efficacy than GX on GABA-A receptor-mediated tonic inhibition. In summary, these results provide strong evidence that GX and its analogs are preferential allosteric modulators and direct activators of extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors regulating network inhibition and seizures in the dentate gyrus. Therefore, these findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the clinical use of synthetic neurosteroids in epilepsy and seizure disorders.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25944373>Ursane-type nortriterpenes with a five-membered A-ring from Rubus innominatus.</a></h1><p>Two nortriterpenes (rubuminatus A and B), which contain a distinctive contracted a five-membered A-ring ursane-type skeleton, and six triterpenes along with 17 known triterpenes were isolated from the roots of Rubus innominatus S.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this change remain unclear. Here, we report that TGF-β1- or PDGF-induced CAFs switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. We identify downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α (IDH3α) as a marker for this switch. Furthermore, miR-424 downregulates IDH3α during CAF formation. Downregulation of IDH3α decreases the effective level of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by reducing the ratio of α-KG to fumarate and succinate, resulting in PHD2 inhibition and HIF-1α protein stabilization. The accumulation of HIF-1α, in turn, promotes glycolysis by increasing the uptake of glucose, upregulating expression of glycolytic enzymes under normoxic conditions, and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation by upregulating NDUFA4L2. CAFs from tumor samples exhibit low levels of IDH3α, and overexpression of IDH3α prevents transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs. Our studies reveal IDH3α to be a critical  switch in CAFs.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, chronic ethanol consumption reduces 3α,5α-THP levels in human plasma, rat hippocampus and mouse limbic regions. We explored the relationship between 3α,5α-THP levels in limbic brain areas and voluntary ethanol consumption in the cynomolgus monkey following daily self-administration of ethanol for 12 months and further examined the relationship to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function prior to ethanol exposure. Monkeys were subjected to scheduled induction of ethanol consumption followed by free access to ethanol or water for 22 h/day over 12 months. Immunohistochemistry was performed using an anti-3α,5α-THP antibody. Prolonged voluntary drinking resulted in individual differences in ethanol consumption that ranged from 1.2 to 4.2 g/kg/day over 12 months. Prolonged ethanol consumption reduced cellular 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity by 13 ± 2 percent (P < 0.05) in the lateral amygdala and 17 ± 2 percent (P < 0.05) in the basolateral amygdala. The effect of ethanol was most pronounced in heavy drinkers that consumed ≥3 g/kg ≥ 20 percent of days. Consequently, 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity in both the lateral and basolateral amygdala was inversely correlated with average daily ethanol intake (Spearman r = -0.87 and -0.72, respectively, P < 0.05). However, no effect of ethanol and no correlation between drinking and 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity were observed in the basomedial amygdala. 3α,5α-THP immunoreactivity following ethanol exposure was also correlated with HPA axis function prior to ethanol exposure. These data indicate that voluntary ethanol drinking reduces amygdala levels of 3α,5α-THP in non-human primates and that amygdala 3α,5α-THP levels may be linked to HPA axis function.© 2015 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27108034>Two Major Bile  in the Hornbills, (24R,25S)-3α,7α,24-Trihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oyl Taurine and Its 12α-Hydroxy Derivative.</a></h1><p>Two major bile  were isolated from the gallbladder bile of two hornbill species from the Bucerotidae family of the avian order Bucerotiformes Buceros bicornis (great hornbill) and Penelopides panini (Visayan tarictic hornbill).

One mechanism that provides CaP resistance to ADT is primary backdoor androgen , which uses up to four 3α-oxidoreductases to convert 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (DIOL) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The goal was to determine whether inhibition of 3α-oxidoreductase activity decreased conversion of DIOL to DHT. Protein sequence analysis showed that the four 3α-oxidoreductases have identical catalytic amino  residues. Mass spectrometry data showed combined treatment using catalytically inactive 3α-oxidoreductase mutants and the 5α-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, decreased DHT levels in CaP cells better than dutasteride alone.

The American Cancer Society estimated that for the year 2016 the number of prostate cancer deaths will be 26,120. Thus, there is a critical need for novel approaches to treat this deadly disease. Using high-throughput small-molecule screening, we found that the small molecule 6-bromo-indirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO) significantly improves the targeting of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) delivered by gymnosis (i.e., in the absence of any transfection reagents) in both the cell cytoplasm and the nucleus. Furthermore, as a single agent, 6BIO had the unexpected ability to simultaneously downregulate androgen receptor (AR) expression and AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. This includes downregulating levels of the AR-V7, a drug-resistance-related AR splice variant that is important in the progression of prostate cancer. Combining 6BIO and an anti-AR oligonucleotide (AR-ASO) can augment the downregulation of AR expression. We also demonstrated that 6BIO enhances ASO function and represses AR expression through the inhibition of the two main glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) isoforms: GSK-3α and GSK-3β activity. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of 6BIO as a single agent or as part of a combinatorial ASO-based therapy in the treatment of human prostate cancer.Copyright © 2017 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of salvianolic  A (SAA) on the expression of CCL-20 in macrophages and ApoE-deficient (ApoE) mice.The expression of CCL-20 was detected both at protein and messenger RNA levels in RAW264.7 cells. We validated the result in ApoE mice that were intraperitoneally injected with SAA. Phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was detected with Western blot, and inhibitor of p38 was used to investigate the mechanism of regulation of CCL-20. Hematoxylin and eosin and Oil-Red-O staining were used to evaluate the atherosclerotic lesions and lipid accumulation in ApoE mice. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to detect the expressions of CCL-20 and CCR6 in the atherosclerotic lesions. Immunofluorescent analysis was used to certify the origination of CCL-20.Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) upregulated CCL-20 production in dose- and time-dependent manners in RAW264.7 cells. The activity of TNF-α-induced CCL-20 production seemed to be significantly suppressed by SAA. Using p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, we found that p38 mediated the effects of TNF-α- and SAA-induced CCL-20 expression changes. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of aortic root of ApoE mice also demonstrated that the expressions of CCL-20 and CCR6 were both downregulated significantly with SAA treatment. Furthermore, treatment of SAA inhibited the progression of the atherosclerotic plaques and lipid accumulation.These results demonstrate that TNF-α increased but SAA suppressed CCL-20 production significantly via a novel mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477291>Hepatic 1-carbon metabolism enzyme activity, intermediate metabolites, and growth in neonatal Holstein dairy calves are altered by maternal supply of methionine during late pregnancy.</a></h1><p>Maternal supply of methyl donors such as methionine (Met) during late pregnancy can affect offspring growth and development. The objective was to investigate the effect of postruminal Met supply during late pregnancy on 1-carbon, Met cycle, and transsulfuration pathways in the calf liver. During the last 28 d of pregnancy, cows were individually fed a control diet or the control diet plus rumen-protected dl-Met (MET; 0.09% dry matter intake). Liver samples obtained from calves (n = 14/group) at 4, 14, 28, and 50 d of age were used for metabolomics, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity analyses. Genes associated with 1-carbon metabolism, DNA methylation, and the cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine-choline pathway were analyzed via real-time PCR. Activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, cystathionine β-synthase, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) was analyzed using C isotopes. Data were analyzed using a mixed model that included the fixed effects of maternal treatment, day, and their interaction, and the random effect was calf within maternal diet. Calves born to dams offered MET tended to have greater birth body weight and had overall greater body weight during the first 9 wk of life. However, no differences were detected for daily feed intake and average daily gain between groups. Concentrations of betaine and choline, reflecting Met cycle activity, at d 14 through 28 were greater in MET calves. Transsulfuration pathway intermediates also were altered in MET calves, with concentrations of cysteine sulfinic  and hypotaurine (d 4 and 14) and taurine being greater (d 4, 14, 28, and 50). Despite the lack of differences in daily feed intake, the greater concentrations of the tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates fumarate and glutamate along with NAD/NADH in MET calves indicated enhanced rates of energy metabolism. Although activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was greater in MET calves at d 14, cystathionine β-synthase was lower and increased at d 14 and 28, where it was greater compared with the control diet. Activity of MTR was lower at d 4 and 50 in MET calves. Among gene targets measured, MET calves had greater overall expression of MTR, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and choline kinase α and β. An interaction of maternal diet by time was detected for mRNA abundance of DNA methyltransferase 3α (involved in de novo methylation) due to greater values at d 4 and 14 in MET calves. Overall, the data indicate that enhanced postruminal supply of Met to cows during late pregnancy may program hepatic metabolism of the calf in the context of maintaining Met homeostasis, phosphatidylcholine and taurine synthesis, DNA methylation, and energy metabolism. These alterations potentially result in better efficiency of nutrient use, hence conferring the calf a physiologic advantage during a period of rapid growth and development.

Although CHI3L1 is described as a biomarker of inflammation, the function of this protein is not completely understood. In the present study, we examined the regulation of CHI3L1 in primary human skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, we analysed potential autocrine effects of CHI3L1. We show that myotubes express CHI3L1 in a differentiation-dependent manner. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines up-regulate CHI3L1 expression (6-fold) and release (3-fold). Importantly, CHI3L1 treatment blocked TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α)-induced inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) activation in skeletal muscle cells. We show that this effect is mediated via PAR2 (protease-activated receptor 2). In addition, CHI3L1 treatment diminished the TNFα-induced expression and secretion of IL (interleukin)-8, MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) and IL-6. In addition, impaired insulin action at the level of Akt and GSK3α/β (glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β) phosphoryl-ation and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was normalized by CHI3L1. In conclusion, the novel myokine CHI3L1, which is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, can counteract TNFα-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle cells, potentially involving an auto- and/or para-crine mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605780>Gossypol inhibits 5α-reductase 1 and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase: Its possible use for the treatment of prostate cancer.</a></h1><p>Gossypol is a yellow polyphenol isolated from cotton seeds. It has the antitumor activity and it is being tested to treat prostate cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. The present study investigated the inhibitory effects of gossypol acetate on rat 5α-reductase 1, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and retinol dehydrogenase 2 for androgen . Rat 5α-reductase 1, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and retinol dehydrogenase 2 were expressed in COS-1 cells. Immature Leydig cells that contain these enzymes were isolated from 35-day-old male Sprague Dawley rats. The potency and mode of action of gossypol acetate to inhibit these enzymes in both enzyme-expressed preparations and immature Leydig cells were examined. Molecular docking study of gossypol on the crystal structure of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was performed. Gossypol acetate inhibited 5α-reductase 1 and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with IC values of 3.33 ± 0.07 and 0.52 ± 0.06 × 10 M in the expressed enzymes as well as 8.512 ± 0.079 and 1.032 ± 0.068 × 10 M in intact rat immature Leydig cells, respectively. Gossypol acetate inhibited rat 5α-reductase 1 in a noncompetitive mode and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in a mixed mode when steroid substrates were supplied. Gossypol acetate weakly inhibited retinol dehydrogenase 2 with IC value over 1 × 10 M. Molecular docking analysis showed that gossypol partially bound to the steroid-binding site of the crystal structure of rat 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Gossypol acetate is a potent inhibitor of rat 5α-reductase 1 and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, possibly inhibiting the formation of androgen in the prostate cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Successful therapy with NMDA receptor antagonists in humans has been limited by the severe side effects of complete receptor blockade. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible protective effects of tideglusib against NMDA receptor overactivation in neural stem cells.We measured the alteration in membrane integrity, free radical generation, intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)/mitochondrial morphology and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (α/β isoforms and phospho-GSK-3α/β) protein expression levels following treatments.NMDA treatment, with or without d-serine, significantly increased LDH leakage and triggered cell death in neural stem cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and intracellular Ca(2+) levels were increased following NMDA receptor overactivation. The significant reduction in MMP was found in NMDA/d-serine-treated cells. Tideglusib significantly decreased ROS production and membrane degradation, but did not change intracellular Ca(2+) levels following NMDA receptor activation. Both in the presence or in the absence of NMDA/d-serine, tideglusib increased MMP and the levels of phospho-GSK-3β in NSCs. Moreover, GW9662 (a peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist) treatment significantly inhibited the protective effect of tideglusib in NMDA/d-serine-treated cells.Our study provides the evidence that GSK-3β and PPARγ may be directly involved in  leading to NMDA receptor-induced cell death and that the inhibitors including tideglusib may exert neuroprotective effect against these receptor overactivation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

The pathophysiological role of allopregnanolone in neuropsychiatric disorders has been highlighted in several investigations. The changes in neuroactive steroid levels are detected in stress and stress-related disorders including anxiety, panic and depression. The changes in allopregnanolone in response to acute stressor tend to restore the homeostasis by dampening the hyper-activated HPA axis. However, long standing stressors leading to development of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety are associated with decrease in the allopregnanolone levels. GABAA receptor complex has been considered as the primary target of allopregnanolone and majority of its inhibitory actions are mediated through GABA potentiation or direct activation of GABA currents. The role of progesterone receptors in producing the late actions of allopregnanolone particularly in lordosis facilitation has also been described. Moreover, recent studies have also described the involvement of other multiple targets including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate, dopamine, opioids, oxytocin, and calcium channels.

The potencies of PFASs to inhibit SRD5A1 are PFOS > PFOA > PFHxS = PFBS, with IC values of PFOS and PFOA of 1.92 ± 0.07 and 14.24 ± 0.07 μM and no effects for PFHxS and PFBS at 100 μM, respectively. The potencies of PFASs to inhibit AKR1C9 and RoDH2 are PFOS > PFOA > PFHxS = PFBS, with IC values of PFOS and PFOA on these two enzymes about 100 μM and no effects for PFHxS and PFBS at 100 μM, respectively.

The metabolic products generated by some of these intestinal bacteria have been linked to a number of systemic diseases including  with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, some forms of inflammation, and more recently, systemic hypertension. In this review, we primarily focus on the potential role selected gut bacteria play in metabolizing the endogenous glucocorticoids corticosterone and cortisol. Those generated steroid metabolites, when reabsorbed in the intestine back into the circulation, produce biological effects most notably as inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) types 1 and 2. Inhibition of the dehydrogenase actions of 11β-HSD, particularly in kidney and vascular tissue, allows both corticosterone and cortisol the ability to bind to and activate mineralocorticoid receptors with attended changes in sodium handling and vascular resistance leading to increases in blood pressure. In several animal models of hypertension, administration of gut-cleansing antibiotics results in transient resolution of hypertension and transfer of intestinal contents from a hypertensive animal to a normotensive animal produces hypertension in the recipient. Moreover, fecal samples from hypertensive humans transplanted into germ-free mice resulted in hypertension in the recipient mice. Thus, it appears that the intestinal microbiome may not just be an innocent bystander but certain perturbations in the type and number of bacteria may directly or indirectly affect hypertension and other diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603760>Induction of secondary  of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 in the batch bioreactor cultures.</a></h1><p>Cultivation of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 in a stirred tank bioreactor was performed to induce the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and provide the bioprocess-related insights into the  capabilities of the investigated strain. The activation of biosynthetic routes was attempted by the diversification of process conditions and growth media. Several strategies were tested, including the addition of rapeseed oil or inulin, changing the concentration of nitrogen source, reduction of chlorine supply, cultivation under saline conditions, and using various aeration schemes. Fifteen secondary metabolites were identified in the course of the study by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, namely mevinolinic , 4a,5-dihydromevinolinic , 3α-hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin L , terrein, aspulvinone E, dihydroisoflavipucine, (+)-geodin, (+)-bisdechlorogeodin, (+)-erdin, asterric , butyrolactone I, desmethylsulochrin, questin, sulochrin, and demethylasterric . The study also presents the collection of mass spectra that can serve as a resource for future experiments. The growth in a salt-rich environment turned out to be strongly inhibitory for secondary  and the formation of dense and compact pellets was observed. Generally, the addition of inulin, reducing the oxygen supply, and increasing the content of nitrogen source did not enhance the production of examined molecules. The most successful strategy involved the addition of rapeseed oil to the chlorine-deficient medium. Under these conditions, the highest levels of butyrolactone I, asterric , and mevinolinic  were achieved and the presence of desmethylsulochrin and (+)-bisdechlorogeodin was detected in the broth. The constant and relatively high aeration rate in the idiophase was shown to be beneficial for terrein and (+)-geodin biosynthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29617190>Bile  oxidation by Eggerthella lenta strains C592 and DSM 2243.</a></h1><p>Strains of Eggerthella lenta are capable of oxidation-reduction reactions capable of oxidizing and epimerizing bile  hydroxyl groups. Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile  metabolism are further metabolized by other members of the gut microbiota. We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile . Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile  and iso-bile  metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to lithocholic  (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic  (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic ) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an  conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile  oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed. These results suggest that E. lenta is an important bile  metabolizing gut microbe and that the gas atmosphere may be an important and overlooked regulator of bile  metabolism in the gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23717450>The catalytic roles of P185 and T188 and substrate-binding loop flexibility in 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase from Comamonas testosteroni.</a></h1><p>3α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase from Comamonas testosteroni reversibly catalyzes the oxidation of androsterone with NAD(+) to form androstanedione and NADH. Structurally the substrate-binding loop of the residues, T188-K208, is unresolved, while binding with NAD(+) causes the appearance of T188-P191 in the binary complex. This study determines the functional roles of the flexible substrate-binding loop in conformational changes and enzyme catalysis. A stopped-flow study reveals that the rate-limiting step in the reaction is the release of the NADH. The mutation at P185 in the hinge region and T188 in the loop causes a significant increase in the Kd value for NADH by fluorescence titration. A kinetic study of the mutants of P185A, P185G, T188A and T188S shows an increase in k(cat), K(androsterone) and K(iNAD) and equal primary isotope effects of (D)V and (D) (V/K). Therefore, these mutants increase the dissociation of the nucleotide cofactor, thereby increasing the rate of release of the product and producing the rate-limiting step in the hydride transfer. Simulated molecular modeling gives results that are consistent with the conformational change in the substrate-binding loop after NAD(+) binding. These results indicate that P185, T188 and the flexible substrate-binding loop are involved in binding with the nucleotide cofactor and with androsterone and are also involved in catalysis.</p></html>
