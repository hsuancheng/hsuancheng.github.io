Though significant progress has been made in unraveling the pathophysiology of the disease, the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and its subsequent inhibition by environmental and genetic factors in NAFLD pathophysiology remains unclear. The present report tests the hypothesis that an exogenous PP2A inhibitor leads to hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis via an NADPH oxidase  (NOX2)-dependent pathway in NAFLD. Results showed that microcystin (MC) administration, a potent PP2A inhibitor found in environmental exposure, led to an exacerbation of NAFLD pathology with increased  immunoreactivity, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and stellate cell activation, a process that was attenuated in mice that lacked the  gene and miR21 knockout mice. Mechanistically, leptin-primed immortalized Kupffer cells (a mimicked model for an NAFLD condition) treated with apocynin or nitrone spin trap 5,5 dimethyl-1- pyrroline -oxide (DMPO) had significantly decreased  and decreased miR21 and α-smooth muscle actin levels, suggesting the role of NOX2-dependent reactive oxygen species in miR21-induced Kupffer cell activation and stellate cell pathology. Furthermore, NOX2-dependent peroxynitrite generation was primarily responsible for cellular events observed following MC exposure since incubation with phenylboronic acid attenuated miR21 levels, Kupffer cell activation, and inflammatory cytokine release. Furthermore, blocking of the AKT pathway attenuated PP2A inhibitor-induced NOX2 activation and miR21 upregulation. Taken together, we show that PP2A may have protective roles, and its inhibition exacerbates NAFLD pathology via activating NOX2-dependent peroxynitrite generation, thus increasing miR21-induced pathology. Protein phosphatase 2A inhibition causes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () progression via NADPH oxidase .

Despite the significant morbidity associated with NAFLD, there are no global consensus guidelines to screen for liver fibrosis in patients considered high risk, including patients older than 50 years with type  diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Multiple therapies are currently being investigated and may soon receive regulatory approval for use in the clinic. It is suggested that patients at high risk for NAFLD be screened in the outpatient setting. This article aims to supply primary care providers (PCPs) with the knowledge and tools needed to properly evaluate a patient at high risk of developing significant liver disease from . A tripartite algorithm is described to help PCPs identify patients with NAFLD using liver enzymes and abdominal ultrasound, assess the presence of advanced liver fibrosis using clinical prediction rules, and, if appropriate, determine when to refer patients to specialist care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292843>Long-term luseogliflozin therapy improves histological activity of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis accompanied by type  diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>A 60-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital for further examination of persistent liver dysfunction. She had been suffering from type  diabetes mellitus since the age of 50 years. Her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value was as high as 7.8% despite treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, metformin, and sulfonylurea. After excluding viral hepatitis, alcohol or drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune liver diseases, liver histology evidence of macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and pericellular fibrosis confirmed a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). Luseogliflozin (.5 mg/day), a sodium-glucose cotransporter  inhibitor (SGLT2I), was co-administered to strengthen glycemic control. Liver enzymes and HbA1c gradually improved without any adverse events. A second liver biopsy at 15 months after luseogliflozin commencement revealed improvements in steatosis, fibrosis, and overall histological activity score. This case demonstrates that long-term luseogliflozin may be a good therapeutic option for diabetic NAFLD/ patients. The merits of persistent SGLT2I administration for NAFLD/ patients warrant validation in future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31436362>Plasma N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen accurately predicts liver fibrosis severity in children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>We examined the diagnostic performance of plasma N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) levels, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score for predicting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and liver fibrosis stage in children/adolescents with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).We enrolled 204 children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD at the "Bambino Gesù" Children's Hospital. We measured plasma PIIINP levels using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and calculated APRI and FIB-4 scores using standard methods.Children with  had higher plasma PIIINP levels, APRI and FIB-4 scores compared with those without  (all P < .001). However, PIIINP levels had much better diagnostic performance and accuracy than APRI and FIB-4 scores for predicting liver fibrosis stage. PIIINP levels correlated with the total NAFLD activity score (NAS) and its constituent components (P < .0001). The risk of either  or F ≥  fibrosis progressively increased with increasing PIIINP levels (P < .0001), independent of age, gender, adiposity measures, insulin resistance, NAS score and the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein-3 rs738409 polymorphism. For every 3.6 ng/mL increase in PIIINP levels, the likelihood of having F ≥  fibrosis increased by ~14-fold (adjusted-odds ratio 14.1, 95% CI 5.50-35.8, P < .0001) after adjustment for the aforementioned risk factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.921 (95% CI 0.87-0.97) for F ≥  fibrosis, and 0.993 (95% CI 0.98-1.0) for F3 fibrosis respectively.Unlike APRI and FIB-4 scores, plasma PIIINP levels are a promising, non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing liver fibrosis stage in children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Withaferin A (WA), extracted from the ayurvedic medicine , has a wide range of pharmacological activities; however, little is known about its effects on . To explore the role of WA in treating , two well defined  models were used, the methionine-choline-deficient diet and the 40 kcal% high-fat diet (HFD). In both  models, WA treatment or control vehicle was administered to evaluate its hepatoprotective effects. As assessed by biochemical and histologic analyses, WA prevented and therapeutically improved liver injury in both models, as revealed by lower serum aminotransaminases, hepatic steatosis, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. In the HFD-induced  model, both elevated serum ceramides and increased hepatic oxidative stress were decreased in the WA-treated group compared with the control vehicle-treated group. To further explore whether WA has an anti- effect independent of its known action in leptin signaling associated with obesity, leptin signaling-deficient ob/ob mice maintained on an HFD were used to induce .

Obesity is a risk factor for cancers; however, the role of NAFLD in this association is unknown. We investigated the effect of NAFLD versus obesity on incident cancers.We identified all incident cases of NAFLD in a US population between 1997-2016. Individuals with NAFLD were matched by age and sex to referent individuals from the same population (1:3) on the index diagnosis date. We ascertained the incidence of cancer after index date until death, loss to follow-up or study end. NAFLD and cancer were defined using a code-based algorithm with high validity and tested by medical record review. The association between NAFLD or obesity and cancer risk was examined using Poisson regression.A total of 4,722 individuals with NAFLD (median age 54, 46% male) and 14,441 age- and sex-matched referent individuals were followed for a median of 8 (range 1-21) years, during which ,224 incident cancers occurred. NAFLD was associated with 90% higher risk of malignancy: incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.9 (95% CI 1.3-.7). The highest risk increase was noted in liver cancer, IRR = .8 (95% CI 1.6-5.1), followed by uterine IRR = .3 (95% CI 1.4-4.1), stomach IRR = .3 (95% CI 1.3-4.1), pancreas IRR = .0 (95% CI 1.-3.3) and colon cancer IRR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-.8). In reference to non-obese controls, NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of incident cancers (IRR = .0, 95% CI 1.5-.9), while obesity alone was not (IRR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8-1.4).NAFLD was associated with increased cancer risk, particularity of gastrointestinal types. In the absence of NAFLD, the association between obesity and cancer risk is small, suggesting that NAFLD may be a mediator of the obesity-cancer association.We studied the incidence of malignancies in a community cohort of adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in reference to age- and sex-matched adults without NAFLD. After 21 years of longitudinal follow-up, NAFLD was associated with a nearly -fold increase in the risk of developing cancers, predominantly of the liver, gastrointestinal tract and uterus. The association with increased cancer risk was stronger in NAFLD than obesity.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Study participants are contacted every 6 months (in between annual surveys) for a brief survey on HIV testing, HIV diagnosis, and PrEP use (ie, attempts to access, PrEP initiation, and PrEP discontinuation). Participants complete annual self-administered at-home HIV testing and Web-based surveys. Using baseline serologic data and self-reported HIV testing history, we reconstructed a cohort of persons who were HIV negative at 12 months before baseline to estimate HIV incidence leading up to cohort enrollment.The study sample included 8777 participants from all 50 US states, Puerto Rico, and Guam; 50.91% (4468/8777) were persons of color and 25.30% (2221/8777) were young individuals aged 16 to 24 years. Per eligibility criteria, all T5K participants reported having sex with > male partners in the 90 days before enrollment, self-reported not having been diagnosed with HIV, and were not actively taking PrEP. In addition, 79.39% (6968/8777) reported > insertive condomless anal sex (CAS) acts, 61.02% (5356/8777) reported >1 receptive CAS acts in the past 90 days. Furthermore, most (7525/8777, 85.74%) reported never having taken PrEP. In total, 70.25% (6166/8777) were sent a self-administered at-home HIV test kit and 82.29% (5074/6166) of those sent a kit returned a sample for testing. The HIV incidence rate during the 12-month period leading up to enrollment was estimated to be .41 (95% CI .02-.90) per 100 person-years.A large, national, and racially diverse fully Web-based cohort of HIV-negative men, transmen, and transwomen at high risk for HIV seroconversion has successfully been recruited into longitudinal follow-up. This cohort is at high risk for HIV acquisition and can provide important insights related to the real-world uptake, impact, and equity of HIV prevention interventions in the United States.

Our objective was to define the quantitative evolution of hepatocyte-derived, macrophage-derived, neutrophil-derived, and platelet-derived EVs in male and female mice with dietary . Fluorescently labeled antibodies and a nanoscale flow cytometer were used to detect plasma levels of EVs. Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1) and cytochrome P450 family  subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1) are markers of hepatocyte-derived EVs; galectin 3 is a marker of macrophage-derived EVs; common epitope on lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G/C1 (Ly-6G and Ly-6C) is a marker of neutrophil-derived EVs; and clusters of differentiation 61 (CD61) is a marker of platelet-derived EVs. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) was calculated using hematoxylin and eosin-stained liver sections, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for measurement of the fat fraction and elastography. Hepatocyte-derived EVs increased in both male and female mice at 12 and 10 weeks of feeding, respectively, and remained elevated at 24 weeks in both male and female mice and at 48 weeks in male mice and 36 weeks in female mice.

Hepatic or serum biochemical analysis showed that MSCS differentially modulated hepatic injury in  milieu, depending on exposure time points. Consistently, -related hepatocellular apoptosis and fibrosis were increased in the early exposure group, but decreased in the late exposure group, except for steatosis. Ex vivo experiments showed that CS extract differentially regulated inflammatory responses in co-cultured hepatocytes and macrophages isolated from steatohepatitic livers after 10 days or 3 weeks of diet feeding. Furthermore, CS differentially up- and down-regulated the expression levels of M1/M2 polarization markers and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in livers (29% and 38%, respectively) or co-cultured macrophages ( and .5 fold, respectively). Collectively, our findings indicate that opposite effects of MSCS on  progression are mediated by differential modulation of PPARγ and its-associated M1/M2 polarization in hepatic macrophages, depending on exposure time points.Copyright © 2019.

NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. As obesity, diabetes, and other lifestyle-related diseases continue to rise, the spectrum of NAFLD, e.g., nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, liver-related morbidity, and mortality, will increase in parallel. Its widespread prevalence and associated economic burden have drawn significant attention, and a multitude of pharmaceutical companies are participating in active research trying to find a "cure". Unfortunately, as of now, no targeted treatment exists to treat this condition, and therefore, emphasis has been on its prevention. The current review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of NAFLD in Western countries. It is important to understand the magnitude of NAFLD and its risk factors in Western countries where the prevalence of NAFLD has now reached epidemic proportions to identify the best strategy to prevent and possibly control this epidemic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308995>Modeling the impacts of agricultural best management practices on runoff, sediment, and crop yield in an agriculture-pasture intensive watershed.</a></h1><p>Best management practices (BMPs) are commonly used to reduce sediment loadings. In this study, we modeled the Fort Cobb Reservoir watershed located in southwestern Oklahoma, USA using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and evaluated the impacts of five agricultural BMP scenarios on surface runoff, sediment yield, and crop yield. The hydrological model, with 43 sub-basins and 15,217 hydrological response units, was calibrated (1991-2000) and validated (2001-2010) against the monthly observations of streamflow, sediment grab samples, and crop-yields. The coefficient of determination ( ), -Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) and percentage bias (PB) were used to determine model performance with satisfactory values of   (0.64 and 0.79) and NS (0.61 and 0.62) in the calibration and validation period respectively for streamflow. We found that contouring practice reduced surface runoff by more than 18% in both conservation tillage and no-till practices for all crops used in this modeling study. In addition, contour farming with either conservation tillage or no-till practice reduced sediment yield by almost half. Compared to the conservation tillage practice, no-till practice decreased sediment yield by 25.3% and 9.0% for cotton and grain sorghum, respectively. Using wheat as cover crop for grain sorghum generated the lowest runoff followed by its rotation with canola and cotton regardless of contouring. Converting all the crops in the watershed into Bermuda grass resulted in significant reduction in sediment yield (72.5-96.3%) and surface runoff (6.8-38.5%). The model can be used to provide useful information for stakeholders to prioritize ecologically sound and feasible BMPs at fields that are capable of reducing sediment yield while increasing crop yield.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559605>Non-obese histologically confirmed  patients with abnormal liver biochemistry have more advanced fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) commonly affects subjects with obesity, yet non-obese NAFLD is increasingly being recognized. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological and genetic characteristics of non-obese NAFLD patients.The clinical, histological and genetic data of 84 NAFLD patients with biopsy for abnormal liver function test were reviewed. Both NAS-CRN and SAF scoring systems were applied for histopathological evaluation. PNPLA3 and TMS6F2 genotyping were also performed.All of the 84 patients were histologically diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), with 36 of them (42.9%) being non-obese (BMI < 25 kg/m). Compared with the obese group, non-obese group were predominantly females (88.9% vs 52.1%, p < 0.001), tended to have higher prevalence of diabetes (p = 0.068). More importantly non-obese patients had a significant higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) (58.3% vs 29.%, p = 0.013), and a trend of higher degree of ballooning (p = 0.061). In addition, values of liver stiffness measurement were also significantly higher in non-obese group (12.1 kPa vs 8.1 kPa, p = 0.032). There was also a trend of higher prevalence of TM6SF2 T allele in non-obese group (p = 0.085), while the prevalence of PNPLA3 risk allele did not differ between two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that higher fasting glucose (p = 0.038) and lower serum platelets (p = 0.040) were two independent predictors for advanced fibrosis in non-obese patients.Non-obese  patients have a female predominance and more advanced fibrosis.

It is highly prevalent and is associated with significant adverse outcomes both through liver-specific morbidity and mortality, but perhaps more importantly, through adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. It is tightly associated with type  diabetes and obesity and both of these conditions drive progressive disease towards the more advanced stages. The mechanisms that govern hepatic lipid accumulation and the predisposition to inflammation and fibrosis are still not fully understood, but reflect a complex interplay between metabolic target tissues including adipose and skeletal muscle, and immune and inflammatory cells.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Accumulating evidence, however, demonstrates that many of these factors, such as BMP- and -4, as well as GDF15, also regulate lipid metabolism. GDF10 is a divergent member of the TGFβ superfamily with a unique structure and is abundantly expressed in brain and adipose tissue; it is also secreted by the latter into the circulation. Although previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of GDF10 reduces adiposity in mice, the role of circulating GDF10 on other tissues known to regulate lipid, like the liver, has not yet been examined.Accordingly, GDF10 mice and age-matched GDF10 control mice were fed either normal control diet (NCD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and examined for changes in liver lipid homeostasis. Additional studies were also carried out in primary and immortalized human hepatocytes treated with recombinant human (rh)GDF10.Here, we show that circulating GDF10 levels are increased in conditions of diet-induced hepatic steatosis and, in turn, that secreted GDF10 can prevent excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. We also report that GDF10 mice develop an obese phenotype as well as increased liver triglyceride accumulation when fed a NCD. Furthermore, HFD-fed GDF10 mice develop increased steatosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, fibrosis, and injury of the liver compared to HFD-fed GDF10 mice. To explain these observations, studies in cultured hepatocytes led to the observation that GDF10 attenuates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activity; a transcription factor known to induce de novo lipogenesis.Our work delineates a hepatoprotective role of GDF10 as an adipokine capable of regulating hepatic lipid levels by blocking de novo lipogenesis to protect against ER stress and liver injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this work, we provide compelling evidence that the pH dependent shift in the Hupd peak on Pt surfaces is driven by the structure of interfacial water rather than the specific adsorption of cations on the electrode surface. Combined cyclic voltammetric and surface enhanced spectroscopic investigations using an organic cation and crown-ether chelated alkali metal cations show that specific adsorption of metal and organic cations on the Pt surface at the conditions relevant to the HOR/HER is unlikely. The vibrational band corresponding to strongly bound water is monitored when the electrode potential is varied in the Hupd range in both acid and base. By varying the electrode potential on the absolute and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale simultaneously and only on the RHE scale while maintaining the absolute potential, we deconvolute the impact of two mechanisms through which the interfacial water structure is impacted: 1) hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed Hupd, and ) electronic interaction with the electrode surface at different absolute potentials. While the hydrogen bonding between Hupd and interfacial water is identified as the primary mode of interaction, the direct water-electrode interaction, which depends on the absolute electrode potential, likely hold the key to understanding the pH induced Hupd peak shift on the Pt surface. Thus, engineering the interfacial water structure could be a fruitful direction in the design of HOR/HER catalysts operating in alkaline media.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Ascorbic acid (AA), also known as vitamin C, an excellent antioxidant, has been shown to exert beneficial effects on NAFLD; however, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the role of AA on cell stress in tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)‑treated HepG2 cells was investigated. Our findings revealed that exposure to AA effectively ameliorated TNFα‑induced cell stresses, including hypoxia, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by reducing the expression of Hif1α and its target genes (glucose transporter 1), pro‑inflammatory genes (monocyte chemoattractant 1) and ER stress‑related genes (glucose‑regulated protein, 78 kDa). AA also decreased the protein level of HIF1α. Additionally, AA significantly increased the secretion of total adiponectin and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin. Mechanistically, AA was determined to increase the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor  (FGFR2). Knockdown of FGFR2 not only decreased the levels of total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin, but almost abolished the beneficial effects of AA in ameliorating cell stress. Collectively, the findings of our study demonstrated that AA may attenuate hepatocyte stress induced by TNFα via activation of the FGF21/FGFR2/adiponectin pathway.

Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate IPTS clinical utility in a high-risk sample of suicidal adolescent inpatients. We assessed whether constructs of the IPTS (1) are associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) on admission to a psychiatric hospitalization, and () prospectively predict suicide attempt (SA) or psychiatric rehospitalization 90 days after discharge. On admission, adolescent patients self-reported recent STBs, perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness (TB), and depression. Parents reported their child's rehospitalization and suicide attempts 90 days after discharge. Generalized linear regression modelling was used to determine how key constructs of the IPTS are associated with STBs prior to admission and whether they prospectively predict SA or rehospitalization 90 days after discharge. IPTS constructs did not predict rehospitalization or SA within 90 days of discharge. Although PB and TB interacted to associate with prehospitalization SI frequency, and PB, TB and NSSI interacted to associate with prehospitalization SA, the nature of these interactions were not as the IPTS predicts. IPTS constructs are relevant proximal predictors of prehospitalization STB in adolescents, but may operate differently than in adults.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the more active form of NAFLD with active hepatic necroinflammation and faster fibrosis progression, has become one of the leading indications for liver transplantation and an important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in Western countries. Epidemiological studies suggest that NAFLD is almost equally prevalent in Asia as in the West, but severe liver complications appear to be less common. In this article, we review the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, risk factors and clinical outcomes of NAFLD in Asia. We highlight the issue of NAFLD in the nonobese population and discuss whether it is a unique phenomenon in Asia. Because of the rapidly changing epidemiology and natural history, future studies should continue to monitor the magnitude of NAFLD in Asia and define the best policy to control this new epidemic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415032>Incidence and Risks for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Steatohepatitis Post-liver Transplant: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>The true incidence and unique risk factors for recurrent and de novo nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () post-liver transplant (LT) remain poorly characterized. We aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for recurrent and de novo NAFLD/ post-LT.MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched for studies from 2000 to 2018. Risk of bias was adjudicated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Seventeen studies representing 2378 patients were included. All were retrospective analyses of patients with post-LT liver biopsies, with the exception of  studies that used imaging for outcome assessment. Seven studies evaluated occurrence of recurrent NAFLD/, 3 evaluated de novo occurrence, and 7 evaluated both recurrent and de novo. In studies at generally high or moderate risk of bias, mean 1-, 3-, and ≥5-year incidence rates may be 59%, 57%, and 82% for recurrent NAFLD; 67%, 40%, and 78% for de novo NAFLD; 53%, 57.4%, and 38% for recurrent ; and 13%, 16%, and 17% for de novo . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that post-LT body mass index (summarized odds ratio = 1.27) and hyperlipidemia were the most consistent predictors of outcomes.There is low confidence in the incidence of recurrent and de novo NAFLD and  after LT due to study heterogeneity.

Good understanding of the transport system and hydrological processes in the dam is very crucial to its sustainability. Under optimal functionality, the Shiroro dam in Northern Nigeria can generate ∼600 MW, which is ideally sufficient to power about 404,000 household. Unfortunately, there have not been reliable monitoring measures to assess yield in the upstream, where sediments are sourced into the dam. In this study, we applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict the hydrological processes, the sediment transport mechanism and sediment yield between 1990 and 2018 in Kaduna watershed (32,124 km) located upstream of the dam. The model was calibrated and validated using observed flow and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) data. Performance evaluation of the model was achieved statistically using -Sutcliffe (NS), coefficient of determination (r) and percentage of observed data (p-factor). SWAT model evaluation using NS (0.71), r (0.80) and p-factors of 0.86 suggests that the model performed satisfactorily for streamflow and sediment yield predictions. The model identified the threshold depth of water (GWQMN.gw) and base flow (ALPHA_BF.gw) as the most sensitive parameters for streamflow and sediment yield estimation in the watershed. Our finding showed that an estimated suspended sediment yield of about 84.1 t/ha/yr was deposited within the period under study. Basins 67, 71 and 62 have erosion prone area with the highest sediment values of 79.4, 75.1 and 73.8 t/h respectively. Best management practice is highly recommended for the dam sustainability, because of the proximity of erosion-prone basins to the dam.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576191>Modeling of runoff water and runoff pesticide concentrations in upland bare soil using improved SPEC model.</a></h1><p>The SPEC model (Predicted Environmental Concentrations in agricultural Soils) was developed and improved for the simulation of pesticide runoff.

We hypothesized that the hepatoprotective anti-inflammatory benefits of catechin-rich green tea extract (GTE) would protect against HCC progression by inhibiting -associated liver injury and pro-oncogenic responses. We used an HCC model in high-fat (HF)-fed mice that mimics early oncogenic events during  without inducing tumorigenesis and premature mortality.

Mice were administered saline or diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 60 mg kg-1, i.p.) at 5-weeks and 7-weeks of age. , inflammation, fibrosis, and oncogenic responses were assessed at 25-weeks of age. Saline-treated mice showed prominent histopathological signs of steatosis and hepatocellular ballooning. Although DEN did not impact adiposity, steatosis, ballooning and hepatic lipid accumulation, these parameters were attenuated by GTE regardless of DEN. Hepatic lipid peroxidation and fibrosis that were increased by DEN were attenuated by GTE. Hepatic TLR4, MCP1 and TNFα mRNA levels were unaffected by DEN, whereas iNOS was increased by DEN. These transcripts were lowered by GTE. GTE attenuated the frequency of PCNA+ hepatocytes and mRNA expression of cyclin D1, MIB1 and Ki-67 that were otherwise increased by DEN. GTE increase APAF1 mRNA that was otherwise lowered by DEN. Relative to saline-treated mice, DEN increased mRNA levels of oncostatin M, gp130, c-Fos, c-Myc and survivin; each was lowered by GTE in DEN-treated mice. These findings indicate that GTE may protect against hepatic oncogenesis by limiting early steps in the carcinogenic cascade related to -associated HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604965>Depletion of CD40 on CD11c cells worsens the metabolic syndrome and ameliorates hepatic inflammation during .</a></h1><p>The co-stimulatory CD40-CD40L dyad plays a central role in fine-tuning immune reactions, including obesity-induced inflammation.

Changes to active and passive transport across epithelia during chilling likely drive the collapse of ion gradients, metabolic imbalance and potentially oxidative stress. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata transcriptomic evidence provides support for these responses at the level of gene expression, but variable expression profiles between life stages in M. rotundata indicate that different mechanisms could be responsible for repairing and protecting against chill injuries across development. Herein, we test the hypotheses that 1) chill injury leads to oxidative stress and damage in insects and ) exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) promotes an increased oxidative stress response leading to a decrease in damage by reactive oxygen species. We measured the expression of transcripts with products known to have antioxidant properties in overwintering prepupae as well as total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation during both extended overwintering in prepupae and low temperature stress during pupal development. We observed differential gene expression for the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase and several transcripts with putative antioxidant properties including vitellogenin, apolipoprotein D, glutathione S-transferase, and nuclear protein 1. However, the expression of transcripts coding for other enzymatic antioxidants did not change between treatments. Neither life stage varied in their capacity to cope with an induced oxidative stress after FTR exposure and we did not observe evidence of lipid peroxidation in chill injured (STR) prepupae. These results did not support our initial hypotheses and indicate that oxidative-stress-induced damage is neither a causal factor or symptom of chill injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Large variation was observed in implementation approaches, and the main trial result showed no mortality reduction. Our objective therefore was to evaluate whether trial participation led to care pathway implementation and to study the relationship between care pathway implementation and use of six recommended implementation strategies.We performed a hospital-level time-series analysis using data from the Enhanced Peri-Operative Care for High-risk patients trial. Care pathway implementation was defined as achievement of >80% median reliability in 10 measured care processes. Mean monthly process performance was plotted on run charts. Process improvement was defined as an observed run chart signal, using probability-based 'shift' and 'runs' rules. A new median performance level was calculated after an observed signal.Of 93 participating hospitals, 80 provided sufficient data for analysis, generating 800 process measure charts from 20 305 patient admissions over 27 months. No hospital reliably implemented all 10 processes. Overall, only 279 of the 800 processes were improved (3 (-5) per hospital) and 14/80 hospitals improved more than six processes. Mortality risk documented (57/80 (71%)), lactate measurement (42/80 (53%)) and cardiac output guided fluid therapy (32/80 (40%)) were most frequently improved. Consultant-led decision making (14/80 (18%)), consultant review before surgery (17/80 (21%)) and time to surgery (14/80 (18%)) were least frequently improved. In hospitals using ≥5 implementation strategies, 9/30 (30%) hospitals improved ≥6 care processes compared with 0/11 hospitals using ≤ implementation strategies.Only a small number of hospitals improved more than half of the measured care processes, more often when at least five of six implementation strategies were used. In a longer term project, this understanding may have allowed us to adapt the intervention to be effective in more hospitals.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty acid with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty acid metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced , and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in  patients as compared to the controls and non- patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of .

While upper-body Moderate Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) improves cardiorespiratory fitness, its effects on cardiometabolic component risks in adults with SCI appear relatively modest. The aim of this study is to assess the acute effects of Continuous Resistance Training (CRT), High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), MICT and rest (CON) on fasting and postprandial systemic biomarkers and substrate utilisation.Eleven healthy, chronic SCI (> 1 year, ASIA A-C) men will be recruited. Following preliminary testing, each will complete four experimental conditions, where they will report to the laboratory following an ~ 10-h overnight fast. A venous blood sample will be drawn and expired gases collected to estimate resting metabolic rate (RMR). In order to ensure an isocaloric exercise challenge, each will complete CRT first, with the remaining three conditions presented in randomised order: (1) CRT, ~ 45 min of resistance manoeuvres (weight lifting) interspersed with low-resistance, high-speed arm-crank exercise; () CON, seated rest; (3) MICT, ~ 45 min constant arm-crank exercise at a resistance equivalent to 30-40% peak power output (PPO) and; (4) HIIT, ~ 35 min arm-crank exercise with the resistance alternating every  min between 10% PPO and 70% PPO. After each ~ 45-min condition, participants will ingest a 2510-kJ liquid test meal (35% fat, 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein). Venous blood and expired gas samples will be collected at the end of exercise and at regular intervals for 120 min post meal.This study should establish the acute effects of different forms of exercise on fasting and postprandial responses in chronic SCI male patients.

Most times it is an unrecognized comorbidity to the primary care provider and endocrinologist. Today it is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries. It is characterized by insulin resistance and hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the absence of co-existing etiologies, such as excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, medications or other etiologies for hepatic steatosis. Its more severe form of the disease with steatohepatitis () is associated with hepatocyte injury (necrosis and inflammation) and frequently with fibrosis. Although it appears to be an indolent condition, with few symptoms and often normal plasma aminotransferases,  is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2DM. The pathogenesis of  remains poorly understood, and likely to be multifactorial, but insulin-resistant adipose tissue plays an important role. The natural history of NAFLD is incompletely understood, but risk factors for disease progression include weight gain, obesity and T2DM, as well as the severity of fibrosis stage at diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithms are evolving but we offer an approach that integrates for the non-hepatologist plasma biomarkers, imaging, and the role of liver biopsy for the management of these complex patients. At the present time, early screening -with biomarker panels or a liver ultrasound, ideally with transient elastography- is reserved for high-risk patients (i.e., obese patients with T2DM or elevated plasma AST/ALT levels or evidence of steatosis at a random liver exam) until more accurate non-invasive methods are available. A liver biopsy should be considered on a case-by-case basis, to identify those at risk of -cirrhosis, working in close collaboration with a hepatologist. Treatment should include a comprehensive approach with lifestyle modification and therapeutic agents tested in RCTs, such as vitamin E (in patients without diabetes) or pioglitazone for patients with or without diabetes. Pioglitazone, given its low-cost as a generic medication, long-standing track record of efficacy in , and cardiometabolic benefits, is likely to be for  what metformin has become for the management of T2DM. However, proper patient selection and close monitoring is needed. In addition, a number of new pharmacological agents are being studied in phase II/III trials and future management will involve the use of combination therapy, as for other chronic metabolic conditions. In summary, endocrinologists need to be aware of the severe metabolic and liver-specific complications of  and establish early-on a long-term management plan. Screening will likely take place in the same way as for diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. A better understanding of its natural history and pathogenesis of , combined with improved diagnostic and treatment options, will likely place endocrinologists at the forefront of the management efforts to prevent end-stage liver disease in patients with .

Understanding prevalence and predictors of  with advanced fibrosis is critical for healthcare resource planning. Using a large U.S. clinical laboratory database from 10/1/2017-9/30/2018, adults negative for hepatitis B and hepatitis C and after excluding for alcoholic liver disease and pregnancy were evaluated for prevalence of F3 and F4 fibrosis using a systematic algorithm of five fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) criteria: Criteria 1 (≥F3: >.67), Criteria  (.67<F3≤4.12 and F4>4.12), Criteria 3 (.67<F3≤3.15, F4>3.15), Criteria 4 (3.25<F3≤3.5, F4>3.5), Criteria 5 (3.25<F3≤4.12, F4>4.12). Metabolic co-morbidities evaluated included decreased high density lipoprotein (<40 mg/dL men, <50 mg/dL women), high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), elevated hemoglobin A1C (≥6.5%). Parallel analyses of patients with specific NAFLD/ ICD-9/10 codes from 10/1/2013-9/30/2018 were performed. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated for predictors of ≥F3 fibrosis. Among patients with NAFLD/ ICD-9/10 codes, ≥F3 prevalence ranged from 4.35% - 6.90%, and F4 prevalence ranged from .52%- 3.67%. Increasing metabolic co-morbidities was associated with higher risk of ≥F3 fibrosis. Compared to  patients without metabolic co-morbidities,  with four concurrent metabolic co-morbidities had higher risk of ≥F3 (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.40-1.73, p<0.001). In summary, prevalence of  with advanced fibrosis among U.S. adults was as high as 6.90% and prevalence of  with cirrhosis was as high as 3.67%, representing 5.18 million and .75 million, respectively, when using an estimate of 75 million U.S. adults with NAFLD.

RC tears are common in individuals older than 60 years and the repair of these tears is amongst the most prevalent of orthopedic procedures. However, most current models of this injury are established in young animals, which may not accurately recapitulate the clinical condition. In this study, we used a murine model of massive RC tears to evaluate age-related muscle degeneration following chronic injury. The expression of the fibro-adipogenic genes encoding collagen type III and leptin was higher in aged RC compared with matched injured young tissue at  weeks post-injury, and development of fibrosis was accelerated in aged mice within 5 days post-injury. Furthermore, the synthesis of collagens type I and III and fat tissue accumulation were significantly higher in injured RCs of aged mice. Similar frequency of fibro-adipogenic PDGFRβ PDGFRα progenitor cells was measured in non-injured RC of aged and young mice, but PDGFRβ PDGFRα cells contributed to significantly larger fibrotic lesions in aged RCs within  weeks post-injury, implying a more robust fibrotic environment in the aged injured muscle. Altogether, these findings demonstrate age-dependent differences in RC response to chronic injury with a more profound fibro-adipogenic change in aged muscles. Clinically, cell therapies for muscular pathologies should not only consider the cell type being transplanted but also the recipient milieu into which these cells are seeded. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in obesity. The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in obesity, thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and  of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of .

Trachoma impact surveys (TIS) were conducted in all districts between 2010 and 2015, following 3-5 years of intervention with the WHO-recommended SAFE (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement) strategy. A multistage cluster random sampling design was used to estimate the district-level prevalence of trachoma. In total, 1,887 clusters in 152 districts were surveyed, from which 208,265 individuals from 66,089 households were examined for clinical signs of trachoma. The regional prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) and trachomatous inflammation-intense among children aged 1-9 years was 25.9% (95% CI: 24.9-26.9) and 5.5% (95% CI: 5.-6.0), respectively. The prevalence of trachomatous scarring and trachomatous trichiasis among adults aged ≥ 15 years was 12.9% (95% CI: 12.-13.6) and 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.1), respectively. Among children aged 1-9 years, 76.5% (95% CI: 75.3-77.7) presented with a clean face; 66.% (95% CI: 64.1-68.) of households had access to water within 30 minutes round trip, 48.1% (95% CI: 45.5-50.6) used an improved water source, and 46.% (95% CI: 44.8-47.5) had evidence of a used latrine. Nine districts had a prevalence of TF below the elimination threshold of 5%.

However, the exact mechanisms of NAFLD pathophysiology remain poorly understood including its progression to the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). New advances for early detection and monitoring of  progression are limited due to the lack of specific blood biomarkers, thus requiring invasive liver biopsies for histopathology. Herein, multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS/MS) is validated as a high throughput, robust, and quantitative platform for targeted analysis of a panel of 16 serum γ-glutamyl dipeptides from a cohort of  adult patients from Japan (median age = 53 years, median BMI = 27 kg/m,  = 116). Multiplexed separations based on MSI-CE-MS/MS enable the design of unique data workflows that rely on customizable serial sample injection formats for accurate determination of γ-glutamyl dipeptides with quality control. Also, the introduction of a liquid coolant device to the capillary outlet improves long-term migration time stability in CE. Unsupervised pattern recognition methods revealed two distinctive  subgroups based on their contrasting γ-glutamyl dipeptide status despite patients having similar clinical phenotypes and  activity scores (median NAS ≈ 6.0). There was an inverse correlation between serum γ-glutamyl dipeptide concentrations and γ-glutamyltransferease (GGT) enzyme activity ( = -0.46;  = .5 × 10), which was indicative of a low-risk ( = 64) as compared to a high-risk ( = 52) patient subgroup with impaired glutathione salvage pathway and likely poor clinical prognosis.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests non-polio enteroviruses (EVs) are a potential etiology, yet EV RNA is rarely detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF from children with AFM (n = 42) and other pediatric neurologic disease controls (n = 58) were investigated for intrathecal antiviral antibodies, using a phage display library expressing 481,966 overlapping peptides derived from all known vertebrate and arboviruses (VirScan). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of AFM CSF RNA (n = 20 cases) was also performed, both unbiased sequencing and with targeted enrichment for EVs. Using VirScan, the viral family significantly enriched by the CSF of AFM cases relative to controls was Picornaviridae, with the most enriched Picornaviridae peptides belonging to the genus Enterovirus (n = 29/42 cases versus 4/58 controls). EV VP1 ELISA confirmed this finding (n = 22/26 cases versus 7/50 controls). mNGS did not detect additional EV RNA.

Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high-fat diet, develop severe . Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse liver revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the liver cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher lipid content was present in postnatal day  (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, and fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways. Hence, we propose that FSP1cre- mice, which accumulate lipids in their liver in early life, may represent a useful animal model to study juvenile NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406003>A Pan-Cyclophilin Inhibitor, CRV431, Decreases Fibrosis and Tumor Development in Chronic Liver Disease Models.</a></h1><p>Previous studies show that cyclophilins contribute to many pathologic processes, and cyclophilin inhibitors demonstrate therapeutic activities in many experimental models. However, no drug with cyclophilin inhibition as the primary mode of action has advanced completely through clinical development to market. In this study, we present findings on the cyclophilin inhibitor, CRV431, that highlight its potential as a drug candidate for chronic liver diseases. CRV431 was found to potently inhibit all cyclophilin isoforms tested-A, B, D, and G. Inhibitory constant or IC values ranged from 1 to 7 nM, which was up to 13 times more potent than the parent compound, cyclosporine A (CsA), from which CRV431 was derived. Other CRV431 advantages over CsA as a nontransplant drug candidate were significantly diminished immunosuppressive activity, less drug transporter inhibition, and reduced cytotoxicity potential. Oral dosing to mice and rats led to good blood exposures and a 5- to 15-fold accumulation of CRV431 in liver compared with blood concentrations across a wide range of CRV431 dosing levels. Most importantly, CRV431 decreased liver fibrosis in a 6-week carbon tetrachloride model and in a mouse model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Additionally, CRV431 administration during a late, oncogenic stage of the  disease model resulted in a 50% reduction in the number and size of liver tumors. These findings are consistent with CRV431 targeting fibrosis and cancer through multiple, cyclophilin-mediated mechanisms and support the development of CRV431 as a safe and effective drug candidate for liver diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cyclophilin inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic activities in many disease models, but no drug candidates have yet advanced completely through development to market. In this study, CRV431 is shown to potently inhibit multiple cyclophilin isoforms, possess several optimized pharmacological properties, and decrease liver fibrosis and tumors in mouse models of chronic liver disease, which highlights its potential to be the first approved drug primarily targeting cyclophilin isomerases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563894>A head-to-head comparison of the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab and adalimumab in biological-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis: 24-week results of a randomised, open-label, blinded-assessor trial.</a></h1><p>To compare efficacy and safety of ixekizumab (IXE) to adalimumab (ADA) in biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naïve patients with both active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and skin disease and inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARDs).Patients with active PsA were randomised (1:1) to approved dosing of IXE or ADA in an open-label, head-to-head, blinded assessor clinical trial.

NAFLD covers a spectrum that ranges from simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with varying degrees of fibrosis, to cirrhosis, which is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle and eating habit changes during the last century have made NAFLD the most common liver disease linked to obesity, type  diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, with a global prevalence of 25%. NAFLD arises when the uptake of fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides (TG) from circulation and de novo lipogenesis saturate the rate of FA β-oxidation and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG export. Deranged lipid metabolism is also associated with NAFLD progression from steatosis to , and therefore, alterations in liver and serum lipidomic signatures are good indicators of the disease's development and progression. This review focuses on the importance of the classification of NAFLD patients into different subtypes, corresponding to the main alteration(s) in the major pathways that regulate FA homeostasis leading, in each case, to the initiation and progression of .

A subset of this population exhibits an aggressive histological phenotype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with ≥ stage  fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis. The definition of NAFLD excludes excessive alcohol intake, which is well known to cause alcoholic liver disease and will not be discussed here. Most NAFLD clinical trials use ~14 drinks per week as the cutoff for excessive alcohol intake. Alcohol consumption below this threshold, which we define as moderate alcohol consumption, is common in the US. According to the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 56% of the US adult population consume alcohol, but only 8.% report drinking heavily and 18.3% report binge drinking. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidance of 2018 states that there are insufficient data to make a recommendation with regard to moderate alcohol consumption in patients with NAFLD, citing a lack of longitudinal studies that examine the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on disease progression and its extrahepatic harms versus benefits, specifically in individuals with established NAFLD. NAFLD prevalence studies have generally noted a negative correlation between modest alcohol consumption and NAFLD. However, prevalence studies have limited application to patients with established NAFLD who present to the clinic. There can also be many confounding factors, because modest alcohol consumption is also negatively associated with some NAFLD risk factors, and those risk factors may not be adequately adjusted for in analyses. The prevalence of  with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) is more important because this is the group that is believed to have progressive disease. Thus, cohort studies of disease progression are more important from the patient's standpoint. Because these patients have already developed NAFLD or , their interest lies in their odds of disease progression if they have moderate alcohol consumption compared to abstinence. It is also noteworthy that cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death among patients with NAFLD. Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduction in overall mortality, but mostly in cardiovascular mortality. However, this protective effect has not been demonstrated specifically in patients with NAFLD.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/ cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty acid synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in oleic acid-treated HuS-E/ cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

However, the relationship between LAL activity and liver fibrosis has never been investigated.Cross-sectional study including 575 outpatients referred for the management of cardio-metabolic and liver disease. The absence of liver fibrosis was defined by a FIB-4 < 1.30 and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) <-1.455. LAL activity was measured with dried blood spot technique.Overall, 515 patients had a diagnosis of NAFLD (454 NAFL and 61 biopsy-proven ) and 60 of CC. The value of LAL activity progressively decreased from healthy subjects to NAFL/ patients to CC (P < .001). LAL activity was reduced by 10% in patients with NAFL, by 20% in  and by 50% in CC. The prevalence of CC decreased across the tertiles of LAL activity: 22.% in the lowest, 4.6% in the intermediate and 0.5% in the highest tertile. In NAFLD patients, 69.9% had a FIB4 < 1.30, and 43.1% a NFS <-1.455. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Log (LAL activity) was associated with FIB-4 < 1.30 (Odds ratio [OR] .19 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-3.62, P = .002) and NFS < -1.455 (OR .43, 95% CI 1.51-3.91, P < .001) after adjustment for confounding factors.We found a progressive reduction of LAL activity according to liver disease severity.

We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino-acid defined (CDAA) diets with increasing fat content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive weight loss, irrespective of fat content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose weight and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary fat in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the lipid metabolism genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60% fat (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High fat supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks.

Such a simple modification of the MPS effectively enhanced the total nitrogen (TN) removal rate from 59.% to 71.4% and the total phosphorus (TP) removal rate from 37.1% to 51.0%. It was identified that the EFBs mainly contributed to enhanced TN removal by the biomass growth in the stereo-elastic packing and attachment on the surface of ceramsite particles packed in the floating mat, while the FB filled with zeolites contributed to both TP adsorption and biological TN removal to certain extent, as indicated by the denitrification rate and adsorption function experimentally obtained for each part of the bed settings. The superposition effect of the installation of EFBs and FBs was estimated using a tank-in-series model. With a -Sutcliffe efficiency higher than 0.75, calculation results of the model well fitted field measurements and showed that the EFBs (including plant uptake) contributed to the increase of TN and TP removal by 23.3% and 8.12%, respectively, and that contributed by FBs were 19.6% and 10.7%, respectively.Copyright © 2019.

To this end, we performed analytical and clinical validation on a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines implicated hepatic inflammation; IL-6, CRP, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1β, eotaxin, VCAM-1. Biomarker assays were validated for accuracy and precision. Clinical performance was evaluated in a random sample of 52 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD/. Patients were categorized into three groups according to their fibrosis stage; advanced (F3-F4), mild (F1-) and no (F0) fibrosis. Serum IL-6 was increased in patients with advanced fibrosis (.71 pg/mL; 1.26 pg/mL; 1.39 pg/mL p<0.01) compared to patients with mild or no fibrosis respectively. While, there was no significant difference noted in CRP, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1β, eotaxin among the three groups, VCAM-1 levels were increased by 55% (p<0.01) and 40% (p<0.05) in the advanced cohort compared to the mild and no fibrosis groups respectively. VCAM-1 also displayed good clinical performance as a biomarker of advanced fibrosis with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.87.

This study aimed to characterise current management and outcomes following malignant small bowel obstruction.A prospective, multicentre cohort study of patients with small bowel obstruction who presented to UK hospitals between 16th January and 13th March 2017. Patients who presented with small bowel obstruction due to primary tumours of the intestine (excluding left-sided colonic tumours) or disseminated intra-abdominal malignancy were included. Outcomes included 30-day mortality and in-hospital complications. Cox-proportional hazards models were used to generate adjusted effects estimates, which are presented as hazard ratios (HR) alongside the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The threshold for statistical significance was set at the level of P ≤ 0.05 a-priori.205 patients with malignant small bowel obstruction presented to emergency surgery services during the study period. Of these patients, 50 had obstruction due to right sided colon cancer, 143 due to disseminated intraabdominal malignancy, 10 had primary tumours of the small bowel and  patients had gastrointestinal stromal tumours. In total 100 out of 205 patients underwent a surgical intervention for obstruction. 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 11.3% for those with primary tumours and 19.6% for those with disseminated malignancy. Severe risk of malnutrition was an independent predictor for poor mortality in this cohort (adjusted HR 16.18, 95% CI 1.86 to 140.84, p = 0.012). Patients with right-sided colon cancer had high rates of morbidity.Mortality rates were high in patients with disseminated malignancy and in those with right sided colon cancer.

The fatty liver index (FLI), a non-invasive steatosis biomarker, has recently drawn attention for its clinical prognostic value, although its capacity to predict mortality risk in HIV-HCV co-infected patients has never been investigated. Using a Cox proportional hazards model for mortality from all causes, with data from the French ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort (983 patients; 4,432 visits), we tested whether elevated FLI (≥60) was associated with all-cause mortality.After multiple adjustment, individuals with FLI≥60 had almost double the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.91 [1.17-3.12], p = 0.009), independently of the following factors: HCV cure (0.21 [0.07-0.61], p=0.004), advanced fibrosis (1.77 [1.00-3.14], p=0.05), history of hepatocellular carcinoma and/or liver transplantation (7.74 [3.82-15.69], p<10 ), history of indirect clinical signs of cirrhosis (.80 [1.22-6.41], p=0.015), and HIV CDC clinical stage C (.88 [1.74-4.79], p<10 ).An elevated fatty liver index (FLI≥60) is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in HIV-HCV co-infected patients independently of liver fibrosis and HCV cure. In the present era of nearly 100% HCV cure rates thanks to direct-acting antivirals, these findings encourage the more systematic use of non-invasive steatosis biomarkers to help identify co-infected patients with higher mortality risk.

A total of 206 participants were randomized to SBA (as-needed beclomethasone 80 μg with rescue short-acting β-agonist) or provider-based guideline-directed adjustment (PBA): maintenance beclomethasone 80 μg/d (6-11 years old), 160 μg/d (12-17 years old), with subsequent guideline-based dose adjustment by PCPs. PCPs implemented both treatment assignments, with outcomes measured by blinded staff. All participants received symptom recognition and albuterol use education from peer educators. Primary outcome was change in asthma control (measured by Asthma Control Test [ACT]/childhood ACT [cACT]) over 12 months.Participants had adequately controlled asthma (mean ACT or cACT score = 21.6 ± .8) at baseline. After 1 year, there was no significant between-group difference in change in ACT scores (SBA - PBA): ACT: -0.88 (95% CI, -.19 to 0.42), cACT: -0.73 (-.09 to 0.62), or combined ACT and cACT (P = .10), and was within the predefined statistical clinical equivalence. The proportion with an exacerbation and measures of lung function were similar between groups. Compared with PBA, SBA led to less beclomethasone use (SBA: 526 μg/mo [95% CI, 412-639 μg] vs PBA: 1961 μg/mo [95% CI, 1681-2241]; P < .0001). More parents in the SBA arm felt they were managing their child's asthma.SBA in African-American children with mild asthma was similar to PBA in asthma control and events when implemented by PCPs with lower inhaled corticosteroid exposure.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The Gore® Acuseal graft is an early-cannulation graft, needled before incorporation and thus may be especially prone to pseudoaneurysm formation. In addition, as this is a relatively new product, there are limited data on long-term outcomes such as pseudoaneurysm. We report one center's experience of the incidence, and etiological factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation over 5 years and 265 grafts.265 Acuseal grafts were placed in the last 5 years. All patients had prospective data entered into an electronic searchable patient record. Surveillance was performed with 3 monthly imaging (DSA or ultrasound), clinical examination and hemodynamic performance. Data examined included the incidence, causative factors and outcomes for pseudoaneurysm.11 grafts (4.15%) developed a pseudoaneurysm, with  patients developing significant hemorrhage. The median time to development of a pseudoaneurysm was 25 months (IQR 20-28 months). Several common etiological factors were identified. All but one patient had over-use of needling sites (n=10; 90.9%). Other factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation were inadequate surveillance (n=9; 81.8%); venous outflow stenosis (n=9; 81.8%) and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy (n=7; 63.6%). Management included observation and needle rotation (n=5, 45.5%); stent-grafting (n=3; 27.3%), or excision (n=1; 9.1%) of the pseudoaneurysm. Surgical or endovascular augmentation of the venous outflow was required in 9 patients (81.8%). Graft ligation and explantation was required in 5 patients (45.5%) with graft preservation achieved in 6/11 patients (54.5%).Pseudoaneurysm formation occurs less frequently in Acuseal grafts compared with historical data for standard PTFE grafts. Pseudoaneurysm formation did not occur in any graft within the first 13 months following implantation; suggesting early-cannulation prior to incorporation is not in itself a risk factor for pseudoaneurysm development. Poor needling, venous stenosis, inadequate surveillance and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy are remediable factors, and graft preservation is possible. Acuseal is a robust graft with lower rates of pseudoaneurysm formation on long-term follow up than standard PTFE grafts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of silymarin in patients with  remains inconclusive due to the substantial number of patients who entered the study but did not meet entry histological criteria, the lack of a statistically significant improvement in NAS of silymarin treated patients, and the unanticipated effect of placebo on fibrosis indicate the need for additional clinical trials.

Of note, none of the panels or biomarkers was able to outperform plasma ALT (AUC 0.78 [95% CI 0.71-0.84]). Performance was better to diagnose advanced fibrosis, in which plasma PRO-C3, AST, and APRI showed better results than the other approaches (AUC 0.90 [0.85-0.95]; 0.85 [0.80-0.91]; and 0.86 [0.80-0.91]; respectively). Again, none of the approaches did significantly better than plasma AST. Sequential use of plasma AST and other noninvasive tests may help in limiting the number of liver biopsies required to detect patients with advanced fibrosis.Performance of noninvasive clinical models/scores and plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of  or advanced fibrosis was suboptimal in patients with T2DM.

However, the role of NE in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () remained unclear. Wild type (WT) and NE knockout (NE KO) mice were fed with western diet (WD) for 24 weeks to establish  model. The severity of liver injury in  mice was assessed by biochemical analysis, liver triglyceride (TG) quantitation and histological scoring. The gene and protein expression was detected by quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining (IHC/IF) and western blot analysis. After 24 weeks, WD induced WT (WD-WT) mice had significantly up-regulated NE protein in the liver. Moreover, body weight, liver/body weight, serum and hepatic TG, liver histological score, and hepatic inflammatory factors expression were significantly higher in WD-WT mice than those in low fat diet (LFD) induced WT mice, and these effects were markedly improved by NE KO. In addition, we found incereased expression of ceramides and serine palmitoyltransferase subunit  (SPT2) in WD-WT mice could be reversed by NE KO. Up-regulating expression of ceramides and SPT2 by active NE treatment was also found in mice primary hepatocytes. Collectively, these findings indicated that NE KO ameliorated WD induced , and this beneficial effect was due, at least in part, to the potential of NE in regulating hepatic ceramides metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The water balance model (WBM) uses standard meteorological parameters as input variables and runs on a daily time step. It consists of two modules. The aboveground module (1) comprises routines for fog precipitation generation, precipitation interception and snowfall/snowmelt dynamics. Covered belowground processes () are bypass flow, percolation, soil evaporation and transpiration, where the latter two processes are considered separately. Preceding to the WBM, a routine is introduced, specifying the intra-annual foliage dynamics of beech. Emphasis is also laid on the inter-annual variation of beech phenology. Leaf sprouting and leaf senescence are calculated as functions of day-length and air temperature. The WBM was applied to four European beech dominated forest stands in the northeastern part of Austria. They are located on a gradient of declining annual precipitation (from west to east). The two easterly sites are located close to the (dry) limit of the natural distribution of beech. Records of soil moisture were used for the adjustment of 26 parameters. On all sites the calibration process (simulated annealing) delivered good predictions of soil moisture (-Sutcliffe efficiency≥ 0.925). Then, the obtained parameterization was used to apply different scenarios of global warming. The temperature was increased step-wisely up to 4 °C. All scenarios were run (1) with present phenological conditions and () with phenology responding to higher temperatures. This way, we wanted to assign the effect of higher temperatures and longer growing seasons on the water dynamics of the forest stands. A warming of 1 °C corresponded roughly to an elongation of the growing season of 4.5 days, where the start of the growing season was affected more strongly than the end. Apparently, higher temperatures led to drier soils. The strongest change was observed in early summer, also amplified by an earlier start of the growing season. Rising temperatures led to lower export fluxes of liquid water, simultaneously increasing evapotranspiration (ET). The gain in ET was almost entirely assignable to increased soil evaporation. Drier soils led to a sharp depression of transpiration during summer months. This decline was compensated by the effect of elongated growing seasons. The risk of severe drought was increased by higher temperatures, but here the contribution of growing season length was negligible. Drier soils seem to hamper the stands' productivity. For all warming scenarios, the estimated increase of the gross primary production, caused by longer periods of assimilation, is nullified by the effect of soil water deficit in mid-summer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293912>Practical Use of Transient Elastography in Screening for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in a Japanese Population.</a></h1><p> Fatty infiltration of liver may induce insulin resistance (IR), and a proportion of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Transient elastography is gaining popularity as a means of non-invasively determining both liver stiffness (fibrosis level) and degree of fatty infiltration, expressed as controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) value.  The aims of this study were to investigate the association between IR and level of fatty liver, and to identify the group at a greater risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis using transient elastography and other noninvasive fibrosis markers. A total of 169 patients without chronic hepatitis B and C were analyzed.  The CAP value was significantly associated with IR (HOMA-IR ≥.5; AUROC = 0.81), and the optimal cut-off to discriminate IR was 264 dB/m. The liver stiffness measurement and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index values were significantly higher for CAP ≥264 than in CAP <264. The 9 patients among the overall 169 patients (5.3%) and among the 102 NAFLD patients (8.8%) who showed ≥264 dB and ≥7.0 kPa in transient elastography could represent good candidates for liver biopsy.  Evaluation of NAFLD based on CAP values was useful in diagnosing IR.

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced .

Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins.  markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced , at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467216>Late Upper Paleolithic occupation at Cooper's Ferry, Idaho, USA, ~16,000 years ago.</a></h1><p>Radiocarbon dating of the earliest occupational phases at the Cooper's Ferry site in western Idaho indicates that people repeatedly occupied the Columbia River basin, starting between 16,560 and 15,280 calibrated years before the present (cal yr B.P.).

Restoration of NO levels by nitrite have been associated with favorable metabolic effects in T2D. Moreover, HS can potentiate the effects of NO in the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of long-term co-administration of sodium nitrite and sodium hydrosulfide () on carbohydrate metabolism in type  diabetic rats.T2D was induced using chronic high fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with low dose streptozotocin (STZ) regimen. Rats were divided into 5 groups (N = 10/group): Control, T2D, T2D + nitrite, T2D + , and T2D + nitrite + . Nitrite (50 mg/L in drinking water) and  (0.28 mg/kg, daily i. p. injection) were administered for 9 weeks. Fasting serum glucose, insulin, lipid profile, liver function tests, and oxidative stress indices were measured. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed at the end of the eighth week, and three days later, intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) was done. Protein levels and mRNA expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in soleus muscle and epididymal adipose tissue as well as mRNA expression of HS-producing enzymes in the liver, soleus muscle, and epididymal adipose tissue were measured at the end of the study.Compared to the controls, HFD and STZ treated rats developed metabolic dysfunction. Nitrite treatment improved carbohydrate metabolism, liver function, and oxidative stress indices whereas  treatment per se had no significant effects. However, co-administration of  and nitrite resulted in further improvement in serum insulin level, GTT, PTT, liver function, oxidative stress, protein level and mRNA expression of GLUT4, as well as mRNA expression of HS-producing enzymes in diabetic rats.Low dose of  per se had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism while it potentiated the favorable metabolic effects of inorganic nitrite in type  diabetic rats. These favorable effects were associated with decreased oxidative stress and increased GLUT4 expression in insulin-sensitive tissues as well as improvement of liver function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, determining the prevalence and the population risk factors of steatosis may assist in risk stratification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of steatosis and steatohepatitis among livers from adults who died due to non-burn trauma.Specimens were collected from 224 adults undergoing autopsy at a regional autopsy referral center from September 2011 to April 2013. Histopathological examination was performed on six samples obtained from different lobes of each liver. The outcomes of interest were the presence of steatosis, steatohepatitis,  inflammation and  fibrosis. The main predictors were body mass index, abdominal circumference, liver weight and volume, presence of cholelithiasis, and siderosis. Our modeling strategy made use of a series of generalized linear models with a binomial family.Our sample had a mean age of 40 years; steatosis was diagnosed in 48.% of cases, and steatohepatitis was diagnosed in .7%. The presence of a high proportion of fatty changes was more prevalent among males and older individuals, with the most affected age group being 41-60 years. When evaluating the crude odds ratio for steatosis, the factors significantly associated with an increased risk of steatosis were greater abdominal circumference, BMI, and liver weight and the presence of siderosis.Our study reinforces the role of older age, obesity and hepatomegaly as predictors of fatty liver disease. These variables should be considered in the assessment of fatty changes in the livers of potential liver donors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600750>Rodent Models of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a continuous diseases spectrum associated with obesity, type  diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and few effective therapeutic approaches are available. Summary and Key Messages: A myriad of different rodent models has been developed to elucidate pathophysiology of NAFLD/ and guide therapeutic strategy. To date, no single rodent model can display the whole disease spectrum and metabolic features associated with human , but can imitate particular characteristics. In this paper, we review the most commonly used dietary, genetic, and chemical rodent models for NAFLD referring to their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we illustrate the status of latest treatment strategy using various NAFLD rodent models. We hope to provide critical guidance for researchers to select appropriate animal models.© 2019 S.

These patients pose new challenges to hepatologists given their older age and higher frequency of coexisting metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes compared with other etiologies of liver disease. Patients with  cirrhosis are at higher risk for renal and cardiovascular disease, and the presence of these extrahepatic comorbidities has a significant impact on outcomes and survival. This review outlines how  cirrhosis differs from other etiologies of cirrhosis including natural history, noninvasive assessment, and the challenges in the management of the complications of cirrhosis including hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nutritional assessment and the impact of sarcopenic obesity and frailty in this population, and strategies to address the latter, are discussed.

Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43. ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x Insulin/22.5), OGTT glucose and insulin profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle insulin sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x insulin [AUC]) during OGTT, insulin response as (insulin [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in . During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of insulin response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was derived from the linear exponential DWI model. Mean diffusion (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK) were derived from the quadratic exponential model of DKI.

AHR targets of the latter function are PARPs/ARTs and CD38 that are regulating glucose and lipid metabolism via NAD-dependent sirtuins. Deregulation of these pathways may facilitate obesity and age-dependent pathologies. The present commentary is focused on AHR and CD38 signaling in liver. CD38 is functioning as ectoNADase and Ca mobilizing enzyme in endoplasmic reticulum and endolysosomal membranes. Deregulation of TCDD-activated AHR and CD38 may facilitate hepatic steatosis and inflammation. However, these proteins are also involved in protection against inflammation and CD38-mediated age-related decreased NAD levels that may be responsible for neurodegeneration. Further knowledge about the complexity of these pathways is needed to avoid pathologies. Therapeutic modulation of AHR and CD38 remains a challenging task.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) did not differ between groups and reflected low exertion. Absolute energy costs for bionic ambulation and nonbionic ambulation were not different between groups despite a 565% higher ambulation velocity in controls and 3.3× higher kilocalorie per meter in SCI. Fuel partitioning was similar between groups and the same within groups for carbohydrate and fat oxidation. Nonsignificant (9%) lowering of the area under a glucose tolerance curve following bionic ambulation required 20% less insulin than at rest.Work intensity during prolonged bionic ambulation for this bionic exoskeleton is below a threshold for cardiorespiratory conditioning but above seated rest and passive standing. Bionic ambulation metabolism is consistent with low RPE and unchanged fuel partitioning from seated rest. Bionic ambulation did not promote beneficial effects on glycemia in well-conditioned, euglycemic participants.

Clinical insights can be derived from analyzing both. The use of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to effectively analyze unstructured data has been well demonstrated. Here we examine the utility of NLP for the identification of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, assess patterns of disease progression, and identify gaps in care related to breakdown in communication among providers.All clinical notes available on the 38,575 patients enrolled in the Mount Sinai BioMe cohort were loaded into the NLP system. We compared analysis of structured and unstructured EHR data using NLP, free-text search, and diagnostic codes with validation against expert adjudication. We then used the NLP findings to measure physician impression of progression from early-stage NAFLD to  or cirrhosis. Similarly, we used the same NLP findings to identify mentions of NAFLD in radiology reports that did not persist into clinical notes.Out of 38,575 patients, we identified ,281 patients with NAFLD. From the remainder, 10,653 patients with similar data density were selected as a control group. NLP outperformed ICD and text search in both sensitivity (NLP: 0.93, ICD: 0.28, text search: 0.81) and F2 score (NLP: 0.92, ICD: 0.34, text search: 0.81). Of 2281 NAFLD patients, 673 (29.5%) were believed to have progressed to  or cirrhosis. Among 176 where NAFLD was noted prior to , the average progression time was 410 days. 619 (27.1%) NAFLD patients had it documented only in radiology notes and not acknowledged in other forms of clinical documentation. Of these, 170 (28.4%) were later identified as having likely developed  or cirrhosis after a median 1057.3 days.NLP-based approaches were more accurate at identifying NAFLD within the EHR than ICD/text search-based approaches. Suspected NAFLD on imaging is often not acknowledged in subsequent clinical documentation. Many such patients are later found to have more advanced liver disease. Analysis of information flows demonstrated loss of key information that could have been used to help prevent the progression of early NAFLD (NAFL) to  or cirrhosis.For identification of NAFLD, NLP performed better than alternative selection modalities. It then facilitated analysis of knowledge flow between physician and enabled the identification of breakdowns where key information was lost that could have slowed or prevented later disease progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Iron did not affect excess hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mice on FF, and FF did not affect iron accumulation compared to normal chow. Mice on low iron are protected from worsening of markers for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), including serum transaminases and fibrotic gene transcript levels.

It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

NAFLD can lead to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), liver cirrhosis, liver cell failure, and liver malignancy.The present work aims to prospectively study the histological changes that occur in NAFLD obese patients 1-year post-laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) based on standardized NAS (NAFLD activity score).This prospective study included 94 obese patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Intraoperative wedge liver biopsy was taken from all patients with a follow-up liver biopsy at 12 months after the operation.LSG produced a marked reduction in body weight with a mean reduction in BMI from 44.54 + 5.45 to 34.23 + .66 kg/m at 12 months. There were statistically highly significant improvements regarding metabolic comorbidities, blood pressure, lipid profile, and HbA1C at 12-month post-LSG (P < 0.001). The current study showed a highly statistically significant improvement at 1-year post LSG regarding steatosis grade, hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation as well as fibrosis stage (P < 0.001). Moreover, the present study showed that NAS score significantly decreased from 5.20 + 1.96 at baseline to .63 + 1.55 at 1-year follow-up (P < 0.001).Our relatively large patient cohort shows a significant improvement of steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis at a 1-year follow-up.

The main outcome was overall patient survival and cox proportional hazard models were used to ascertain predictors of survival.There were 2552 patients identified. The median age of diagnosis was 57 (interquartile range: 49-65) and 52.3% of patients were female. The 5-year survival for Stage I disease was 91.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.%-95.7%), for Stage II disease was 90.5% (95% CI: 85.8%-93.7%), for Stage III disease was 57.0% (95% CI: 45.0%-67.3%), and for Stage IV disease was 18.9% (95% CI: 9.3%-31.0%).

After baseline surveys demonstrated that Sudan was endemic for trachoma, the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) Trachoma Control Program conducted trachoma prevention and treatment interventions in endemic localities. The Sudan FMOH conducted population-based trachoma prevalence surveys between September 2016 and April 2017 in seven localities across five states of Sudan to document current trachoma prevalence estimates and measure water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators. Children aged 1-9 years were examined for five clinical signs of trachoma, and participants of all ages were examined for trachomatous trichiasis (TT). A household questionnaire was administered to gather demographic and WASH-related information. The prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1-9 years ranged from 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-1.1%) to 6.4% (95% CI: 3.3-11.9%). Trachomatous trichiasis in those aged 15 years and older ranged from 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0-0.6%) to a high of 4.4% (95% CI: .1-9.1%). Of seven localities surveyed, four localities had achieved the elimination threshold of less than 5% TF in children aged 1-9 years. Six localities still required interventions to achieve less than 0.% TT in those aged 15 years and older. The presence of latrine ranged from a low of 10.8% (95% CI: 5.-21.1%) to 88.4% (CI: 81.5-93.0%) and clean face among children ranged between 69.5% (95% CI: 63.5-75.0%) and 87.5% (95% CI: 81.-91.9%).

The current qualitative and quantitative analyses aimed to ascertain the efficacy of vitamin E on clinical outcomes of patients with NAFLD. A systematic search of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed using databases (PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCOhost and Ovid) from inception to July 2018. Trials meeting the inclusion criteria were subjected to quality assessment using the Jadad Scoring. All trials meeting the prerequisites information for meta-analysis were subjected to quantitative synthesis of results. Nine RCTs (five in adults and four in children) were included. Four of the five RCTs on adults demonstrated significant improvements in alanine transaminase and other liver function surrogates in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, only one of the four RCTs conducted on children showed significant improvements in liver functions with the use of vitamin E. Although quantitative synthesis of available data revealed insignificant differences between vitamin E and placebo, still the use of vitamin E improves the level of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase by -1.96 and -0.59, with heterogeneity of I=67% and I=0%, respectively. Adjuvant vitamin E therapy provides significant biochemical and histological improvements in adult patients with NAFLD, while paediatric patients showed insignificant efficacy compared with placebo. Lifestyle interventions along with vitamin E can provide much better results. Data, including the impact of vitamin E on hepatic histology, are still lacking. Moreover, the short duration of trials limits the conclusion on the safety and efficacy of proposed treatments.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Herein we report the design of a new multifunctional MOL, Hf-Ir-Ni, by laterally linking Hf secondary building units (SBUs) with photosensitizing Ir(DBB)[dF(CF)ppy] [DBB-Ir-F, DBB = 4,4'-di(4-benzoato)-,'-bipyridine; dF(CF)ppy = -(,4-difluorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine] bridging ligands and vertically terminating the SBUs with catalytic Ni(MBA)Cl [MBA = -(4'-methyl-[,'-bipyridin]-4-yl)acetate] capping agents. Hf-Ir-Ni was synthesized in a bottom-up approach and characterized by TEM, AFM, PXRD, TGA, NMR, ICP-MS, UV-vis, and luminescence spectroscopy. The proximity between photosensitizing Ir centers and catalytic Ni centers (∼0.85 nm) in Hf-Ir-Ni facilitates single electron transfer, leading to a 15-fold increase in photoredox reactivity. Hf-Ir-Ni was highly effective in catalytic C-S, C-O, and C-C cross-coupling reactions with broad substrate scopes and turnover numbers of ∼4500, ∼1900, and ∼450, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279902>The global epidemiology of NAFLD and  in patients with type  diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and  with advanced fibrosis are closely associated with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), their global prevalence rates have not been well described. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of NAFLD, , and advanced fibrosis among patients with T2DM, by regions of the world.We searched for terms including NAFLD,  and T2DM in studies published from January 1989 to September 2018, using PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE®, EMBASE and Web of Science. Strict exclusion criteria were applied. Regional and global mean prevalence weighted by population size in each country were estimated and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated using stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression.Among 80 studies from 20 countries that met our inclusion criteria, there were 49,419 individuals with T2DM (mean age 58.5 years, mean body mass index 27.9 kg/m, and males 52.9%). The global prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM was 55.5% (95% CI 47.3-63.7). Studies from Europe reported the highest prevalence (68.0% [62.1-73.0%]). Among 10 studies that estimated the prevalence of , the global prevalence of  among individuals with T2DM was 37.3% (95% CI 24.7-50.0%). Seven studies estimated the prevalence of advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD and T2DM to be 17.0% (95% CI 7.-34.8). Meta-regression models showed that geographic region and mean age (p <0.5) were associated with the prevalence of NAFLD, jointly accounting for 63.9% of the heterogeneity.This study provides the global prevalence rates for NAFLD, , and advanced fibrosis in patients with T2DM. These data can be used to estimate the clinical and economic burden of  in patients with T2DM around the world.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for NAFLD. Additionally, T2DM seems to accelerate the progression of liver disease in NAFLD. Despite the high prevalence and serious clinical implications of NAFLD in patients with T2DM, it is usually overlooked in clinical practice. This meta-analysis provides evidence of the high prevalence of NAFLD and  in patients with T2DM. In this context, increasing awareness about the importance of NAFLD in patients with T2DM among all important stakeholders (primary care physicians, specialists, and health policy makers) must be prioritized.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox models and pooled across databases by random effect meta-analyses.120 795 patients with recorded NAFLD or  diagnoses were identified with mean follow-up .1-5.5 years. After adjustment for age and smoking the pooled hazard ratio for AMI was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.30; 1035 events in participants with NAFLD or , 67 823 in matched controls). In a group with more complete data on risk factors (86 098 NAFLD and 4 664 988 matched controls), the hazard ratio for AMI after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, type  diabetes, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension was 1.01 (0.91 to 1.12; 747 events in participants with NAFLD or , 37 462 in matched controls).

NAFLD is associated with liver-related and cardiovascular complications. Despite this, the first licensed drug for NAFLD is yet to be approved. Given the scale of the problem and unmet needs, there is a myriad of agents in the development pipeline.  We discuss promising agents in early phase clinical trials and categorize these agents based on their action on steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis. Furthermore, given the multisystemic nature of NAFLD, we consider the effects of these agents on the liver, their cardiometabolic effects, and the potential future strategies of combination therapies.  The paradigm for the ideal drug is the targeting of both steatohepatitis and fibrosis and the amelioration of cardiometabolic risk factors. New drugs that confer benefit in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () must also be tested for their effects on type  diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The treatment of  will become analogous to the treatment of hypertension; it is very likely that multiple classes of drugs targeting different mechanistic pathways will be necessary because no single agent is likely to control all aspects of this complex liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384535>Silibinin ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in mice with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by regulating CFLAR-JNK pathway.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a chronic metabolic syndrome and the CFLAR-JNK pathway can reverse the process of .

Dual-photon microscopy allows automated quantification of fibrosis-related parameters (q-FPs) and may facilitate large-scale histological studies. We aim to validate the performance of q-FPs in a large histological cohort.344 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) underwent 428 liver biopsies (240 had paired transient elastography examination). Fibrosis stage was scored using the  Clinical Research Network system, and q-FPs were measured by dual-photon microscopy using unstained slides. Patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation cohorts to test the performance of individual q-FPs and derive optimal cut-offs.Over 25 q-FPs had area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves >0.90 for different fibrosis stages. Among them, the perimeter of collagen fibres and number of long collagen fibres had the highest accuracy. At the best cut-offs, the two q-FPs had 88.3%-96.% sensitivity and 78.1%-91.1% specificity for different fibrosis stages in the validation cohort. q-FPs and histological scoring had nearly identical correlations with liver stiffness measurement, suggesting that the accuracy of q-FPs approached that of histological assessment. Among patients with paired liver biopsies, changes in the same q-FPs were associated with changes in fibrosis stage. At a median follow-up of 5.6 years, baseline q-FPs predicted liver-related events.q-FP is highly accurate in the assessment of fibrosis in NAFLD patients.

This MAIC assessed the comparative effectiveness of secukinumab (an anti-interleukin-17A) and etanercept (a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor) in a target population of biologic-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).Individual patient data pooled from FUTURE  (), FUTURE 3 (), and FUTURE 5 () (secukinumab: 150 mg, n=458 and 300 mg, n=461) were matched to data from the population in the  trial (etanercept 25 mg, n=101) using MAIC methodology, by adjusting for clinical and demographic baseline characteristics. Recalculated outcomes from FUTURE , 3, and 5 (150 mg, effective sample size (ESS) post-matching=104; 300 mg, ESS=75; and placebo, ESS=159) were compared with the  trial. Pairwise comparisons using odds ratios (ORs) were performed for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 response criteria at week 12 (placebo-adjusted) and week 24 (non-placebo-adjusted).At week 12, there were no significant differences in ACR responses between secukinumab and etanercept. There was no significant difference between secukinumab 150 mg and etanercept at week 24 with respect to ACR 20 and 50 response rates; however, ACR 70 response rates were higher for secukinumab 150 mg (OR (95% confidence interval (CI)): 4.48 (.01-9.99), p<0.001).

We studied the association of body size-metabolic phenotype with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and significant fibrosis.Our cross-sectional study included 559 subjects (mean age of 53 years; women 51%) with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Clinical, genetic, and histological characteristic features of NAFLD were evaluated. The metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined by the presence of two or more metabolic components, while body size was categorized based on body mass index: obese (≥ 25 kg/m) or non-obese (< 25 kg/m). Body size-metabolic phenotypes were divided into four study groups: (1) non-obese metabolic syndrome (MS)-, () non-obese MS+ , (3) obese MS-, and (4) obese MS+.Obese MS- and non-obese MS+ groups demonstrated comparable levels of insulin resistance, adipose tissue insulin resistance indexes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) areas. The VAT area was significantly higher in the obese MS+ group versus obese MS- group. However, the VAT to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) ratio was highest in the non-obese MS+ group. There was no difference in histology between the non-obese MS+, obese MS-, and obese MS+ groups. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and VAT/SAT areas demonstrated an independent and dose-dependent relationship between the body size-metabolic phenotype and  or significant fibrosis.The non-obese MS+ group displayed similar degree of hepatic histological severity compared to their obese MS- counterparts.

Recent government programmes such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Mission Indradhanush (MI) have catalysed important changes impacting VHNDs. To learn how VHNDs are currently being delivered, we assessed the fidelity of services provided as compared to government norms in a priority district of Uttar Pradesh.We fielded a cross-sectional study of VHNDs to provide a snapshot of health services functioning. Process evaluation data were collected via administrative sources, non-participant observation using a standardised form, and structured questionnaires. Questionnaires were designed using a framework to assess implementation fidelity. Key respondents were VHND participants, front-line workers involved in VHND delivery, and VHND non-participants (pregnant women due for antenatal care or children due for vaccination as per administrative records). Results were summarised as counts, frequencies, and proportions.In the 30 villages randomly selected for inclusion, 36 VHNDs were scheduled but four (11.1%) were cancelled and one VHND was not surveyed. Vaccination and antenatal care were offered at 96.8% (30/31) and child weighing at 83.9% (26/31) of VHNDs. Other normed services were infrequently provided or completely absent. Health education and promotion were particularly weak; institutional delivery was the only topic discussed in a majority of VHNDs. The true proportion of any serious problem impeding vaccine delivery was 47.% (17/36), comprising 4 VHND cancellations and 13 VHNDs experiencing vaccine shortages. Of the 13 incidents of vaccine shortage, 11 related to an unexpected global shortage of injectable polio vaccine (IPV). Over the 31 VHNDs, 37.8% (171 of the 452 scheduled beneficiaries) did not participate. Analysis of missed opportunities for vaccination highlighted inaccuracies in beneficiary identification and tracking and demand side-factors.The transformative potential of VHNDs to improve population health is only partially being met. A core subset of high-priority services for antenatal care, institutional delivery, and vaccination associated with high-priority government programmes (JSY, MI) is now being provided quite successfully. Other basic health promotion and prevention services are largely not provided, constituting a critical missed opportunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380156>Pathogenesis of : The Impact of Multiple Pathways.</a></h1><p>Advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie  pathogenesis.Recent findings on  pathogenesis have expanded our understanding of its complexity including: (1) there are multiple parallel hits that lead to ; () the microbiota play an important role in pathogenesis, with bacterial species recently shown to accurately differentiate between NAFL and  patients; (3) the main drivers of liver cell injury are lipotoxicity caused by free fatty acids (FFAs) and their derivatives combined with mitochondrial dysfunction; (4) decreased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) efficiency with increased demand for protein synthesis/folding/repair results in ER stress, protracted unfolded protein response, and apoptosis; (5) upregulated proteins involved in multiple pathways including JNK, CHOP, PERK, BH3-only proteins, and caspases result in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis; and (6) subtypes of  in which these pathophysiological pathways vary may require patient subtype identification to choose effective therapy.Recent pathogenesis studies may lead to important therapeutic advances, already seen in patients treated with ACC, ASK1 and SCD1 inhibitors and FXR agonists.

However, efficacious pharmacological treatment for  is lacking. A major issue for preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutics for  is the limited number of appropriate animal models, i.e., models that do not require long-term dietary intervention and adequately mimic disease progression in humans. The present study aimed to evaluate a 3-wk dietary mouse model of  and validate it by studying the effects of liraglutide, a compound in advanced clinical development for . C57BL6/J mice were fed a diet high in fat (60%), cholesterol (1.25%), and cholic acid (0.5%), along with % hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in drinking water (HFCC-CDX diet). Histological and biological parameters were measured at 1 and 3 wk. After 1-wk diet induction, liraglutide was administrated daily for  wk and then -associated phenotypic aspects were evaluated in comparison with control mice. Prior to treatment with liraglutide, mice fed the HFCC-CDX diet for 1 wk developed liver steatosis and had increased levels of oxidative-stress markers and hepatic and systemic inflammation. For mice not treated with liraglutide, these aspects were even more pronounced after 3 wk of the dietary period, with additional liver insulin resistance and fibrosis. Liraglutide treatment corrected the diet-induced alterations in glucose metabolism and significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. This study provides a novel 3-wk dietary model of mice that rapidly develop  features, and this model will be suitable for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of compounds in preclinical drug development for . We propose a diet high in fat (60%), cholesterol (1.25%), and cholic acid (0.5%) along with % hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in drinking water (HFCC-CDX diet) as a new dietary model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

Here, we use genetic mouse models to demonstrate a role of RGS4 in the maintenance of chronic pain states in male and female mice. Using paradigms of peripheral inflammation and nerve injury, we show that the prevention of RGS4 action leads to recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia and increases the motivation for wheel running. Similarly, RGS4KO eliminates the duration of nocifensive behavior in the second phase of the formalin assay. Using the Complete Freud's Adjuvant (CFA) model of hindpaw inflammation we also demonstrate that downregulation of RGS4 in the adult ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei promotes recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia. RNA sequencing analysis of thalamus (THL) from RGS4WT and RGS4KO mice points to many signal transduction modulators and transcription factors that are uniquely regulated in CFA-treated RGS4WT cohorts. Ingenuity pathway analysis suggests that several components of glutamatergic signaling are differentially affected by CFA treatment between RGS4WT and RGS4KO groups. Notably, Western blot analysis shows increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor  in THL synaptosomes of RGS4KO mice at time points at which they recover from mechanical allodynia. Overall, our study provides information on a novel intracellular pathway that contributes to the maintenance of chronic pain states and points to RGS4 as a potential therapeutic target. There is an imminent need for safe and efficient chronic pain medications. Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is a multifunctional signal transduction protein, widely expressed in the pain matrix. Here, we demonstrate that RGS4 plays a prominent role in the maintenance of chronic pain symptoms in male and female mice. Using genetically modified mice, we show a dynamic role of RGS4 in recovery from symptoms of sensory hypersensitivity deriving from hindpaw inflammation or hindlimb nerve injury. We also demonstrate an important role of RGS4 actions in gene expression patterns induced by chronic pain states in the mouse thalamus. Our findings provide novel insight into mechanisms associated with the maintenance of chronic pain states and demonstrate that interventions in RGS4 activity promote recovery from sensory hypersensitivity symptoms.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561285>Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter  ameliorates renal injury in a novel medaka model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related kidney disease.</a></h1><p>The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter  inhibitor (SGLT2I) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () has been reported, but there are few studies on its effect on -related renal injury. In this study, we examined the effect of SGLT2I using a novel medaka fish model of -related kidney disease, which was developed by feeding the d-rR/Tokyo strain a high-fat diet. SGLT2I was administered by dissolving it in water of the feeding tank. SGLT2I ameliorates macrophage accumulation and oxidative stress and maintained mitochondrial function in the kidney.

People gain nutrients from a varied diet, although fish-which are a rich source of bioavailable micronutrients that are essential to human health-are often overlooked. A lack of understanding of the nutrient composition of most fish and how nutrient yields vary among fisheries has hindered the policy shifts that are needed to effectively harness the potential of fisheries for food and nutrition security. Here, using the concentration of 7 nutrients in more than 350 species of marine fish, we estimate how environmental and ecological traits predict nutrient content of marine finfish species. We use this predictive model to quantify the global spatial patterns of the concentrations of nutrients in marine fisheries and compare nutrient yields to the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. We find that species from tropical thermal regimes contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and zinc; smaller species contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and omega-3 fatty acids; and species from cold thermal regimes or those with a pelagic feeding pathway contain higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. There is no relationship between nutrient concentrations and total fishery yield, highlighting that the nutrient quality of a fishery is determined by the species composition. For a number of countries in which nutrient intakes are inadequate, nutrients available in marine finfish catches exceed the dietary requirements for populations that live within 100 km of the coast, and a fraction of current landings could be particularly impactful for children under 5 years of age. Our analyses suggest that fish-based food strategies have the potential to substantially contribute to global food and nutrition security.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519114>GS-0976 (Firsocostat): an investigational liver-directed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().</a></h1><p>:  lipogenesis (DNL) plays a major role in fatty acid metabolism and contributes significantly to triglyceride accumulation within the hepatocytes in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

The association between diabetes and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in  patients with cirrhosis is not well quantified. All patients with the diagnosis of  cirrhosis seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 2006 and December 2015 were identified. All adult liver transplant registrants with  between 2004 and 2017 were identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation registry for external validation. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to investigate the association between diabetes and HCC risk. Among 354 Mayo Clinic patients with  cirrhosis, 253 (71%) had diabetes and 145 (41%) were male. Mean age at cirrhosis evaluation was 62. During a median follow-up of 47 months, 30 patients developed HCC. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in univariate (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.9; P = 0.04) and multivariable analysis (HR = 4.; 95% CI = 1.-14.; P = 0.02). In addition, age (per decade, HR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.-.6; P < 0.01) and low serum albumin (HR = .1; 95% CI = 1.5-.9; P < 0.01) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in multivariable analysis. Other metabolic risk factors, including body mass index, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, were not associated with HCC risk. Among UNOS  registrants (N = 6,630), 58% had diabetes.

Linear mixed-effects models assessed relations of baseline characteristics, acuity (at birth, across hospitalization), major morbidities, and nutrition (enteral feeding type, macronutrient/energy intakes) with changes in anthropometrics over hospitalization (days 1-8, 9-29, 30-75).Specific factors and the strength of their associations with growth depended on in-hospital time interval. Small-for-gestational-age infants experienced weight gain (4.3   g · kg-1 · d-1; 95% CI: .0, 6.5   g · kg-1 · d-1) during days 1-8, versus weight loss (-4.6     g · kg-1 · d-1; 95% CI: -5.6, -3.7     g · kg-1 · d-1) among appropriate-for-gestational-age infants (P < 0.001).

Patients with fatty liver disease are primarily asymptomatic. Currently, specialists are predicting that fatty liver related cirrhosis will the be leading reason for liver transplants in the next 10-20 years, displacing hepatitis C and alcohol related liver transplants. NAFLD exists on a spectrum of simple steatosis to steatosis with inflammation and different levels of fibrosis. It is currently estimated that 20% of simple steatosis patients will progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Patients with  are at risk for further progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no single factor that triggers progression from simple steatosis to , however, we do know that  is more prevalent in patients with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is thought to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and is closely tied with hyperinsulinemia. Currently there are no approved FDA treatments for NAFLD. NAFLD is typically found incidentally on imaging such as abdominal ultrasound and CT. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may prompt the clinician to evaluate for NAFLD however ALT should not be used as a diagnostic tool. The gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD and  is a liver biopsy. Only a liver biopsy can distinguish simple steatosis from . In patients whom NAFLD is suspected, appropriate biochemical assessment and imaging should be evaluated. Also, the presence of fibrosis should be assessed. Weight loss and dietary modifications are currently the only recommendations provided to NAFLD patients. There is histological improvement seen in in patients whom lose 5-10% of their body weight. Certain dietary factors play a role in the development of NAFLD including excessive caloric intake and high fructose consumption. There are pharmacological treatments currently being studied as well as non-pharmacological agents.

Collaborative product development in an alliance enables the firms to benefit from each other's diversified skills and the experience as a result of which they can develop products more rapidly and of better quality as well resulting in a higher payoff. Also, the development costs decrease. However, to avoid undesired results, selection of an appropriate partner firm for collaboration is of utmost importance keeping in view the objectives of alliance formation of both the strategic partners. One-way partner selection techniques available in the literature are impractical as they enable a firm to rank potential partners only from its own perspective while ignoring their objectives. This problem is addressed by the two-way partner selection techniques, however, they either ignore the payoff distribution criteria or the proposed criteria is unfair. More importantly, existing techniques consider that firm collaborate only with the objective to enhance their financial payoff which might not always be the case. The fact that collaborating firms may have one but different objectives for collaboration, or, each may have multiple objectives is largely neglected. To address the scenarios in which firms may collaborate due to multiple and possibly different objectives, this work proposes a bi-objective game-theoretic model that enables a firm to select an appropriate partner based on the individual preferences of both on the following two objectives: 1) learning and ) financial revenue. Moreover, this model calculates the pay-off that each firm should get whether only monetary, only in the form of learning or both. The calculation of payoff share is based on the following parameters: 1) individual goals of collaboration of partner selecting firms on the said two objectives, ) their level of cost contribution, 3) cooperation ratio and 4) knowledge investment difference.

The median ages at the time of first symptom, diagnosis, and enrollment were 29.7, 35.6, and 37.9 years, respectively; 58.8% were male and 82.4% were Hispanic. The median time from immigration to symptoms (minimum incubation) was 10 years and the estimated true incubation period considerably greater. Fifty percent also had other forms of NCC. Common complications were hydrocephalus (56%), shunt placement (41%), infarcts (18%), and symptomatic spinal disease (15%). Thirty patients (88.%) required prolonged treatment with albendazole (88.%, median 0.55 year) and/or praziquantel (61.8%; median 0.96 year), corticosteroids (88.%, median 1.09 years), methotrexate (50%, median 1.37 years), and etanercept (34.%, median 0.81 year), which led to sustained inactive disease in 29/30 (96.7%) patients. Three were treated successfully for recurrences and one has continuing infection. Normalization of cerebral spinal fluid parameters and cestode antigen levels guided treatment decisions. All 15 patients with undetectable cestode antigen values have sustained inactive disease. There were no deaths and moderate morbidity posttreatment. Corticosteroid-related side effects were common, avascular necrosis of joints being the most serious (8/33, 24.%).

Up-regulation of the CAT gene in livers with hypothyroidism after treatment with TQ supported our hypothesis of its antioxidant mechanistic hepatoprotective action.TQ efficiently restores the normal liver histology in hypothyroid rats with up-regulation of the antioxidant CAT gene.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589891>Change in hepatic fat content measured by MRI does not predict treatment-induced histological improvement of steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Proof-of-concept studies frequently assess changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content by magnetic resonance-based techniques as a surrogate marker of histology. The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Patients with  who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liver histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG <5.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p <0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from  different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of  without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or liver fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predict changes in steatosis but not of other liver histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution, as it may not be as reliable as previously believed to predict a treatment's overall clinical efficacy in patients with .Quantification of liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver as previously believed.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

We have previously shown that morphine and other µ-opioids may contribute to HAND by inhibiting the homeostatic and neuroprotective chemokine receptor CXCR4 in cortical neurons, and this novel mechanism depends on upregulation of the protein ferritin heavy chain (FHC). Here, we examined the cellular events and potential mechanisms involved in morphine-mediated FHC upregulation using rat cortical neurons of either sex in vitro and in vivo. Morphine dose dependently increased FHC protein levels in primary neurons through µ-opioid receptor (µOR) and Gαi-protein signaling. Cytoplasmic FHC levels were significantly elevated, but nuclear FHC levels and FHC gene expression were unchanged. Morphine-treated rats also displayed increased FHC levels in layer /3 neurons of the prefrontal cortex. Importantly, both  and  FHC upregulation was accompanied by loss of mature dendritic spines, which was also dependent on µOR and Gαi-protein signaling. Moreover, morphine upregulated ferritin light chain (FLC), a component of the ferritin iron storage complex, suggesting that morphine altered neuronal iron metabolism. Indeed, prior to FHC upregulation, morphine increased cytoplasmic labile iron levels as a function of decreased endolysosomal iron. In line with this, chelation of endolysosomal iron (but not extracellular iron) blocked morphine-induced FHC upregulation and dendritic spine reduction, whereas iron overloading mimicked the effect of morphine on FHC and dendritic spines. Overall, these data demonstrate that iron mediates morphine-induced FHC upregulation and consequent dendritic spine deficits and implicate endolysosomal iron efflux to the cytoplasm in these effects.Copyright © 2019  et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668396>PAR2 controls cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Increases in hepatic and plasma cholesterol occur in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the reason for this is not well understood. We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor  (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/ as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The spleen in obese patients is associated with the cardiovascular system. Enlargement of the spleen is suggestive of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Patients with  present an increase in growth factor (HGF) as well as those with advanced heart failure. Interleukin-16 and interleukin-12p40 levels were found to correlate significantly with BMI, and waist circumference.We tried to find a relationship between BMR, spleen length and HGF.We analysed retrospective data from 80 obese patients with NAFLD. We evaluated indices of indirect calorimetry by the bioimpendance analysis; carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), spleen length (SLD) and HS by ultrasonography; serum HGF, IL-16, IL-12p40 and IL-6 concentrations by a magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays and the severity of NAFLD by BARD score > .HGF levels of the obese were higher than those of controls,  < 0.001. At linear regression, BMR was foreseen by spleen length ( < 0.001), which was predicted by HGF ( = 0.04). BMR was predicted by IL-16 ( = 0.005), which predicted HGF,  = 0.034. Only fat mass, among other factors, predicted early atherosclerosis,  = 0.017; IL-12p40 did not predict IMT, HGF and BMR ( = 0.57, 0.09 and 0.59, respectively). The BARD score >  was negatively predicted by BMR and FFM ( =0.032 and 0.031, respectively), at the logistic regression. Interesting findings at the extended regression (mediation effect) were: IL-16 was likely causal in predicting BMR by HGF levels; HGF was influential in predicting BMR by SLD level. HS was predicted by SLD in males ( = 0.014), of advanced age ( < 0.001) and by BMR ( < 0.001). IL-6 concentrations, but not BMR were influential in the prediction of HS by SLD.These data reinforce the concept that the immune system is a sensor of the metabolic state, showing a link between HGF levels and BMR, which is mediated by IL-16 (cytokine inducing a cascade of inflammatory factors), and ascertaining the influential effect of the spleen, as main immune organ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288283>[Microbiome &  - partners in crime driving progression of fatty liver disease].</a></h1><p>Along with the increasing prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and type  diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing and poses a major challenge for gastroenterologists. Many studies have demonstrated that the microbiome is closely associated with the progression of nutrition-related diseases, especially of fatty liver disease. Changes in the quantity and quality of the intestinal flora, commonly referred to as dysbiosis, result in altered food metabolism, increased permeability of the intestinal barrier ("leaky gut") and consecutive inflammatory processes in the liver. This favors both the progression of obesity and metabolic disorders as well as NAFLD towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Important molecular mechanisms include microbial metabolites, microbial and endogenous signaling substances (so-called PAMPs/DAMPs) as well as bile acids. Essential cellular mechanisms include immune cells in the gut and liver, especially macrophages and Kupffer cells, as well as intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes as central regulators of metabolism. In this review article, we briefly summarize the relevant species of the human microbiome, describe the microbial analytics, explain the most important molecular relationships between microbiome and NAFLD/, and finally the opportunities and challenges of microbiome-modulating therapy for the treatment of fatty liver disease.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279904>Prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>We undertook a cross-sectional study of children/adolescents with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to compare the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes, and to examine the role of abnormal glucose tolerance as a predictor of liver disease severity.We recruited a cohort of 599 Caucasian children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD, and 118 children/adolescents without NAFLD, who were selected to be similar for age, sex, body mass index and waist circumference to those with NAFLD. The diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes was based on either hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose or  h post-load glucose concentrations.Children/adolescents with NAFLD had a significantly higher prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (prediabetes or diabetes) than those without NAFLD (20.6% vs. 11%, p = 0.02).

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile acid profile with increased tauro--muricholic acid (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver.

In the present study, the frequency of baseline AFP elevations and their related factors, AFP dynamics during and after DAA treatment, and factors associated with AFP reduction was assessed. This retrospective study included 141 patients with CHC without hepatocellular carcinoma who received DAA and achieved sustained virological response. The details are as follows: mean post-treatment follow-up was 99 weeks (12-213); mean age, 57.8 years old; 52%, males; 79%, genotype (GT) 1; and 47%, cirrhosis.

In an earlier study, Google Maps application programming interface (API) was used to perform modeling on the combination of hospitals optimizing for catchment in terms of current traveling time and road conditions. It is not known if these findings would remain the same if the modeling was performed with a large-scale transport demand model such as Victorian Integrated Transport Model (VITM). This model is developed by the Victorian State Government Transport has the capability to forecast travel demand into the future including future road conditions which is not possible with a Google Maps based applications. The aim of this study is to compare the travel time to potential ECR hubs using both VITM and the Google Maps API and model stability in the next 5 and 10 years.  The VITM was used to generate travel time from randomly generated addresses to four existing ECR capable hubs in Melbourne city, Australia (i.e., Royal Melbourne Hospital/RMH, Monash Medical Center/MMC, Alfred Hospital/ALF, and Austin Hospital/AUS) and the optimal service boundaries given a delivering time threshold are then determined.  The strategic transport model and Google map methods were similar with the   of 0.86 (peak and off peak) and the -Sutcliffe model of efficiency being 0.83 (peak) and 0.76 (off-peak travel). Futures modeling using VITM found that this proportion decreases to 82% after 5 years and 80% after 10 years. The combination of RMH and ALF provides coverage for 74% of cases, 68% by 5 years, and 66% by 10 years. The combination of RMH and AUS provides coverage for 70% of cases in the base case, 65% at 5 years, and 63% by 10 years.

Both disease phenotypes often co-occur, in the case of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type , and the metabolic syndrome. We explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epidemiology of asCVD in NAFLD patients, shared drivers of both phenotypes, and factors caused by NAFLD that contribute to asCVD.

Next, we discuss the prospects of lifestyle improvement and pharmacological treatment of NAFLD for asCVD risk reduction.

Our aim was to study the long-term effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on NAFLD/.Between 2008 and 2015, 3813 patients had an intraoperative liver biopsy performed at the time of primary RYGB and SG at a single academic center. Utilizing strict inclusion criteria, 487 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD who had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values (≥ 40 IU/L) at baseline were identified. Matching of SG to RYGB patients (1:4) was performed via logistic regression and propensity scores adjusting for clinical and liver histological characteristics. Changes in liver function tests (LFTs) at least 1 year after surgery were compared to baseline values and between the surgical groups.A total of 310 (weighted) patients (SG n = 62, and RYGB n = 248) with a median follow-up time of 4 years (range, 1-10) were included in the analysis. The distribution of covariates was well-balanced after propensity matching. In 84% of patients, LFT values normalized after bariatric surgery at the last follow-up time. The proportions of patients having normalized LFT values did not differ significantly between the SG and RYGB groups (82% vs. 84%, p = 0.66). The AST decreased from (SG: 49.1 ± 21.5 vs. RYGB: 49.3 ± 22.0, p = 0.93) at baseline to (SG: 28.0 ± 16.5 vs. RYGB: 26.5 ± 15.5, p = 0.33) at the last follow-up.

First, mice aged five weeks were divided into two groups (vehicle group and canagliflozin group) and were treated for three weeks. Then, mice aged five weeks were divided into three groups of nine animals each: the vehicle group, early canagliflozin group (treated from five to nine weeks), and continuous canagliflozin group (treated from five to 16 weeks). Canagliflozin was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg in these experiments. In addition, the in vitro effects of canagliflozin were investigated using HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. At the age of eight or 16 weeks, the histological non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was lower in the canagliflozin-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. There were significantly fewer hepatic tumors in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly fewer glutamine synthetase-positive nodules in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Expression of α-fetoprotein mRNA, a marker of HCC, was downregulated in the continuous canagliflozin group when compared with the vehicle group. At 16 weeks, there was diffuse SGLT1 expression in the hepatic lobules and strong expression by hepatocytes in the vehicle group, while SGLT2 expression was stronger in liver tumors than in the lobules. In the in vitro study, canagliflozin (10 μM) suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry showed that canagliflozin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase due to arrest in the G1 phase along with decreased expression of cyclin D and Cdk4 proteins, while it increased the percentage of cells in the G0/1 phase. Canagliflozin also induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3. In this mouse model of diabetes and /HCC, canagliflozin showed anti-steatotic and anti-inflammatory effects that attenuated the development of  and prevented the progression of  to HCC, partly due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the reduction of tumor growth through the direct inhibition of SGLT2 in tumor cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506634>Automated computerized image analysis for the user-independent evaluation of disease severity in preclinical models of NAFLD/.</a></h1><p>Pathologists use a semiquantitative scoring system (NAS or SAF score) to facilitate the reporting of disease severity and evolution. Similar scores are applied for the same purposes in rodents. Histological scores have inherent inter- and intra-observer variability and yield discrete and not continuous values. Here we performed an automatic numerical quantification of  features on liver sections in common preclinical NAFLD/ models. High-fat diet-fed foz/foz mice (Foz HF) or wild-type mice (WT HF) known to develop progressive  or an uncomplicated steatosis, respectively, and C57Bl6 mice fed a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDAA) to induce steatohepatitis were analyzed at various time points. Automated software image analysis of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis was performed on digital images from entire liver sections. Data obtained were compared with the NAS score, biochemical quantification, and gene expression. As histologically assessed, WT HF mice had normal liver up to week 34 when they harbor mild steatosis with if any, little inflammation. Foz HF mice exhibited grade  steatosis as early as week 4, grade 3 steatosis at week 12 up to week 34; inflammation and ballooning increased gradually with time. Automated measurement of steatosis (macrovesicular steatosis area) revealed a strong correlation with steatosis scores (r = 0.89), micro-CT liver density, liver lipid content (r = 0.89), and gene expression of CD36 (r = 0.87). Automatic assessment of the number of F4/80-immunolabelled crown-like structures strongly correlated with conventional inflammatory scores (r = 0.79). In Foz HF mice, collagen deposition, evident at week 20 and progressing at week 34, was automatically quantified on picrosirius red-stained entire liver sections. The automated procedure also faithfully captured and quantitated macrovesicular steatosis, mixed inflammation, and pericellular fibrosis in CDAA-induced steatohepatitis. In conclusion, the automatic numerical analysis represents a promising quantitative method to rapidly monitor NAFLD activity with high-throughput in large preclinical studies and for accurate monitoring of disease evolution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31418344>What Does the Future Hold for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis?</a></h1><p>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease, is characterized by accumulation of fat (>5% of the liver tissue), in the absence of alcohol abuse or other chronic liver diseases. Its prevalence is increasing because of obesity, metabolic syndrome or Type  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). NAFLD can cause liver inflammation and progress to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (), fibrosis, cirrhosis or Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC). Nevertheless, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in NAFLD/ patients. Current guidelines suggest the use of pioglitazone both in patients with T2DM and in those without. The newer antidiabetic drugs such as Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RA), Sodium-Glucose co- Transporter- inhibitors (SGLT2i), and statins plus ezetimibe, are considered safe by the guidelines, and may have a beneficial effect on NAFLD/ as well as Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Future drugs seem to have a potential for holding down the evolution of NAFLD and reduce liver- and CVD-related morbidity and mortality, but they will take some years to be approved for routine use. Until then pioglitazone, GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i, and statins plus ezetimibe, especially in combination might be useful for treating the huge number of patients with NAFLD/.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478881>Event-Triggered Multiagent Optimization for Two-Layered Model of Hybrid Energy System With Price Bidding-Based Demand Response.</a></h1><p>Due to uncertainty and dynamic characteristics from intermittent energy and load demand response (DR), the optimal operation of the hybrid energy system is a great challenge.

Then, four agents are designed to control different kinds of energy resources: agent 1 mainly analyzes the uncertainty or randomness caused by intermittent power, agent  takes charge of the dynamic economic dispatch (DED) within thermal units, agent 3 manages the optimal scheduling of energy storage, and agent 4 mainly undertakes the load-shifting strategy from consumers. In the upper-layer level, all agents coordinate together to ensure the stability of the hybrid energy system with an event-triggered mechanism, and the intelligent control approach mainly depends on switching on/off power generators or curtailing system load, and the consensus algorithm is utilized to optimize the subsystem problem in the lower-layer level. Furthermore, the simulation results can further verify the efficiency of the proposed method, and it also reveals that the event-triggered multiagent optimization strategy can be a promising way to solve the hybrid energy system problem.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309589>Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Is Associated With Liver-Related Outcomes and All-Cause Mortality in Chronic Hepatitis B.</a></h1><p>Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are increasingly observed together in clinical practice, and development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () represents another leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Our aims were to determine whether biopsy-proven  impacts clinical outcomes in CHB patients and assess prognostic risk factors.CHB patients attending two tertiary centers in North America and Europe over 13 years with available clinical and biopsy data were included. Patients were categorized as no- or probable/definite  based on standardized histological assessment. Clinical events (death, decompensation, transplant, and hepatoma) were evaluated, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to analyze the incidence of events. There were 1,089 CHB patients, classified as no- (n = 904, 83%) or  (n = 185, 17%), with 52 (6%) versus 27 (15%) experiencing outcome events during follow-up, respectively. In the multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, hepatitis B e antigen serostatus, and diabetes, the presence of  and concomitant advanced fibrosis (AF) was significantly associated with clinical outcomes (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 4.8 [.6-9.0], P < 0.01) when compared to absence of  and AF (reference).  and AF were associated with a greater risk of outcomes compared to AF (P = 0.01) or  alone (P < 0.01).

High-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatohepatitis and CKD share common pathogenesis involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)- and -. Elafibranor, a dual PPAR/ agonist, can ameliorate the HFD-induced steatohepatitis. Nonetheless, the effects of HFD-induced CKD had not yet explored. This study investigated the effects of elafibranor (elaf) on the progression of HFD-induced CKD in mice.  and  renal effects were evaluated in HFD-elaf mice receiving 12 weeks of elafibranor (from 13 to 24 week of HFD feeding) treatment. In elafibranor-treated HFD mice, increased insulin sensitivity, reduced obesity and body fat mass, decreased severity of steatohepatitis, increased renal expression of PPAR, PPAR, SIRT1, and autophagy (Beclin-1 and LC3-II) as well as glomerular/renal tubular barrier markers [synaptopodin (podocyte marker), zona occludin-1, and cubulin], reduced renal oxidative stress and caspase-3, and less urinary 8-isoprostanes excretion were observed. Aforementioned benefits of elafibranor were associated with low renal tubular injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis scores, less albuminuria, low urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and preserved glomerular filtration rate. Acute incubation of podocytes and HK- cells with elafibranor or recombinant SIRT1 reversed the HFD-sera-induced oxidative stress, autophagy dysfunction, cell apoptosis, barrier marker loss, albumin endocytosis, and reuptake reduction. Besides hepatoprotective and metabolic beneficial effects, current study showed that elafibranor inhibited the progression of HFD-induced CKD through activation of renal PPAR, PPAR, SIRT1, autophagy, reduction of oxidative stress, and apoptosis in mice with steatohepatitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589663>Modeling and Mitigating Phosphorus Losses from a Tile-Drained and Manured Field Using RZWQM2-P.</a></h1><p>Prediction of P losses from manured agricultural fields through surface runoff and tile drainage is necessary to mitigate widespread eutrophication in water bodies. However, present water quality models are weak in predicting P losses, particularly in tile-drained and manure-applied cropland. We developed a field-scale P management model, the Root Zone Water Quality Model version -Phosphorus (RZWQM2-P), whose accuracy in simulating P losses from manure applied agricultural field is yet to be tested. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess the accuracy of this new model in simulating dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and particulate phosphorus (PP) losses in surface runoff and tile drainage from a manure amended field, and (ii) to identify best management practices to mitigate manure P losses including water table control, manure application timing, and spreading methods by the use of model simulation. The model was evaluated against data collected from a liquid cattle manure applied field with maize ( L.)-soybean [ (L.) Merr.] rotation in Ontario, Canada. The results revealed that the RZWQM2-P model satisfactorily simulated DRP and PP losses through both surface runoff and tile drainage (-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.50, percentage bias within ±25%, and index of agreement > 0.75). Compared with conventional management practices, manure injection reduced the P losses by 18%, whereas controlled drainage and winter manure application increased P losses by 13 and 23%, respectively. The RZWQM2-P is a promising tool for P management in manured and subsurface drained agricultural field. The injection of manure rather than controlled drainage is an effective management practice to mitigate P losses from a subsurface-drained field.© 2019 The Authors.

However, to predict the amount of incoming wastewater in WWTPs, wastewater engineers face challenges arising from numerous complexities and uncertainties, such as the nonlinear precipitation-runoff relationships in combined sewer systems, unpredictability due to aging infrastructure, and frequently inconsistent data quality. To address such challenges, a time series analysis model (i.e., the autoregressive integrated moving average, ARIMA) and an artificial neural network model (i.e., the multilayer perceptron neural network, MLPNN) were developed for predicting wastewater inflow. A case study of the Barrie Wastewater Treatment Facility in Barrie, Canada, was carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models. Fifteen-minute flow data over a period of 1 year were collected, and the resampled daily flow data were used to train and validate the developed models. The model performances were examined using root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, coefficient of determination, and -Sutcliffe efficiency. The results indicate that both models provided reliable forecasts, while ARIMA showed a slightly better performance than MLPNN in this case study. The proposed models can provide useful decision support for the optimization and management of WWTPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595464>Low Awareness of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in a Population-Based Cohort Sample: the CARDIA Study.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, yet little is known about NAFLD awareness in individuals with incidental fatty liver on imaging.To assess the level of awareness of imaging-defined NAFLD among individuals with and without metabolic risk factors.Cross-sectional analysis within a prospective longitudinal population-based cohort study conducted in four U.S. cities.Adults age 43 to 55 years enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study who underwent computed tomography and a personal health questionnaire at the year 25 exam (2010-2011, n = 2788).NAFLD was defined as liver attenuation ≤ 51 Hounsfield units after exclusion of other causes of liver fat. Participants were considered "NAFLD aware" if they reported being told previously by a doctor or nurse that they had "fatty liver."NAFLD prevalence was 23.9%. Only 16 of 667 (.4%) participants with CT-defined NAFLD were aware of a NAFLD diagnosis. NAFLD aware participants were more likely to be white (81.3% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.03) and have the metabolic syndrome (87.5% vs. 59.3%, p = 0.02) and/or hypertension (75.0% vs. 50.%, p = 0.05). In multivariable analyses adjusted for demographics, metabolic syndrome and hypertension remained predictive of NAFLD awareness.There is low awareness of NAFLD among individuals with hepatic steatosis on imaging, even among those with metabolic risk factors. These findings highlight an opportunity to raise public and practitioner awareness of NAFLD with the goal of increasing diagnosis and implementing early treatment strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361543>eNOS deletion impairs mitochondrial quality control and exacerbates Western diet-induced .</a></h1><p>Dysregulated mitochondrial quality control leads to mitochondrial functional impairments that are central to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Here, we identify hepatocellular localized endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) as a novel master regulator of mitochondrial quality control. Mice lacking eNOS were more susceptible to Western diet-induced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in conjunction with decreased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover. The hepatocyte-specific influence was verified via magnetic activated cell sorting purified primary hepatocytes and in vitro siRNA-induced knockdown of eNOS. Hepatic mitochondria from eNOS knockout mice revealed decreased markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (PPARγ coactivator-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A) and autophagy/mitophagy [BCL--interacting protein-3 (BNIP3), 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3)], suggesting decreased mitochondrial turnover rate. eNOS knockout in primary hepatocytes exhibited reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity and were unable to mount a normal BNIP3 response to a mitophagic challenge compared with wild-type mice. Finally, we demonstrate that eNOS is required in primary hepatocytes to induce activation of the stress-responsive transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (). Thus, our data demonstrate that eNOS is an important regulator of hepatic mitochondrial content and function and  susceptibility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329513>Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: MASCC/ISOO/ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline.</a></h1><p>To provide guidance regarding best practices in the prevention and management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in patients with cancer.Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) and ASCO convened a multidisciplinary Expert Panel to evaluate the evidence and formulate recommendations. Guideline development involved a systematic review of the literature and a formal consensus process. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies of the prevention and management of MRONJ related to bone-modifying agents (BMAs) for oncologic indications published between January 2009 and December 2017. Results from an earlier systematic review (2003 to 2008) were also included.The systematic review identified 132 publications, only 10 of which were randomized controlled trials. Recommendations underwent two rounds of consensus voting.Currently, MRONJ is defined by (1) current or previous treatment with a BMA or angiogenic inhibitor, () exposed bone or bone that can be probed through an intraoral or extraoral fistula in the maxillofacial region and that has persisted for longer than 8 weeks, and (3) no history of radiation therapy to the jaws or metastatic disease to the jaws. In patients who initiate a BMA, preventive care includes comprehensive dental assessments, discussion of modifiable risk factors, and avoidance of elective dentoalveolar surgery (ie, surgery that involves the teeth or contiguous alveolar bone) during BMA treatment. It remains uncertain whether BMAs should be discontinued before dentoalveolar surgery. Staging of MRONJ should be performed by a clinician with experience in the management of MRONJ. Conservative measures comprise the initial approach to MRONJ treatment. Ongoing collaboration among the dentist, dental specialist, and oncologist is essential to optimal patient care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390551>Generation of Human Fatty Livers Using Custom-Engineered Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells with Modifiable SIRT1 Metabolism.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms by which steatosis of the liver progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and end-stage liver disease remain elusive. Metabolic derangements in hepatocytes controlled by SIRT1 play a role in the development of fatty liver in inbred animals. The ability to perform similar studies using human tissue has been limited by the genetic variability in man. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with controllable expression of SIRT1. By differentiating edited iPSCs into hepatocytes and knocking down SIRT1, we found increased fatty acid biosynthesis that exacerbates fat accumulation. To model human fatty livers, we repopulated decellularized rat livers with human mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and human SIRT1 knockdown iPSC-derived hepatocytes and found that the human iPSC-derived liver tissue developed macrosteatosis, acquired proinflammatory phenotype, and shared a similar lipid and metabolic profiling to human fatty livers. Biofabrication of genetically edited human liver tissue may become an important tool for investigating human liver biology and disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report a method and preliminary data that simulates both tensile fracture and fluid flow at elevated pressures. To achieve this we developed a sample assembly consisting of a cylindrical core drilled with an axial borehole encapsulated in a 3D printed jacket permitting fluid from the borehole to move through the freshly generated tensile fracture to a voluometer. The permeability of  Point Shale increases from a pre-fracture value of 10 to 10 m (1 microDarcy, μD to 0.01 μD) to  × 10 m ( milliDarcy, mD) immediately after fracture (at .1 MPa confining pressure). Permeability is strongly dependent on confining pressure, decreasing to 0.25 × 10 m (0.25 mD) at 19 MPa confining pressure (approximately 800 m depth), and does not recover when confinement is removed. Using concomitant measurements of the radial strain as a proxy for fracture aperture, we conclude that the effective permeability is governed solely by the width of the developed cracks, revealed by post-test X-Ray Computed Tomography to be planar, extending radially from the central conduit.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635468>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of a metabolic syndrome, is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide with prevalence 17-46 % in adult population.

We recently identified adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1) as a member of a core set of dysregulated fibrosis-specific genes in human . Here we sought to investigate the relationship between AEBP1 and hepatic fibrosis. We confirmed that hepatic AEBP1 expression is elevated in fibrosis compared to lobular inflammation, steatosis, and normal liver, and increases with worsening fibrosis in  patients. AEBP1 expression was upregulated 5.8-fold in activated hepatic stellate cells and downregulated during chemical and contact induction of biological quiescence. In LX- and HepG2 cells treated with high glucose (25 mM), AEBP1 expression increased over 7-fold compared to normal glucose conditions. In response to treatment with either fructose or palmitate, AEBP1 expression in primary human hepatocytes increased .4-fold or 9.6-fold, but was upregulated 55.8-fold in the presence of fructose and palmitate together. AEBP1 knockdown resulted in decreased expression of nine genes previously identified to be part of a predicted AEBP1-associated  co-regulatory network and confirmed to be upregulated in fibrotic tissue. We identified binding sites for two miRNAs known to be downregulated in  fibrosis, miR-372-3p and miR-373-3p in the AEBP1 3' untranslated region.

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recently published updated practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing NAFLD, including the following recommendations: Routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups is not advised because of uncertainties surrounding test and treatment options, along with a lack of knowledge about cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. Noninvasive studies, including biomarkers from laboratory tests and liver stiffness measured through elastography, are clinically useful tools for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of delayed TSS diagnosis at our institution and describe the clinical characteristics commonly observed in their particular presentation.Following institutional review board approval, an institutional billing database review was performed for patients who underwent a spinal decompression procedure between 2006 and 2016. Thirty-three patients who underwent decompression on  separate spinal regions within 1 year were included for review. Patients with delayed diagnosis of TSS following the first surgery were differentiated from those with preoperative diagnosis of TSS.TSS requiring surgical decompression occurred in 33 patients, with the incidence being .06% in this cohort. Fifteen patients received a delayed diagnosis after the first surgical decompression (45%) and were found to have a longer interval between decompressions (7.6 ± .1 months versus 4.01 ± 3 months,  = .0004). Patients undergoing lumbar decompression as the initial procedure were more likely to have a delayed diagnosis of TSS (8 versus  patients,  = .0200). The most common presentation of delayed TSS was pain and myelopathic symptoms that persisted after decompressive surgery.TSS should remain within the differential diagnosis for patients at initial presentation of spinal stenosis.

We aimed to investigate whether serum vitamin E levels differently impact long-term prognosis in diabetic versus non-diabetic NAFLD individuals. A total of 2404 ultrasonographically defined NAFLD individuals from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III were stratified by their glycemic statuses into diabetic ( = 662), pre-diabetic ( = 836) and non-diabetic ( = 906), and the relationship between serum vitamin E levels and all-cause mortality was analyzed. The serum vitamin E concentrations were 31.1 ± 14.1, 26.7 ± 9.6, and 24.7 ± 9.8 µmol/L and vitamin E: total cholesterol ratios were 5.16 ± 1.70, 4.81 ± 1.46, and 4.80 ± 1.34 µmol/mmol in in diabetic, pre-diabetic, and non-diabetic groups, respectively. Of 2404 NAFLD subjects, 2403 have mortality information and 152 non-diabetic, 244 pre-diabetic, and 342 diabetic participants died over a median follow-up period of 18.8 years. Both serum vitamin E levels and vitamin E: total cholesterol ratios were negatively associated with all-cause mortality after adjusting for possible confounders in non-diabetic subjects (HR = 0.483, and 0.451, respectively,  < 0.005), but not in either diabetic or pre-diabetic subjects. In NAFLD individuals, both serum vitamin E and lipid-corrected vitamin E were (1) higher in the diabetic group; and () negatively associated with all-cause mortality only in the non-diabetic group. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this inverse association of serum vitamin E concentration with all-cause mortality in non-diabetic but not pre-diabetic or diabetic subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431413>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease after liver transplantation in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cryptogenic cirrhosis: the impact of pre-transplant graft steatosis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may occur in liver transplant recipients. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of NAFLD after liver transplantation in patients with  and cryptogenic cirrhosis, focusing on the impact of graft steatosis.Patients with  and cryptogenic cirrhosis who had undergone liver transplantation in Shiraz transplant center between March 2010 and March 2017 were included. NAFLD was diagnosed after liver transplantation using ultrasonography and transient elastography.73 patients with  and 389 with cryptogenic cirrhosis were included. NAFLD was diagnosed in 33 patients (56.9%) in  group and 96 patients (26.7%) in cryptogenic group (OR: 3.61; CI: .04-6.39; P-Value < 0.001), using ultrasound. Obesity and post-transplant hyperlipidemia were independent predictors of NAFLD after liver transplantation (P < 0.05). NAFLD was diagnosed in 32.9% of patients with graft macrosteatosis compared to 29.9% in patients without graft macrosteatosis (OR: 1.51; 95%CI: 0.755-1.753). 28% of the patients with macrosteatosis ≥30% had NAFLD after liver transplantation compared to 31.4% with macrosteatosis <30% (OR: 1.175; 95% CI: 0.346-.091).Liver graft steatosis before transplantation was not associated with the occurrence of NAFLD after liver transplantation.Copyright © 2019 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.

Training on such topics has been adapted from teamwork training programs used in military and commercial aviation, called crew resource management (CRM). The principles behind CRM programs have been deployed in a number of clinical settings over the past  decades, and there are now several CRM vendors. Little is known about this nascent industry, and the emerging research supporting CRM programs lacks standardization and conclusive evidence. The objectives of this study were to report on the body of empirical data about CRM training in clinical settings and to provide a conceptual framework for evaluating its effectiveness in medicine. Using the proposed conceptual framework, the authors further examine currently published methods of measuring effectiveness and identify future directions for the use of teamwork training in medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554328>Bridging Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly During GRACE/GRACE-FO Gap Using SSA Method: A Case Study in China.</a></h1><p>The terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) gap between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO) is now a significant issue for scientific research in high-resolution time-variable gravity fields. This paper proposes the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to predict the TWSA derived from GRACE. We designed a case study in six regions in China (North China Plain (NCP), Southwest China (SWC), Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), Tianshan Mountains Region (TSMR), Heihe River Basin (HRB), and Lishui and Wenzhou area (LSWZ)) using GRACE RL06 data from January 2003 to August 2016 for inversion, which were compared with Center for Space Research (CSR), Helmholtz-Centre Potsdam-German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s Mascon (Mass Concentration) RL05, and JPL's Mascon RL06. We evaluated the accuracy of SSA prediction on different temporal scales based on the correlation coefficient (), -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE), which were compared with that of an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model. The TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were predicted using SSA, which was verified using Mascon RL06, the Global Land Data Assimilation System model, and GRACE-FO results. The results show that: (1) TWSA derived from GRACE agreed well with Mascon in most regions, with the highest consistency with Mascon RL06 and () prediction accuracy of GRACE in TRHR and SWC was higher. SSA reconstruction improved , NSE, and RMSE compared with those of ARMA. The  values for predicting TWS in the six regions using the SSA method were 0.34-0.98, which was better than those for ARMA (0.26-0.97), and the RMSE values were 0.03-5.55 cm, which were better than the .29-5.11 cm RMSE for ARMA as a whole. (3) The SSA method produced better predictions for obvious periodic and trending characteristics in the TWSA in most regions, whereas the detailed signal could not be effectively predicted. (4) The predicted TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were basically consistent with Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) results, and the predicted TWSA during June 2018 to May 2019 agreed well with GRACE-FO results.

In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1. kg/m , glucose 103± mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function.

This study sought to identify predictors of rehospitalization in 783 adolescents in the  year period following psychiatric hospitalization at a major treatment facility in a large urban area. A current diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, greater severity of lifetime suicidal ideation (SI) and stronger treatment alliance prior to hospitalization were associated with a greater likelihood of rehospitalization. Overall, severe lifetime SI was the strongest predictor of rehospitalization; although, within the first 4 months post-discharge, moderate lifetime SI was the strongest predictor.

Here, we show that estrogen deficiency severely compromises the maintenance of muscle stem cells (i.e., satellite cells) as well as impairs self-renewal and differentiation into muscle fibers. Mechanistically, by hormone replacement, use of a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (bazedoxifene), and conditional estrogen receptor knockout, we implicate 17β-estradiol and satellite cell expression of estrogen receptor α and show that estrogen signaling through this receptor is necessary to prevent apoptosis of satellite cells. Early data from a biopsy study of women who transitioned from peri- to post-menopause are consistent with the loss of satellite cells coincident with the decline in estradiol in humans. Together, these results demonstrate an important role for estrogen in satellite cell maintenance and muscle regeneration in females.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

This work aimed to determine which of the models used to estimate daily total global solar irradiance (TGSI) is the best model when irradiance measurements are scarce in a given site. A model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and empirical models based on temperature and sunshine measurements were analyzed and evaluated in Córdoba, Argentina. The performance of the models was benchmarked using different statistical estimators such as the mean bias error (MBE), the mean absolute bias error (MABE), the correlation coefficient (r), the -Sutcliffe equation (NSE), and the statistics t test (t value). The results showed that when enough measurements were available, both the ANN and the empirical models accurately predicted TGSI (with MBE and MABE ≤ |0.11| and ≤ |1.98| kWh m day, respectively; NSE ≥ 0.83; r ≥ 0.95; and |t values| < t critical value). However, when few TGSI measurements were available (, 3, 5, 7, or 10 days per month) only the ANN-based method was accurate (|t value| < t critical value), yielding precise results although only  measurements per month were available for 1 year. This model has an important advantage over the empirical models and is very relevant to Argentina due to the scarcity of TGSI measurements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658178>Missed Study Visits and Subsequent HIV Incidence Among Women in a Predominantly Sex Worker Cohort Attending a Dedicated Clinic Service in Kampala, Uganda.</a></h1><p>There is limited evidence on the relationship between sustained exposure of female sex workers (FSWs) to targeted HIV programmes and HIV incidence. We investigate the relationship between the number of missed study visits (MSVs) within each episode of  consecutively attended visits (MSVs) and subsequent HIV risk in a predominantly FSW cohort.Women at high risk of HIV are invited to attend an ongoing dedicated clinic offering a combination HIV prevention intervention in Kampala, Uganda. Study visits are scheduled once every 3 months. The analysis included HIV-seronegative women with ≥1 follow-up visit from enrollment (between April 2008 and May 2017) to August 2017. Cox regression models were fitted adjusted for characteristics on sociodemographic, reproductive, behavioral, and sexually transmitted infections (through clinical examination and serological testing for syphilis).Among 2206 participants, HIV incidence was 3.1/100 (170/5540) person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): .6 to 3.5]. Incidence increased from .6/100 person-years (95% CI: .1 to 3.) in episodes without a MSV to 3.0/100 (95% CI: . to 4.1) for 1- MSVs and 4.3/100 (95% CI: 3.3 to 5.6) for ≥3 MSVs. Relative to episodes without a MSV, the hazard ratios (adjusted for confounding variables) were 1.40 (95% CI: 0.93 to .12) for 1- MSVs and .00 (95% CI: 1.35 to .95) for ≥3 MSVs (P-trend = 0.001).Missing study visits was associated with increased subsequent HIV risk. Although several factors may underlie this association, the finding suggests effectiveness of targeted combination HIV prevention.

It is often unclear whether this finding is a non-specific consequence of cirrhosis or indicative of underlying A1ATD (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) contributing to the cirrhosis. In this study, explanted livers were retrospectively evaluated for histopathology (including PASD status with confirmatory A1AT immunohistochemistry), and chart review provided etiology of liver failure and general clinical parameters. RT-PCR (real-time PCR) was used to detect A1AT genotype (SERPINA1 S and Z alleles) by melting curve analysis on liver explant tissue from selected cases. Of 196 explanted livers, 21 (11%) had PASD+ globules. PASD+ globules were significantly enriched in patients with a clinical diagnosis of  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 47%) compared to other causes such as chronic ethanol use (16%) and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (6.7%) (P 0.001). Immunohistochemistry confirmed all PASD+ globules were A1AT positive, with 20 of 21 cases demonstrating diffuse A1AT staining. In an expanded  cohort, 42% (14/33) of explants had PASD+ globules, and 92% of these PASD+ cases were homozygous (n=1) or heterozygous (n=11) for the SERPINA1 Z allele, corresponding to nearly 40% of all  patients. Overall, the Z allele was present in 10% of all liver explants tested, with 85% of PASD+ cases genotyping homozygous (n=) or heterozygous (n=20), far in excess of the estimated % in the general population. Conclusion: These results indicate PASD+ A1AT globules (with confirmatory genotyping showing at least one Z allele) are commonly observed in , suggesting a synergistic relationship towards liver fibrosis. In addition, the high frequency of SERPINA1 Z alleles in liver transplantation patients supports the utility of pre-transplant genotyping.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516268>Drug Development for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Landscape and Challenges.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the leading cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized economies. With no licensed treatment currently available, together with a growing prevalence that parallels global increases in obesity and type  diabetes, NAFLD will dominate the landscape of hepatology for the foreseeable future.

We conducted a study to characterize the prevalence of and factors associated with advanced liver histology in patients with histologically characterized NAFLD and normal aminotransferase levels.We evaluated 534 adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) <40U/L within 3 months of their liver biopsy. Histological phenotypes of primary interest were nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with stage -3 fibrosis ( F2-3) and cirrhosis. Using multiple logistic regression models with Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC), we identified variables associated with these histological phenotypes. We developed and internally validated their clinical prediction models.The prevalence of  F2-F3 and cirrhosis was 19% and 7%, respectively. The best multiple regression AIC model for  F2-3 consisted of type  diabetes, white race, lower low-density lipoprotein, lower platelet count, higher AST/ALT ratio, higher serum triglycerides, and hypertension. The best AIC model for cirrhosis consisted of lower platelet count, lower AST/ALT ratio, higher body mass index, and female sex. The area under the receiver operator curves of the prediction models were 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.76) for detecting -F2-3 and 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.92) for detecting cirrhosis. When models were fixed at maximum Youden's index, their positive and negative predictive values were 35% and 88% for  F2-F3 and 30% and 98% for cirrhosis, respectively.Clinically significant histological phenotypes are observed in patients with NAFLD and normal aminotransferase levels.

As Mallory-Denk bodies were occasionally observed in the enlarged hepatocytes in  model rat (SHRSP5/Dmcr) fed high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet, we aimed to clarify the roles of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in  progression. Male SHRSP5/Dmcr were randomly divided into 4 groups. Two groups were fed a control diet; the other two groups were fed a HFC diet for  and 8 weeks, respectively. The HFC diet increased the autophagy-related proteins levels and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II/I ratio after  and 8 weeks, respectively. However, regarding ER stress-related proteins, the HFC diet decreased the levels of phosphorylated (p-) inositol-requiring kinase-1 (p-IRE-1) and p-protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase after  weeks. Additionally, the HFC diet increased anti-ubiquitin-positive cells and the level of the autophagy substrate p62, suggesting that the HFC diet induced dysfunction in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathways. In conclusion, the HFC diet arrested the autophagy process in the liver; this was particularly associated with decreases in p-IRE-1 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405599>Optimal Timing of Prenatal Ultrasound in Predicting Birth Weight in Diabetic Pregnancies.</a></h1><p>This study sought to determine the optimal timing of ultrasound in the third trimester to predict birth weight accurately in diabetic women with a singleton pregnancy.A retrospective cohort study of all diabetic women with a singleton pregnancy treated in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was performed. Estimated fetal weight was derived from ultrasound measures using the Hadlock2 equation. The Mongelli equation was used to predict birth weight. The association between gestational age at ultrasound and accuracy of predicted birth weight was assessed, with accuracy as a continuous variable representing the difference between predicted and actual birth weight and as a categorical variable (with four gestational age categories) representing whether predicted birth weight was within, over, or under 250 g of actual birth weight RESULTS: The cohort of 943 women comprised 121 (12.8%) with type 1 diabetes, 111 (11.7%) with type  diabetes, and 711 (75.4%) with gestational diabetes. Ultrasound scans performed at term were the most accurate in predicting birth weight. At this gestational age, the mean difference between predicted and actual birth weight was -30 g (95% confidence interval -109 to -48). After adjusting for maternal body mass index, age, smoking, type of diabetes, and interval between ultrasound examination and delivery, accuracy improved as gestational age at ultrasound increased (P = 0.005). The odds of underpredicting or overpredicting birth weight were not significantly affected by the timing of the ultrasound examination.Because the predictive accuracy of ultrasound prediction of birth weight improves with gestational age, fetal growth assessment at term is recommended to aid with delivery planning in women with diabetes.Copyright © 2019 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Société des obstétriciens et gynécologues du Canada.

NAFLD was diagnosed from detection of steatosis by histology or imaging, no alcohol intake, and exclusion of other liver diseases. Cirrhosis was defined by histological features, imaging data, and symptoms. We compared NAFLD-related HCC with or without cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic NAFLD with or without HCC.There were 48 non-cirrhotic HCC patients and 71 cirrhotic HCC patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that other than liver function factors male gender (OR: 5.603, 95%CI: 1.577-19.900), light drinker (OR: .797, 95%CI: 1.031-7.589), and tumor size (OR: 1.031, 95%CI 1.009-1.055) differ significantly between these two groups. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the non-cirrhotic HCC group than the cirrhotic HCC group, with risk factors being des-γ-carboxy prothrombin and the number of HCCs. The non-cirrhotic HCC group showed significantly better survival due to absence of non-cancerous liver failure. Comparison between non-cirrhotic NAFLD patients with or without HCC (n=612) revealed the following risk factors for HCC: male gender (OR: 7.774, 95%CI: .176-27.775), light drinker (OR: 4.893, 95%CI: 1.923-12.449), and high FIB4-index (OR .634, 95%CI: 1.787-3.884).In patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD, important risk factors for HCC were male gender, alcohol consumption, and the FIB4-index. HCC recurrence and survival were only influenced by the tumor stage. We should be aware of alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for HCC.This article is protected by copyright.

Strategic conservation and management requires identification of the environmental and socioeconomic factors driving the persistence of scleractinian coral assemblages-the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems. Here, we compiled coral abundance data from ,584 Indo-Pacific reefs to evaluate the influence of 21 climate, social and environmental drivers on the ecology of reef coral assemblages. Higher abundances of framework-building corals were typically associated with: weaker thermal disturbances and longer intervals for potential recovery; slower human population growth; reduced access by human settlements and markets; and less nearby agriculture. We therefore propose a framework of three management strategies (protect, recover or transform) by considering: (1) if reefs were above or below a proposed threshold of >10% cover of the coral taxa important for structural complexity and carbonate production; and () reef exposure to severe thermal stress during the 2014-2017 global coral bleaching event.

Among them, 130 patients had 1-year follow up LSM and analyzed for the changes of LSM after pioglitazone or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment.In Kleiner fibrosis stage F0-1, LSM values increased at higher CAP tertile ( = 0.001), and in F2, at middle and higher tertiles ( = 0.027). No difference across CAP tertiles was noticed in F3-4 ( = 0.752). Receiver operating characteristic curve for LSM cutoff in diagnosis of F ≥  identified 8.05 kPa for lower CAP tertile, 9.35 kPa for middle, and 10.55 kPa for high tertile. When changes in proportion of significant fibrosis (F ≥ ) were assessed among pioglitazone and UDCA treated patients considering CAP values, pioglitazone treated patients demonstrated decrease in proportion of high LSM.In patient with NAFLD, interpretation of LSM in association with CAP scores may provide helpful information sparing unnecessary liver biopsy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630405>Quantitative Proteomics and Mechanistic Modeling of Transporter-mediated Disposition in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Understanding transporter-mediated drug disposition and pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is critical in developing treatment options. Here, we quantified the expression levels of major drug transporters in healthy, steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () liver samples, via liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and used the data to predict the PK of substrate drugs in the disease state. Expression of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) is significantly lower in  livers; whereas, MRP3 is induced while no change was observed for organic cation transporter (OCT)1. PBPK models verified with PK data from healthy subjects well recovered the PK in  subjects for morphine (involving OCT1) and its glucuronide metabolites (MRP2/MRP3/OATP1B),  TC-mebrofenen (OATP1B/MRP2/MRP3), and rosuvastatin (OATP1B/breast cancer resistance protein).

NAFLD is associated with obesity, type  diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and insulin resistance. The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of .

Masked assessment of liver histologic specimens was performed, using a prespecified protocol to score individual biopsies. Participants included 446 adults with NAFLD enrolled in the  CRN Database studies between October 27, 2004, and September 13, 2013, who underwent  liver biopsies 1 or more year apart. Data analysis was performed from October 2016 to October 2018.Progression and regression of fibrosis stage, using clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, including the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; range, 0-8, with 8 indicating more severe disease).A total of 446 adults (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years; 294 [65.9%] women) with NAFLD (NAFL, 86 [19.3%]), borderline  (84 [18.8%]), and definite  (276 [61.9%]) were studied. Over a mean (SD) interval of 4.9 (.8) years between biopsies, NAFL resolved in 11 patients (12.8%) and progressed to steatohepatitis in 36 patients (41.9%). Steatohepatitis resolved in 24 (28.6%) of the patients with borderline  and 61 (22.1%) of those with definite . Fibrosis progression or regression by at least 1 stage occurred in 132 (30%) and 151 [34%] participants, respectively. Metabolic syndrome (20 [95%] vs 108 [72%]; P = .03), baseline NAS (mean [SD], 5.0 [1.4] vs 4.3 [1.6]; P = .005), and smaller reduction in NAS (-0.

They can be acquired from medical waste such as adipose and umbilical cord tissues, are influenced by culturing conditions, and exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-fibrotic, and angiogenic effects. We analyzed the multi-directional effects of MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions and their underlying mechanisms in the treatment of liver cirrhosis in a mouse model.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured under hypoxic (5% O; hypoMSCs) and normoxic (21% O; norMSCs) conditions were compared by cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) with or without serum from liver cirrhosis patients. The therapeutic effects of MSCs, including serum liver enzyme induction, fibrosis regression, and hepatic oxidative stress, were evaluated by injecting 1 × 10,  × 10, or 4 × 10 MSCs/mouse into the tail veins of mice with carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced liver cirrhosis. Intravital imaging was performed with a two-photon excitation microscope to confirm the various MSC migration paths to the liver.CAGE analysis revealed that the RNA expression levels of prostaglandin E synthase () and miR210 were significantly higher in hypoMSCs than in norMSCs.  analysis revealed that both hypoMSCs and norMSCs reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, oxidative stress, and fibrosis compared to that in control mice in a dose-dependent manner. However, hypoMSCs had stronger therapeutic effects than norMSCs. We confirmed this observation by an  study in which hypoMSCs changed macrophage polarity to an anti-inflammatory phenotype via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulation. In addition, miR210 reduced the rate of hepatocyte apoptosis. Intravital imaging after MSC administration showed that both cell types were primarily trapped in the lungs. Relatively a few hypoMSCs and norMSCs migrated to the liver. There were no significant differences in their distributions.The therapeutic effect of hypoMSCs was mediated by PGE2 and miR210 production and was greater than that of norMSCs. Therefore, MSCs can be manipulated to improve their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of liver cirrhosis and could potentially serve in effective cell therapy. MSCs produce several factors with multidirectional effects and function as "conducting cells" in liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

Patients with both T2DM and  have increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes, leading to higher risk for mortality and morbidity. We built a Markov model with 1-year cycles and 20-year horizon to estimate the economic burden of  with T2DM in the U.S.Cohort size was determined by population size, prevalence of T2DM, and prevalence and incidence of  in 2017. The model includes 10 health states: NAFL, -fibrosis stages 0-3, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 year post-liver transplant, post-liver transplant, and liver-related, cardiovascular, and background mortality. Transition probabilities were calculated from meta-analyses and literature. Annual costs for  and T2DM were taken from literature and billing codes.We estimated that there were 18. million people in the U.S. living with T2DM and NAFLD, of which 6.4 million had . Twenty-year costs for NAFLD in these patients were $55.8 billion. Over the next 20 years,  with T2DM will account for 65,000 transplants, 1.37 million cardiovascular-related deaths, and 812,000 liver-related deaths.This model predicts significant clinical and economic burden due to  with T2DM over the next 20 years. In fact, this burden may be greater since we assumed conservative inputs for our model and did not increase costs or the incidence of T2DM over time. It is highly likely that interventions reducing morbidity and mortality in  patients with T2DM could potentially reduce this projected clinical and economic burden.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557180>Coralline algal calcification: A morphological and process-based understanding.</a></h1><p>Coralline algae are key biological substrates of many carbonate systems globally. Their capacity to build enduring crusts that underpin the formation of tropical reefs, rhodolith beds and other benthic substrate is dependent on the formation of a calcified thallus. However, this important process of skeletal carbonate formation is not well understood. We undertook a study of cellular carbonate features to develop a model for calcification. We describe two types of cell wall calcification; 1) calcified primary cell wall (PCW) in the thin-walled elongate cells such as central medullary cells in articulated corallines and hypothallial cells in crustose coralline algae (CCA), ) calcified secondary cell wall (SCW) with radial Mg-calcite crystals in thicker-walled rounded cortical cells of articulated corallines and perithallial cells of CCA. The distinctive banding found in many rhodoliths is the regular transition from PCW-only cells to SCW cells. Within the cell walls there can be bands of elevated Mg with Mg content of a few mol% higher than radial Mg-calcite (M-type), ranging up to dolomite composition (D-type).We propose the following three-step model for calcification. 1) A thin (< 0.5 μm) PCW forms and is filled with a mineralising fluid of organic compounds and seawater. Nanometer-scale Mg-calcite grains precipitate on the organic structures within the PCW. ) Crystalline cellulose microfibrils (CMF) are extruded perpendicularly from the cellulose synthase complexes (CSC) in the plasmalemma to form the SCW. 3) The CMF soaks in the mineralising fluid as it extrudes and becomes calcified, retaining the perpendicular form, thus building the radial calcite. In Clathromorphum, SCW formation lags PCW creating a zone of weakness resulting in a split in the sub-surface crust. All calcification seems likely to be a bioinduced rather than controlled process. These findings are a substantial step forward in understanding how corallines calcify.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411894>Digoxin improves steatohepatitis with differential involvement of liver cell subsets in mice through inhibition of PKM2 transactivation.</a></h1><p>The cardiac glycoside digoxin was identified as a potent suppressor of pyruvate kinase isoform -hypoxia-inducible factor-α (PKM2-HIF-1α) pathway activation in liver injury mouse models via intraperitoneal injection. We have assessed the therapeutic effects of digoxin to reduce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () by the clinically relevant oral route in mice and analyzed the cellular basis for this effect with differential involvement of liver cell subsets. C57BL/6J male mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 wk and started concurrently with the gavage of digoxin (.5, 0.5, 0.125 mg/kg twice a week) for 5 wk. Digoxin significantly reduced HFD-induced hepatic damage, steatosis, and liver inflammation across a wide dosage range. The lowest dose of digoxin (0.125 mg/kg) showed significant protective effects against liver injury and sterile inflammation. Consistently, digoxin attenuated HIF-1α sustained NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. We have reported for the first time that PKM2 is upregulated in hepatocytes with hepatic steatosis, and digoxin directly improved hepatocyte mitochondrial dysfunction and steatosis. Mechanistically, digoxin directly bound to PKM2 and inhibited PKM2 targeting HIF-1α transactivation without affecting PKM2 enzyme activation. Thus, oral digoxin showed potential to therapeutically inhibit liver injury in  through the regulation of PKM2-HIF-1α pathway activation with involvement of multiple cell types. Because of the large clinical experience with oral digoxin, this may have significant clinical applicability in human . This study is the first to assess the therapeutic efficacy of oral digoxin on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model and to determine the divergent of cell type-specific effects. Oral digoxin reduced liver damage, steatosis, and inflammation in HFD mice. Digoxin attenuated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α axis-sustained inflammasome activity in macrophages and hepatic oxidative stress response in hepatocytes via the regulation of PKM2-HIF-1α axis pathway activation.

Siloed patient care across separate health care systems can negatively impact quality and safety of patient care. The purpose of the project discussed in this article is to effectively engage stakeholders from separate primary care and mental health organizations to develop an ideal cross-organization communication system to improve metabolic monitoring for their comanaged patients prescribed second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs).The mixed method approach of group concept mapping was used to engage stakeholders across a nonaffiliated primary care clinic and a community mental health organization over the time period of March 2018 through May 2018.Three important domains in communication were identified: (1) process/workflow, () advocacy, and (3) a patient-centered focus. Seven high priority/easier to implement brainstormed items were identified and resulted in practice changes across both organizations, including developing a standard release of information, identifying a point person from each clinic focused on cross-organization care coordination, endorsing an SGA monitoring protocol across organizations, agreeing that metabolic monitoring of SGAs will be the responsibility of the primary care clinicians, beginning monthly medication reconciliation and cross-organization care conferences, developing standard electronic health record documentation, and providing education.Care coordination across all health systems is critical to optimize patient care for chronic medical and psychiatric conditions.

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and liver elastography tests, defining the level of liver fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to liver biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their liver disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had  at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to liver disease.

Iron is an essential micronutrient for organisms. Once excess iron is accumulated in vital organs, dysfunctions of these organs can occur via the generation of reactive oxygen species. Hepatic iron overload is often seen in CLD patients. In  patients, iron accumulation in the liver is positively correlated with histological severity. Thus iron overload can contribute to progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to . In a rat model of , feeding of high-fat and high-iron diet increases hepatic inflammation with increased hepatic cytokine expression compared with feeding of high-fat diet only. In this model, iron is intensely accumulated in Kupffer cells/macrophages within the lesion, raising the possibility that iron-laden Kupffer cells/macrophages can play a key role in the enhancement of hepatic inflammation in  condition. On the other hand, in a rat model of liver cirrhosis, dietary iron overload clearly abrogates the development and progression of liver cirrhosis induced by repeated administration of thioacetamide (TAA). These findings suggest that iron overload can promote or suppress chronic liver diseases depending on the tissue microenvironment.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of combined preoperative biembolization and portal vein embolization (PVE).This study was performed between 2010 and 2017. From 2010 to 2014, patients only underwent preoperative PVE. After 2014, BE was proposed as an alternative to PVE. Liver volumetry was assessed by a CT-scan before BE or PVE and then three weeks later.During the study period, 72 patients underwent radiological procedures that included 41 PVE (PVE group) and 31 BE (BE group). The time elapsing between the procedure and surgery was similar (p = 0.760). The mean percentage of FLR ratio hypertrophy in the PVE group was 31.9% (±34), but reached 51.% (±42) in the BE group (p = 0.018) and this difference remained significant under multivariate analysis that included age, gender, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis and .

For the 858 non-migrant travelers, common source countries were Bolivia (n=156, 18.%) and Costa Rica (n=97, 11.3%), while for migrants, they were Syria (n=34, 35%) and Afghanistan (n=22, 22.7%). Ninety-nine travelers (10%) acquired their disease on trips of ≤ weeks. Of 274 cases for which species identification was available, Leishmania Viannia braziliensis was the most well represented strain (n=117, 42.7%), followed by L. major (n=40, 14.6%), and L. V. panamensis (n=38, 13.9%). Forty cases of MCL occurred, most commonly in tourists (n=29, 72.5%) and from Bolivia (n=18, 45%). 10% of MCL cases were acquired in the Old World.Amongst GeoSentinel reporting sites, CL is predominantly a disease of tourists traveling mostly to countries in Central and South America such as Bolivia where risk of acquiring L. V. braziliensis and subsequent MCL is high. The finding that some travelers acquired leishmaniasis on trips of short duration challenges the common notion that CL is a disease of prolonged travel. Migrants from areas of conflict and political instability, such as Afghanistan and Syria, were well represented, suggesting that as mass migration of refugees continues, CL will be increasingly encountered in intake countries.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Increasingly, these parameters include MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MR elastography (MRE)-derived shear stiffness as biomarkers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. Understanding fluctuations in these measures is essential for calculating trial sample sizes, interpreting results, and planning clinical drug trials in children with NAFLD. Lack of such data in children comprises a critical knowledge gap. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess whole-liver MRI-PDFF change in adolescents with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () over 12 weeks.Adolescents 12-19 years with biopsy-proven  undergoing standard-of-care treatment were enrolled. Baseline and week-12 assessments of anthropometrics, transaminases, MRI-PDFF, and MRE-stiffness were obtained.Fifteen adolescents were included (mean age 15.7 [SD .9] years). Hepatic MRI-PDFF was stable over 12 weeks (mean absolute change -0.8%, p = 0.24). Correlation between baseline and week-12 values of MRI-PDFF was high (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 - 0.99). MRE-stiffness was stable (mean percentage change .7%, p = 0.44); correlation between baseline and week-12 values was moderate (ICC = 0.47; 95% CI: 0, 0.79). Changes in weight, BMI, and aminotransferases were not statistically significant.In adolescents with , fluctuations in hepatic MRI-PDFF and MRE-stiffness over 12 weeks of standard-of-care were small. These data on the natural fluctuations in quantitative imaging biomarkers can serve as a reference for interventional trials in pediatric  and inform the interpretation and planning of clinical trials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h1><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), but there is scarcity of data for lean  subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean .We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven  patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and /6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean .© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving lipid metabolism, antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of . The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved lipid homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As, mitochondria are intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and important sites of lipid metabolism, we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in palmitic acid (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti- potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The botanical natural product silymarin, which has been investigated as a treatment of , contains flavonolignans that inhibit organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter function. The purpose of this study was to assess the individual and combined effects of  and silymarin on the disposition of the model OATP substrate pitavastatin. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a control or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet ( model) for 8 weeks. Silymarin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle followed by pitavastatin (0.5 mg/kg) were administered intravenously, and the pharmacokinetics were determined.  increased mean total flavonolignan area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 1.7-fold. Silymarin increased pitavastatin AUC in both control and  animals approx. -fold.  increased pitavastatin plasma concentrations from  to 40 minutes, but AUC was unchanged. The combination of silymarin and  had the greatest effect on pitavastatin AUC, which increased .9-fold compared with control vehicle-treated animals.  increased the total amount of pitavastatin excreted into the bile .7-fold compared with control animals, whereas silymarin decreased pitavastatin biliary clearance approx. 3-fold in both control and  animals. This double hit of  and silymarin on hepatic uptake transporters is another example of a multifactorial pharmacokinetic interaction that may have a greater impact on drug disposition than each hit alone. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Multifactorial effects on xenobiotic pharmacokinetics are within the next frontier for precision medicine research and clinical application. The combination of silymarin and  is a probable clinical scenario that can affect drug uptake, liver concentrations, biliary elimination, and ultimately, efficacy and toxicity.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521175>Variations in hepatic lipid species of age-matched male mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient diet and housed in different animal facilities.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a common disease and feeding mice a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet is a frequently used model to study its pathophysiology. Genetic and environmental factors influence  development and liver lipid content, which was studied herein using C57BL/6 J mice bred in two different animal facilities.Age-matched male C57BL/6 J mice bred in two different animal facilities (later on referred to as WT1 and WT2) at the University Hospital of Regensburg were fed identical MCD or control chows for  weeks. Hepatic gene and protein expression and lipid composition were determined. was associated with increased hepatic triglycerides, which were actually higher in WT1 than WT2 liver in both dietary groups. Cholesterol contributes to hepatic injury but was only elevated in WT2  liver. Ceramides account for insulin resistance and cell death, and ceramide species d18:1/16:0 and d18:1/18:0 were higher in the  liver of both groups. Saturated sphingomyelins only declined in WT1  liver. Lysophosphatidylcholine concentrations were quite normal in  and only one of the 12 altered phosphatidylcholine species declined in  liver of both groups. Very few phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol species were comparably regulated in  liver of both animal groups. Seven of these lipid species declined and two increased in . Notably, hepatic mRNA expression of proinflammatory (F4/80, CD68, IL-6, TNF and chemerin) and profibrotic genes (TGF beta and alpha SMA) was comparable in WT1 and WT2 mice.Mice housed and bred in different animal facilities had comparable disease severity of  whereas liver lipids varied among the groups. Thus, there was no specific lipid signature for  in the MCD model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497990>Characteristics and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver.</a></h1><p>the characteristics, screening, and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for patients without cirrhosis have not been fully studied.A retrospective cohort study was performed in non-cirrhotic patients with histological HCC, between January 2004 and October 2018. Their characteristics, treatment, follow-up and overall survival were described.25 of the 332 patients with HCC met the inclusion criteria (7.5%), 76% were males and the median age was 69.9 years. The main etiology of liver disease was the hepatitis B virus (HBV) (32%), followed by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () (20%). Liver fibrosis was mild (0-1) in 44% of cases. The nodule was diagnosed by ultrasonography in 32% of cases, 60% were found incidentally and 8% due to clinical symptoms. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging was 0 in 4% of cases, A in 88%, B in 4% and C in 4%. The main initial treatment was surgical resection (76%) and 8% refused to be treated. Percutaneous ethanol injection, chemoembolization, sorafenib and palliative care were each performed in 4% of cases. There were some complications in 21% of patients treated with surgery, half of them were severe. The median follow-up was 22. (.9-150.6) months and 56% were in remission and the median overall survival was 57.4 ± 29.8 months. The overall cumulative survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 84%, 61.6% and 47.9%, respectively.7.5% of HCC presented without cirrhosis and almost half of patients had mild fibrosis. HBV was the main cause of HCC, followed by . The most frequent BCLC stage at diagnosis was early stage and surgery was the most common treatment. Overall cumulative survival at 5 years was almost 50%.</p></html>
