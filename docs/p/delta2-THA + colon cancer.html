Here we aim to identify new molecular targets in  neuroendocrine carcinomas (co-NEC) and proof the efficacy of matching drugs.We performed a  analysis of co-NEC to identify genetic or epigenetic alterations that could be exploited as effective drug targets. We compared co-NEC samples with colorectal carcinomas (CRC) to identify neuroendocrine specific traits. Patients with co-NEC and derived-xenografts (PDX) were treated with a BRAFV600E blocking drug to demonstrate sensitivity.co-NEC and CRC are similar in their mutational repertoire, although co-NECs are particularly enriched in  mutations. We report for the first time that  mutant  neuroendocrine carcinomas may benefit from BRAF inhibition in monotherapy and how EGFR status is essential to predict innate sensitivity and acquired resistance by a differential methylation of its gene regulatory regions.The identification of  mutations in high grade  neuroendocrine carcinomas has allowed the description of radiological responses to combination therapy of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in basket clinical trials. However, the molecular rationale for this treatment combination was based on the presence of the BRAF mutation and the efficacy observed in other  types such as melanoma. Future drug development in this setting should test BRAF inhibitors upfront and the addition of anti-EGFR antibodies instead of MEK inhibitors for an efficient blockade of acquired resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662984>Spica Prunellae Extract Enhances Fluorouracil Sensitivity of 5-Fluorouracil-Resistant Human  Carcinoma HCT-8/5-FU Cells via TOP2 and miR-494.</a></h2><p>The use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been proven benefits, but it also has adverse events in colorectal  (CRC) chemotherapy. In this study, we explored the mechanism of 5-FU resistance by bioinformatics analysis of the NCBI public dataset series GSE81005. Fifteen hub genes were screened out of 582 different expressed genes. Modules of the hub genes in protein-protein interaction networks gathered to TOP2 showed a decrease in HCT-8 cells but an increase in 5-FU-resistant HCT-8/5-FU cells with 5-FU exposure. Downregulation of TOP2 with siRNA or miR-494 transfection resulted in an increase of cytotoxicity and decrease of cell colonies to 5-FU for HCT-8/5-FU cells. Moreover, we found that an ethanol extract of Spica Prunellae (EESP), which is a traditional Chinese medicine with clinically beneficial effects in various cancers, was able to enhance the sensitivity of 5-FU in HCT-8/5-FU cells and partly reverse the 5-FU resistance effect. It significantly helped suppress cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in HCT-8/5-FU cells with the expression of TOP2 being significantly suppressed, which increased by 5-FU. Consistently, miR-494, which reportedly regulates TOP2, exhibited reverse trends in EESP/5-FU combination treatment. These results suggested that Spica Prunellae may be beneficial in the treatment of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients.Copyright © 2019 Yi Fang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626644>Genetically determined serum urate levels and cardiovascular and other diseases in UK Biobank cohort: A phenome-wide mendelian randomization study.</a></h2><p>The role of urate in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has been extensively investigated in observational studies; however, the extent of any causal effect remains unclear, making it difficult to evaluate its clinical relevance.A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) together with a Bayesian analysis of tree-structured phenotypic model (TreeWAS) was performed to examine disease outcomes related to genetically determined serum urate levels in 339,256 unrelated White British individuals (54% female) in the UK Biobank who were aged 40-69 years (mean age, 56.87; SD, 7.99) when recruited from 2006 to 2010. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to replicate significant findings using various genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine possible pleiotropic effects on metabolic traits of the genetic variants used as instruments for urate. PheWAS analysis, examining the association with 1,431 disease outcomes, identified 13 distinct phecodes representing 4 disease groups (inflammatory polyarthropathies, hypertensive disease, circulatory disease, and metabolic disorders) and 9 disease outcomes (gout, gouty arthropathy, pyogenic arthritis, essential hypertension, coronary atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, chronic ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and hypercholesterolemia) that were associated with genetically determined serum urate levels after multiple testing correction (p < 3.35 × 10-4). TreeWAS analysis, examining 10,750 ICD-10 diagnostic terms, identified more sub-phenotypes of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., angina pectoris, heart failure, cerebral infarction). MR analysis successfully replicated the association with gout, hypertension, heart diseases, and blood lipid levels but indicated the existence of genetic pleiotropy. Sensitivity analyses support an inference that pleiotropic effects of genetic variants on urate and metabolic traits contribute to the observational associations with CVDs. The main limitations of this study relate to possible bias from pleiotropic effects of the considered genetic variants and possible misclassification of cases for mild disease that did not require hospitalization.In this study, high serum urate levels were found to be associated with increased risk of different types of cardiac events. The finding of genetic pleiotropy indicates the existence of common upstream pathological elements influencing both urate and metabolic traits, and this may suggest new opportunities and challenges for developing drugs targeting a common mediator that would be beneficial for both the treatment of gout and the prevention of cardiovascular comorbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650063>The prediction incidence of the three most common cancers among Iranian military community during 2007-2019: a time series analysis.</a></h2><p>Cancers are one of the most important public health problems in Iran.

Although anti- drug oxaliplatin (Oxa) effectively inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, the growing resistance and side-effects make it urgent to improve the therapeutic strategy of Oxa. Although Oxa induces the autophagy process, the role of PFKFB3 in this process remains unknown. In addition, whether PFKFB3 affects the cytotoxicity of Oxa has not been investigated. Here, we show that Oxa-inhibited cell proliferation and migration concomitant with the induction of apoptosis and autophagy in SW480 cells. Both inhibition of autophagy by small molecule inhibitors and siRNA modification decreased the cell viability loss and apoptosis induced by Oxa. Utilizing quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, we observed that Oxa increased PFKFB3 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, suppression of PFKFB3 attenuated both the basal and Oxa-induced autophagy, by monitoring the autophagic flux and phosphorylated-Ulk1, which play essential roles in autophagy initiation. Moreover, PFKFB3 inhibition further inhibited the cell proliferation/migration, and cell viability decreased by Oxa. Collectively, the presented data demonstrated that PFKFB3 inhibition attenuated Oxa-induced autophagy and enhanced its cytotoxicity in colorectal  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626056>American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable Report on Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and  Prevention and Control.</a></h2><p>The American College of Sports Medicine convened an International Multidisciplinary Roundtable on Exercise and  in March 2018 to evaluate and translate the evidence linking physical activity and  prevention, treatment, and control.

Minimizing time spent in sedentary behavior may also lower risk of endometrial,  and lung cancers. Conversely, physical activity is associated with higher risk of melanoma, a serious form of skin . Further, physical activity before and after a  diagnosis is also likely to be relevant for improved survival for those diagnosed with breast and ; with data suggesting that postdiagnosis physical activity provides greater mortality benefits than prediagnosis physical activity.Collectively, there is consistent, compelling evidence that physical activity plays a role in preventing many types of  and for improving longevity among  survivors, although the evidence related to higher risk of melanoma demonstrates the importance of sun safe practices while being physically active. Together, these findings underscore the importance of physical activity in  prevention and control.

A lot of investigations have confirmed the involvement of CCAT2 in the tumorigenesis of many  types. Previous studies found that over-expression of CCAT2 significantly promoted cell migration and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells. In the present investigation, the clinical value and prognostic significance of CCAT2 were investigated.The 122 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues were acquired between September 2013 and February 2018. The expression levels of CCAT2 in HCC tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal liver tissues were examined by RT-qPCR analysis. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. Independent prognostic indicators were determined in the multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model.CCAT2 expression levels were significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to that in their normal counterparts (P < .001). CCAT2 expression was significantly correlated with vascular invasion (P = .001), histopathologic grading (P = .001), distant metastasis (P = .002) and TNM stage (P = .018). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the overall survival rate of HCC patients in high CCAT2 expression group markedly decreased as compared with that of low CCAT2 expression group (P = .016). In addition, COX multivariate analysis showed that high expression of CCAT2 was an independent risk factor for predicting shorter overall survival time in HCC (HR = 2.126, 95%CI:1.273-8.775, P = .021).Taken together, this research revealed that lncRNA CCAT2 may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting overall survival time in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637417>Transanal ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis has comparable long-term functional outcomes to transabdominal approach: a multicentre comparative study.</a></h2><p>The transanal approach to ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (Ta-IPAA) provides better access to the lower pelvis with lower short-term morbidity in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to assess the long-term functional outcomes after Ta-IPAA versus transabdominal IPAA (Abd-IPAA) in UC.A multicentre cohort analysis was done between March 2002 and September 2017. Patient characteristics, surgical details and postoperative outcomes were compared. CGQL (Cleveland global quality of life) score at 12 months with a functioning pouch was considered the primary endpoint.A total of 374 patients (100 Ta-IPAA vs 274 Abd-IPAA) were included. Ta-IPAA demonstrated a comparable overall quality of life (CGQL score) to Abd-IPAA (0.75 ± 0.11 vs 0.71 ± 0.14; respectively, p=0.1). Quality of life (7.71 ± 1.17 vs 7.30 ± 1.46; p=0.04) and energy level items (7.16 ± 1.52 vs 6.66 ± 1.68; p=0.03) were significantly better after Ta-IPAA, while the quality of health item was comparable (7.68 ± 1.26 vs 7.64 ± 1.44; p=0.96). Analysis excluding anastomotic leaks did not change the overall CGQL scores. Stool frequencies (>10/ 24 hrs:22% vs 21%; p=1.0) and the rate of single episode of major incontinence during the 12-month period (27% vs 26%; p=0.89) were similar.

We sought to determine if completeness of preoperative care was associated with pathologic specimen quality and postoperative morbidity.Clinical stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent elective low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection were identified from the 2016-2017 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. The 3 preoperative NSQIP variables (colonoscopy, stoma marking, and neoadjuvant chemoradiation) were used to divide patients into 2 cohorts: complete vs incomplete preoperative care. The primary outcome was a composite higher pathologic specimen quality score (>12 lymph nodes, negative circumferential, and negative distal margins). The secondary outcome was 30-day morbidity. Preoperative characteristics were compared with ANOVAs and chi-square tests. Outcomes measures were evaluated with logistic regression.We identified 1,125 patients: 591 (52.5%) complete and 534 (47.5%) incomplete. The complete group was younger, had more women, lower-third rectal tumors, clinical stage III disease, and neoadjuvant treatment. The complete group had higher odds of better pathologic specimen quality after adjusting for age, sex, tumor location, stage, and neoadjuvant therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.75, p = 0.001). The complete group had decreased rates of transfusions (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, p < 0.001), postoperative ileus (OR 0.67, p = 0.01), sepsis (OR 0.32, p = 0.01), and readmissions (OR 0.60, p = 0.003). Other complications did not statistically differ between groups.Complete preoperative care in rectal adenocarcinoma is associated with higher pathologic specimen quality and reduced postoperative morbidity.

Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived adipokine, whose levels are reduced during obesity. Both epidemiological and preclinical data indicate that adiponectin suppresses  tumorigenesis. We have previously demonstrated that both adiponectin and AdipoRon, a small-molecule adiponectin receptor agonist, suppress  risk in part by reducing the number of Lgr5 stem cells in mouse  organoids. However, the mechanism by which the adiponectin signaling pathway attenuates  risk remains to be addressed. Here, we have hypothesized that adiponectin signaling supports  stem cell maintenance through modulation of the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane (PM). Specifically, we investigated the effects of adiponectin receptor activation by AdipoRon on the biophysical perturbations linked to the attenuation of Wnt-driven signaling and cell proliferation as determined by LEF luciferase reporter assay and  organoid proliferation, respectively. Using physicochemical sensitive dyes, Di-4-ANEPPDHQ and C-laurdan, we demonstrated that AdipoRon decreased the rigidity of the  cell PM. The decrease in membrane rigidity was associated with a reduction in PM free cholesterol levels and the intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol in lysosomes. These results suggest that adiponectin signaling plays a role in modulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis, PM biophysical properties, and Wnt-driven signaling. These findings are noteworthy because they may in part explain how obesity drives  progression.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mice bearing subcutaneous CT26  tumors were injected i.v. with 1 g/kg (535 mg iodine/kg) IX-lipo, and  CT and CEST MR images were acquired on day 3. CT and CEST MR images were also acquired for tumor-bearing mice co-injected with IX-lipo and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α).In addition to CT contrast, IX-lipo exhibited a strong CEST contrast similar to its non-liposomal form, with a detectability of ~2 nM per liposome. Both CT imaging and CEST MRI showed that i.v. injection of IX-lipo resulted in a rim enhancement of CT26 tumors with a heterogeneous central distribution. In contrast, co-injection of TNF-α caused a significantly augmented CT/MRI contrast in the tumor center. The intratumoral biodistribution of IX-lipo correlated well to the rhodamine patterns observed with fluorescence microscopy.We have developed a CT/MRI bimodal imaging approach for monitoring the delivery and biodistribution of liposomes by loading them with the clinically approved X-ray/CT contrast agent iodixanol.

Therefore, further identification of genes related to those malignant tumors is of great significance for the improvement of management of the diseases. The database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository was used as the data source of gene expression profiles in this study. Malignant tumors genes were selected using a feature selection algorithm of maximal relevance and minimal redundancy (mRMR) and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. And finally selected 20 genes as potential related genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed on the potential related genes, and different tumor-specific genes and similarities and differences between network modules and pathways were analyzed. Further, using the potential -related genes found above in this study as features, a support vector machine (SVM) model was developed to predict high-risk malignant tumors. As a result, the prediction accuracy reached more than 85%, indicating that such a model can effectively predict the four types of malignant tumors. It is demonstrated that such genes found above in this study indeed play important roles in the differentiation of the four types of malignant tumors, providing basis for future experimental biological validation and shedding some light on the understanding of new molecular mechanisms related to the four types of tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624871> in the young: contributing factors and short-term surgical outcomes.</a></h2><p>The incidence in young patients has increased significantly over the last few decades.

Patients were stratified into two groups: early-onset CC (< 50 years old) and late-onset CC (≥ 50 years old). Outcome measures were hospital length of stay, 30-day complications, mortality, and readmission.We included a total of 15,957 patients in the analysis. Mean age was 65 ± 13 years, and 52% were male. Overall 10% of the patients had early-onset CC. Patients with early-onset CC were more likely to be black (11% vs 7%, p = 0.04) and Hispanic (8% vs 4%, p = 0.02). Additionally, they presented with a more aggressive tumor and higher TNM staging. Patients with early onset CC had lower 30-day complications (18% vs 22%, p = 0.02), shorter hospital length of stay (6[3-8] vs 8[5-11], p = 0.03) and lower 30-day mortality (0.4% vs 1.8%, p = 0.04) compared to their counterparts. However, there was no difference between the two groups regarding 30-day readmission. On regression analysis, there was no difference between the two groups regarding study outcomes.Racial disparity does exist in the incidence of  in the young with higher incidence in blacks.

NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE to generate 15-keto PGE. 15-PGDH has been known as a tumor suppressor in various malignancies including . However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of 15-PGDH remain largely unresolved. In this study, we found that 15-keto PGE upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a representative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both transcriptional and translational levels in human  epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. A redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) plays a critical role in the regulation of HO-1 and other cytoprotective proteins. 15-Keto PGE induced translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity. Furthermore, the silencing of the Nrf2 gene abolished 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression in CCD 841 CoN cells. 15-Keto PGE activated AKT signaling, and the pharmacological AKT inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed the 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression. 15-Keto PGE generates the reactive oxygen species which is suppressed by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment attenuated the 15-keto PGE-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and subsequently HO-1 expression. However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety failed to induce reactive oxygen species, HO-1 expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2.

We describe a novel circulating tumor cell (CTC) platform to capture colorectal epithelial cells associated with CRC and adenomas.Blood was collected from 667 Taiwanese adults from 2012 to 2018 before a colonoscopy. The study population included healthy control subjects, patients with adenomas, and those with stage I-IV CRC. CTCs were isolated from the blood using the CellMax platform. The isolated cells were enumerated, and an algorithm was used to determine the likelihood of detecting adenoma or CRC. Nominal and ordinal logistic regression demonstrated that CTC counts could identify adenomas and CRC, including CRC stage.The CellMax test demonstrated a significant association between CTC counts and worsening disease status (Cuzick's P value < 0.0001) with respect to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The test showed high specificity (86%) and sensitivity across all CRC stages (95%) and adenomatous lesions (79%). The area under the curve was 0.940 and 0.868 for the detection of CRC and adenomas, respectively.The blood-based CTC platform demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting adenomas and CRC, as well as reasonable specificity in an enriched symptomatic patient population.If these results are reproduced in an average risk population, this test has the potential to prevent CRC by improving patient compliance and detecting precancerous adenomas, eventually reducing CRC mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644410>Mechanism of a Novel Camptothecin-Deoxycholic Acid Derivate Induced Apoptosis Against Human Liver  HepG2 Cells and Human  HCT116 Cells.</a></h2><p>Camptothecin (CPT) hasis been known as an anticancer drug in traditional Chinese medicine.

On the day before operation, fluorescent clips (ZEOCLIP FS: Zeon Medical co, Ltd, Tokyo) were endoscopically placed around the tumor and polyp sites, 4 clips for each lesion attached every 90 degrees within the  lumen, respectively. During the operation, locations of the fluorescent clips were easily confirmed using a full-color fluorescent laparoscope, VISION SENSE (Medtronic Co., U.S.). Curative operation was performed accordingly with the preoperative pathological and radiological findings. The postoperative course was uneventful.Locations of intraluminally placed fluorescent clips were clearly and easily recognized through the serosal layer of the intestinal wall using a fluorescent laparoscope. Complications related to dye scattering or intestinal wall/other organ perforation were not observed suggesting that future incorporation of this tumor site marking technique into laparoscopic surgery might be beneficial.The fluorescent marking clips were easily placed and recognized with a fluorescent laparoscope.

An area of fascination and great potential is the human microbiome. Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiota has significant roles in an individual's ability to avoid , with considerable focus on the gut microbiome and colorectal . That in mind, racial disparities with regard to colorectal  treatment and prevention are generally understudied despite higher incidence and mortality rates among Non-Hispanic Blacks compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. A comprehension of ethnic differences with relation to colorectal , dietary habits and the microbiome is a meritorious area of investigation. This review highlights literature that identifies and bridges the gap in understanding the role of the human microbiome in racial disparities across colorectal . Herein, we explore the differences in the gut microbiota, common short chain fatty acids produced in abundance by microbes, and their association with racial differences in  acquisition.©The Author(s) 2019.

The major histocompatibility complex class I-related molecules A and B (MICA and MICB) are NKG2D ligands that play important roles in tumor immune surveillance. In the present study, by a combined bioinformatics prediction and experimental approach, we identify BCL11B 3'-UTR as a putative MICA and MICB ceRNA. We demonstrate in several human cell lines of different origins that the knockdown of BCL11B downregulates surface expression of MICA and MICB. Furthermore, we demonstrate miRNA dependency of BCL11B-mediated MICA and MICB regulation in Dicer knockdown HCT116 cells. In addition, MICA/B-targeting miRNAs (miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a, and miR-106b) repressed the expression of BCL11B by targeting its 3'-UTR. Moreover, we showed that the BCL11B knockdown-mediated downregulation of MICA/B resulted in reduced NK cell elimination in vitro and in vivo through reduced recognition of NKG2D. Of particular significance, BCL11B displays tumor-suppressive properties. The expression of BCL11B is downregulated in  tissues and associated with a reduced median survival of  patients. Taken together, our study revealed a new mechanism of BCL11B that prevents immune evasion of cancerous cells by upregulation of the NKG2D ligands MICA and MICB in a ceRNA manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637159>Real-Time Imaging of Ammonia Release from Single Live Cells via Liquid Crystal Droplets Immobilized on the Cell Membrane.</a></h2><p>Tumor cells exhibit prominent metabolic alterations through which they acclimatize to their stressful microenvironment. These cells have a high rate of glutaminolysis and release ammonia (NH) as a byproduct, which may function as a diffusible signal among  cells and can reveal cellular heterogeneity. E7, a nematic liquid crystal (LC), is doped with 4-pentyl-4'-biphenyl carboxylic acid (PBA) and encapsulated in polymeric microcapsules (P-E7), which are then immobilized on cells in a microfluidic channel. Normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and myeloma, human primary glioblastoma (U87), human  carcinoma (Caco-2), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells are investigated for the release of NH. The P-E7 is able to visualize NH release from the cell via a radial-to-bipolar (R-B) orientation change, observed through a polarized optical microscope. The various cell lines significantly differ in their response time required for an R-B change. The mean response times for Caco-2, U87, and MCF-7 cells are 277, 155, and 121 s, respectively. NH release from a single cell captured in a microwell flow chip shows a similar R-B change. The P-E7 droplets technology could be applied to other multiple targets by functionalizing LCs with different probes.© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Different sites of colorectal  (CRC) are different in many aspects, including clinical symptoms, biological behaviour, and prognosis.This study aimed to analyse prognosis, genes, bacteria, fungi, and microbial metabolome in different sites of CRC.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and STAT were used to statistically describe and analyse the prognosis in different sites of CRC. RNA sequences of CRC from Broad Institute's GDAC Firehose were re-annotated and reanalysed based on different sites using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse the prognosis and Cytoscape was used to construct a drug-target network based on DGIdb databases. Bacterial 16S V3-V4 and fungal ITS V3-V4 ribosomal RNA genes of stool samples were sequenced. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) was performed to detect the microbial metabolites in stool samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare distinct gut microorganisms and microbial metabolites between rectal and sigmoid cancers.The prognosis in CRC with different sites is significantly different. The closer to the anus predicted longer survival time. The difference between genes and co-expression pairs in CRC with different sites were constructed. The relative abundance of 112 mRNAs and 26 lncRNAs correlated with the sites of CRC were listed. Nine differentially expressed genes at different sites of CRC were correlated with prognosis. A drug-gene interaction network contained 227 drug-gene pairs were built. The relative abundance of gut bacteria and gut fungus, and the content of microbe-related metabolites were statistically different between rectal and sigmoid cancers.There are many differences in prognosis, genome, drug targets, gut microbiome, and microbial metabolome in different colorectal  sites. These findings may improve our understanding of the role of the CRC sites in personalized and precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648389>Establishment and characterization of a novel neuroendocrine carcinoma cell line derived from a human ascending  tumor.</a></h2><p>The incidence of rare neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is rapidly increasing. Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a NET with poorly differentiated histological features, high proliferative properties and associated poor prognoses. Since these carcinomas are so rare, and thus, affect only a small number of patients allowing for few cell lines to be derived from patient biopsies, the histological, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics associated with colorectal NEC and NECs in other organs, have yet to be clearly defined. Herein, we describe the establishment of a novel NEC cell line (SS-2) derived from a tumor resection of the ascending  from a 59-year-old Japanese woman. The histological, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical features of chromogranin A (CgA) as well as the confirmation of synaptophysin positivity in this tumor were typical of those commonly observed in surgically resected colorectal NECs. Further, the Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumor was > 20 %, and thus, the tumor was diagnosed as an NEC of the ascending . The SS-2 cell line maintained characteristic features to those of the resected tumor, which were further retained following implantation into the subcutaneous tissues of nude mice. Additionally, when SS-2 cells were seeded into ultra-low attachment plates they formed spheres that expressed higher levels of the  stem cell (CSC) marker CD133 compared to SS-2 cells cultured under adherent conditions. SS-2 cells may, therefore, contribute to the current knowledge on midgut NEC biological behaviors, while providing a novel platform for examining the effects of colorectal NEC drugs, including CSC.© 2019 The Authors.

The primary aims of this population-based, observational study were to (a) investigate the association between the novel European Organisation for Research and Treatment of  Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30 (QLQ-C30) summary score and all-cause mortality, adjusting for the more traditional sociodemographic and clinical prognostic factors; and (b) compare the prognostic value of the QLQ-C30 summary score with the global quality of life (QoL) and physical functioning scales of the QLQ-C30.Between 2008 and 2015, patients with  (12 tumor types) were invited to participate in PROFILES disease-specific registry studies (response rate, 69%). In this secondary analysis of 6,895 patients, multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between the QLQ-C30 scores and all-cause mortality.In the overall Cox regression model including sociodemographic and clinical variables, the QLQ-C30 summary score was associated significantly with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 99% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.82). In stratified analyses, significant associations between the summary score and all-cause mortality were observed for , rectal, and prostate , non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. The QLQ-C30 summary score had a stronger association with all-cause mortality than the global QoL scale (HR, 0.82; 99% CI, 0.77-0.86) or the physical functioning scale (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85).In a real-world setting, the QLQ-C30 summary score has a strong prognostic value for overall survival for a number of populations of patients with  above and beyond that provided by clinical and sociodemographic variables. The QLQ-C30 summary score appears to have more prognostic value than the global QoL, physical functioning, or any other scale within the QLQ-C30.The finding that health-related quality of life provides distinct prognostic information beyond known sociodemographic and clinical measures, not only around  diagnosis (baseline) but also at follow-up, has implications for clinical practice.

DNA methylation could control lncRNA expression and play an important role in tumor initiation and progression. However, the DNA methylation that regulates lncRNAs in CRC remains poorly characterized.  In our research, we integrated dysregulated expression and methylation of lncRNAs between colorectal tumor and adjacent mucosa tissues from The  Genome Atlas database. With the use of this strategy, LINC00460, the most frequently epigenetically activated, was identified and further verified in the  Cell Line Encyclopedia and Gene Expression Omnibus databases.  Patients with high expression of LINC00460 are prone to metastasis and are associated with poor prognosis. Abnormally expressed LINC00460 could be used as an independent prognostic risk factor for disease-free survival. Knockdown of LINC00460 promotes  cell invasion and migration .  In summary, our results suggest that DNA methylation-regulated LINC00460 could promote CRC metastasis and serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Lu, Wu and Feng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663444>Berberine and  exert a potential anticancer effect on  cells by acting on specific pathways.</a></h2><p>Berberine (BBR) is a natural active principle with potential antitumor activity. The compound targets multiple cell signaling pathways, including proliferation, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms behind the anticancer activity of BBR by comparing the effects of purified BBR with those of the extract of , a medicinal plant that produces this metabolite. The expression levels of a panel of 44 selected genes in human  adenocarcinoma (HCA-7) cell line were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BBR treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent down regulation of 33 genes differently involved in cell cycle, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The trend was confirmed across the two types of treatment, the two time points, and the different absolute dosage of BBR. These findings suggest that the presence of BBR in  extract significantly contributes to its antiproliferative activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642313>A Near-Complete Series of Four Atropisomeric Jozimine A-Type Naphthylisoquinoline Dimers with Antiplasmodial and Cytotoxic Activities and Related Alkaloids from .</a></h2><p>Three new naphthylisoquinoline dimers, jozibrevines A-C (-), were isolated from the West African shrub , along with the known dimer jozimine A (). The two molecular moieties of - are coupled via the sterically constrained 3',3″-positions of their two naphthalene units, so that the central biaryl linkage is rotationally hindered. With the two outer axes also being chiral, - possess three consecutive stereogenic axes. The four isolated dimers all have the same constitutions and identical absolute configurations at the four stereogenic centers, but differ by their axial chirality. They belong to the extremely small class of Dioncophyllaceae-type naphthylisoquinoline dimers, i.e., being devoid of oxygen functions at C-6 and bearing the -configuration at C-3 in their isoquinoline portions. Besides these dimers, the plant produces predominantly typical Ancistrocladaceae-type monomeric compounds, i.e., with the -configuration at C-3 and an oxygen function at C-6, such as the new ancistrobrevines K () and L (). Furthermore, a new hybrid-type (i.e., mixed Ancistrocladaceae/Dioncophyllaceae-type) alkaloid was identified, named ancistrobrevine M (), which is 3-configured and 6-oxygenated. Remarkable was the discovery of its "inverse hybrid-type" counterpart, dioncoline A (). It is the as yet only known 3-configured naphthylisoquinoline lacking an -functionality at C-6. The new jozibrevines A-C (-) exhibited pronounced antiplasmodial activities in the submicromolar range, with  being the most potent compound (IC, 0.012 μM). Furthermore, jozimine A () showed cytotoxicity against human  carcinoma (HT-29), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and multiple myeloma (MM.1S)  cells, displaying IC values of 12.0, 9.0, and 5.0 μM, respectively, whereas jozibrevines A () and B () were nontoxic in this concentration range.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641961>Integrin-EGFR interaction regulates anoikis resistance in  cells.</a></h2><p>Anoikis resistance is an essential property of  cells that allow the extra-cellular matrix-detached cells to survive in a suspended state in body fluid in order to metastasize and invade to distant organs. It is known that integrins play an important role in anoikis resistance, but detailed mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report that highly metastatic  cells showed a higher degree of anoikis resistance than the normal intestinal epithelial cells. These anoikis-resistant  cells express high-levels of integrin-α2, β1, and activated EGFR in the anchorage-independent state than the anchorage-dependent state. In contrast, normal intestinal epithelial cells failed to elevate these proteins. Interestingly, a higher co-association of EGFR with integrin-α2β1/-α5β1 was observed on the surface of anoikis-resistant cells. Thus, in the absence of extra-cellular matrix, integrins in association with EGFR activates downstream effectors ERK and AKT and suppress Caspase-3 activation to induce anoikis resistance as was confirmed from the gene-ablation and pharmacological inhibitor studies. Interestingly, these anoikis-resistant  cells express high-level of  stem cell signatures (CD24, CD44, CD133, EpCAM) and pluripotent stem cell markers (OCT-4, SOX-2, Nanog) as well as drug-resistant pumps (ABCG2, MDR1, MRP1). Altogether, our findings unravel the interplay between integrin-α2β1/-α5β1 and EGFR in anoikis resistance and suggest that the resistant cells are  initiating or  stem cells, which may serve as a promising target to combat metastasis of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646798>Prognostic importance of tumor location and anti-EGFR therapy in patients with K-RAS wild type metastatic colorectal .</a></h2><p>To compare anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF agents in patients with K-RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal  (mCRC) with regards to tumor location.450 patients diagnosed with mCRC, who applied to our center were included in this retrospective study.

Different plant parts possess various phytochemicals, playing important roles in preventing and curing diseases. Scientists, through extensive experimental studies, are playing an important part in establishing the use of phytochemicals in medicine. However, there are still a large number of medicinal plants which need to be studied for their phytochemical profile. In this study, the objective was to isolate phytochemicals from bark of  L. and to study them for their antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The bark was extracted with methanol, followed by column chromatography and thus isolating kaempferol, stigmasterol, protocatechuic acid-methyl ester (PCA-ME) and protocatechuic acid (PCA). 2,2-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2, 2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) radical scavenging assays were utilized for assessment of antioxidant activity, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay was used to determine cytotoxic activity against C-6 glioma rat brain, MCF-7 breast , and HCT-15  cell lines. The compounds were found to have significant antioxidant and cytotoxic activity.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of many cytoprotective genes, plays a protective role in carcinogenesis. Recent studies have identified a specific gene-expression signature regulated by the Nrf2 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma and head-and-neck squamous cell . However, the roles of Nrf2 in the development of colitis-associated colorectal  (CACC) have not been well characterized. Nrf2 target genes as prognostic biomarkers in CACC remain to be explored. Thus, this work aimed to identify the molecular changes that occur during mouse CACC progression to facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.The CACC model was established using azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in BALB/c mice for 3 weeks to induce colitis-associated adenoma (CAA, early stage) and for 9 weeks to induce colitis-associated carcinoma (CAC, late stage). Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses we examined the mRNA expression profiles of 6 groups: wild-type control (WT-C), WT-CAA, WT-CAC, Nrf2 knockout control (Nrf2KO-C), Nrf2KO-CAA, and Nrf2KO-CAC.In the AOM/DSS model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis, Nrf2 mice showed a phenotype similar to WT mice, but with significantly more tumors and a much higher percentage of adenocarcinomas.

No loss of lumen/blind advancement was necessary in any of the procedures. No adverse events occurred. Among the completed colonoscopies, 6/34 (17.6%) patients had adenomas, all proximal to the site of prior failure, including one advanced adenoma. All failures (n = 3, 8.1%) had a history of  surgeries, with peritoneal carcinomatosis/extensively fixed/frozen bowel (two patients) and an additional diverticular stricture with colo-vesical fistula (one patient).STR colonoscope facilitates completion of a high proportion (91.9%) of colonoscopies that previously failed in expert hands.

This led to impaired gut epithelial function characterized by altered mucus-associated proteins and antimicrobial peptides and increased susceptibility to  injury and bacterial infection. Ffar2 increased IL-22 CCR6 ILC3s and influenced ILC3 abundance in  lymphoid tissues. Ffar2 agonism differentially activated AKT or ERK signaling and increased ILC3-derived IL-22 via an AKT and STAT3 axis. Our findings suggest that Ffar2 regulates  ILC3 proliferation and function, and they identify an ILC3-receptor signaling pathway modulating gut homeostasis and pathogen defense.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Cosmc dysfunction leads to inactive T-synthase and results in aberrant O-glycosylation, which is associated with various tumour malignancies. However, it is unclear whether Cosmc has some other functions beyond its involvement in O-glycosylation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional role of Cosmc in human colorectal  (CRC). We first assessed the expression levels of Cosmc in human CRC specimens and then forcedly expressed Cosmc in human CRC cell lines (HCT116, SW480) to examine its impact on cellular behaviours. The mechanisms for aberrant expression of Cosmc in CRC tissues and the altered behaviours of tumour cells were explored. It showed that the mRNA and protein levels of Cosmc were markedly elevated in human CRC specimens relative to normal colorectal tissues. The occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may largely contribute to the increased Cosmc expression in  tissue and cells. Cosmc overexpression in CRC cells significantly promoted cell migration and invasion, which could be attributed to the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway rather than aberrant O-glycosylation. These data indicate that Cosmc expression was elevated in human CRC possibly caused by ER stress, which further enhanced malignancies through the activation of EMT but independently of aberrant O-glycosylation.© 2019 The Authors.

Wheat bran (WB) is a rich source of dietary fiber and phytochemicals with health-promoting properties. However, the active components especially the interaction between different components in WG wheat have not been fully explored. Here, we investigated whether one of the major WB phytochemicals, alkylresorcinol (AR) C21, and the major active intestinal microbial metabolite of fiber, butyrate, could synergistically suppress human  cells. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the combination of C21 and butyrate synergistically inhibited the growth of human  cells and induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that the co-treatment of C21 and butyrate induced significant up-regulations in cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleaved caspase 3, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), cytochrome C, lipid-conjugated membrane-bound form of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expressions, indicating the synergistic anti- effects of C21 and butyrate were associated with induction of apoptosis, autophagy and ER stress pathways. Notably, the C21 concentrations in the large intestinal tract of mice treated with human relevant doses of C21, were from 0.86-1.78 µmol/g, suggesting the C21 doses used in vitro may be achievable after daily WG wheat intake. These results provide novel insights into the dietary prevention of CRC regarding the potential interaction of bioactive WG wheat phytochemicals and the microbial metabolites of fiber.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643740>Floxuridine.</a></h2><p>Floxuridine (FUDR) is a pyrimidine analogue used as an antineoplastic agent, usually as a continuous hepatic arterial infusion to treat hepatic metastases from .

In this study, our primary aim is to calculate the prevalence and also evaluate the predictors of increased prevalence of detected adenomas in the 40-49-year-old individuals undergoing colonoscopy.A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed using our endoscopy database. Study subjects included all 40-49-year-old patients undergoing their first colonoscopy at our institution from January 1, 2010 to September 30, 2017. Exclusion criteria included patients who underwent colonoscopy for overt gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, a history of familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis CRC. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to identify factors associated with increased adenoma detection rate (ADR).A total of 2059 patients were included in the study, and 317 of these patients had family history (FH) of CRC. Patients with FH of CRC had significantly higher ADR (27.8% vs. 19.7%, p = 0.001) as compared to those without FH of CRC. There was no significant difference in ADR in patients between 40-44 years and 45-49 years of age (17.7% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.058). On a multivariate analysis while adjusting for multiple patient and procedural variables, FH of CRC, male sex, BMI > 30 kg/m, chronic kidney disease, and age were associated with high ADR.Our study shows that in addition to FH of CRC, age, male sex, BMI, and CKD are independent predictors of increased ADR in patients between 40 and 49 years of age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671862>Absence of the Tks4 Scaffold Protein Induces Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Like Changes in Human  Cells.</a></h2><p>Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a multipurpose process involved in wound healing, development, and certain pathological processes, such as metastasis formation. The Tks4 scaffold protein has been implicated in  progression; however, its role in oncogenesis is not well defined. In this study, the function of Tks4 was investigated in HCT116  cells by knocking the protein out using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Surprisingly, the absence of Tks4 induced significant changes in cell morphology, motility, adhesion and expression, and localization of E-cadherin, which are all considered as hallmarks of EMT. In agreement with these findings, the marked appearance of fibronectin, a marker of the mesenchymal phenotype, was also observed in Tks4-KO cells. Analysis of the expression of well-known EMT transcription factors revealed that Snail2 was strongly overexpressed in cells lacking Tks4. Tks4-KO cells showed increased motility and decreased cell-cell attachment. Collagen matrix invasion assays demonstrated the abundance of invasive solitary cells. Finally, the reintroduction of Tks4 protein in the Tks4-KO cells restored the expression levels of relevant key transcription factors, suggesting that the Tks4 scaffold protein has a specific and novel role in EMT regulation and  progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626245>[Successful surgical treatment of aortic heart disease as a complication after combined targeted therapy for ].</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular diseases and malignancies are leading causes of mortality in the world.

Cellular O-GlcNAcylation levels are regulated by a unique couple of enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which adds and removes the GlcNAc residue, respectively. Maintenance of O-GlcNAc homeostasis is essential to ensure optimal cellular function and disruption of this homeostasis has been linked to the etiology of several human diseases including . The mechanisms through which the cell maintains O-GlcNAc homeostasis are not fully understood but several studies have suggested that a reciprocal regulation of OGT and OGA expression could be one of them. In this study, we investigated the putative regulation of OGT and OGA expression in response to disruption in O-GlcNAc homeostasis in . We provide in vitro and in vivo evidences that in  cells, modulation of O-GlcNAcylation levels leads to a compensatory regulation of OGT and OGA expression in an attempt to restore basal O-GlcNAcylation levels. Our results also suggests that the regulation of  OGA expression in response to changes in O-GlcNAc homeostasis occurs mostly at the transcriptional level whereas OGT regulation seems to rely mainly on post-transcriptional mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Five methods (mean treatment difference averaged over time, using a mixed-effects growth curve model; mixed-effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM); time-to-deterioration (TTD); status change; and responder analysis) were used to analyze EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/QoL and scores from functional scales.Overall, GHS/QoL and physical functioning deteriorated over time. Mean treatment difference slightly favored nintedanib over placebo for physical functioning (adjusted mean, 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-4.34) and social functioning (adjusted mean, 2.62; 95% CI, 0.66-4.47). GHS/QoL was numerically better with nintedanib versus placebo (adjusted mean, 1.61; 95% CI, -0.004 to 3.27). MMRM analysis had similar results, with better physical functioning in the nintedanib group at all timepoints. There was no significant delay in GHS/QoL deterioration (10%) and physical functioning (16%) with nintedanib versus placebo (TTD analysis). Status change analysis showed a higher proportion of patients with markedly improved GHS/QoL and physical functioning in the nintedanib versus placebo groups.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that  can increase the risk of diabetes. Consequently, diabetes and  share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating diabetes and  and rectal  (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on  cell aggressiveness in human  epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of  cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating diabetes and CRC.

More importantly, as a monotherapy, DaRT has been shown to induce a systemic antitumor immune response following tumor ablation. Here, immunomodulatory strategies to boost the antitumor immune response induced by DaRT, and the response specificity, were investigated in the  CT26 mouse model. Local treatment prior to DaRT, with the TLR3 agonist poly I:C, was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth relative to poly I:C or DaRT alone. DaRT used in combination with the TLR9 agonist CpG, or with the TLR1/2 agonist XS15 retarded tumor growth and increased tumor-rejection rates, compared to DaRT alone, curing 41% and 20% of the mice, respectively. DaRT in combination with CpG, the Treg inhibitor cyclophosphamide, and the MDSC inhibitor sildenafil, cured 51% of the animals, compared to only 6% and 0% cure when immunomodulation or DaRT was used alone, respectively. Challenge and Winn assays revealed that these high cure rates involved a specific immunological memory against CT26 antigens.

Median progression-free survival was 14 months for right vs 18 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.27-1.88, p=0.492) and median overall survival was 21 months for right vs 29 months for left sided tumors (Hazard ratio was 0.86, 95% CI 0.32-2.26, p=0.752).First-line triplet chemotherapy may overcome the difference in prognosis between right sided and left sided primaries in metastatic colorectal .

This study investigated the effects of using an ethanol extract of Chrysanthemum zawadskii Herbich (ECZ) to induce apoptosis and autophagy associated with reliable signal pathways in mouse  CT-26 cells.Using ECZ on mouse  CT-26 cells, cell viability, annexin V/propidium iodide staining, acridine orange staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and western blotting were assayed.ECZ exhibited cytotoxicity in CT-26 cells in a dose-dependent manner. ECZ induced apoptosis was confirmed by caspase-3 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, it was shown that ECZ induced autophagy via the increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3II, the degradation of p62, and the formation of acidic vesicular organelles. The inhibition of ROS production by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine resulted in reduced ECZ-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine resulted in enhanced ECZ-induced apoptosis via increased ROS generation.These findings confirmed that ECZ induced ROS-mediated autophagy and apoptosis in  cells.

This study aimed to study the travel distance to  patient's GP and to the hospital of diagnosis and the association with tumour stage for 12  types. A cohort study was conducted including  patients in Denmark diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 with rectum, malignant melanoma, breast, testis, oesophageal, , cervix, prostate, stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovary  (n = 256,663). Distance to each patient's GP and to the hospital of diagnosis were calculated using ArcGIS, Network Analyst. The results showed that for most easy-to-diagnose  types (rectum , malignant melanoma, testis ) and cervix , increasing travel distance to the hospital of diagnosis increased the odds of advanced disease at diagnosis. Contrary, increasing travel distance to the hospital was associated with decreased odds of being diagnosed with advanced disease stage among hard-to-diagnose  types (stomach, pancreatic, lung and ovarian ), and prostate . Distance to the GP was overall not associated with tumour stage. The underlying mechanisms for these findings are multifaceted and might reflect differences in presentation, symptomologies and investigations used for diagnosis across  types.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the mechanisms by which the western diet promotes tumor recurrence, including changes in the microbiome, in mice that underwent colorectal resections.BALB/c male mice were fed either standard chow diet or western-type diet (characterized by high fat, no fiber, and decreased minerals and vitamins) for 4 weeks; some mice were given antibiotics or ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 (Pi-PEG), which inhibits collagenase production by bacteria but not bacterial growth, in drinking water. Colorectal resections and anastomoses were then performed. The first day after surgery, mice were given enemas containing collagenolytic rodent-derived strain of Enterococcus faecalis (strain E2), and the second day they were given mouse  carcinoma cells (CT26). Twenty-one days later, distal colons were removed and  contents (feces, distal , and tumor) were collected.  tissues were analyzed by histology, for the presence of collagenolytic colonies, and by 16S rRNA sequencing. determined the anatomical distribution of E faecalis at the site of the anastomosis and within tumors using in situ hybridization. Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures.  tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the  microbiome.We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by  cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery. Strategies to prevent emergence of these microbe communities or their enzymatic activities might be used to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing colorectal  surgery.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The biological functions of miR-552 have been well documented in ; however, the role of miR-552 in HCC remains unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of miR-552 in HCC physiology, using HCC cell lines as model. An miR-552 inhibitor was transfected into HCC cell lines to knock down the expression of miR-552. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of miR-552 and Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), respectively. MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability, whilst Transwell and wound-healing assay were used to investigate cell migration. Flow cytometry was performed to measure cell apoptosis. The direct association between RUNX3 and miR-552 was evaluated using dual luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-552 was significantly elevated in HCC tumor tissues compared with the adjacent healthy samples. Additionally, transfection with the miR-552 inhibitor decreased cell viability and migration. miR-552 knockdown also increased HCC cell apoptosis . In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-552 has an oncogenic function in HCC and is a potential biomarker for detecting HCC.Copyright: © Ma et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666564>Characterisation of proguanylin expressing cells in the intestine - evidence for constitutive luminal secretion.</a></h2><p>Guanylin, a peptide implicated in regulation of intestinal fluid secretion, is expressed in the mucosa, but the exact cellular origin remains controversial. In a new transgenic mouse model fluorescent reporter protein expression driven by the proguanylin promoter was observed throughout the small intestine and  in goblet and Paneth(-like) cells and, except in duodenum, in mature enterocytes. In Ussing chamber experiments employing both human and mouse intestinal tissue, proguanylin was released predominantly in the luminal direction. Measurements of proguanylin expression and secretion in cell lines and organoids indicated that secretion is largely constitutive and requires ER to Golgi transport but was not acutely regulated by salt or other stimuli. Using a newly-developed proguanylin assay, we found plasma levels to be raised in humans after total gastrectomy or intestinal transplantation, but largely unresponsive to nutrient ingestion. By LC-MS/MS we identified processed forms in tissue and luminal extracts, but in plasma we only detected full-length proguanylin. Our transgenic approach provides information about the cellular origins of proguanylin, complementing previous immunohistochemical and in-situ hybridisation results. The identification of processed forms of proguanylin in the intestinal lumen but not in plasma supports the notion that the primary site of action is the gut itself.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655804>Increase in Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 Levels without Tumor Progression after Polaprezinc Administration that Induced Deep Vein Thrombosis in a  Patient.</a></h2><p>Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a well-known tumor marker of adenocarcinoma (reference range, 37 U/mL). It can also be used, together with computed tomography, to monitor responses and resistance to chemotherapy in  patients. False elevation of CA 19-9 levels is often seen in conditions such as biliary tract obstruction and cholangitis. However, whether medication might induce false elevation of CA 19-9 levels has not yet been reported.

The patient developed chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia and was treated with polaprezinc. After polaprezinc administration, his CA 19-9 levels gradually increased from 18.9 to 1,699.4 U/mL. He developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although it was not associated with progressive disease or metastasis. Upon discontinuation of polaprezinc, CA 19-9 levels gradually decreased. This case demonstrates that polaprezinc may not only induce false elevation of CA 19-9 levels but also cause development of DVT induced by increased CA 19-9 levels, both of which are very rare events.© 2019 S.

However, the therapeutic outcome of conventional methodologies relying on only one mechanism is rather limited. Herein, the first example of ultrasmall responsively aggregatable nanochelators that can intrinsically fulfill both antivasculature functions as well as high renal clearable efficiency is introduced. The nanochelators with sub-6 nm sizes exhibit not only systemic copper depletion activity for tumor antiangiogenesis but also, more surprisingly, the capability to transform from a "dispersed" state to an "aggregated" state to form large secondary particles in response to tumor microenvironment with elevated copper and phosphate levels for blood vessel obstruction. Compared to a benchmark antiangiogenic agent that can only inhibit the formation of tumor blood vessels, the nanochelators with unprecedented synergistic functions demonstrate significantly enhanced tumor inhibition activity in both breast  and  tumor models. Moreover, these ultrasmall nanochelators are noncytotoxic and renal clearable, ensuring superior biocompatibility. It is envisaged that the design of nanomaterials with ground-breaking properties and the synergistic antivasculature functions would offer a substantial conceptual advance for tumor vasculature targeted therapy and may provide vast opportunities for developing advanced nanomedicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627712>Bispecific anti-OX40/CTLA-4 antibodies for advanced solid tumors: a patent evaluation of WO2018202649.</a></h2><p>: OX40 is a potent costimulatory receptor of the immune response in various types of  and has been used as a target for the generation of agonists of its function.

In colorectal , the importance of autophagy is becoming widely recognized as it demonstrates both pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions. In , cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles for autophagy are essential in growth and progression. However, the mechanisms downstream of autophagy (to reduce or enhance tumor growth) are not well known.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body metabolism and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific metabolic profile on  risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 obesity-related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into  and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and  risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with obesity. However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: 2.46; 95%CI 1.20; 5.03), and distal  (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal  (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; 2.05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women. These results indicate that higher BMR may be an indicator of a metabolic phenotype associated with risk of certain  types, and may be a useful predictor of  risk independent of body fatness.

In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in inflammatory leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C + inflammatory leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an IBD mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = 5, PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of -morphology as assessed by -length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS colitis model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in inflammatory leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, another kind of marker has been developed: sterile carbon particle suspension (SCPS). No comparison between these two markers has yet been made. The aim of the present study was to compare the pyrogenic, inflammatory and intraperitoneal effect of these two markers.From September 2015 to December 2018, adult patients who were candidates for elective laparoscopic  resection were randomized to the SCPS or conventional India ink injection group using computer-based randomization. The primary endpoint of the study was the presence of intraoperative adhesions related to the endoscopic tattoo. Secondary endpoints were differences in white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels as well as, abdominal pain and body temperature at baseline (before endoscopic tattooing) and 6 and 24 h after colonoscopy. Finally, the visibility of the tattoo during the minimally invasive intervention was assessed.Ninety-four patients were included in the study, 47 for each arm. There were 45/94 females (47.9%) and 49/94 males (52.1%), with a median age of 67.85 ± 9.22 years. No differences were found between groups in WBC, fibrinogen levels, body temperature or VAS scores, but we documented significantly higher CRP values at 6 and 24 h after endoscopic tattooing with India ink injection. There were significantly fewer adhesions in the SCPS Endoscopic Marker group. All the endoscopic tattoos were clearly visible.SCPS is an effective method for tattooing  lesions and has a better safety profile than traditional India ink in terms of post-procedure inflammatory response and intraoperative bowel adhesions.clinicaltrials.gov (ID: ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645354>Cooperative Immune-mediated Mechanisms of the HDAC Inhibitor Entinostat, an IL-15 Superagonist, and a  Vaccine Effectively Synergize as a Novel  Therapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in subsets of patients with solid carcinomas. Multimodal therapies employing agents that can affect different arms of the immune system and/or tumor microenvironment might increase clinical responses.We demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of the IL-15 superagonist, N-803 plus vaccine in 4T1 triple-negative breast and MC38-CEA  murine carcinoma models. A comprehensive immune and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T cell activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme B. For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme B, T-cell responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the checkpoint V-domain Ig Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) on multiple immune subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME.

We evaluated the costs and benefits of testing for Lynch syndrome and determined the optimal surveillance interval for first-degree relatives (FDRs) found to have Lynch syndrome.We developed a patient flow diagram to determine costs and yield of immunohistochemical testing for Lynch syndrome in CRC cases and, for those found to have Lynch syndrome, their FDRs, accounting for realistic uptake. Subsequently, we used the MISCAN- model to compare costs and benefits of annual, biennial, and triennial surveillance in FDRs identified with Lynch syndrome vs colonoscopy screening every 10 years (usual care for individuals without a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome).Testing 1000 CRC cases was estimated to identify 20 CRC index cases and 29 FDRs with Lynch syndrome at a cost of $310,274. Despite the high cost of Lynch syndrome tests, offering the FDRs with Lynch syndrome biennial colonoscopy surveillance was cost effective at $8785 per life-year gained compared with usual care, due to a substantial increase in life-years gained (+122%) and cost savings in CRC care. Triennial surveillance was more costly and less effective, and annual surveillance showed limited additional benefit compared with biennial surveillance.Immunohistochemical testing for Lynch syndrome in persons younger than 70 years who received a diagnosis of colorectal , and then testing first-degree relatives of those found to have Lynch syndrome, provides a good balance between costs and long-term benefits.

Mutations in the exon 6 of the PPM1D result in production of a highly stable, C-terminally truncated PPM1D. These gain-of-function PPM1D mutations are present in various human cancers but their role in tumorigenesis remains unresolved. Here we show that truncated PPM1D impairs activation of the cell cycle checkpoints in human non-transformed RPE cells and allows proliferation in the presence of DNA damage. Next, we developed a mouse model by introducing a truncating mutation in the PPM1D locus and tested contribution of the oncogenic PPM1D allele to  tumorigenesis. We found that p53 pathway was suppressed in  stem cells harboring PPM1D resulting in proliferation advantage under genotoxic stress condition. In addition, truncated PPM1D promoted tumor growth in the  in Apc mice and diminished survival. Moreover, tumor organoids derived from  of the ApcPpm1d mice were less sensitive to 5-fluorouracil when compared to ApcPpm1dand the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil was restored by inhibition of PPM1D. Finally, we screened colorectal  patients and identified recurrent somatic PPM1D mutations in a fraction of  adenocarcinomas that are p53 proficient and show defects in mismatch DNA repair.

LM22B-10 promoted proliferation and invasion of  cells and inhibited apoptosis and autophagy, while 5.1% sevoflurane could reverse the effect of LM22B-10 on the biological characteristics of cells. Sevoflurane can significantly inhibit tumor growth in SW480 cells transplanted nude mice. Moreover, 5.1% sevoflurane significantly increased the expression of p-Raf, p-MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in SW480 cells and tumor tissues without affecting p-JNK and p-p38 proteins, meanwhile, 5.1% sevoflurane can inhibit the activation of ERK signaling pathway by LM22B-10 in vitro and in vivo.Sevoflurane can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of  cells, induce apoptosis and autophagy, and participate in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which may be related to its inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to present the clinicopathologic features of GNET, including treatment information. We included 19 patients with GNET with a mean tumor size of 4.2 cm. The most common site of tumor origin was the small intestine (57.9%), followed by the stomach (15.8%),  (10.5%), ileocecal junction (5.3%), lower esophagus (5.3%), and anal canal (5.3%). Microscopically, the tumors were composed of epithelioid cells with eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm arranged in nest, sheet-like, papillary, or pseudoalveolar patterns and/or spindle tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in a fascicular pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells stained positively for S100 (19/19,100%), SOX10 (14/15, 93.3%), vimentin (17/17, 100%), synaptophysin (Syn) (7/17, 41.2%), CD56 (4/13, 30.8%), CD99 (1/5, 20%), and CD117 (1/15, 6.7%), and negatively for HMB45, Melan A, DOG1, CD34, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, chromogranin A, smooth muscle actin, and desmin. In total, 14/15 (93.3%) cases showed split Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene (EWSR1) signals consistent with a chromosomal translocation involving EWSR1. Within a mean follow-up of 29.7 months (range: 3 to 63 mo), 2/15 (13.3%) patients died of disease, 5 (33.3%) were alive with disease, and 8 (53.3%) had no evidence of disease. Two and 1 patients showed partial response to apatinib and anlotinib, respectively. In conclusion, GNET has distinctive morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features and should be distinguished from other gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Apatinib and anlotinib might be effective for the treatment of advanced GNET and could prolong patient survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644088>Fluorouracil.</a></h2><p>Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a pyrimidine analogue used as an antineoplastic agent to treat multiple solid tumors including , rectal, breast, gastric, pancreatic, ovarian, bladder and liver .

There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including , diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases. Ames dwarf (df/df) mice are characterized by an extended life- and healthspan, and although these mice are protected from many age-related diseases, their microbiome has not been studied. To determine the role of microbiota on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the microbiota by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal , ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut microbiota plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

On enhanced barium enema study, the cecum was in the pelvis, and the ascending  was running medially in the abdomen. Enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed rotation of the superior mesenteric vein(SMV). We diagnosed the case as sigmoid (cT3N0M0, StageⅡA)with non rotation-type intestinal malrotation, and performed laparoscopic surgery. We confirmed the small intestine to be located on the right side of the abdomen, the cecum to be located in the pelvis, and the ascending  to be running medially in the abdomen. The ascending mesocolon was adherent to the right of the sigmoid mesocolon. Following dissections of the ascending mesocolon from the sigmoid mesocolon, we performed surgery via the inside approach as usual. We dissected the root of the inferior mesenteric artery(IMA), and the operation was completed. In laparoscopic surgery for colorectal  with intestinal malrotation, there are some reports that it could be performed safely if attention is paid to adhesion of the mesenteries and vascular variation in the course of preoperative imaging diagnosis.

Histologic diagnosis using biopsy samples of colorectal  is the most important step in determining the treatment methods, but these methods have limitations in accuracy and effectiveness. Herein, we report a dual-recognition two-photon probe and its application in the discrimination between human colorectal . The probe is composed of two monosaccharides, D-glucosamine and β-D-galactopyranoside, in a fluorophore for the monitoring of both glucose uptake and β-gal hydrolysis. In vitro/cell imaging studies revealed the excellent selectivity and sensitivity of the probe for glucose transporter-mediated glucose uptake and β-gal activity. -specific uptake was monitored by increased fluorescence intensity, and additional screening of  cells was achieved by changes in emission ratio owing to the higher activity of β-gal.

We aimed to assess how prolonged frozen storage and freeze-thaw cycles might affect measures of faecal haemoglobin (Hb) and diagnostic performance of FITs. Methods From 2005 through 2010, participants of screening colonoscopy (n = 2042) and clinical colorectal  (CRC) cases (n = 184) provided faecal samples in stool containers (60 mL). The samples were stored at -80 °C for up to 11 years and underwent three freeze-thaw cycles. Between each cycle, a defined amount of faeces was extracted using the manufacturer's sampling device of one or two FITs (RIDASCREEN, OC-Sensor). Faecal Hb concentration and diagnostic performance were calculated and compared across freeze-thaw cycles. Results For RIDASCREEN and the OC-Sensor, repeat measurements were available for 504 and 551 study participants, respectively. Hb concentrations correlated strongly (0.77 and 0.85, respectively) and diagnostic performance indicators were similar at the repeat measurements among the same FITs. For RIDASCREEN we found even slightly higher Hb levels, sensitivities and area under the curves (AUCs) after the third than after the first freeze-thaw cycle. For the OC-Sensor the Hb levels, sensitivities and AUCs were slightly lower after prolonged storage and one additional freeze-thaw cycle. Conclusions Measures of Hb and diagnostic performance were fairly stable, even after long-term frozen storage and multiple freeze-thaw cycles of raw faecal samples. Faecal samples collected in prospective screening studies and kept frozen at -80 °C before analysis seem useful for timely and efficient retrospective evaluation of FIT performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646937>Specifying Future Behavior When Assessing Risk Perceptions: Implications for Measurement and Theory.</a></h2><p>. Many theories assert that high perceived risk motivates health behavior change; the empirical literature shows mixed findings. . To determine whether, for whom, and under what circumstances specifying a future behavior when assessing perceived risk (i.e., "conditioning" risk perception items on behavior) improves data quality and strengthens the perceived risk-intentions/behavior relationship. . Internet panel participants ( = 787, 58.8% no college experience, 44.4% racial/ethnic minority, 43.7% men, 67.3% aged 18-49 years, 59.0% nonadherent to physical activity guidelines) answered 8  perceived risk items in a within-subjects design. Participants answered 4 types of risk perception items: absolute and comparative perceived likelihood and absolute and comparative feelings of risk. Participants answered each type of item twice: once conditioned on not engaging in physical activity and once unconditioned. . Compared to unconditioned items, conditioned items elicited fewer "don't know" (DK) responses (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93), higher risk perceptions ( = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.49-0.61) and stronger positive correlations with intentions ( = 5.46,  < 0.001) and behavior ( = 5.10,  < 0.001). The effect of conditioning was more pronounced for perceived likelihood than feelings of risk items (OR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.63-3.01 and  = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.20 for DK responding and risk perception magnitude, respectively). The effect on risk perception magnitude (except absolute feelings of risk) was higher among people with higher health literacy (χ(3) = 8.11,  = 0.04). . Researchers who examine whether perceived risk motivates precautionary behavior should consider conditioning risk perception items on behavior to increase the validity of the statistical conclusions they draw and to gain insight into the nature of perceived risk and its relation to behavior.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646062>Transmissible inflammation-induced colorectal  in inflammasome-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>The microbiota is pivotal in orchestrating the pathogenesis of IBD-associated colorectal  (CRC).

In the current case-control study, an association between diagnosis of CRC, obesity and diabetes was investigated.Demographic characteristics, colonoscopy reports, history of drug, smoking, and medical history were collected from patients referred to a colonoscopy unit. The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, diabetes, family history of  was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04).

Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as sebaceous carcinoma. We diagnosed her with Muir-Torre syndrome based on the following evidence: 1) high prevalence of microsatellite instability in gene locus assay, 2) absence of mismatch repair proteins in the sebaceous carcinoma on immunohistochemical analysis, and 3) a genetic mutation of 1226_1227delAG in the MSH2 exon 7 in the lesion detected by DNA sequencing analysis.

There is even evidence that microRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Although microRNA expression profiles have been characterized in colorectal carcinoma, their precise physiological functions are largely unknown. It has become clear that the activated KRAS Proto‑Oncogene, GTPase (KRAS) oncogene plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the present study, it was found that the level of mature miR‑143 was lower in colorectal carcinoma tissues compared with that observed in normal adjacent tissues. A lack of miR‑143 was detected in human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, SW480, LoVo and HT‑29, compared to the high expression observed in normal  epithelial cell line NCM460. pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 and its mutant were successfully constructed and transfected into colorectal carcinoma cells. Increased accumulation of mature miR‑143 was observed in the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143‑transfected cells. In SW480 cells, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 resulted in a 35 and 47% reduction in cell growth after incubation for 4 and 5 days, respectively, compared with transfection of the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 mutant; while in LoVo cells, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 resulted in a 33 and 46% reduction in cell growth respectively. In contrast, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 had no significantly effects on HT‑29 cell growth. We also found that transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 had no effect on levels of KRAS mRNA, but resulted in a 58% decrease in the KRAS protein level in the transfected SW480 cells, while an approximate 54 and 43% KRAS protein reduction in LoVo and HT‑29 cells, respectively, compared with the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 mutant. Two fragments containing the putative complementary site were cloned into the pGL3 vector, constructing the luciferase reporter pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2. Cotransfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 with pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2 respectively resulted in 4.6‑ and 3.3‑fold inhibition of luciferase activity in the SW480 cells, while a 4.0‑ and 3.2‑fold inhibition of luciferase activity in the LoVo cells, 3.7‑ and 3.1‑fold inhibition in the HT‑29 cells. Differences in pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2 activity were not significant. Our results revealed that increased accumulation of miR‑143 is likely to modulate levels of KRAS protein expression at the post‑transcriptional level by interacting specifically with the complementary site, and consequently inhibiting proliferation of the transfected cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657813>[Considerations about the importance of nutritional status in the treatment of advanced colorectal .]</a></h2><p>In patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, i.e. cancers of the stomach, , liver, biliary tract or pancreas, progressive undernutrition can be regularly observed during the course of illness.

During metastasis, tumor cells undergo a morphological change known as transdifferentiation or the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In normal embryonic development, the EMT occurs in the context of morphogenesis in a variety of tissues. Over the course of this process, epithelial cells lose their cell-cell adhesion and polarity properties. In this study, we investigated whether magnolol could suppress the EMT in human colorectal  cells. To this end, we examined the epithelial markers E-cadherin, ZO-1, and claudin and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, TWIST1, Slug, and Snail. Magnolol effectively inhibited EMT in human  cell lines by upregulating epithelial markers and downregulating mesenchymal markers. The EMT is induced by the TGF-β signaling pathway. To determine whether magnolol disrupts TGF-β signaling, we examined several mediators of this pathway, and found that magnolol decreased the levels of phosphorylated (i.e., active) ERK, GSK3β, and Smad. We conclude that magnolol blocks migration in HCT116 cells by suppressing TGF-β signaling.Copyright © 2019 Chei, Oh, Song, Seo, Lee and Lee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637261>Therapeutic Opportunities in Colorectal : Focus on Melatonin Antioncogenic Action.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) influences individual health worldwide with high morbidity and mortality.

European data are primarily reported by specialized referral centers and thus may not be representative of common European ESD practice. The aim of this study is to understand the current state of ESD practice across Italian endoscopy centers.All Italian endoscopists who were known to perform ESD were invited to complete a structured questionnaire including: operator features and competencies, ESD training details and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.Twenty-nine operators from 23 centers (69% response rate) completed the questionnaire: 18 (62%) were <50 years old; 7 (24%) were female; 16 (70%) were located in Northern Italy. Overall ESD volume was <40 cases in 9 (31%) operators, 40-80 in 8 (27.5%), 80-150 in 4 (13.8%) and >150 in 8 (27.5%). Colorectal ESD was predominant for operators with an experience >80 cases.

Among these cells are enteric glial cells (EGCs) that are potent regulators of the epithelium functions in a healthy intestine. However, whether EGCs impact CSC-driven tumorigenesis remains unknown.Impact of human EGC primary cultures or a non-transformed EGC line on CSCs isolated from human primary  adenocarcinomas or  cell lines with different p53, MMR system and stemness status was determined using murine xenograft models and 3D co-culture systems. Supernatants of patient-matched human primary  adenocarcinomas and non-adjacent healthy mucosa were used to mimic tumor versus healthy mucosa secretomes and compare their effects on EGCs.Our data show that EGCs stimulate CSC expansion and ability to give rise to tumors via paracrine signaling. Importantly, only EGCs that were pre-activated by tumor epithelial cell-derived soluble factors increased CSC tumorigenicity. Pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis in EGCs or IL-1 knockdown in tumor epithelial cells prevented EGC acquisition of a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of PGE2 receptor EP4 and EGFR in CSCs inhibited the effects of tumor-activated EGCs.Altogether, our results show that EGCs, once activated by the tumor, acquire a pro-tumorigenic phenotype and stimulate CSC-driven tumorigenesis via a PGE2/EP4/EGFR-dependent pathway.This work was supported by grants from the French National  Institute, La Ligue contre le , the 'Région des Pays de la Loire' and the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive  Center.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The results showed that triptolide inhibited macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype and abolished M2 macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the expression of M2 markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of M2-polarized macrophages and TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity. Our findings provide important information for the potential clinical application of triptolide in  therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627299>Synergistic Anti-Tumor Effect of mTOR Inhibitors with Irinotecan on  Cells.</a></h2><p>Advanced colorectal  has a poor prognosis because of metastasis formation and resistance to combined therapies. Downstream of PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways, the mTOR kinase plays a decisive role in treatment failure. We previously established that irinotecan has antiangiogenic properties and it is known that new mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) catalytic AZD inhibitors, unlike rapamycin, target both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Thus, we hypothesized that the complete inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α axis with mTOR catalytic inhibitors and low doses of irinotecan may have antitumor effects. We showed that the AZD8055 and AZD2014 inhibitors were much more potent than rapamycin to reduce cell viability of four  cell lines. On the other hand, whereas AZD2014 alone inhibits migration by 40%, the drug combination led to 70% inhibition. Similarly, neither irinotecan nor AZD2014 significantly reduced cell invasion, whereas a combination of the two inhibits invasion by 70%. In vivo, irinotecan and AZD2014 combination drastically reduced ectopic patient-derived  tumor growth and this combination was more potent than Folfox or Folfiri. Finally, the combination totally inhibited liver and lung metastases developed from orthotopic implantation of SW480 cells. Thus, the use of mTOR catalytic inhibitors, in association with other chemotherapeutic agents like irinotecan at low doses, is potentially a hope for  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667695>Quality of Preoperative Colonoscopy Affects Missed Postoperative Adenoma Detection in Colorectal  Patients.</a></h2><p>Despite thorough preoperative screening, 19-30% of synchronous polyps or adenomas are detected after  surgery. Remnant synchronous lesions require additional colonoscopy procedures or surgery.To investigate factors of preoperative colonoscopy potentially affecting the detection of missed lesions in patients subjected to colorectal  surgery.Of 1147 colorectal  patients subjected to curative open or laparoscopic colectomy and colonoscopy at the Chungnam National University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2016, 518 patients underwent pre- and postoperative colonoscopy. The index colonoscopy was defined as the last preoperative endoscopy performed. We analyzed pre- and postoperative medical charts for colonoscopy and pathological data. The effects of patient, procedure, and tumor factors on the postoperative adenoma detection rate, advanced adenoma detection rate, and adenoma miss rate (AMR) were analyzed.The overall AMR was 25.7% (95% confidence interval, 22.2-29.8%). Comparing optimal and non-optimal bowel preparation groups, the latter had greater postoperative polyp missed rate (PMR), AMR (p < 0.01), and AAMR (p = 0.272). The optimal preparation group allowed identification of more synchronous adenomas than in the fair (OR 5.72) and poor (OR 11.39) preparation groups. On univariate analysis, patient age and left-sided colectomy (p < 0.01) influenced AMR. Multivariate analysis showed that age, preoperative bowel preparation, and left  resection influenced postoperative AMR.A better quality of index colonoscopy had a positive effect on lowering the detection rate of postoperative adenoma. Older age and suboptimal bowel preparation at the index colonoscopy and left-sided colectomy had negative effects on lowering the postoperative AMR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637303>Clinico-pathological Features of  Patients Undergoing Emergency Surgery: A Comparison Between Elderly and Non-elderly Patients.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in patients older than 65 years. Emergency presentation represents about 30% of cases, with increased morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study is to compare the perioperative outcome between elderly and non-elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery.We retrospectively analysed CRC patients that underwent emergency surgery at the Departments of Surgery of the Sapienza University Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome, and at San Donato Hospital in Arezzo, between June 2012 and June 2017. Patients were divided into two groups: non-elderly (< 65 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years). Variables analysed were sex, onset symptoms, associated disease, ASA score, tumor site and TNM stage, surgical procedures and approach, and morbidity and mortality.Of a total of 123 patients, 29 patients were non-elderly and 94 patients were elderly. No significant differences were observed in sex, onset symptoms and tumor site between the two groups. Comorbidities were significantly higher in elderly patients (73.4% vs 41.4%, p<0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in surgical approach and the rate of one-stage procedures. Elderly patients were more frequently treated by Hartmann's procedure compared to non-elderly patients (20.2% vs 6.9%). Left colorectal resection with protective ileostomy was most frequent in the non-elderly group (27.6% vs 11.7%). No significant differences were found in the pT and pN categories of the TNM system between the two groups. However, a higher number of T3 in non-elderly patients was observed. A consistent number of non-oncologically adequate resections were observed in the elderly (21.3% vs 3.5%; p<0.03). The morbidity rate was significantly higher in the elderly group (31.9 % vs 3.4%, p<0.001). No significant difference was found in the mortality rate between the two groups, being 13.8% in the elderly and 6.9% in the non-elderly.Emergency colorectal surgery for  still presents significant morbidity and mortality rates, especially in elderly patients. More aggressive tumors and advanced stages were more frequent in the non-elderly group and as a matter it should be taken into account when treating such patients in the emergency setting in order to perform a radical procedure as much as possible.© 2019 Gianluca Costa et al., published by De Gruyter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653646>Prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis by DNA binding small molecule curaxin CBL0137 involves suppression of Wnt signaling.</a></h2><p>Chemoprevention is considered a valid approach to reduce the incidence of colorectal  (CRC), one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Here, we investigated the tumor preventive activity of curaxin CBL0137. This compound represents a new class of non-mutagenic DNA-binding small molecules that alter chromatin stability and inhibit the function of the histone chaperone FACT. Among downstream effects of CBL0137 treatment are activation of p53 and type I interferons and inhibition of NF-κB, HSF1 and MYC. In addition, our data show that in both human and mouse CRC cells in vitro CBL0137 inhibits the APC/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a key role in  carcinogenesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR and microarray hybridization, we have demonstrated decreased expression of multiple components and downstream targets of the WNT pathway in  cells treated with CBL0137. At the same time, CBL0137 induced expression of WNT antagonists. Inhibition of WNT-signaling activity by CBL0137 was also confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Tumor preventive activity of CBL0137 in vivo was tested in a murine model of colorectal carcinogenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), which is known to involve WNT pathway dysregulation. After DMH subcutaneous treatment, mice were administered CBL0137 in drinking water. Efficacy of CBL0137 in suppressing CRC development in this model was evidenced by reduced incidence of adenocarcinomas and adenomas in both males and females, decrease in tumor multiplicity. These data support the prospective use of CBL0137 in chemoprevention of CRC as well as of other malignances associated with activated WNT signaling.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642986>Ropivacaine via nuclear factor kappa B signalling modulates CD62E expression and diminishes tumour cell arrest.</a></h2><p>The issue whether anaesthesia has an impact on the prognosis of carcinoma has been widely discussed and remains debated. Ropivacaine has been widely used in perioperative period as a long acting local anesthetic. An early event during recurrence or metastasis of carcinoma is the adhesion of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) to endothelial cells (ECs) through binding adhesion molecules that are up-regulated on inflamed endothelium during the perioperative period or other periods. This study was to explore the impact of ropivacaine on the adhesion of tumour cells, providing evidences of its influence on the prognosis of carcinoma.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pre-treated with ropivacaine (10-10 M; 30 min) prior to treatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (10 ng ml; 1, 4 and 8 h). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), endothelial-selectin (CD62E) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA levels were detected via quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To clarify the underlying action mechanism, p65, p-p65, IκBα, p-IκBα, IKKα/β and p-IKKα/β protein levels were evaluated via western blotting. Cell viability and tumour cell adhesion assays were also assessed.The clinically usage concentration of ropivacaine (10 M) produced a significant decrease in CD62E expression compared with that produced by TNFα only (p < 0.001). Moreover, adhesion assays showed that ropivacaine effectively inhibited the adhesion of hepatoma cells (p < 0.01), human  cells (p < 0.01) and human leukemic monocyte (p < 0.01). Western blot results showed that pre-treatment with ropivacaine inhibited the phosphorylation of p65 (p < 0.05), IκBα (p < 0.001) and IKKα/β (p < 0.01).Ropivacaine decreased the adhesion of tumour cells. Ropivacaine modulated CD62E expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB.

This is an descriptive study. The operation videos of 61 cases (28 males, 33 females, median age of 61) were collected. All the patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery from January 2018 to December 2018 in Yangpu Hospital, including low anterior resection for rectal  in 25 cases, left hemicolectomy for descending  in 15 cases, and subtotal resection of the  for intractable constipation in 21 cases. Among these 21 constipation patients, 8 received additional modified Duhamel surgeries. Gross anatomy was performed on 24 adult cadavers provided by Department of Anatomy, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, including 23 formalin-fixed and 1 fresh cadaver (12 males, 12 females). Sixty-one patients and 24 cadavers had no previous abdominal or pelvic surgical history. The anatomy and extension of fasciae related to descending , sigmoid  and rectum, especially the morphology of Toldt fascia, and the continuities of mesocolon and mesorectum were observed carefully. The distribution characteristics of the fasciae and anatomical landmarks during laparoscopic surgery were recorded and described.  The anatomical study on 24 cadavers showed that visceral fascia was the densest connective tissue in the pelvic, posterolateral to the rectum, and stretched as a hammock to lift all pelvic organs. Among 61 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, 36 (59.0%) needed to free the left  during operation, and Toldt fascia in the descending  segment presented as potential, avascular and extensible loose connective tissue plane between the mesocolon and posterior Gerota fascia; 33 (54.1%) needed to free the rectum during operation, and Toldt fascia extended downward to pelvis as loose connective tissue between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral fascia; the fascia propria of the rectum exposed completely in 32 (32/33, 97.0%) cases, which ran downward and fused with visceral fascia at the level of the fourth sacral vertebra. The anatomy of 24 cadavers also showed that fascia propria of the rectum fused with visceral fascia at the level of Waldeyer fascia. The fusion line of these two fasciae was supposed to be the extension of Waldeyer fascia. There were two avascular planes behind the rectum: one between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral fascia, and the other between the visceral fascia and parietal fascia. In 8 constipation cases undergoing laparoscopic subtotal  resection plus modified Duhamel operation, both mesocolon and mesorectum needed to be mobilized. It was obvious that the mesocolon of descending  extended and became the mesocolon of sigmoid , and ran further into the pelvic and became the mesorectum. The  fascia of descending  served as the natural boundary of mesocolon extended downward as the fascia of sigmoid  and the fascia propria of the rectum, respectively. Toldt fascia locating between mesocolon of descending  and Gerota fascia extended to pelvis as the 'presacral space' between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral fascia. Gerota fascia in descending  segment extended as urogenital fascia in sigmoid  segment and visceral fascia in the pelvis, respectively. In the cadaver anatomy study, the visceral fascia served as a corridor carrying the hypogastric nerve, and ureter was observed in 23 (23/24, 95.8%) cases. The visceral fascia passed from posterior to anterior lateral of rectum, fusing with Denonvilliers fascia in a fan shape. The pelvic plexus located exactly external to the junction of visceral fascia and Denonvilliers fascia. Pelvic splanchnic nerves went through the parietal fascia toward to the inferolateral of the pelvic plexus.  Fascia propria of the rectum and the visceral pelvic fascia are two independent layers of fascia, and the TME surgical plane is between the fascia propria of the rectum and visceral pelvic fascia instead of between the visceral and the parietal pelvic fascia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633602>Uptake of Total Mesorectal Excision and Total Mesorectal Excision Grading for Rectal : A Statewide Study.</a></h2><p>Total mesorectal excision is associated with decreased local recurrence and improved disease-free survival following rectal  resection. The extent to which total mesorectal excision has been adopted in the United States is unknown.We sought to assess trends in total mesorectal excision performance and grading in Michigan hospitals.This is a retrospective cohort study from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative. Trends in total mesorectal excision performance and grade assignment were analyzed by using χ tests and linear regression.Participating hospitals (initially 14 hospitals, now 38) abstracted medical records data for rectal  cases from 2007 to 2016.Patients who underwent rectal  resection were included.The main outcome measures were surgeon-documented total mesorectal excision performance and pathologist-reported total mesorectal excision grade.Of 510 rectal  cases, 367 (72.0%) had surgeon-reported total mesorectal excision performance and 78 (15.3%) had pathologist-reported total mesorectal excision grade. Between-hospital variability in total mesorectal excision performance ranged from 0% to 97% and total mesorectal excision grading ranged from 0% to 90%. Total mesorectal excision grading was associated with a higher likelihood of also having adequate lymph node assessment (88.5% versus 71.9%, p = 0.002). There has been a statistically significant trend toward an increase in total mesorectal excision grading in the original 14 hospitals (p = 0.001), but not in the complete cohort of all hospitals (p = 0.057).This is a retrospective cohort design with sampled rectal  cases. In addition, there is insufficient granularity to capture all factors associated with total mesorectal excision performance or grade assignment.The rates of total mesorectal excision performance and grade assignment are widely variable throughout the state of Michigan. Overall, grade assignment remains very low. This suggests an opportunity for quality improvement projects to increase total mesorectal excision performance and grading, involving both the surgeons and pathologists for effective implementation.

High ligation divides the IMA proximally at its origin, and low ligation ligates the IMA distal to the origin of left colic artery. We assessed the association of level of ligation in scheduled minimally invasive resection of sigmoid and rectal cancers on anastomotic leak, postoperative complications, and death within 30 days.We identified all patients with primary sigmoid and rectal  treated with scheduled minimally invasive resection and primary anastomosis between January 2002 and June 2018 using linked institutional and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program databases. We assessed the association of level of ligation with each outcome by fitting individual univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for surgical approach, tumor location, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and Charlson comorbidity index.We included 158 patients treated with high ligation and 123 patients treated with low ligation. Overall, 12 patients had an anastomotic leak requiring intervention within 30 days: 5 in the high ligation group (3.2%, 95% CI 1.4-7.2%) and 7 in the low ligation group (5.7%, 95% CI 2.8-11.3%). There was no association between the level of ligation and anastomotic leak (unadjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.58-6.38; adjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16-2.55). Similarly, there was no association between the level of ligation and reoperation for anastomotic leak (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.15-10.9), major complications (Clavien-Dindo III-V; OR 2.22, 95% CI 0.90-5.77), minor complications (Clavien-Dindo I-II; OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.88-2.60), and all complications (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.94-2.67). No deaths occurred in either group.There was no association of level of ligation of the IMA with anastomotic leak, postoperative complications as a composite, or death.

Increased WNT2 expression is detectable in many carcinomas and participates in tumor progression. In human colorectal  (CRC), WNT2 is selectively elevated in -associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leading to increased invasion and metastasis. However, if there is a role for WNT2 in , angiogenesis was not addressed so far. We demonstrate that WNT2 enhances EC migration/invasion, while it induces canonical WNT signaling in a small subset of cells. Knockdown of WNT2 in CAFs significantly reduced angiogenesis in a physiologically relevant assay, which allows precise assessment of key angiogenic properties. In line with these results, expression of WNT2 in otherwise WNT2-devoid skin fibroblasts led to increased angiogenesis. In CRC xenografts, WNT2 overexpression resulted in enhanced vessel density and tumor volume. Moreover, WNT2 expression correlates with vessel markers in human CRC. Secretome profiling of CAFs by mass spectrometry and cytokine arrays revealed that proteins associated with pro-angiogenic functions are elevated by WNT2. These included extracellular matrix molecules, ANG-2, IL-6, G-CSF, and PGF. The latter three increased angiogenesis. Thus, stromal-derived WNT2 elevates angiogenesis in CRC by shifting the balance towards pro-angiogenic signals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661001>Targeting CXCR4 potentiates anti-PD-1 efficacy modifying the tumor microenvironment and inhibiting neoplastic PD-1.</a></h2><p>Inefficient T-cell access to the tumor microenvironment (TME) is among the causes of tumor immune-resistance. Previous evidence demonstrated that targeting CXCR4 improves anti-PD-1/PD-L1 efficacy reshaping TME. To evaluate the role of newly developed CXCR4 antagonists (PCT/IB2011/000120/ EP2528936B1/US2013/0079292A1) in potentiating anti-PD-1 efficacy two syngeneic murine models, the MC38  and the B16 melanoma-human CXCR4-transduced, were employed.Mice were subcutaneously injected with MC38 (1 × 10) or B16-hCXCR4 (5 × 10). After two weeks, tumors bearing mice were intraperitoneally (ip) treated with murine anti-PD-1 [RMP1-14] (5 mg/kg, twice week for 2 weeks), Pep R (2 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 2 weeks), or both agents. The TME was evaluated through immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry. In addition, the effects of the human-anti-PD-1 nivolumab and/or Peptide-R54 (Pep R54), were evaluated on human melanoma PES43 cells and xenografts treated.The combined treatment, Pep R plus anti-PD-1, reduced the MC38 Relative Tumor Volume (RTV) by 2.67 fold (p = 0.038) while nor anti-PD-1, neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. Significant higher number of Granzyme B (GZMB) positive cells was detected in MC38 tumors from mice treated with the combined treatment (p = 0.016) while anti-PD-1 determined a modest but significant increase of tumor-infiltrating GZMB positive cells (p = 0.035). Also, a lower number of FoxP3 positive cells was detected (p = 0.022). In the B16-hCXCR4 tumors, two weeks of combined treatment reduced tumor volume by 2.27 fold while nor anti-PD-1 neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. A significant higher number of GRZB positive cells was observed in B16-hCXCR4 tumors treated with combined treatment (p = 0,0015) as compared to anti-PD-1 (p = 0.028). The combined treatment reduced CXCR4, CXCL12 and PD-L1 expression in MC38 tumors. In addition, flow cytometry on fresh B16-hCXCR4 tumors showed significantly higher Tregs number following anti-PD-1 partially reversed by the combined treatment Pep R and anti-PD-1. Combined treatment determined an increase of CD8/Tregs and CD8/MDSC ratio. To dissect the effect of anti-PD-1 and CXCR4 targeting on PD-1 expressed by human  cells, PES43 human melanoma xenograft model was employed. In vitro human anti-PD-1 nivolumab or pembrolizumab (10 μM) reduced PES43 cells growth while nivolumab (10 μM) inhibited pERK1/2, P38 MAPK, pAKT and p4EBP. PES43 xenograft mice were treated with Pep R54, a newly developed Pep R derivative (AcHN-Arg-Ala-[DCys-Arg- Nal(2')-His-Pen]- COOH), plus nivolumab. After 3 weeks of combined treatment a significant reduction in tumor growth was shown (p = 0.038). PES43 lung disseminated tumor cells (DTC) were detected in fresh lung tissues as melanoma positive MCSP-APC cells. Although not statistically significant, DTC-PES43 cells were reduced in mice lungs treated with combined treatment while nivolumab or Pep R54 did not affect DTC number.Combined treatment with the new developed CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R, plus anti-PD-1, reduced tumor-growth in two syngeneic murine models, anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant, potentiating Granzyme and reducing Foxp3 cells infiltration. In addition, the human specific CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R54, cooperated with nivolumab in inhibiting the growth of the PD-1 expressing human PES43 melanoma xenograft.

This study aimed to discover blood-based markers for the early detection of CRC and to ascertain their efficiency in discriminating healthy controls, patients with polyps and adenomas and  patients. We first analysed and screened ZFAS1, SNHG11, LINC00909 and LINC00654 in a bioinformatics database and then collected clinical plasma samples for a preliminary small-scale analysis and further large-scale verification. We then explored the mechanism of dominant lncRNA SNHG11 expression in CRC by in vitro and in vivo assays. The combination of ZFAS1, SNHG11, LINC00909 and LINC00654 showed high diagnostic performance for CRC (AUC: 0.937), especially early-stage disease (AUC: 0.935). Plasma levels of the four candidate lncRNAs were significantly reduced in post-operative samples compared to pre-operative samples. A panel including these four lncRNAs performed well in distinguishing patient groups with different stages of  disease, and SNHG11 exhibited the greatest diagnostic ability to identify precancerous lesions and early-stage tumour formation. Mechanistically, high SNHG11 expression promotes proliferation and metastasis by targeting the Hippo pathway. Taken together, the data indicate that SNHG11 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC and a potential biomarker for the early detection of CRC.

Only  variants scored by the InSiGHT variant database as class 4 or 5 (clinically actionable) were included in the analysis.Ninety-nine  carriers had no  prior to or at first colonoscopy, but subsequently developed . Among these, 96 were 65 years of age or younger at diagnosis, and included 77 , 17  and 2  carriers. The number of cancers detected within < 1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5 and at > 3.5 years after previous colonoscopy were 9, 43, 31 and 13, respectively. Of these, 2, 8, 4 and 3 were stage III, respectively, and only one stage IV (interval 2.5-3.5 years) disease. Ten-year crude survival after  were 93, 94 and 82% for stage I, II and III disease, respectively ( < 0.001). Ten-year crude survival when the last colonoscopy had been < 1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5 or > 3.5 years before diagnosis, was 89, 90, 90 and 92%, respectively ( = 0.91).In  and  carriers, more advanced  stage was associated with poorer survival, whereas time since previous colonoscopy was not. Although the numbers are limited, together with our previously reported findings, these results may be in conflict with the view that follow-up of  variant carriers with colonoscopy intervals of less than 3 years provides significant benefit.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630307>Disparities in surgery for early-stage : the impact of refusal.</a></h2><p>For early-stage  surgery is often curative, yet refusal of recommended surgical interventions may be contributing to disparities in patient treatment. This study aims to assess predictors of early-stage cancers surgery refusal, and the impact on survival.Patients recommended surgery with primary stage I and II lung, prostate, breast, and  cancers, diagnosed between 2007-2014, were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (n = 498,927). Surgery refusal was reported for 5,757 (1.2%) patients. Associations between sociodemographic variables and surgery refusal by  type were assessed in adjusted multivariable logistic regression models. The impact of refusal on survival was investigated using adjusted Cox-Proportional Hazard regression in a propensity score-matched cohort.Increasing age (p < 0.0001 for all four  types), non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.68-2.39; OR 3.04, 95% CI 2.17-4.26; OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.77-2.71; OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.86-2.20; vs non-Hispanic White), insurance status (uninsured: OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.89-3.99; OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.72-2.56; vs insured), marital status (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.85-2.51; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.10; OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.80-2.47; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.81-2.09), and stage (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.70-2.22; OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.18; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96) were all associated with refusal; patients refusing surgery were at increased risk of death compared to patients who underwent surgery.More vulnerable patients are at higher risk of refusing recommended surgery, and this decision negatively impacts their survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665064>BMP3 suppresses  tumorigenesis via ActRIIB/SMAD2-dependent and TAK1/JNK signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>BMP3 gene is often found hypermethylated and hence inactivated in several types of cancers including colorectal  (CRC), indicating that it has a suppressor role in carcinogenesis. Though BMP3 is a reliable biomarker for screening CRC, the molecular mechanism of BMP3 in carcinogenesis remains largely unknown.The expression level of BMP3 was examined by immunohistochemistry staining and western blot. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and real-time quantitative MSP were used to test the hypermethylation status of BMP3 gene. Analyses of BMP3 function in  cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were performed using HCT116 and KM12 cells. BMP3 was further knocked down or overexpressed in CRC cells, and the effects on cell growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice were assessed. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyze the association between BMP3 and BMPR2 or BMP3 and ActRIIB. Microarray analysis was performed to identify most differentially expressed genes and pathways regulated by BMP3. The BMP3-regulated SMAD2-dependent signaling pathway and TAK1/JNK signal axes were further investigated by quantitative PCR and western blot.BMP3 gene was hypermethylated and its expression was downregulated in both CRC tissues and cell lines. Expressing exogenous BMP3 in HCT116 inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion and increased rate of apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. However, shRNA-mediated attenuation of endogenous BMP3 in KM12 reversed such inhibitory and apoptotic effects. Furthermore, BMP3 could bind to ActRIIB, an activin type II receptor at the cellular membrane, thereby activating SMAD2-dependent pathway and TAK1/JNK signal axes to regulate downstream targets including caspase-7, p21, and SMAD4 that play crucial roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis.Our study reveals a previously unknown mechanism of BMP3 tumor suppression in CRC and provides a rationale for future investigation of BMP3 as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic agents to fight CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667329>Early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy for lower gastrointestinal  with peritoneal metastasis: a systematic review and critical analysis.</a></h2><p>Early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) can be used in combination with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to treat patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of multiple origins. The present study is a systematic review to evaluate the role of EPIC after CRS + HIPEC for appendiceal and colorectal cancers with PC.We conducted a systematic search in PubMed according to the PRISMA guidelines and included all studies published before June 27 of 2019 comparing EPIC to HIPEC or the combination of both. Our search found 79 articles. After excluding non-relevant articles, a total of 13 retrospective clinical studies reporting on the efficacy and safety of EPIC compared to HIPEC or as a combination therapy for lower gastrointestinal  were analyzed. Initial EPIC reports led to its declined usage because of concerns with increased postoperative morbidity and uncertain added benefit on survival. Recent retrospective studies have been promising, showing significant improvements in OS and fewer issues with complications when adding EPIC to CRS + HIPEC.Current evidence is entirely retrospective and is conflicting. It is hoped that ongoing clinical trials and additional studies will clarify EPIC's role in the treatment of patients with PC.© 2019 Soucisse et al., published by De Gruyter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656692>The Cytotoxic Effects of Geranylgeranylacetone Are Attenuated in the High-Glucose Condition.</a></h2><p>Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) has been used as an antiulcer drug and also is known as inducer of heat shock protein 70 that has cytoprotective effects especially in hyperglycemic condition. In contrast, cytotoxicity of GGA has also been reported. Some studies have reported that GGA suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis in cell models of human leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, and  . Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether GGA can have a cytotoxic effect on a human cervical  cell line (HeLa), human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK) in normal-glucose and high-glucose environments (NG and HG, respectively). The results showed that 100 μM GGA inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells only in NG environment despite inhibiting proliferation of Caco-2 and HEK cells regardless of glucose concentration. Cell viability assay revealed that GGA decreased viability of HeLa, Caco-2, and HEK cells only in NG environment. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the type of cell death was a combination of necrosis and apoptosis. Our study revealed that difference in cytotoxicity of GGA is influenced by glucose condition. The cytotoxic effects of GGA are attenuated in the HG condition. Since both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects are reported about GGA, further research is needed about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects.© Yuko Nakano et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671761>Size Matters in the Cytotoxicity of Polydopamine Nanoparticles in Different Types of Tumors.</a></h2><p>Polydopamine has acquired great relevance in the field of nanomedicine due to its physicochemical properties. Previously, it has been reported that nanoparticles synthetized from this polymer are able to decrease the viability of breast and  tumor cells. In addition, it is well known that the size of therapeutic particles plays an essential role in their effect. As a consequence, the influence of this parameter on the cytotoxicity of polydopamine nanoparticles was studied in this work. For this purpose, polydopamine nanoparticles with three different diameters (115, 200 and 420 nm) were synthetized and characterized. Their effect on the viability of distinct sorts of human carcinomas (breast, , liver and lung) and stromal cells was investigated, as well as the possible mechanisms that could be responsible for such cytotoxicity. Moreover, polydopamine nanoparticles were also loaded with doxorubicin and the therapeutic action of the resulting nanosystem was analyzed. As a result, it was demonstrated that a smaller nanoparticle size is related to a more enhanced antiproliferative activity, which may be a consequence of polydopamine's affinity for iron ions. Smaller nanoparticles would be able to adsorb more lysosomal Fe and, when they are loaded with doxorubicin, a synergistic effect can be achieved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644719>Splenic flexure mobilization in sigmoid and rectal  resections: a meta-analysis of surgical outcomes.</a></h2><p>to evaluate the influence of the splenic flexure mobilization for the main surgical outcomes of patients submitted to resection of sigmoid and rectal .we searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and LILACS, using the terms "splenic flexure mobilization", "colorectal surgery", "rectal ", "anterior resection", "sigmoid ", and "sigmoid resection".

As the prevalence of thyroid  increases worldwide, thyroid  survivorship is associated with increasing personal and cumulative costs. Few studies have examined the psychological and material economic costs experienced by thyroid  survivors. We seek to estimate the comparative prevalence of financial and psychological hardship among thyroid  and non-thyroid  patients in the United States.The 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Experiences with  databank was queried to identify thyroid and non-thyroid (, breast, lung, prostate)  survivors. This survey includes assessments of financial stress, material hardship, and psychological financial hardship.  incidence-based weighted estimates of responses were compared between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. Independent predictors of material and psychological financial burden were identified through separate multivariate regression models.Thyroid  survivors more frequently reported psychological financial burden compared to non-thyroid  (46.1% vs 24.0%, P = .04). Material financial hardship (28.1% vs 19.9%, P = .37) and concurrent material and psychological hardship (25.1% vs 12.5%, P = .09) were noted at similar frequencies between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. However, on multivariate analysis, only younger age and lack of health insurance coverage were independently associated with psychological financial hardship.Thyroid  survivors report greater psychological financial hardship than non-thyroid  survivors. Because this financial burden may be underrecognized in the medical community, further studies should be conducted to aid physicians in better understanding the impact of a thyroid  diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a  model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of  patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to -related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies have examined the potential prognostic value of the CLU protein in CRC; however, our research follows an alternative approach, focusing on the CLU mRNA expression.Total RNA from 172 cancerous tissue specimens and 39 paired non-cancerous ones was isolated and 2 μg of this were subjected to reverse transcription with an oligo-dT primer. The single stranded DNA, which was synthesized, was amplified with an in-house developed highly sensitive and precise qPCR method, using specific pair of primers for the CLU molecule. Finally, an extensive biostatical analysis took place for the assessment of the results.Patients with tumors expressing high CLU mRNA levels had a higher probability for poor outcome (relapse and death), comparing to those with CLU mRNA-negative tumors. This association between CLU mRNA expression status and both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) is evident in Cox regression analysis and is also depicted in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Consistently, the aforementioned associations and the CLU mRNA expression levels are significantly enhanced as CRC tumors progress from TNM stage I to IV, further supporting the functional implication of CLU in tumorigenesis.High CLU mRNA levels in CRC tumors can act as a new adverse prognostic biomarker of DFS and OS for CRC, independent of clinicopathological and biological features of the patient.Copyright © 2019.

We have identified that mitotic regulator microtubule-associated protein 9 (MAP9) as a critical regulator of CIN in CRC. We thus studied the effect of MAP9 loss on CRC in Map9 knockout mice and in cell lines.We generated  epithelial-specific Map9 knockout mice and evaluated CRC development. Effect of Map9 knockout on CRC progression was determined in chemical or ApcMin/+-induced CRC. Molecular mechanism of MAP9 was determined using spectral karyotyping (SKY), microtubule assays and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Clinical significance of MAP9 was examined in 141 CRC patients.Spontaneous  tumors (9.1%) were developed in  epithelium-specific Map9 knockout mice at 17 months, but none was observed in wildtype littermates. Map9 deletion accelerated CRC formation both in ApcMin/+ mice and azoxymethane-treated mice, and reduced survival in ApcMin/+ mice. Mechanistically, MAP9 stabilized microtubules and mediated mitotic spindle assembly. MAP9 also maintained the spindle pole integrity and protected K-fibre from depolymerization at spindle poles. MAP9 loss induced severe mitosis failure, chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy, leading to transformation of normal  epithelial cells. WGS confirmed enhanced CIN in intestinal tumors from Map9 knockout ApcMin/+ mice. In CRC patients, MAP9 was frequently silenced and its down-regulation was associated with poor survival.MAP9 is a microtubule stabilizer that contributes to spindle stability and inhibits colorectal tumorigenesis, supporting the role of MAP9 as a tumor suppressor for preventing CIN in CRC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667710>Changes in use of opioid therapy after  diagnosis: a population-based study.</a></h2><p>To describe patterns of opioid use in  survivors.In a cohort study of  patients diagnosed during 1995-2014 and enrolled at two Kaiser Permanente regions, we constructed quarterly measures of opioid use from 1 year before  diagnosis through 5 years after diagnosis to examine changes in use. Measures included any use, incident use, regular use (use ≥ 45 days in a 91-day quarter), and average daily dose (converted to morphine milligram equivalent, MME). We also assessed temporal trends of opioid use.Of 2,039  patients, 11-15% received opioids in the four pre-diagnosis quarters, 68% in the first quarter after diagnosis, and 15-17% in each subsequent 19 quarters.

Advanced neoplasia (AN) represents the main target of colorectal  screening programs. Our aim was to assess CCE-2 diagnostic accuracy for the detection of AN in FIT+ screenees.Subjects aged 50 to 69, with a positive FIT in 4 population screening programs in Italy and Spain were enrolled. Screenees were asked to perform CCE-2, followed by traditional colonoscopy (TC). TC was performed the same day or the following morning. Bowel preparation included a split PEG-based regimen and sodium phosphate (NaP) with gastografin as boosters. CCE-2 video was read by an endoscopist blinded to the results of TC. The main outcomes were CCE-2 accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for AN when using 2 different-sized thresholds for TC referral (ie, >6 or >10 mm polyp).Two hundred twenty-two subjects were enrolled, and 178 patients completed both CCE-2 and TC examination (87.7%). Overall, 59 cases of AN were detected at TC. Overall, CCE-2 sensitivity was 90%, specificity was 66.1%, PPV was 57.4%, and NPV was 92.9% for AN when using a 6 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 52.8%) and 76.7%, 90.7%, 80.7%, 88.4% when using 10 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 32%), respectively. CCE-2 detected that 8 out of 9 already developed CRC. Among the 41 false-positives at 6-mm cut-off, 34 (82.9%) presented with a nonadvanced adenoma at TC. Mean transit time was 4:04 hours and >70% of patients excreted CCE within 5 hours.In an enriched-disease setting, we showed the high sensitivity of CCE-2 for advanced neoplasia at 6 mm cut-off. The apparently low CCE-2 specificity is related to the choice of AN as the main outcome.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Surgical care is essential for the treatment. Many patients do not have access to curative surgery for colorectal  in rural Kenya. To better understand the impact of surgical care on colorectal  in a resource-limited setting, we compared the experience of patients undergoing operations to those who did not.All patients with histologically confirmed CRC at Tenwek Hospital from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from records when available. The exposure was either curative operation, palliative operation, or no operation. The primary outcome was survival at 5 years, assessed with Cox proportional hazard analysis after propensity-score matching for age, sex, tumor site, time period, and stage.One hundred and sixty-five patients were identified on chart review. Survival information was available for 150 patients with a median follow-up of 319 days. Fifty-two percent had  and 48% had rectal . At diagnosis, the mean age was 55.4 years (SD: 16.7) and the male to female ratio was 1.1:1. Thirty-nine percent underwent curative operations, 25% palliative operations, and 36% no operations. One-year survival was estimated to be 98% for curative surgery, 73% for palliative surgery, and 83% for no surgery (p = 0.0005). On crude analysis, 5-year survival improved with curative operation in comparison to no operation with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (CI: 0.14-0.64) (p = 0.002). After propensity matching, the hazard ratio for curative operation versus no operation remained significant, 0.34 (CI: 0.14-0.80) (p = 0.01).Curative surgery improves survival in our resource-limited environment. Although various factors contribute to the use of surgical treatment, the survival advantage persists after adjusted analysis. Barriers exist for access to prompt surgical evaluation and treatment. Surgical care should be a priority to address the increasing burden of CRC in resource-limited settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661211>Childhood Colorectal  Treatment (PDQ®): Patient Version.</a></h2><p>This PDQ  information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood colorectal .

Previous work demonstrated the therapeutic effect of intratumoral injection of recombinant granulysin using  models of breast  and multiple myeloma. In the present work we have developed a granulysin gene fusion to the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA/CEACAM5) single chain Fv antibody fragment MFE23. Both granulysin and the granulysin-based immunotoxin were expressed in . The immunotoxin specifically recognized CEA, purified or expressed on the cell surface. Moreover, the bioactivity of the immunotoxin against several CEA cell lines was higher than that of granulysin alone. Granulysin and the immunotoxin were tested as a treatment in  xenograft models in athymic mice. When injected intratumorally, both granulysin and the immunotoxin were able to inhibit tumor growth. Furthermore, systemic administration of the immunotoxin demonstrated a decrease in tumor growth in a CEA tumor-bearing mouse model, whereas granulysin did not exhibit a therapeutic effect. This is the first granulysin-based immunotoxin and the present work constitutes the proof of concept of its therapeutic potential.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641062>Medical Oncologists' Perspectives on How the Results of the IDEA Collaboration Impact the Adjuvant Treatment of Stage III .</a></h2><p>The International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration aimed to evaluate whether 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy are noninferior to 6 months. Our study objectives were to characterize medical oncologists' perspectives toward the results of the IDEA collaboration and to evaluate how IDEA impacted prescribing patterns of adjuvant FOLFOX and CAPOX in .A list of questions developed by four medical oncologists regarding IDEA results were formulated and distributed online to gastrointestinal medical oncologists globally. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to summarize information.Of 174 responses, 145 were complete and analyzed. Responses were obtained globally from South America (53%); the U.S. and Canada (28%); Europe, Australia, and New Zealand (12%); and Asia (7%). Most clinicians (98%) were aware of the IDEA study. Prior to IDEA, clinicians preferred FOLFOX over CAPOX (81% vs. 19%). Subsequent to IDEA, 55% of clinicians preferred CAPOX over FOLFOX (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-8.5;  < .01 compared with pre-IDEA). Two thirds (68%) of responders tailored duration of adjuvant therapy based on risk stratification. Most oncologists (76%) were more willing to discontinue oxaliplatin early if toxicities develop after the results of IDEA. Half of responders (50%) found that IDEA increased their confidence in decision making for adjuvant treatment; 36% were unchanged, and 15% indicated decreased confidence. Less than half (48%) were comfortable communicating the study results and the concept of a noninferiority trial with patients.IDEA appears to have shifted clinician preference from FOLFOX to CAPOX for adjuvant therapy, and most clinicians now use a risk-stratified approach in determining duration of adjuvant therapy. Patient education resources may facilitate better communication of IDEA results to patients.This global survey illustrates that most gastrointestinal medical oncologists now use a risk-stratified approach for determining the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III . Clinicians are five times more likely to choose CAPOX over FOLFOX after the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration results.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645984>A new family with a homozygous nonsense variant in  further delineated the clinical phenotype of -associated polyposis.</a></h2><p>A new family with -associated polyposis (NAP) is described, involving a 58-year-old male affected with >100 colorectal polyps and a 55-year-old female sibling with nine colorectal polyps.

In our studies, we focused on the anticancer activity of flavokawain B in colorectal  cells LoVo and its resistant to doxorubicin subline-LoVo/Dx. Strong cytotoxic activity of flavokawain B and its ability to inhibit the proliferation in both cell lines was detected. These effects accompanied with induction cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and the presence of SubG1 fraction. Flavokawain B at low concentration led to increase of caspase-3 activity. The chalcone-induced apoptosis was also confirmed by DNA fragmentation. In our work, the conversion of flavokawain B to corresponding flavanone-5,7-dimetoxyflavanone-was shown to be more extensive in  than in non- cells. We found that the cyclization of the chalcone was related to the significant decrease in the cytotoxicity.

The presence of the candidate circRNAs was confirmed through RNase R assays, qRT-PCR and DNA sequencing, and their diagnostic value was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.The plasma levels of three circRNAs (circ-CCDC66, circ-ABCC1 and circ-STIL) were significantly decreased in CRC patients (n = 45) compared with healthy controls (n = 61). The ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the three-circRNA panel was 0.780, which is higher than that of traditional protein biomarkers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Combining the circRNA panel with CEA and CA19-9 might improve the ability to diagnose CRC (AUC = 0.855). In addition, the plasma circ-ABCC1 level was related to tumor growth and progression, and the plasma circ-CCDC66 and circ-ABCC1 levels were decreased in precursor lesions of CRC, including  adenomas and adenomatous polyps.

Conversely, it was reported that AhR negatively regulates the β-catenin signal via ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in a ligand dependent manner. However, there have been conflicting data among previous studies regarding the relationship between these two proteins. In this report, we conducted confirmatory studies dissecting the relationship between AhR and β-catenin. We did not observe β-catenin degradation by AhR ligands in several  cell lines. Reporter assays revealed that the AhR ligand did not alter TcF/β-catenin dependent transcription. Yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays failed to reconstruct the interaction of β-catenin and AhR even when other factors, Arnt, CUL4B, and DDB1, were co-expressed additionally. Independently to induction of AhR expression, β-catenin enhanced AhR-dependent transcriptional activation via the xenobiotic response element (XRE). Coimmunoprecipitation detected the formation of a β-catenin and ligand-activated AhR complex, which was thought to reflect the β-catenin mediated enhancement of the AhR signaling. Overall, we could only confirm unidirectional interaction, which is positive regulation of the AhR signal by β-catenin.

Then, Pirc rats aged 1 month were treated for 3 months with Adipol (Adi), a patented preparation containing phytoestrogens and insoluble fibers.  tumorigenesis was significantly reduced by Adi treatment ( tumors/rat were 5.3 ± 0.8 and 2.9 ± 0.3, Mucin Depleted Foci/rat 127 ± 6.6 and 97.1 ± 8.6 in Controls and Adi-treated rats, respectively, means ± SE, P < 0.01). The treatment also normalized  proliferation pattern along the crypt and significantly increased apoptosis in  tumors. Estrogen receptor-β expression was increased by Adi treatment, especially in the tumors. These positive effects suggest that Adipol may be exploited as a chemopreventive agent to reduce  risk in familial adenomatous polyposis patients and to postpone prophylactic colectomy. Moreover, given the similarities between familial adenomatous polyposis and sporadic colorectal , it might also be used as chemopreventive agent in colorectal  patients at risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659112>Proteomic Analysis of Primary  and Synchronous Solitary Liver Metastasis.</a></h2><p> is prone to distant metastases to other sites and the risk of recurrence is relatively high. Therefore, the identification of liver metastasis-related factors is important for the diagnosis or treatment of . The aim of this study was to identify the metastasis-related factors that are differentially expressed in synchronous solitary liver metastasis compared to primary .Tissues of primary  and associated with liver metastases of five patients were used for mass spectrometry. Identified proteins were validated by western blotting. The in silico analysis was performed using the STRING database and GeneMANIA.We identified 58 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 51 under-expressed and 7 over-expressed proteins among a total of 164 identified proteins. Major hubs of protein-protein networks were ACTC1, PRDX6, TPI1, and ALDH1A1. DEPs were located in the extracellular region and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity. The metabolic process was significantly enriched in biological processes and an involvement in the KEGG pathway.These DEPs can potentially be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of liver metastasis and they may provide a new strategy for developing anti-metastatic liver drugs in  patients.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

The fluctuations may induce variations in anticancer drugs sensitivity to  cells. We aimed to clarify the variations in sensitivity of SN-38 to  patients with ESKD and investigate this mechanism, by human  cells exposed to uremic serum residue. LS180 cells were exposed to normal or uremic serum residue (LS/NSR or LS/USR cells) for a month. IC values of SN-38 in LS/NSR or LS/USR cells were calculated from viability of each cells treated SN-38. mRNA expression and intracellular SN-38 accumulation was evaluated by RT-PCR and HPLC-fluorescence methods, respectively. The IC value in LS/USR cells was higher than that in LS/NSR cells. Organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 2B1 mRNA expression was lower in LS/USR cells than in LS/NSR cells, and SN-38 accumulation in LS/USR cells was lower than that in LS/NSR cells. Only co-treatment baicalin, which is OATP2B1 inhibitor, almost negated the difference in SN-38 accumulation between LS/NSR and LS/USR. Anticancer effects of substrates of OATP2B1, such as SN-38, were reduced in ESKD patients at the same plasma substrate concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671847>NEDD9 Inhibition by miR-25-5p Activation Is Critically Involved in Co-Treatment of Melatonin- and Pterostilbene-Induced Apoptosis in Colorectal  Cells.</a></h2><p>The underlying interaction between melatonin (MLT) and daily fruit intake still remains unclear to date, despite multibiological effects of MLT. Herein, the apoptotic mechanism by co-treatment of MLT and pterostilbene (Ptero) contained mainly in grape and blueberries was elucidated in colorectal cancers (CRCs). MLT and Ptero co-treatment (MLT+Ptero) showed synergistic cytotoxicity compared with MLT or Ptero alone, reduced the number of colonies and Ki67 expression, and also increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL) positive cells and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CRCs. Consistently, MLT+Ptero cleaved caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activated sex-determining region Y-Box10 (SOX10), and also attenuated the expression of Bcl-xL, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 9 (NEDD9), and SOX9 in CRCs. Additionally, MLT+Ptero induced differentially expressed microRNAs (upregulation: miR-25-5p, miR-542-5p, miR-711, miR-4725-3p, and miR-4484; downregulation: miR-4504, miR-668-3p, miR-3121-5p, miR-195-3p, and miR-5194) in HT29 cells. Consistently, MLT +Ptero upregulated miR-25-5p at mRNA level and conversely NEDD9 overexpression or miR-25-5p inhibitor reversed the ability of MLT+Ptero to increase cytotoxicity, suppress colony formation, and cleave PARP in CRCs. Furthermore, immunofluorescence confirmed miR-25-5p inhibitor reversed the reduced fluorescence of NEDD9 and increased SOX10 by MLT+Ptero in HT29 cells. Taken together, our findings provided evidence that MLT+Ptero enhances apoptosis via miR-25-5p mediated NEDD9 inhibition in  cells as a potent strategy for colorectal  therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646796>Dentatin exerts anticancer effects on human  cell lines via cell cycle arrest, autophagy, inhibition of cell migration and JAK/STAT signalling pathway.</a></h2><p> is a malignant disease with significant mortality. In the present study the anticancer effects of a carbazole alkaloid, Dentatin, were examined against  cells.The  HT-29 cell line and the normal CCD-18 CO  cell line were used in the present study. MTT assay was used to check the proliferation rate of the  cells. Autophagy was detected by electron microscopy. DNA damage was checked by alkaline comet assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Cell migration was monitored by wound healing assay. Protein expression was checked by western blot analysis.The results showed that Dentatin inhibited the growth of HT-29  cells in a concentration-dependent manner and with IC50 of 25 µM. However, the IC50 of Dentatin against the normal CCD-18CO  cells was four times higher (ie.,100 µM). Dentatin inhibited the proliferation of the HT-29  cells by triggering S-phase arrest. This was also accompanied with increase in the expression of cyclin D1 and decrease in the expression of Cyclin A and B1. Moreover, Dentatin also induced autophagy in the HT-29 cells which was associated with upregulation of LC3 II and downregulation of Beclin-1 expression. Comet assay revealed that Dentatin induced DNA damage in the HT-29 cells. Dentatin also significantly inhibited the migration of the HT-29 cells. Finally the effects of Dentatin were examined on the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and it was found that Dentatin inhibited this pathway.Dentatin may prove to be an essential lead molecule for the management of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662542>CA19-9 Concentration After First-line Chemotherapy Is Prognostic Predictor of Metastatic .</a></h2><p>To evaluate whether the serum levels of CEA or CA19-9 concentration is a useful predictor of survival in patients with metastatic  (mCC).Between 2012 and 2015, 113 patients with mCC who underwent chemotherapy according to the Japanese Colorectal  Treatment Guidelines at four Jikei University Hospitals were enrolled in this study. The two serum tumor makers, CEA and CA19-9 were measured before first-line chemotherapy and at four months thereafter.Serum CA19-9 concentration at four months after first-line chemotherapy (p=0.003, HR=3.761) and first-line chemotherapy including oxaliplatin (p=0.038, HR=0.312) were independent predictors of survival in patients with mCC.

These include directional motility (including galvanotaxis), pH balance, extracellular proteolysis, and invasion. Contrary to the substantial in vitro data, however, evidence for VGSC involvement in the  process in vivo is limited. Here, we critically assess, for the first time, the available in vivo evidence, hierarchically from mRNA level to emerging clinical aspects, including protein-level studies, electrolyte content, animal tests, and clinical imaging. The evidence strongly suggests that different VGSC subtypes (mainly Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are expressed de novo in human carcinoma tissues and generally parallel the situation in vitro. Consistent with this, tissue electrolyte (sodium) levels, quantified by clinical imaging, are significantly higher in  vs. matched non- tissues. These are early events in the acquisition of metastatic potential by the  cells. Taken together, the multi-faceted evidence suggests that the VGSC expression has clinical (diagnostic and therapeutic) potential as a prognostic marker, as well as an anti-metastatic target. The distinct advantages offered by the VGSC include especially (1) its embryonic nature, demonstrated most clearly for the predominant neonatal Nav1.5 expression in breast and , and (2) the specifically druggable persistent current that VGSCs develop under hypoxic conditions, as in growing tumours, which promotes invasiveness and metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666929>DPA shows comparable chemotherapy sensitizing effects as EPA upon cellular incorporation in tumor cells.</a></h2><p>Dietary supplementation with ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been reported to enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells towards chemotherapy. Most enhancing effects are described for ω-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA; less evidence is available with the intermediate DPA. We studied the chemotherapy enhancing effects of EPA, DPA and DHA in murine  C26 adenocarcinoma cells and showed that DPA displayed similar chemosensitizing effects as EPA. Moreover, EPA supplementation increased cellular DPA content. In a C26 tumor-bearing mouse model, we studied the incorporation of ω-3 PUFA in tumor and skeletal muscle after a diet with different ω-3 PUFA sources. Although little DPA was present in the fatty acid food sources, in those that contained considerable EPA concentrations, DPA levels were higher in tumor and muscle tissue. From these studies, we conclude that EPA and DPA show chemosensitizing effects and that intake of EPA or EPA-containing nutrition leads to increased cellular DPA content by elongation. These findings support the use of ω-3 PUFA containing nutritional supplementations in  patients during chemotherapy treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660141>Alternating consumption of β-glucan and quercetin reduces mortality in mice with colorectal .</a></h2><p>The current dietary recommendations for disease prevention and management are scarce and are not well supported. Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal  (CRC) by regulating the gut microbiota and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate,  length, inflammatory cytokines, gut microbiota, and  epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated  damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%.

The distribution of Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Summary Stage for 12 malignancies was examined. We estimated net survival by stage up to 5 years after diagnosis, controlling for background mortality with life tables of all-cause mortality in the general population by single year of age, sex, and calendar period. Survival estimates were age-standardised using the International  Survival Standard (ICSS) weights.Only 14.2% of patients were diagnosed at a localised stage and 38.9% at the regional stage. The proportion of patients with known stage was 88.9% during 2000-2004 but fell to 59.4% during 2010-2013. During 2005-2009, 1- and 5-year survival for , rectal, breast, cervical, and prostate  was about 90% or higher for patients diagnosed at the localised stage. During 2004-2009, the proportion of patients diagnosed at a localised stage was lower in Kuwait than in the US for , breast, and lung . Age-standardised 5-year net survival for all stages combined was lower in Kuwait than the US for , lung, and breast , but stage-specific survival was similar.Since stage-specific survival is similar in Kuwait and the US, late stage at diagnosis is likely to be a major contributing factor to the overall lower survival in Kuwait than in the US. Increasing public awareness of  risk factors and symptoms and investment in early detection will be vital to reduce the proportion of patients diagnosed at a late stage and to improve survival.Copyright © 2019 E.

Today, MSI is usually detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of specific microsatellite markers. However, the instability is identified by comparing the length of microsatellite repeats in tumor and normal samples. In this work, we developed a qualitative transcriptional signature to individually predict MSI status for right-sided  (RCC) based on tumor samples.Using RCC samples, based on the relative expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs, we extracted a signature consisting of 10 gene pairs (10-GPS) to predict MSI status for RCC through a feature selection process. A sample is predicted as MSI when the gene expression orderings of at least 7 gene pairs vote for MSI; otherwise the microsatellite stability (MSS). The classification performance reached the largest F-score in the training dataset. This signature was verified in four independent datasets of RCCs with the F-scores of 1, 0.9630, 0.9412 and 0.8798, respectively. Additionally, the hierarchical clustering analyses and molecular features also supported the correctness of the reclassifications of the MSI status by 10-GPS.The qualitative transcriptional signature can be used to classify MSI status of RCC samples at the individualized level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658780> Infection and Colorectal Surgery: Is There Any Risk?</a></h2><p> infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection, with important consequences both from a medical and financial point of view, but its correlation with anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgeries is scarcely reported in the literature.  We conducted a retrospective study looking for patients who underwent open or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancers between January 2012 and December 2017, excluding emergency surgeries for complicated colorectal tumors. We also examined patient history for risk factors for CDI such as age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical findings at admission or during hospital stay as well as tumor characteristics.  A total of 360 patients were included in the study, out of which 320 underwent surgeries that included anastomoses. There were 19 cases of anastomotic leaks, out of which 13 patients were diagnosed with CDI, with a statistic significance for association between CDI and anastomotic leakage ( < 0.0001). Most patients who developed both CDI and anastomotic leaks had left-sided resections or a type of rectal resection, while none of the patients with right-sided resections had this association, but with no statistical significance possibly due to the limited number of cases.  CDI is a relevant risk factor and should be taken into consideration when trying to prevent anastomotic leaks in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery for  or rectal . Thorough assessment of risk factors at admission should be mandatory in order to adequately prepare the patient and plan an optimal course of treatment.

This study was to investigate the association of CDX2 expression level in colorectal  (CRC) with age, gender, microscopic histopathology, tumor staging, tumor grading, 3-year survival rate, and prognosis.After preparing paraffin tissue blocks, CDX2 protein expression was assayed by immunohistochemistry in 82 CRC patients. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to detect tumor histology, tumor grading, tumor staging, and blood-lymphatic, and neural invasion. The collected data includes age, gender, tumor site, and 3-year survival rate of patients after diagnosis.The CDX2 expression was significantly higher in men than in women, and it was significantly lower in right-sided tumors as in transverse  and left-sided tumors. Also, the CDX2 expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma than in mucinous. In addition, a significant correlation was found between downregulated CDX2 and lymph node involvement. In tumor grading, there was a significant correlation between CDX2 downregulation and high-grade tumor. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between downregulated CDX2 expression and overall pathological staging.The downregulated CDX2 expression is associated with female gender, right-sided tumors, mucinous tumors, lymph node involvement, high-grade tumor, and advanced overall pathological staging and can be considered as a possible prognostic factor for patients follow-up. However, our study is a preliminary study and further studies with larger sample sizes in different ethnic groups are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651174>PLGA Nanoparticles Co-Delivering siRNAs against Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 and Its Ligand Gene for Suppression of  Tumor Growth.</a></h2><p>Tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes highly express programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) that interacts with its ligand, programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor immunity, allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CTLs and  tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, co-silencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independently of adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 single silencing alone, co-silencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in .

The obtained micelle was used for co-delivery of the anticancer drug docetaxel (DTX) and Chrysin (CHS) as an adjuvant on the CSCs originated from Human  adenocarcinoma cell line.  stem cells were enriched by MACS technique and characterized by flow cytometry analysis against CD133 marker.Data demonstrated that the micelles harbouring DTX@CHS had potential to reduce  stem cell viability compared to free DTX@CHS, single-drug formulations and the control group (p < 0.05). The combination effect of DTX and CHS formulated in micelle was synergistic in CSCs (CI < 1).

Hypomagnesemia is a comparatively frequent adverse event of this drug, which is likely overlooked because it occurs later in treatment without symptoms. Furthermore, hypomagnesemia and hypomagnesemia-induced corrected QT (QTc) prolongation may lead to loss of consciousness (LOC), the onset of which is not generally considered associated with the treatment of anti-EGFR antibody because of its rare occurrence. Here, we present a colorectal  patient treated with anti-EGFR antibody, who suffered LOC during treatment while severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation was not observed.A 69-year-old man with metastatic  was treated with cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) plus irinotecan as third-line chemotherapy. His serum magnesium level gradually decreased, and grade 2 hypomagnesemia (a serum magnesium level of 0.9 mg/dL) was observed at the 12th administration of cetuximab. In light of this development, intravenous supplementation of 20 mEq magnesium sulfate began with careful blood monitoring despite the lack of clinical symptoms. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed prolonged QT or corrected QT (QTc) intervals (grade 1). His serum magnesium level remained at 0.9 mg/dL, and no hypomagnesemia symptoms were observed by the 17th administration of cetuximab. After the treatment, however, he suddenly lost consciousness without symptoms related to infusion or allergic reactions. Circulatory collapse following dermatological reactions and respiratory events were not evident. Intravenous supplementation of magnesium sulfate was administered again. He awakened 2 min after the onset of temporary LOC without any other symptoms related to hypomagnesemia, such as lethargy, tremor, tetany, and seizures. No other etiology outside of the low level of serum magnesium was confirmed in further examinations. Cetuximab was discontinued, and his serum magnesium level returned to a level within the normal range after 6 weeks. Because of tumor progression, regorafenib and TAS-102 (trifluridine tipiracil hydrochloride) were introduced sequentially for 6 months. Five months after the final treatment of TAS-102, he died of his primary disease, which reflected a survival period of 4 years and 6 months since the beginning of treatment.This case report reminds clinicians that LOC can be induced without severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation, during anti-EGFR antibody treatment for metastatic colorectal  even while under carefully monitored magnesium supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662545>Granulation Tissue-induced Pseudo-relapse During Nivolumab Treatment in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung .</a></h2><p>Atypical tumor responses such as pseudo-progression or hyper-progression sometimes occur during immune check point inhibitor therapy.

The functions of ion channels in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract influence a variety of cellular processes, many of which overlap with these hallmarks of . In this review we focus on the roles of the calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl) and zinc (Zn) transporters in GI , with a special emphasis on the roles of the KCNQ1 K channel and CFTR Cl channel in colorectal  (CRC). Ca is a ubiquitous second messenger, serving as a signaling molecule for a variety of cellular processes such as control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration. Various members of the TRP superfamily, including TRPM8, TRPM7, TRPM6 and TRPM2, have been implicated in GI cancers, especially through overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and down-regulation in . Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are classically associated with the initiation and conduction of action potentials in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells. The VGSC Na1.5 is abundantly expressed in human colorectal CRC cell lines as well as being highly expressed in primary CRC samples. Studies have demonstrated that conductance through Na1.5 contributes significantly to CRC cell invasiveness and  progression. Zn transporters of the ZIP/SLC39A and ZnT/SLC30A families are dysregulated in all major GI organ cancers, in particular, ZIP4 up-regulation in pancreatic  (PC). More than 70 K channel genes, clustered in four families, are found expressed in the GI tract, where they regulate a range of cellular processes, including gastrin secretion in the stomach and anion secretion and fluid balance in the intestinal tract. Several distinct types of K channels are found dysregulated in the GI tract. Notable are hERG1 upregulation in PC, gastric  (GC) and CRC, leading to enhanced  angiogenesis and invasion, and KCNQ1 down-regulation in CRC, where KCNQ1 expression is associated with enhanced disease-free survival in stage II, III, and IV disease. Cl channels are critical for a range of cellular and tissue processes in the GI tract, especially fluid balance in the . Most notable is CFTR, whose deficiency leads to mucus blockage, microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in the intestinal tract. CFTR is a tumor suppressor in several GI cancers. Cystic fibrosis patients are at a significant risk for CRC and low levels of CFTR expression are associated with poor overall disease-free survival in sporadic CRC. Two other classes of chloride channels that are dysregulated in GI cancers are the chloride intracellular channels (CLIC1, 3 & 4) and the chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCA1,2,4). CLIC1 & 4 are upregulated in PC, GC, gallbladder , and CRC, while the CLCA proteins have been reported to be down-regulated in CRC. In summary, it is clear, from the diverse influences of ion channels, that their aberrant expression and/or activity can contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression. Further, because ion channels are often localized to the plasma membrane and subject to multiple layers of regulation, they represent promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention including the repurposing of current drugs.©The Author(s) 2019.

A previous study focused on its antioxidant mechanism, whereas in this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of a series of 28 analogues and the mechanism of apoptosis of the most cytotoxic compound against wild-type (HCT-116) and p53 mutant (HT-29) colorectal  cell lines. The series of analogues comprise of different families, namely hydrazone, oxadiazole, thiosemicarbazides and triazoles. In the initial cytotoxicity screening, N-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyloxy) benzohydrazide, henceforth known as, P5H, was found to be most cytotoxic against human colorectal  cell lines (IC for HCT-116 = 11.79 μM and HT-29 = 18.52 μM). Additionally, P5H was found to have some degree of selectivity towards  cells compared to normal human  cells (CCD-112 CoN).

A gene selection algorithm for  cancers is proposed by using the dynamic modeling properties of chameleon algorithm and its capability to discover any arbitrary shape clusters. This chameleon algorithm based gene selection algorithm comprises three steps. The first step is to select those genes with higher Fisher function values as candidate genes. The second step is to detect gene groups by using chameleon algorithm based on Euclidean distance. The third step is to select the most important gene from each gene cluster to comprise the gene subset by using the information index to classification of each gene. After that the chameleon algorithm is used to detect groups of  patients and normal people only with genes in gene subset. The final clustering accuracy of chameleon algorithm with the selected genes is up to 85.48%. The clustering analysis to  data and the comparisons to the other related studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in detecting the differential genes of  cancers.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673925>Hereditary or Not?

There is a significant risk for  in first-degree relatives of individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome. However, less than 3% of serrated polyposis syndrome cases are explained by identifiable germline mutations, with mutations in RNF43 being the only currently validated genetic cause. Serrated polyposis syndrome is rarely explained by identifiable germline mutations, but there remains an increased risk for colorectal  in first-degree relatives. Referral for genetic counseling and testing is recommended for individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome and a personal history of coexisting adenomatous polyposis or with a concerning family history and can be considered for all individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose ethanol (0.5%, 1%, and 2% [v/v] ethanol in drinking water) for 28 wk on  tumor incidence in rats injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Body weight, fluid and food consumption, and the total numbers of  adenomas (mild-, moderate-, and severe-grade dysplasia) per rat were unaffected by ethanol consumption. However, the numbers of severe-grade dysplasia were significantly reduced by 1% ethanol compared with the control (0% ethanol; -93%) but not by 0.5% and 2% ethanol. Although the numbers of total adenocarcinomas were unaffected, those of total of adenomas and adenocarcinomas together were significantly reduced by 0.5% and 1% ethanol (-39% and -41%, respectively). Intriguingly, real-time PCR assay indicated the abundance of cecal Clostridium leptum (a putative immunosuppressor) was the least in rats received 1% ethanol. Furthermore, 1% ethanol markedly increased  mRNA of IL-6, a putative suppressor of regulatory T-cells and cytoprotector. This study provides the first evidence for the potential of 1% ethanol, but not 2% ethanol, to prevent  tumorigenesis in rats, supporting the J-curve hypothesis of the effect of low-dose alcohol on health. Further, the modulation of C. leptum and expression of IL-6, potentially linking to carcinogenesis, by 1% ethanol may provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms of the anti- tumor effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661689>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced T4 : A Nationwide Propensity-Score Matched Cohort Analysis.</a></h2><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) for locally advanced  (LACC) could potentially lead to tumor shrinkage, eradication of micrometastases, and prevention of tumor cell shedding during surgery. This retrospective study investigates the surgical and oncological outcomes of preoperative CT for LACC.Using the Netherlands  Registry, data of patients with stage II or III , diagnosed between 2008 and 2016 was collected. A propensity score matching (PSM; 1:2) was performed and compared patients with clinical tumor (cT) 4  who were treated with neoadjuvant CT to patients with cT4  treated with adjuvant CT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">1</xref>).A total of 192 patients treated with neoadjuvant CT were compared to 1,954 patients that received adjuvant CT. After PSM, 149 patients in the neoadjuvant group were compared to 298 patients in the control group. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics after PSM. After neoadjuvant CT, a significant response was observed in 13 (9%) patients with 5 (4%) patients showing a complete response. Complete resection margins (R0) were achieved in 77% in the neoadjuvant group versus 86% in the adjuvant treated group (p = 0.037).

CCSCs as a result of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations and also complex interconnection with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can evolve and convert to full malignant cells. Mounting evidence suggests that in  therapy both CCSCs and non-CCSCs in TME have to be regarded to break through the limitation of current therapies. In this regard, stem cell capabilities of some non-CCSCs may arise inside the TME condition. Therefore, a deep knowledge of regulatory mechanisms, heterogeneity, specific markers, and signaling pathways of CCSCs and their interconnection with TME components is needed to improve the treatment of colorectal  and the patient's life quality. In this review, we address current different targeted therapeutic options that target cell surface markers and signaling pathways of CCSCs and other components of TME. Current challenges and future perspectives of  personalized therapy are also provided here. Taken together, based on the deep understanding of biology of CCSCs and using three-dimensional culture technologies, it can be possible to reach successful  eradication and improvise combination targeted therapies against CCSCs and TME.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650468>Baicalein, an enteric microbial metabolite, suppresses gut inflammation and  progression in Apc mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal  (CRC) development. Baicalin (BI), a major constituent in an anti-inflammatory herb Scutellaria baicalensis, can be biotransformed into baicalein (BE) by the intestinal microbiota. We evaluated the anti-inflammation and anti-CRC effects of the metabolite BE.The in vitro biotransformation by human intestinal microbiota from BI into BE has been determined with HPLC. Using a gut-specific Apc mouse model, the effects of oral BE on the life span, organ index, and tumor multiplicity were evaluated. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA. To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal microbiota. Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125.2 to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index. Compared with the model group, following BE treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and  (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In the gut tissues, BE treatment significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In vitro data supported our in vivo results that the anti-CRC effects of BE were via the inhibition of gut inflammation and induction of  cell death.Our results suggest that the parent compound BI can be quickly converted into its microbial metabolite BE, which has stronger bioactive effects than BI.

The existence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in  tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic acid into the large  through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their  tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671666>Automated Workflow for Somatic and Germline Next Generation Sequencing Analysis in Routine Clinical  Diagnostics.</a></h2><p>Thanks to personalized medicine trends and collaborations between industry, clinical research groups and regulatory agencies, next generation sequencing (NGS) is turning into a common practice faster than one could have originally expected. When considering clinical applications of NGS in oncology, a rapid workflow for DNA extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, as well as producing high quality library preparation, can be real challenges. Here we consider these targets and how applying effective automation technology to NGS workflows may help improve yield, timing and quality-control. We firstly evaluated DNA recovery from archived FFPE blocks from three different manual extraction methods and two automated extraction workstations. The workflow was then implemented to somatic (lung/ panel) and germline () library preparation for NGS analysis exploiting two automated workstations. All commercial kits gave good results in terms of DNA yield and quality. On the other hand, the automated workstation workflow has been proven to be a valid automatic extraction system to obtain high quality DNA suitable for NGS analysis (lung/ Ampli-seq panel). Moreover, it can be efficiently integrated with an open liquid handling platform to provide high-quality libraries from germline DNA with more reproducibility and high coverage for targeted sequences in less time ().

To explore its anti-tumorigenic potential, we examined the effects of DMF on human  carcinoma cell lines and the underlying mechanisms of action. Human  cell line HT-29 and human colorectal carcinoma cell line T84 were treated with or without DMF. Effects of DMF on proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were analyzed mainly by Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)- and Lactatdehydrogenase (LDH)assays, caspase activation, flowcytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting. In addition, combinational treatments with radiation and chemotherapy were performed. DMF inhibits cell proliferation in both cell lines. It was shown that DMF induces a cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, which is accompanied by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin D1 and Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)4. Furthermore, upregulation of autophagy associated proteins suggests that autophagy is involved. In addition, the activation of apoptotic markers provides evidence that apoptosis is involved.

This drug effectively reduces the size of tumors to a certain degree; however,  cells can gradually acquire resistance, resulting in disease progression. To identify the mechanism of 5‑FU resistance, we established three 5‑FU‑resistant  cell lines and analyzed both apoptosis‑related protein expression levels and BH3 profiling. These 5‑FU‑resistant  cell lines acquired apoptotic resistance to 5‑FU. Although apoptosis‑related protein expression levels were altered in each 5‑FU‑resistant  cell line variably, BH3 profiling indicated BCLXL dependence in 5‑FU‑resistant HT‑29 cells only. Functional BCLXL inhibition in 5‑FU‑resistant HT‑29 cells not only sensitized the cells to apoptosis but also overcame 5‑FU resistance. The apoptotic BIM protein was preferentially sequestered, thereby resulting in acquired dependence on BCLXL for survival. Additionally, in vivo models showed that BCLXL inhibition controlled tumor progression. These results indicate that BH3 profiling facilitates the identification of the functional role of anti‑apoptotic proteins during drug resistance and has clinical implications for  in targeting specific proteins such as BCLXL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650683>Toll-like receptor 4 regulates spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis by up-regulating IL-6 and GM-CSF.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is as an important component of intestinal tumorigenesis. The activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling promotes inflammation in colitis of mice, but the role of TLR4 in intestinal tumorigenesis is not yet clear. About 80%-90% of colorectal tumours contain inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) tumour suppressor, and intestinal adenoma carcinogenesis in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is also closely related to the germline mutations in Apc. The Apc (multiple intestinal neoplasia) model mouse is a well-utilized model of FAP, an inherited form of intestinal . In this study, Apc intestinal adenoma mice were generated on TLR4-sufficient and TLR4-deficient backgrounds to investigate the carcinogenic effect of TLR4 in mouse gut by comparing mice survival, peripheral blood cells, bone marrow haematopoietic precursor cells and numbers of polyps in the guts of Apc WT and Apc TLR4 mice. The results revealed that TLR4 had a critical role in promoting spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. Significant differential genes were screened out by the high-throughput RNA-Seq method. After combining these results with KEGG enrichment data, it was determined that TLR4 might promote intestinal tumorigenesis by activating cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in  signalling pathways. After a series of validation experiments for the concerned genes, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF (CSF2), IL11, CCL3, S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly decreased in gut tumours of Apc TLR4 mice compared with Apc WT mice. In the functional study of core down-regulation factors, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF, IL11, CCL3 and S100A8/9 increased the viability of  cell lines and decreased the apoptosis rate of  cells with irradiation and chemical treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

The development of drug resistance and dearth of the viable drug options form a serious obstacle in the treatment of CC. Herein, the anticancer potential of Zingiberene was examined against the CC cells.The proliferation rate of the CC cells was assessed by cell counting assay. Autophagy was detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The transfected cells were then treated with varied concentrations of Zingiberene (0, 10, 20 and 40 µM) for 24 h and monitored by fluorescent microscopy. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting.Zingiberene could considerably inhibit the proliferation of CC cells. The anticancer activity of Zingiberene against the HT-29 CC cells was found to be due to induction of autophagy. The Zingiberene triggered autophagy was also linked with increase in the expression of LC3-II and decrease in p62 expression. However, no apparent effects were observed on the LC3-I expression. Moreover, it was found that zingiberine also caused activation of autophagy-related caspases in the HT-29 cells. Further, it was found that Zingiberene could inhibit the mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in the CC cells. Zingiberene also suppressed the weight and volume of the xenografted tumors concentration-dependently.These results indicate that Zingiberene may inhibit the growth of CC in vitro and in vivo and may be used for the development of systemic therapy against CC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662792>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 expression is closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 is reported to participate in intestinal mucosa barrier damage in Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to determine the association with disease activity and intestinal permeability.Uc.261 level in  mucosa and Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) were evaluated in 20 active CD patients. Uc.261 expression and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were determined in Caco2 and T84 cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. Body weight, disease activity index (DAI),  length, histological index (HI), intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran, uc.261, and tight junction proteins (TJPs) levels were evaluated in BALB/C mice treated with saline enema, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol enema, and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody injection, respectively.Uc.261 expression was overexpressed in CD patients, TNF-α treated cells, and colitis mice. Uc.261 expression was positively correlated with HBI ( = 0.582,  = 0.007) in CD patients, and positively correlated with TNF-α concentration and negatively correlated TEER in Caco2 and T84 cells (all  < 0.05). Furthermore, uc.261 was positively correlated with DAI ( = 0.824,  = 0.008), HI ( = 0.672,  = 0.021), and intestinal permeability ( = 0.636,  = 0.012), while negatively correlated with body weight ( = -0.574,  = 0.035),  length ( = -0.866,  = 0.017), and TJP expression (all  < 0.05) in colitis mice.Uc.261 expression was closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in CD. Anti-TNF-α treatment may play its role through suppressing uc.261 expression in colitis mice.© The Author(s), 2019.</p></html>
