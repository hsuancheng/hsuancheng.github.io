The inflammasome serves as a key component of immune homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to various inflammatory disorders. However, little is known about the effects of  on inflammasome activation and the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that  attenuates inflammasome activation via GPR43 in a Ca-dependent manner. Through binding to GPR43,  activates the G subunit and subsequent phospholipase C-IP signaling to decrease Ca mobilization. In addition,  activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), promotes NLRP3 inflammasome ubiquitination by PKA, and ultimately induces NLRP3 degradation through autophagy. In vivo,  protects mice from NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis and LPS-induced . Collectively, our research demonstrates that  regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome via GPR43 and Ca-dependent mechanisms, which reveals the mechanism of metabolite-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome attenuation and highlights  as a possible therapeutic strategy for NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25249339>Anti-inflammatory effects of Baicalin, Baicalein, and Wogonin in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Here, three structurally related polyphenols found in the Chinese herb Huang Qui, namely baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin, were examined for its effects on inflammatory responses by monitoring the effects of baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated vascular inflammatory responses. We found that each compound inhibited LPS-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of monocytes to human endothelial cells. Each compound induced potent inhibition of phorbol-12-myristate 13- and LPS-induced endothelial cell protein C receptor shedding. It also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore, each compound suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB or extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, treatment with each compound resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal . These results suggest that baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin posses anti-inflammatory functions by inhibiting hyperpermeability, expression of CAMs, and adhesion and migration of leukocytes, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517286>A synbiotic concept containing spore-forming  strains and a prebiotic fiber blend consistently enhanced metabolic activity by modulation of the gut microbiome .</a></h2><p>A standardized  simulation of the human gastrointestinal tract (M-SHIME®) was used to assess the effect of repeated daily administration of a synbiotic formulation, containing five spore-forming  strains and a prebiotic fiber blend, on the microbial activity and composition of three simulated human subjects. Firstly, while confirming recent findings, deeper phylogenetic insight was obtained in the resident M-SHIME® microbiota, demonstrating that the model maintains a diverse and representative, colon region-specific luminal and mucosal microbial community. Supplementation of the synbiotic concept increased microbial diversity in the distal colon areas, whereas specific enhancement of  levels was observed in the ascending colon suggesting a successful engraftment of the  spores, which probably resulted in a stimulatory effect on, among others, , ,  and  contributing directly or indirectly to stimulation of , propionate and butyrate production. When compared with a previous study investigating the  strains, the generated data suggest a synergistic effect on the intestinal microbiota for the synbiotic formulation. Given the fact that the probiotic strains have been shown to impact post-prandial metabolic  in human individuals, it might be interesting to further investigate the efficacy of the synbiotic concept in protecting against obesity-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26600968>New-found link between microbiota and obesity.</a></h2><p>Due to the grave pathological role of obesity, worldwide research is being continued to find out the causative factors involved in it. Recent advances in this field reveal a possible relationship between the compositional pattern of gut microbiota and genesis of obesity. Several study results have shown that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, microbiota-induced fermentation products) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS, an integral component of Gram negative microorganisms) play the key role in linking the two. Though several SCFAs are produced as microbiota-fermentation products, three of them, i.e., butyrate, propionate and  have been found to be definitely involved in obesity; though individually they are neither purely obesogenic nor antiobesogenic. Out of these, butyrate and propionate are predominantly antiobesogenic. Butyrate, though a major energy source for colonocytes, has been found to increase mitochondrial activity, prevent metabolic , improve insulin sensitivity, possess anti-inflammatory potential, increase intestinal barrier function and protect against diet-induced obesity without causing hypophagia. Propionate has been found to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, thereby antagonizing the cholesterol increasing action of , and to inhibit the expression of resistin in adipocytes. Moreover, both these SCFAs have been found to cause weight regulation through their stimulatory effect on anorexigenic gut hormones and to increase the synthesis of leptin. Unlike butyrate and propionate, , which is substantially absorbed, shows more obesogenic potential, as it acts as a substrate for hepatic and adipocyte lipogenesis. High fat diet increases the absorption of LPS, which, in turn, has been found to be associated with metabolic  and to induce inflammation resulting in obesity. Multiple independent and interrelated mechanisms have been found to be involved in such linking processes which are discussed in this review work along with some possible remedial measures for prevention of weight gain and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482935>Anti-inflammatory effects of vicenin-2 and scolymoside in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Two structurally related flavonoids found in Cyclopia subternata, namely vicenin-2 and scolymoside, were examined for its effects on inflammatory responses by monitoring the effects of vicenin-2 and scolymoside on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated vascular inflammatory responses.The anti-inflammatory activities of vicenin-2 and scolymoside were determined by measuring permeability,monocytes adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in LPS-activated HUVECs and mice.We found that post-treatment of each compound inhibited LPS-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of human neutrophils to human endothelial cells. Each compound induced potent inhibition of phorbol-12-myristate 13- (PMA) and LPS-induced endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR)shedding. It also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore,each compound suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or Interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, posttreatment with each compound resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal .Vicenin-2 and scolymoside possess anti-inflammatory functions by inhibiting hyperpermeability,expression of CAMs, and adhesion and migration of leukocytes, thereby endorsing its usefulness as a therapy for vascular inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26825634>Fully Balanced Fluids do not Improve Microvascular Oxygenation, Acidosis and Renal Function in a Rat Model of .</a></h2><p>The expectation of fluid therapy in patients with septic shock is that it corrects hypovolemia, with the aim of restoring tissue perfusion and oxygenation and organ function. This study investigated whether different types of resuscitation fluids were effective in improving renal microcirculatory oxygenation, acidosis, oxidative stress, and renal function in a rat model of endotoxemic shock. Five groups of rats were used: a sham group, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, and three LPS groups that received 30 mL/kg/h of 0.9% sodium chloride (0.9% NaCl), a new bicarbonate buffered crystalloid solution closely resembling the composition of plasma (FB-Cxt) or a hydroxyethyl starch-ringer  solution. Systemic hemodynamic variables, renal blood flow, microvascular oxygenation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and renal function were measured. LPS-induced shock was only partially resolved by fluid administration. Animals became arterially hypotensive despite adequate central venous pressure. Hydroxyethyl starch-ringer  was more effective at improving arterial pressures and renal blood flow than 0.9% NaCl or FB-Cxt. Fluids had marginal effects on pH and HCO3 levels irrespective of the buffer, or on renal μPO2 and dysfunction. Colloids increased the markers of renal oxidative stress (P < 0.001), whereas unbalanced crystalloids increased the markers of nitrosative stress during sepsis (P < 0.01). -induced acidosis and decreases in renal μPO2 or renal injury were not corrected solely by fluid resuscitation, irrespective of the buffer of the fluid. Our study supported the idea that fluids must be supplemented by other compounds that specifically correct renal inflammation and oxygenation to be effective in resolving septic shock-induced renal failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315049>Antihypertensive Effects of Probiotics.</a></h2><p>The present review focuses in the hypertension-associated changes in the microbiota and the current insights regarding the impact of probiotics on blood pressure in animal models and in human hypertensive patients.Gut dysbiosis in hypertension is characterized by (i) the gut microbioma that is less diverse and less rich with an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and (ii) a decrease in - and butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in lactate-producing bacterial populations. The meta-analysis of the human studies supports that supplementation with probiotics reduces blood pressure. The mechanism of this antihypertensive effect of probiotics and its protective effect on endothelial function has not been fully elucidated. Further investigations are needed to clarify if the effects of probiotic bacteria result from the changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolic by-products; the restoration of the gut barrier function; and the effects on , inflammation, and renal sympathetic nerve activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27671340>Effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation in resuscitation fluids on renal microcirculatory oxygenation, inflammation, and function in a rat model of .</a></h2><p>Modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress appears to limit sepsis-induced damage in experimental models. The kidney is one of the most sensitive organs to injury during septic shock. In this study, we evaluated the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration in conjunction with fluid resuscitation on renal oxygenation and function. We hypothesized that reducing inflammation would improve the microcirculatory oxygenation in the kidney and limit the onset of acute kidney injury (AKI).Rats were randomized into five groups (n = 8 per group): (1) control group, (2) control + NAC, (3) endotoxemic shock with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) without fluids, (4) LPS + fluid resuscitation, and (5) LPS + fluid resuscitation + NAC (150 mg/kg/h). Fluid resuscitation was initiated at 120 min and maintained at fixed volume for 2 h with hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.4) dissolved in -balanced Ringer's solution (Volulyte) with or without supplementation with NAC (150 mg/kg/h). Oxygen tension in the renal cortex (CμPO2), outer medulla (MμPO2), and renal vein was measured using phosphorimetry. Biomarkers of renal injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed in kidney tissues.Fluid resuscitation significantly improved the systemic and renal macrohemodynamic parameters after LPS. However, the addition of NAC further improved cortical renal oxygenation, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption (p < 0.05). NAC supplementation dampened the accumulation of NGAL or L-FABP, hyaluronic acid, and nitric oxide in kidney tissue (p < 0.01).The addition of NAC to fluid resuscitation may improve renal oxygenation and attenuate microvascular dysfunction and AKI. Decreases in renal NO and hyaluronic acid levels may be involved in this beneficial effect. A therapeutic strategy combining initial fluid resuscitation with antioxidant therapies may prevent sepsis-induced AKI.</p></html>
