In this study, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated for six saturated fatty acids and two unsaturated fatty acids against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The antimicrobial behavior in the liquid medium was categorized into three groups. The first was the selective antibacterial activity group comprising myristic  (C14:0 fatty ), palmitoleic  (C16:1 fatty ), and  (C18:1 fatty ) and preferentially displayed antimicrobial activity for S. aureus (group 1). C16:1 fatty  displayed high antimicrobial activity only for S. aureus. The second was the non-selective antibacterial activity group which displayed antibacterial activity for both Staphylococci (group 2). Caprylic  (C8:0 fatty ), capric  (C10:0 fatty ), and lauric  (C12:0 fatty ) comprised group 2. The third was the nonantibacterial activity group which did not show significant antimicrobial activity (group 3). Bactericidal activities were confirmed for C12:0 fatty  and C16:1 fatty  by evaluating the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) on the agar medium. C12:0 fatty  displayed non-selective bactericidal behavior against S. aureus and S. epidermidis when the fatty  concentration was above 250 μg mL. These findings suggest that C16:1 fatty  has the potential to be used as a detergent in skin care and medical products because it can selectively kill only S. aureus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29628230>Chitosan stabilized nasal emulsion delivery system for effective humoral and cellular response against recombinant tetravalent dengue antigen.</a></h2><p>Nasal vaccine delivery systems are emerging alternatives to the conventional sub unit vaccine delivery systems owing to their ability to stimulate potent antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Additional virtue of nasal delivery is its close proximity of immune cells to external epithelial layer which is the route of entry to pathogens. Toxicity of emulsion based vaccine delivery systems may be attributed to the presence of high quantities of surfactants used for stabilizing the emulsions. A safer approach would be to reduce physiologically unwanted surfactant burden in the emulsion to the bare limit to necessity.  was used as oil phase due to its ability to enhance penetration of system in nasal mucosa. This emulsion was designed with the purpose that it activates the innate (TLR 4) and adaptive immune systems apart from performing its antigen delivery function. Proving the hypothesis, emulsion when immunized along with recombinant tetravalent dengue antigen has elicited a profound antigen specific humoral and cellular response. Antigen cross presenting and sustained release of antigen by emulsion is the key factor in shaping this immune response. Moreover, the dose sparing effect of emulsion has also been proven which has a crucial role in modern day vaccine delivery. This significant humoral and cellular response elicited proves the suitability of this emulsion system for enhancing the protective effect of vaccines against various intracellular pathogens.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the ineffectiveness of conventional treatments, there is growing interest in research involving compounds of natural origin. One such compound is curcumin (CUR), which has been proven to be effective against this microorganism. However, some of CUR's physicochemical properties, especially its low aqueous solubility, make the therapeutic application of this compound difficult. Thus, the incorporation of CUR in mucoadhesive liquid crystalline systems (MLCSs) for vaginal administration may be an efficient strategy for the treatment of VVC. MLCSs are capable of potentiating the compound's action, releasing it in a controlled manner, and can enable longer exposure at the site of infection. In this study, MLCSs consisting of  and ergosterol 5:1 (w/w) as the oily phase, PPG-5-CETETH-20 as the surfactant, and a polymer dispersion of 1% chitosan as the aqueous phase, were developed for the application of CUR (MLCS-CUR) in VVC treatment. The formulations were characterized by polarized light microscopy (PLM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), oscillatory rheometry, continuous shear rheometry, texture profile analysis, and in vitro mucoadhesion. In addition, the antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro, and the effects on local fungal burden and cytokine profiles were investigated in a murine model of VVC. PLM and SAXS showed that the developed formulations presented a characteristic of a microemulsion. However, after the addition of artificial vaginal mucus (AVM), PLM showed that the formulations had structures similar to the "Maltese cross" characteristic of lamellar MLCS. Mucoadhesive test results showed an increase in the mucoadhesive strength of these formulations. Rheology analyses suggested long-lasting action of the formulation at the infected site. The in vitro antimicrobial activity assays suggested that CUR possesses antifungal activity against Candida albicans, determined after its incorporation into the MLCS. Further, MLCS-CUR was also more effective in vivo in the control of vaginal infection than treatment with fluconazole. Immunological assays showed that the ratio of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β) to anti-inflammatory (TGF-β) cytokines has decreased and that there is a reduction in the number of polymorphonuclear neutrophils recruited to the vaginal lumen, showing that treatment with MLCS-CUR was effective in modulating the inflammatory reaction associated with the infection. The results suggest that MLCSs could potentially be used in the treatment of VVC with CUR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009913>Deletion of fabN in Enterococcus faecalis results in unsaturated fatty  auxotrophy and decreased release of inflammatory cytokines.</a></h2><p>The Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis can cause life-threatening infections and is resistant to several commonly used antibiotics. The type II fatty  pathway in bacteria is discussed as a potential target for antimicrobial therapy. However, it was shown that inhibition or deletion of its enzymes can be rescued in Gram-positive bacteria by supplementation with fatty acids. Here we show that by deletion of the fabN gene, which is essential for unsaturated fatty  (UFA) synthesis in E. faecalis, growth is impaired but can be rescued by supplementation with  or human serum. Nonetheless, we demonstrate alterations of the UFA profile after supplementation with  in the ΔfabN mutant using a specific glycolipid. In addition, we demonstrate that cytokine release in vitro is almost abolished after stimulation of mouse macrophages by the mutant in comparison to the wild type. The results indicate that fabN is not a suitable target for antimicrobials as UFA auxotrophy can be overcome. However, deletion of fabN resulted in a decreased inflammatory response indicating that fabN and resulting UFA synthesis are relevant for virulence.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25760987>Preventive effects of a fermented dairy product against Alzheimer's disease and identification of a novel oleamide with enhanced microglial phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity.</a></h2><p>Despite the ever-increasing number of patients with dementia worldwide, fundamental therapeutic approaches to this condition have not been established. Epidemiological studies suggest that intake of fermented dairy products prevents cognitive decline in the elderly. However, the active compounds responsible for the effect remain to be elucidated. The present study aims to elucidate the preventive effects of dairy products on Alzheimer's disease and to identify the responsible component. Here, in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD), intake of a dairy product fermented with Penicillium candidum had preventive effects on the disease by reducing the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and hippocampal inflammation (TNF-α and MIP-1α production), and enhancing hippocampal neurotrophic factors (BDNF and GDNF). A search for preventive substances in the fermented dairy product identified oleamide as a novel dual-active component that enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity towards LPS stimulation in vitro and in vivo. During the fermentation, oleamide was synthesized from , which is an abundant component of general dairy products owing to lipase enzymatic amidation. The present study has demonstrated the preventive effect of dairy products on Alzheimer's disease, which was previously reported only epidemiologically. Moreover, oleamide has been identified as an active component of dairy products that is considered to reduce Aβ accumulation via enhanced microglial phagocytosis, and to suppress microglial inflammation after Aβ deposition. Because fermented dairy products such as camembert cheese are easy to ingest safely as a daily meal, their consumption might represent a preventive strategy for dementia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187404>Functional expression of the free fatty acids receptor-1 and -4 (FFA1/GPR40 and FFA4/GPR120) in bovine endometrial cells.</a></h2><p>Endometrial epithelial cells play a key defensive role as part of the innate immune response of cow uterus. An association between risk of acquiring infectious diseases and increased levels of free fatty acids postpartum has been suggested, and the use of omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA) has been proposed as a beneficial strategy to improve  and fertility. The goal of our study was to demonstrate the presence of free fatty  (FFA)-1 and 4 receptors in endometrial cells and to investigate their role on DHA interference in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory endometrial activation. We demonstrated that the bovine endometrial (BEND) cells line and bovine endometrium express both FFA1 and FFA4 receptors. FFA1 and FFA4 receptors were localized in the epithelium lining the endometrial cavity and in endometrial glands whereas in BEND cells a characteristic cell membrane localization of both receptors was observed. DHA, a FFA4 natural agonist, increased intracellular calcium mobilization in BEND cells, but the FFA1 agonists  and linoleic acids did not increase this response. DHA-induced intracellular calcium mobilization was inhibited by the FFA4 and FFA1 antagonists AH7614 and GW1100, respectively. DHA significantly reduced LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, but none of the antagonists reduced the effect produced by DHA. On the contrary, linoleic  increased LPS-induced PGE2 production. In conclusion, endometrial cells express FFA4 and FFA1 receptors, and DHA induces intracellular calcium release via FFA4 and FFA1 receptors. DHA reduces PGE2, but this response was not mediated by FFA4 or FFA1 receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26318523>Diversity in the structures and ligand-binding sites of nematode fatty  and retinol-binding proteins revealed by Na-FAR-1 from Necator americanus.</a></h2><p>Fatty  and retinol-binding proteins (FARs) comprise a family of unusual α-helix rich lipid-binding proteins found exclusively in nematodes. They are secreted into host tissues by parasites of plants, animals and humans. The structure of a FAR protein from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is available, but this protein [C. elegans FAR-7 (Ce-FAR-7)] is from a subfamily of FARs that does not appear to be important at the host/parasite interface. We have therefore examined [Necator americanus FAR-1 (Na-FAR-1)] from the blood-feeding intestinal parasite of humans, N. americanus. The 3D structure of Na-FAR-1 in its ligand-free and ligand-bound forms, determined by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography respectively, reveals an α-helical fold similar to Ce-FAR-7, but Na-FAR-1 possesses a larger and more complex internal ligand-binding cavity and an additional C-terminal α-helix. Titration of apo-Na-FAR-1 with , analysed by NMR chemical shift perturbation, reveals that at least four distinct protein-ligand complexes can be formed. Na-FAR-1 and possibly other FARs may have a wider repertoire for hydrophobic ligand binding, as confirmed in the present study by our finding that a range of neutral and polar lipids co-purify with the bacterially expressed recombinant protein. Finally, we show by immunohistochemistry that Na-FAR-1 is present in adult worms with a tissue distribution indicative of possible roles in nutrient acquisition by the parasite and in reproduction in the male.© 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27964715>Differential effects of palmitoleic  on human lymphocyte proliferation and function.</a></h2><p>Palmitoleic  (PA) is a n-7 monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) secreted by adipose tissue and related to decreased insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Evidences have been shown that PA also decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in cultured macrophages. Although studies have shown that other fatty acids (FAs) modulate several lymphocyte functions, the specific effect of PA on these cells is unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of PA on activation and differentiation of human lymphocytes in comparison to  (OA).Human lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of health men and cultured in the presence of growing concentrations of PA or OA (5 to 200 μM), for 24 h. After that, cells were collected and cytotoxicity evaluated by flow cytometry. Then, we analyzed proliferative capacity in lymphocytes treated with non toxic concentrations of PA and OA (25 and 50 μM, respectively), in the presence or absence of concanavalin A (ConA). The Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production was determined by the Cytometric Bead Array. CD28 and CD95 surface expression and T regulatory cell percentage were determined by flow cytometry.We observed that PA is toxic to lymphocytes above 50 μM. PA promoted a decrease of lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by ConA in both concentrations. PA also decreased CD28 externalization and increased CD95. On the other hand, OA did not alter these parameters. In the same way, PA reduced IL6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL17A production in both concentration and IL2 only at 50 μM (in the presence of ConA). OA promoted IFN-gamma reduction in both concentrations and an increase of IL-2, IL4 and IL10 at 25 μM. Both fatty acids decreased the percentage of T regulatory cells.In conclusion, PA promoted a suppressive effect on lymphocyte proliferation characterized by a decrease of Th1 and Th17 response, and co-stimulatory molecule (CD28). However, OA increased lymphocyte proliferation through IL2 production and Th2 response. These results also show a more suppressive effect of PA on lymphocytes in comparison to OA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27350074>Bioorthogonal Chemical Reporters for Monitoring Unsaturated Fatty-Acylated Proteins.</a></h2><p>Dietary unsaturated fatty acids, such as , have been shown to be covalently incorporated into a small subset of proteins, but the generality and diversity of this protein modification has not been studied. We synthesized unsaturated fatty- chemical reporters and determined their protein targets in mammalian cells. The reporters can induce the formation of lipid droplets and be incorporated site-specifically onto known fatty-acylated proteins and label many proteins in mammalian cells. Quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that unsaturated fatty acids modify similar protein targets to saturated fatty acids, including several immunity-associated proteins. This demonstrates that unsaturated fatty acids can directly modify many proteins to exert their unique and often beneficial physiological effects in vivo.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we identified both body fat gain in obesity and impaired glucose metabolism as two independent risk factors for increased serum levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). Since obesity is associated with increased and/or delayed resolution of inflammation observed in various chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, we investigated the impact of FFAs on human monocyte-derived and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (DCs) functions relevant for the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. FFAs such as palmitic  (PA) and  (OA) did not affect the pro-inflammatory immune response of DCs. In contrast, PA and OA sensitize DCs resulting in augmented secretion of TH1/TH17-instructive cytokines upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. Interestingly, obesity in mice worsened a TH1/TH17-driven psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Strong correlation of the amount of total FFA, PA, and OA in serum with the severity of skin inflammation points to a critical role of FFA in obesity-mediated exacerbation of skin inflammation. Our data suggest that increased levels of FFAs might be a predisposing factor promoting a TH1/TH17-mediated inflammation such as psoriasis in response to an inflammatory danger signal.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition, this condition may lead to premature aging. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a nutritional supplementation with monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on several functions and oxidative stress parameters in peritoneal immune cells of obese mice, as well as on the life span of these animals.Obesity was induced in adult female ICR/CD1 by the administration of a high-fat diet (HFD) for 14 weeks. During the last 6 weeks of HFD feeding, one group of obese mice received the same HFD, supplemented with 1500 mg of 2-hydroxyoleic  (2-OHOA) and another with 3000 mg of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). Several functions and oxidative stress parameters of peritoneal leukocytes were evaluated.The groups of obese mice treated with 2-OHOA or with EPA and DHA showed a significant improvement in several functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, digestion capacity, Natural killer activity and lymphoproliferation in response to mitogens. All of these functions, which were decreased in obese mice, increased reaching similar levels to those found in non-obese controls. Both treatments also improved oxidative stress parameters such as xanthine oxidase activity, which decreased, catalase activity and glutathione levels, which increased.These data suggest that dietary supplementation with monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be an effective nutritional intervention to restore the immune response and oxidative stress state, which are impaired in obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28790345>Oleate but not stearate induces the regulatory phenotype of myeloid suppressor cells.</a></h2><p>Tumor infiltrating myeloid cells play contradictory roles in the tumor development. Dendritic cells and classical activated macrophages support anti-tumor immune activity via antigen presentation and induction of pro-inflammatory immune responses. Myeloid suppressor cells (MSCs), for instance myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) or tumor associated macrophages play a critical role in tumor growth. Here, treatment with sodium oleate, an unsaturated fatty , induced a regulatory phenotype in the myeloid suppressor cell line MSC-2 and resulted in an increased suppression of activated T cells, paralleled by increased intracellular lipid droplets formation. Furthermore, sodium oleate potentiated nitric oxide (NO) production in MSC-2, thereby increasing their suppressive capacity. In primary polarized bone marrow cells, sodium oleate (C18:1) and linoleate (C18:2), but not stearate (C18:0) were identified as potent FFA to induce a regulatory phenotype. This effect was abrogated in MSC-2 as well as primary cells by specific inhibition of droplets formation while the inhibition of de novo FFA synthesis proved ineffective, suggesting a critical role for exogenous FFA in the functional induction of MSCs. Taken together our data introduce a new unsaturated fatty -dependent pathway shaping the functional phenotype of MSCs, facilitating the tumor escape from the immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30184537>C. Elegans Fatty  Two-Hydroxylase Regulates Intestinal Homeostasis by Affecting Heptadecenoic  Production.</a></h2><p>The hydroxylation of fatty acids at the C-2 position is the first step of fatty  α-oxidation and generates sphingolipids containing 2-hydroxy fatty acyl moieties. Fatty  2-hydroxylation is catalyzed by Fatty  2-hydroxylase (FA2H) enzyme. However, the precise roles of FA2H and fatty  2-hydroxylation in whole cell homeostasis still remain unclear.Here we utilize Caenorhabditis elegans as the model and systemically investigate the physiological functions of FATH-1/C25A1.5, the highly conserved worm homolog for mammalian FA2H enzyme. Immunostaining, dye-staining and translational fusion reporters were used to visualize FATH-1 protein and a variety of subcellular structures. The "click chemistry" method was employed to label 2-OH fatty  in vivo. Global and tissue-specific RNAi knockdown experiments were performed to inactivate FATH-1 function. Lipid analysis of the fath-1 deficient mutants was achieved by mass spectrometry.C. elegans FATH-1 is expressed at most developmental stages and in most tissues. Loss of fath-1 expression results in severe growth retardation and shortened lifespan. FATH-1 function is crucially required in the intestine but not the epidermis with stereospecificity. The "click chemistry" labeling technique showed that the FATH-1 metabolites are mainly enriched in membrane structures preferable to the apical side of the intestinal cells. At the subcellular level, we found that loss of fath-1 expression inhibits lipid droplets formation, as well as selectively disrupts peroxisomes and apical endosomes. Lipid analysis of the fath-1 deficient animals revealed a significant reduction in the content of heptadecenoic , while other major FAs remain unaffected. Feeding of exogenous heptadecenoic  (C17: 1), but not  (C18: 1), rescues the global and subcellular defects of fath-1 knockdown worms.Our study revealed that FATH-1 and its catalytic products are highly specific in the context of chirality, C-chain length, spatial distribution, as well as the types of cellular organelles they affect. Such an unexpected degree of specificity for the synthesis and functions of hydroxylated FAs helps to regulate protein transport and fat metabolism, therefore maintaining the cellular homeostasis of the intestinal cells. These findings may help our understanding of FA2H functions across species, and offer potential therapeutical targets for treating FA2H-related diseases.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Here, we measured the effects of omega-3 (n-3), n-6 and n-9 fatty acids on the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and naïve T cells. Spleen DCs from BALB/c mice were cultured in vitro with ovalbumin (OVA) with 50 μM fatty acids; α-linolenic , arachidonic  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), linoleic  or  and thereafter OVA-specific DO11.10 T cells were added to the cultures. Fatty acids were taken up by the DCs, as shown by gas chromatography analysis. After culture with arachidonic  or DHA CD11c+ CD11b+ and CD11c+ CD11bneg DCs expressed more CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86 and PDL-1, while IAd remained unchanged. However, fewer T cells co-cultured with these DCs proliferated (CellTrace Violet low) and expressed CD69 or CD25, while more were necrotic (7AAD+). We noted an increased proportion of T cells with a regulatory T cell (Treg) phenotype, i.e., when gating on CD4+ FoxP3+ CTLA-4+, CD4+ FoxP3+ Helios+ or CD4+ FoxP3+ PD-1+, in co-cultures with arachidonic - or DHA-primed DCs relative to control cultures. The proportion of putative Tregs was inversely correlated to T-cell proliferation, indicating a suppressive function of these cells. With arachidonic  DCs produced higher levels of prostaglandin E2 while T cells produced lower amounts of IL-10 and IFNγ. In conclusion arachidonic  and DHA induced up-regulation of activation markers on DCs. However arachidonic - and DHA-primed DCs reduced T-cell proliferation and increased the proportion of T cells expressing FoxP3, indicating that these fatty acids can promote induction of regulatory T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108381>Metabolomic study of the intervention effects of Shuihonghuazi Formula, a Traditional Chinese Medicinal formulae, on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rats using performance HPLC/ESI-TOF-MS.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics is the comprehensive assessment of endogenous metabolites of a biological system in a holistic context, and its property consists with the global view of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

Pro-inflammatory TNFα and pro-fibrotic TGFβ released into the supernatants were measured by ELISA; qPCR was performed for Srebp-1c and PPARα mRNA (genes for products involved in fatty  synthesis and catabolism, respectively). Vitamin D3 and DHA exerted a consistent, dose dependent anti-inflammatory effect, and increased PPARα relative to Srebp-1c in both cell types. By contrast, addition of free fatty acids (FFA, /palmitic  2:1) caused aggravation of LPS-induced inflammatory reaction and an increase of Srebp-1c relative to PPARα.

Aquacultured turbot are commonly fed a high-lipid diet; however, this diet causes excessive lipid deposition and the overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies in mammals have indicated that a relationship exists between pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression and altered lipid metabolism through the activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). In this study, we investigated the relationship between SOCS3 and triglyceride (TG) deposition and mechanism of SOCS3 activation in farmed turbot fed high-lipid diet (HLD). TG content increased with SOCS3 production, mediated by toll-like receptor-nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (TLR-NFκB) signaling in the liver of turbot fed a HLD and in turbot primary liver cells incubated with  (OA). Overexpression of SOCS3 increased TG deposition via the increased production of mature sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (m-SREBP-1). Knockdown of SOCS3 in turbot primary liver cells resulted in normalized TG deposition and decreased m-SREBP-1 production. These results suggest that the HLD and OA can induce cytokine expression by activating the TLR-NFκB signaling pathways, resulting in increased SOCS3 expression. It is proposed that SOCS3 enhances m-SREBP-1 production, leading to TG deposition. These findings provide important new insights into the relationship between cytokine expression and TG deposition and mechanism of HLD-induced pro-inflammatory response, which could help to improve the health of farmed turbot and a better understanding of fish .Copyright © 2017.

However, the lipid mediators involved and their cellular targets have not been identified. Mice lacking Pla2g5 showed markedly reduced lung ILC2 activation and eosinophilia following repetitive Alternaria Alternata inhalation. While Pla2g5-null mice had Wt levels of immediate IL-33 release after one Alternaria dose, they failed to upregulate IL-33 in macrophages following repeated Alternaria administration. Unexpectedly, while adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived (BM)-macrophages restored ILC2 activation and eosinophilia in Alternaria-exposed Pla2g5-null mice, exogenous IL-33 did not. Conversely, transfers of Pla2g5-null BM-macrophages reduced inflammation in Alternaria-exposed Wt mice. Mass spectrometry analysis of free fatty acids (FFAs) demonstrated significantly reduced FFAs (including linoleic  (LA) and  (OA)) in lung and BM-macrophages lacking Pla2g5. Exogenous administration of LA or LA+OA to Wt mice sharply potentiated IL-33-induced lung eosinophilia and ILC2 expansion in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, OA potentiated IL-33-induced inflammation and ILC2 expansion in Pla2g5-null mice, but LA was inactive both in vivo and in vitro. Notably, Pla2g5-null ILC2s showed significantly reduced expression of the FFA-receptor-1 compared to Wt ILC2s.

To gain further insight into the relevance to human metabolic disease of dietary PA, we studied healthy, lean and obese adults enrolled in a randomized, crossover trial comparing 3-week, high-PA (HPA) and low-PA/high- (HOA) diets. After each diet, both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivities were measured, and we assessed cytokine concentrations in plasma and in supernatants derived from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as proinflammatory gene expression in skeletal muscle. Insulin sensitivity was unaffected by diet. Plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α was higher during the HPA diet. Lowering the habitually high PA intake by feeding the HOA diet resulted in lower secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α by PBMCs, as well as lower relative mRNA expression of cJun and NLRP3 in muscle. Principal components analysis of 156 total variables coupled to analysis of covariance indicated that the mechanistic pathway for the differential dietary effects on PBMCs involved changes in the PA/OA ratio of tissue lipids. Our results indicate that lowering the dietary and tissue lipid PA/OA ratio resulted in lower leukocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines and muscle expression of redox-sensitive genes, but the relevance to diabetes risk is uncertain.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Autophagy, an evolutionarily-conserved house-keeping process, was implicated in cellular lipid handling by either feeding and/or degrading lipid-droplets (LDs). We hypothesized that beyond phagocytosis of dead adipocytes, AT-FC biogenesis is supported by the AT microenvironment by regulating autophagy. Non-polarized ("M0") RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to AT conditioned media (AT-CM) exhibited a markedly enhanced LDs biogenesis rate compared to control cells (8.3 Vs 0.3 LDs/cells/h, p<0.005). Autophagic flux was decreased by AT-CM, and fluorescently following autophagosomes over time revealed ~20% decline in new autophagic vesicles' formation rate, and 60-70% decrease in autophagosomal growth rate, without marked alternations in the acidic lysosomal compartment. Suppressing autophagy by either targeting autophagosome formation (pharmacologically, with 3-methyladenine or genetically, with Atg12±Atg7-siRNA), decreased the rate of LD formation induced by . Conversely, interfering with late autophago-lysosomal function, either pharmacologically with bafilomycin-A1, chloroquine or leupeptin, enhanced LD formation in macrophages without affecting LD degradation rate. Similarly enhanced LD biogenesis rate was induced by siRNA targeting Lamp-1 or the V-ATPase. Collectively, we propose that secreted products from AT interrupt late autophagosome maturation in macrophages, supporting enhanced LDs biogenesis and AT-FC formation, thereby contributing to AT dysfunction in obesity.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

We tested the hypothesis that the exogenous application of glycerol as a foliar spray might enhance the disease resistance of Theobroma cacao through the modulation of endogenous G3P levels. We found that exogenous application of glycerol to cacao leaves over a period of 4 days increased the endogenous level of G3P and decreased the level of  (18:1). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were produced (a marker of defence activation) and the expression of many pathogenesis-related genes was induced. Notably, the effects of glycerol application on G3P and 18:1 fatty  content, and gene expression levels, in cacao leaves were dosage dependent. A 100 mm glycerol spray application was sufficient to stimulate the defence response without causing any observable damage, and resulted in a significantly decreased lesion formation by the cacao pathogen Phytophthora capsici; however, a 500 mm glycerol treatment led to chlorosis and cell death. The effects of glycerol treatment on the level of 18:1 and ROS were constrained to the locally treated leaves without affecting distal tissues. The mechanism of the glycerol-mediated defence response in cacao and its potential use as part of a sustainable farming system are discussed.© 2014 BSPP AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28646583>Sebum lipids influence macrophage polarization and activation.</a></h2><p>As lipids are known to regulate macrophage functions, it is reasonable to suppose that a sebocyte-macrophage axis mediated by sebum lipids may exist.To investigate if sebocytes could contribute to the differentiation, polarization and function of macrophages with their secreted lipids.Oil Red O lipid staining and Raman spectroscopy were used to assess the dermal lipid content and penetration. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse the macrophage subsets. Human peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated in the presence of either supernatant from human SZ95 sebocytes or major sebum lipid components and activated with Propionibacterium acnes. Macrophage surface markers and their capacity to uptake fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated P. acnes were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting measurements. Cytokine protein levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis.Sebaceous gland-rich skin had an increased dermal lipid content vs. sebaceous gland-poor skin to which all the tested sebum component lipids could contribute by penetrating the dermoepidermal barrier.

The first analysis was of two gene families with key roles in regulation of oil quality and in particular the accumulation of , namely stearoyl ACP desaturases (SAD) and acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases (FAT). In both cases, these were found to be large gene families with complex expression profiles across a wide range of tissue types and developmental stages. The detailed classification of the oil palm SAD and FAT genes has enabled the updating of the latest version of the oil palm gene model. The second analysis focused on disease resistance (R) genes in order to elucidate possible candidates for breeding of pathogen tolerance/resistance. Ortholog analysis showed that 141 out of the 210 putative oil palm R genes had homologs in banana and rice. These genes formed 37 clusters with 634 orthologous genes. Classification of the 141 oil palm R genes showed that the genes belong to the Kinase (7), CNL (95), MLO-like (8), RLK (3) and Others (28) categories. The CNL R genes formed eight clusters. Expression data for selected R genes also identified potential candidates for breeding of disease resistance traits. Furthermore, these findings can provide information about the species evolution as well as the identification of agronomically important genes in oil palm and other major crops.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291010>Indian freshwater edible snail Bellamya bengalensis lipid extract prevents T cell mediated hypersensitivity and inhibits LPS induced macrophage activation.</a></h2><p>Soup prepared from the foot of fresh water edible snail, Bellamya bengalensis, is traditionally consumed by the tribes of Jharkhand against rheumatism like bone and joint inflammation. As rheumatism has underlying involvement of cell mediated hypersensitivity, in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) model and in vitro LPS-induced macrophage signaling were studied to delineate the mechanism by which Bellamya bengalensis exerts its ethnomedicinal function. Since the whole meat is consumed, the lipid of Bellamya bengalensis (BBL) was hypothesized to be the active part.BBL isolated from the foot part of this species, was characterized and given by gavage daily (10mg BBL/kg; 20mg BBL/kg) to mice for 3 weeks prior to initiating development of DTH. Effects of DTH induced changes in paw diameter, serum nitric oxide (NO), serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level, CINC1 level, splenic CD4(+)/CD8(+) cell ratios, and level of splenic Treg cells were then compared with values in untreated control mice. In vitro effect of BBL on LPS-stimulated macrophage, the immune cell that is active in DTH, was assessed by NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), TNFα, and NO production.BBL was characterized, and its supplementation in situ led to significant decrease in paw edema, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, NO level, serum TNFα level and CINC 1 level as well as decrease in splenic CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios and increase in level of Treg cells.

For this purpose, in the present study, we examined the the possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of MgIG and the protective effects of MgIG in a model of NAFLD. The human hepatic L02 cell line and  were employed to establish an in vitro model of NAFLD. The CCK-8 assay, Hoechst 33258 staining and Annexin V-PI staining were performed in order to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis. Oil red O staining was used to detect lipid accumulation within the L02 cells. We found that MgIG significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and protected the L02 cells against lipid accumulation-induced apoptosis. Key molecules involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling were upregulated in lipid-overloaded hepatic cells whereas MgIG suppressed the activation of the UPR. Furthermore, MgIG significantly inhibited the expression of the downstream inflammatory cytokines which had been induced by lipid accumulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of UPR signaling induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines through the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in lipid-overloaded hepatic cells. In addition, MgIG may suppress the activation of UPR signaling thereby protecting hepatic cells from NAFLD‑induced injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27749147>Deletion of the SACPD-C Locus Alters the Symbiotic Relationship Between Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 and Soybean, Resulting in Elicitation of Plant Defense Response and Nodulation Defects.</a></h2><p>Legumes form symbiotic associations with soil-dwelling bacteria collectively called rhizobia. This association results in the formation of nodules, unique plant-derived organs, within which the rhizobia are housed. Rhizobia-encoded nitrogenase facilitates the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which is utilized by the plants for its growth and development. Fatty acids have been shown to play an important role in root nodule symbiosis. In this study, we have investigated the role of stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase isoform C (SACPD-C), a soybean enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of stearic  into , which is expressed in developing seeds and in nitrogen-fixing nodules. In-depth cytological investigation of nodule development in sacpd-c mutant lines M25 and MM106 revealed gross anatomical alteration in the sacpd-c mutants. Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed ultrastructural alterations in the sacpd-c mutants that are typically associated with plant defense response to pathogens. In nodules of two sacpd-c mutants, the combined jasmonic  (JA) species (JA and the isoleucine conjugate of JA) were found to be reduced and 12-oxophytodienoic  (OPDA) levels were significantly higher relative to wild-type lines. Salicylic  levels were not significantly different between genotypes, which is divergent from previous studies of sacpd mutant studies on vegetative tissues. Soybean nodule phytohormone profiles were very divergent from those of roots, and root profiles were found to be almost identical between mutant and wild-type genotypes. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were also found to be higher in nodules of sacpd-c mutants. PR-1 gene expression was extremely elevated in M25 and MM106, while the expression of nitrogenase was significantly reduced in these sacpd-c mutants, compared with the parent 'Bay'. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analyses confirmed sacpd-c mutants also accumulated higher amounts of pathogenesis-related proteins in the nodules. Our study establishes a major role for SACPD-C activity as essential for proper maintenance of soybean nodule morphology and physiology and indicates that OPDA signaling is likely to be involved in attenuation of nodule biotic defense responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156077>Increased palmitate intake: higher acylcarnitine concentrations without impaired progression of β-oxidation.</a></h2><p>Palmitic  (PA) is associated with higher blood concentrations of medium-chain acylcarnitines (MCACs), and we hypothesized that PA may inhibit progression of FA β-oxidation. Using a cross-over design, 17 adults were fed high PA (HPA) and low PA/high  (HOA) diets, each for 3 weeks. The [1-(13)C]PA and [13-(13)C]PA tracers were administered with food in random order with each diet, and we assessed PA oxidation (PA OX) and serum AC concentration to determine whether a higher PA intake promoted incomplete PA OX. Dietary PA was completely oxidized during the HOA diet, but only about 40% was oxidized during the HPA diet. The [13-(13)C]PA/[1-(13)C]PA ratio of PA OX had an approximate value of 1.0 for either diet, but the ratio of the serum concentrations of MCACs to long-chain ACs (LCACs) was significantly higher during the HPA diet. Thus, direct measurement of PA OX did not confirm that the HPA diet caused incomplete PA OX, despite the modest, but statistically significant, increase in the ratio of MCACs to LCACs in blood.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890432>Lipid droplets participate in modulating innate immune genes in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney cells.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly being recognized as important immune modulators in mammals, in additional to their function of lipid ester deposition. However, the role of LDs in fish  remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous lipid mix (LM;  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]:linolenic  [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA, arachidonic  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We observed that Corynebacterium spp. are overrepresented in children free of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a common pediatric nasal colonizer and an important infectious agent. Corynebacterium accolens, a benign lipid-requiring species, inhibits pneumococcal growth during in vitro cocultivation on medium supplemented with human skin surface triacylglycerols (TAGs) that are likely present in the nostrils. This inhibition depends on LipS1, a TAG lipase necessary for C. accolens growth on TAGs such as triolein. We determined that C. accolens hydrolysis of triolein releases , which inhibits pneumococcus, as do other free fatty acids (FFAs) that might be released by LipS1 from human skin surface TAGs. Our results support a model in which C. accolens hydrolyzes skin surface TAGS in vivo releasing antipneumococcal FFAs. These data indicate that C. accolens may play a beneficial role in sculpting the human microbiome.Little is known about how harmless Corynebacterium species that colonize the human nose and skin might impact pathogen colonization and proliferation at these sites. We show that Corynebacterium accolens, a common benign nasal bacterium, modifies its local habitat in vitro as it inhibits growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae by releasing antibacterial free fatty acids from host skin surface triacylglycerols. We further identify the primary C. accolens lipase required for this activity. We postulate a model in which higher numbers of C. accolens cells deter/limit S. pneumoniae nostril colonization, which might partly explain why children without S. pneumoniae colonization have higher levels of nasal Corynebacterium. This work narrows the gap between descriptive studies and the needed in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microbe-microbe interactions that help shape the human microbiome. It also lays the foundation for future in vivo studies to determine whether habitat modification by C. accolens could be promoted to control pathogen colonization.Copyright © 2016 Bomar et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28984989>Treating murine Kala-azar with a Mayan plant induces immunochemical changes.</a></h2><p>Pentalinon andrieuxii Muell Arg is a Mexican-Central American plant anciently used by local people to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice.
