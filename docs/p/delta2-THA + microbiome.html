The results showed that the  decrease rates of BBP, BBP-8, BBP-16, and BBP-24 were 77.48, 69.61, 56.87, and 52.89%, respectively. The antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of BBPs were decreased under gastrointestinal condition, which might be due to the variation of  during digestion. The bile acid-binding ability of BBPs showed an -dependent manner for higher  polysaccharides with higher viscosity. Through fermentation, the BBPs affected the ecosystem of the intestinal tract by promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids, lowering the pH of colon, and decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. All BBPs showed almost a similar modulation effect on the gut bacteria, but the lower  polysaccharide was more easily utilized by bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667426>Oregano: A potential prophylactic treatment for the intestinal .</a></h2><p>Prophylactic use of antibiotics in poultry diets has been identified as a problematic practice because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens. A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664852>Mice without a  are partially protected from lung injury by hyperoxia.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk  is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h2><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut .

A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); (b) High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655872>Phyllosphere of Submerged Plants in Bathing Lakes as a Reservoir of Fungi-Potential Human Pathogens.</a></h2><p>This study analysed whether the littoral zone in the immediate vicinity of bathing sites retains potentially pathogenic yeasts on the phyllosphere surface and to what extent the species composition of microfungi in the phyllosphere and in surface waters is similar. The research was carried out in selected lakes located within the administrative boundaries of the city of Olsztyn, the largest city in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The experiment was conducted in three summer seasons near bathing sites in three lakes, which are the most popular as recreational sites (Lake Kortowskie, Lake Tyrsko, and Lake Skanda). Microfungi isolated from the phyllosphere of 13 plant species of the littoral zone from dropped leaves of coast plants with no disease symptoms were used as the study material. The isolated fungi were identified in accordance with the accepted diagnostic procedures applied in mycological laboratories. A total of 36 yeast species of 16 genera were identified.

Finally, we investigate how treatment history affects the prevalence of resistance among opportunistic enterobacterial pathogens. We simulate treatment histories and identify which properties of prior antibiotic exposure are most influential in determining the prevalence of resistance.

Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin  during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the , reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core  that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).© The Author(s) 2019.

Studies indicated that several factors related to host response have a crucial role in pulpitis. Among these factors, inflammatory mediators of the immune system such as cytokines and chemokines contribute to pulpal defense mechanisms. A wide range of cytokines have been observed in dental pulp and these small molecules are able to trigger inflammation and participate in immune cell trafficking, cell proliferation, inflammation, and tissue damage in pulp space. Therefore, the aim of this review was to describe the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of pulpitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut ) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut , stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact -immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670167>Reduction in pathogenic load of wheat by tempering with saline organic acid solutions at different seasonal temperatures.</a></h2><p>As a raw agricultural commodity, wheat is exposed to microbial contamination; therefore, enteric pathogens may be among its  creating a food safety risk in milled products. This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on (2) survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (2.0, 10.8, 24.2, 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic 2.5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (2.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and 2.6, 2.4 and 2.4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Antibiotics perturb the bacterial gut composition but the extent of these changes and potential consequences for animal and human health is still debated. Six calves were housed in a controlled environment. Three animals received an injection of the antibiotic florfenicol (Nuflor), and three received no treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 3 and 7 days, and bacterial communities were profiled to assess the impact of a therapy on the gut . Phylogenetic analysis (16S-rDNA) established that at day 7, antibiotic-treated  showed a 10-fold increase in facultative anaerobic Escherichia spp, a signature of imbalanced , dysbiosis.

PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal barrier in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal barrier function is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of  composition and function, intestinal barrier integrity, as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

In the present work we evaluated the safety of mastic oil using as a model the zebrafish lateral line system. In addition, we studied the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with mastic oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the hair cells of lateral line neuromasts are functional upon exposure of zebrafish larvae up to 20 ppm of mastic essential oil, while treatment with higher concentrations, 100 and 200 ppm, resulted in increased larvae mortality. Dietary supplementation of zebrafish with mastic essential oil led to differential expression of interferon response-related genes as well as the immune responsive gene 1 () that links cellular metabolism with immune defense.

Understanding the rules that govern microbial community assembly will have a major impact on our ability to manage microbial ecosystems, positively impacting, for instance, human health and agriculture. Here, I present a phylogenetically constrained community assembly principle grounded on the well-supported facts that deterministic processes have a significant impact on microbial community assembly, that microbial communities show significant phylogenetic signal, and that microbial traits and ecological coherence are, to some extent, phylogenetically conserved. From these facts, I derive a few predictions which form the basis of the framework. Chief among them is the existence, within most microbial ecosystems, of phylogenetic core groups (PCGs), defined as discrete portions of the phylogeny of varying depth present in all instances of the given ecosystem, and related to specific niches whose occupancy requires a specific phylogenetically conserved set of traits. The predictions are supported by the recent literature, as well as by dedicated analyses. Integrating the effect of ecosystem patchiness, microbial social interactions, and scale sampling pitfalls takes us to a comprehensive community assembly model that recapitulates the characteristics most commonly observed in microbial communities. PCGs' identification is relatively straightforward using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing, and subsequent bioinformatic analysis of their phylogeny, estimated core pan-genome, and intra-group co-occurrence should provide valuable information on their ecophysiology and niche characteristics. Such a priori information for a significant portion of the community could be used to prime complementing analyses, boosting their usefulness. Thus, the use of the proposed framework could represent a leap forward in our understanding of microbial community assembly and function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662429>Changes in the Composition of the Gut  and the Blood Transcriptome in Preterm Infants at Less than 29 Weeks Gestation Diagnosed with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.</a></h2><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung condition in preterm infants that results in abnormal lung development and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality, making BPD one of the most common complications of preterm birth. We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal  in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the  were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the  might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut  can influence immunity and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut  in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut  of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants.

Extrinsic factors such as diet and host immunity are insufficient to explain the constituents of this community, and direct interactions between co-resident microorganisms have been implicated as important drivers of  composition. The genomes of bacteria derived from the gut  contain several pathways that mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism. Many members of the Gram-negative order Bacteroidales encode the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which facilitates the delivery of toxic effector proteins into adjacent cells. Here we report the occurrence of acquired interbacterial defence (AID) gene clusters in Bacteroidales species that reside within the human gut . These clusters encode arrays of immunity genes that protect against T6SS-mediated intra- and inter-species bacterial antagonism. Moreover, the clusters reside on mobile elements, and we show that their transfer is sufficient to confer resistance to toxins in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, we identify and validate the protective capability of a recombinase-associated AID subtype (rAID-1) that is present broadly in Bacteroidales genomes. These rAID-1 gene clusters have a structure suggestive of active gene acquisition and include predicted immunity factors of toxins derived from diverse organisms.

The isolates are members of the Lactobacillus alimentarius group with Lactobacillus ginsenosidimutans DSM 24154 (99.4% 16S similarity), Lactobacillus versmoldensis DSM 14857 (97.9%) and Lactobacillus furfuricola DSM 27174 (97.7%) as phylogenetic closest related species and L. alimentarius DSM 20249 (97.7%) and Lactobacillus paralimentarius DSM 13961 (97.5%) as closest relatives, respectively. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between the isolates and their close related type strains are lower than 80% and 25%, respectively. For both designated type strains, the peptidoglycan type is A4α l-Lys-d-Asp and the major fatty acids are C, C and summed feature 7. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analysis we demonstrated that the investigated isolates belong to two novel Lactobacillus species for which we propose the names Lactobacillus salsicarnum with the type strain TMW 1.2098=DSM 109451=LMG 31401and Lactobacillus halodurans with the type strain TMW 1.2172=DSM 109452=LMG 31402.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Different sites of colorectal cancer (CRC) are different in many aspects, including clinical symptoms, biological behaviour, and prognosis.This study aimed to analyse prognosis, genes, bacteria, fungi, and microbial metabolome in different sites of CRC.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and STAT were used to statistically describe and analyse the prognosis in different sites of CRC. RNA sequences of CRC from Broad Institute's GDAC Firehose were re-annotated and reanalysed based on different sites using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse the prognosis and Cytoscape was used to construct a drug-target network based on DGIdb databases. Bacterial 16S V3-V4 and fungal ITS V3-V4 ribosomal RNA genes of stool samples were sequenced. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) was performed to detect the microbial metabolites in stool samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare distinct gut microorganisms and microbial metabolites between rectal and sigmoid cancers.The prognosis in CRC with different sites is significantly different. The closer to the anus predicted longer survival time. The difference between genes and co-expression pairs in CRC with different sites were constructed. The relative abundance of 112 mRNAs and 26 lncRNAs correlated with the sites of CRC were listed. Nine differentially expressed genes at different sites of CRC were correlated with prognosis. A drug-gene interaction network contained 227 drug-gene pairs were built. The relative abundance of gut bacteria and gut fungus, and the content of microbe-related metabolites were statistically different between rectal and sigmoid cancers.There are many differences in prognosis, genome, drug targets, gut , and microbial metabolome in different colorectal cancer sites. These findings may improve our understanding of the role of the CRC sites in personalized and precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663118>Outer membrane vesicles enhance tau phosphorylation and contribute to cognitive impairment.</a></h2><p>Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nanosized vesicles produced by the gut  (GM). The GM is well-known to be involved in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of OMVs is not clear. In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of OMVs in the development of cognitive (learning and memory) dysfunction induced by blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. More important, further study showed that OMVs induced tau phosphorylation by activating glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) in the hippocampus. OMVs activated astrocytes and microglia, increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (nuclear factor κB, interleukin-1β, and tumour necrosis factor-α) in the hippocampus. Therefore, OMVs increase the permeability of the BBB and promote the activation of astrocytes and microglia, inducing an inflammatory response and tau hyperphosphorylation by activating the GSK-3β pathway and finally leading to cognitive impairment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669435>Untargeted Metabolomic Profiling Identifies Disease-specific Signatures in Food Allergy and Asthma.</a></h2><p>Food allergy (FA) affects an increasing proportion of children. for reasons that remain obscure. Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the -sensitive aromatic amino acid and secondary bile acid metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty acids.Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic acids along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of A.muciniphila on Porphyromonas gingivalis elicited inflammation.In lean and obese mice, A.muciniphila was administered in P.gingivalis induced calvarial abcess and in experimental periodontitis model (EIP). Bone destruction and inflammation were evaluated by histomorphometric analysis. In vitro, A.muciniphila was co-cultured with P.gingivalis, growth and virulence factors expression were evaluated. Bone-marrow macrophages (BMMϕ) and gingival epithelial cells (TIGK) were exposed to both bacterial strains and the expression of inflammatory mediators, as well as tight junction markers was analyzed.In a model of calvarial infection, A.muciniphila decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction. In EIP, treatment with A.muciniphila resulted in a decreased alveolar bone loss. In vitro, the addition of A.muciniphila to P.gingivalis infected BMMϕ increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and decreased IL-12. Additionally, A.muciniphila exposure increases the expression of junctional integrity markers such as integrin-β1, E-cadherin and ZO-1 in TIGK cells. A.muciniphila co-culture with P.gingivalis reduced gingipains mRNA expression.This study demonstrated the protective effects of A.muciniphila administration and may open consideration to its use as an adjunctive therapeutic agent to periodontal treatment.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

To illustrate the importance of standardizing methodology, we compared analyses of postmortem  samples using several bioinformatic pipelines, varying minimum library size or minimum number of sequences per sample, and sample size. Using the same input sequence data, we found that three open-source bioinformatic pipelines, MG-RAST, mothur, and QIIME2, had significant differences in relative abundance, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity, despite the same input data. Increasing minimum library size and sample size increased the number of low-abundant and infrequent taxa detected.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut  composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut  variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut  by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut , which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656993>The gut  to the brain axis in the metabolic control.</a></h2><p>The regulation of glycemia is under a tight neuronal detection of glucose levels performed by the gut-brain axis and an efficient efferent neuronal message sent to the peripheral organs, as the pancreas to induce insulin and inhibit glucagon secretions.

Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the . The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other.

Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and  composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655861> Associated with Dromedary Camel Milk from Algerian Sahara.</a></h2><p>Despite the fact that camel milk represents a valuable food source, the fungal diversity of raw camel milk has been poorly studied so far.

RbgA is one of these GTPases and is required for the assembly of the 50S subunit in most bacteria. Homologs of this protein are also implicated in the assembly of the large subunit of the mitochondrial and eukaryotic ribosome. We present here the cryo-electron microscopy structure of RbgA bound to a Bacillus subtilis 50S subunit assembly intermediate (45SRbgA particle) that accumulates in cells upon RbgA depletion. Binding of RbgA at the P site of the immature particle stabilizes functionally important rRNA helices in the A and P-sites, prior to the completion of the maturation process of the subunit. The structure also reveals the location of the highly conserved N-terminal end of RbgA containing the catalytic residue Histidine 9. The derived model supports a mechanism of GTP hydrolysis, and it shows that upon interaction of RbgA with the 45SRbgA particle, Histidine 9 positions itself near the nucleotide potentially acting as the catalytic residue with minimal rearrangements.

Stool metatranscriptomic analysis offers a comprehensive functional view of the gut , but despite its usefulness, it has rarely been used in clinical studies due to its complexity, cost, and bioinformatic challenges. This method has also received criticism due to potential intrasample variability, rapid changes, and RNA degradation. Here, we describe a robust and automated stool metatranscriptomic method, called Viomega, which was specifically developed for population-scale studies. Viomega includes sample collection, ambient temperature sample preservation, total RNA extraction, physical removal of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), preparation of directional Illumina libraries, Illumina sequencing, taxonomic classification based on a database of >110,000 microbial genomes, and quantitative microbial gene expression analysis using a database of ~100 million microbial genes. We applied this method to 10,000 human stool samples and performed several small-scale studies to demonstrate sample stability and consistency. In summary, Viomega is an inexpensive, high-throughput, automated, and accurate sample-to-result stool metatranscriptomic technology platform for large-scale studies and a wide range of applications.Copyright © 2019 Andrew Hatch et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659687>Propionate, together with triple antibiotics, inhibits the growth of Enterococci.</a></h2><p>Enterococci are Gram-positive facultative anaerobic bacteria that colonize the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666311>Incidence of necrotising enterocolitis before and after introducing routine prophylactic  and  probiotics.</a></h2><p>To compare rates of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis, and mortality in 5-year epochs before and after implementation of routine daily multistrain probiotics administration in high-risk neonates.Single-centre retrospective observational study over the 10-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017.Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, UK.Preterm neonates at high risk of NEC: admitted to NICU within 3 days of birth at <32 weeks' gestation or at 32-36 weeks' gestation and of birth weight <1500 g.Prior to 1 January 2013 probiotics were not used. Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.5% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.5%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.2%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues. Our data are consistent with routine use of  and  combination probiotics having a beneficial effect on NEC prevention in very preterm neonates.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Diarrhea is one of the most frequently observed adverse reactions associated with regorafenib. This toxicity may arise from the reactivation of the inactive regorafenib-glucuronide to regorafenib in the gastrointestinal tract by gut microbial β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes. We sought to unravel the molecular basis of regorafenib-glucuronide processing by human intestinal GUS enzymes, and to examine the potential inhibition of these enzymes. Using a panel of 31 unique gut microbial GUS enzymes derived from the 279 mapped from the human gut , we found that only four were capable of regorafenib-glucuronide processing. Using crystal structures as a guide, we pinpointed the molecular features unique to these enzymes that confer regorafenib-glucuronide processing activity. Furthermore, a pilot screen identified the FDA-approved drug raloxifene as an inhibitor of regorafenib-reactivation by the GUS proteins discovered. Novel synthetic raloxifene analogs exhibited improved potency in both in vitro and ex vivo studies. Taken together, these data establish that regorafenib reactivation is exclusively catalyzed by gut microbial enzymes, and that these enzymes are amenable to targeted inhibition. Our results unravel key molecular details of regorafenib reactivation in the GI tract and provide a potential pathway to improve clinical outcomes with regorafenib.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672173>Suppressed N fixation and diazotrophs after four decades of fertilization.</a></h2><p>N fixation is one of the most important microbially driven ecosystem processes on Earth, allowing N to enter the soil from the atmosphere, and regulating plant productivity. A question that remains to be answered is whether such a fundamental process would still be that important in an over-fertilized world, as the long-term effects of fertilization on N fixation and associated diazotrophic communities remain to be tested. Here, we used a 35-year fertilization experiment, and investigated the changes in N fixation rates and the diazotrophic community in response to long-term inorganic and organic fertilization.It was found that N fixation was drastically reduced (dropped by 50%) after almost four decades of fertilization. Our results further indicated that functionality losses were associated with reductions in the relative abundance of keystone and phylogenetically clustered N fixers such as Geobacter spp.Our work suggests that long-term fertilization might have selected against N fixation and specific groups of N fixers. Our study provides solid evidence that N fixation and certain groups of diazotrophic taxa will be largely suppressed in a more and more fertilized world, with implications for soil biodiversity and ecosystem functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665625>Neutrophil Recruitment to Noninvasive MRSA at the Stratum Corneum of Human Skin Mediates Transient Colonization.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of skin and soft issue infection, but paradoxically, it also transiently, and often harmlessly, colonizes human skin. An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Exposure to 4000 µg BPA/kg bw/day (BPA HIGH) reduced sperm motility and altered the straight-line velocity (VSL) and linearity (LIN). Effects on steroidogenesis were evident, with testosterone (T) being up-regulated by both treatments and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) down-regulated by BPA HIGH. Plasma levels of 17β-estradiol (E) were not affected. The Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) increased in the BPA HIGH group. Interestingly, the levels of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like compounds were significantly reduced after both treatments. Unpredictably, a few changes were noticed in the expression of genes coding for ECS enzymes, while the receptors were up-regulated depending on the BPA dose. Reproductive markers in testis (leptin receptor (), estrogen receptors (, ), progesterone receptors () and the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor ()) were up-regulated.

In particular, the transparent gut, rapid growing time and ability to create a defined gut  make it an ideal candidate organism for understanding and engineering the host . Here we present the development of an experimental model which can be used to characterise whole-cell bacterial biosensors in vivo. A dual-plasmid sensor system responding to isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was developed and fully characterised in vitro. Subsequently, we show the sensor was capable of detecting and reporting on changes in the intestinal environment of C. elegans after introducing exogenous inducer into the environment. The protocols presented here may be used for aiding the rational design of engineered bacterial circuits, primarily for diagnostic applications.

City subway systems are human-dense environments, where passengers often exchange microbes. The MetaSUB project participants collected samples from subway surfaces in different cities and performed metagenomic sequencing. Previous studies focused on taxonomic composition of these microbiomes and no explicit functional analysis had been done till now.As a part of the 2018 CAMDA challenge, we functionally profiled the available ~ 400 subway metagenomes and built predictor for city origin. In cross-validation, our model reached 81% accuracy when only the top-ranked city assignment was considered and 95% accuracy if the second city was taken into account as well. Notably, this performance was only achievable if the similarity of distribution of cities in the training and testing sets was similar. To assure that our methods are applicable without such biased assumptions we balanced our training data to account for all represented cities equally well. After balancing, the performance of our method was slightly lower (76/94%, respectively, for one or two top ranked cities), but still consistently high. Here we attained an added benefit of independence of training set city representation. In testing, our unbalanced model thus reached (an over-estimated) performance of 90/97%, while our balanced model was at a more reliable 63/90% accuracy. While, by definition of our model, we were not able to predict the  origins previously unseen, our balanced model correctly judged them to be NOT-from-training-cities over 80% of the time. Our function-based outlook on microbiomes also allowed us to note similarities between both regionally close and far-away cities. Curiously, we identified the depletion in mycobacterial functions as a signature of cities in New Zealand, while photosynthesis related functions fingerprinted New York, Porto and Tokyo.We demonstrated the power of our high-speed function annotation method, mi-faser, by analysing ~ 400 shotgun metagenomes in 2 days, with the results recapitulating functional signals of different city subway microbiomes. We also showed the importance of balanced data in avoiding over-estimated performance. Our results revealed similarities between both geographically close (Ofa and Ilorin) and distant (Boston and Porto, Lisbon and New York) city subway microbiomes.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal  and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673418>Cartilage-gut- axis: a new paradigm for novel therapeutic opportunities in osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>DNA of gut  can be found in synovium of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut  in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of  observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut . There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut  response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669656>A method to assess bioavailability of antibiotics in anthropogenic polluted ecosystems by using a bacterial fitness test.</a></h2><p>Antibiotics released in the environment exert a selective pressure on the resident . It is well accepted that the mere measurement of antibiotics does not reflect the actual bioavailability. In fact, antibiotics can be adsorbed or complexed to particles and/or chemicals in water and soil. Bioavailable concentrations of antibiotics in soil and water are subjected to great uncertainty, therefore biological assays are increasingly recognized as that allow an indirect determination of the residual antibiotic activity. Here we propose how a fitness test for bacteria can be used to qualitatively assess the bioavailability of a specific antibiotic in the environment. The findings show that by using a pair of resistant and sensitive bacterial strains, the resulting fitness can indirectly reflect antibiotic bioavailability. Hence, this test can be used as a complementary assay to other biological and chemical tests to assess bioavailability of antibiotics.Copyright © 2018.

Microbial communities of each fecal sample were characterized using Illumina sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Dietary recalls were analyzed using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Recall Dietary Assessment Tool.Associations between dietary factors and  features were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman rank correlations, or permutational multivariate analysis of variance. For demographic and health-related variables, χ analyses were used to test for differences between age groups for categorical variables.Our results show that age is correlated with three metrics of  diversity (P<0.05) and is associated with both community structure (P=0.0488) and membership (P=0.0002). Several dietary food groups and nutrients were likewise associated with  features. For example, consumption of non-whole-grain foods was associated with community structure (P=0.0089) and membership (P=0.0057), but not diversity (P>0.05). Likewise, the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa were linked to consumption of particular food groups and/or nutrients, as illustrated by the positive associations between total fruit (P<0.05) and fiber (P<0.05) consumption with the relative abundance of the Lachnospira genera.This hypothesis-generating study demonstrates that the composition of the child gut  remains dynamic beyond the age of 3 years and responds to dietary differences across individuals. In particular, non-whole-grain foods fortified with vitamins and minerals appear to be associated with the composition of the .

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001).

However, it is unknown whether sialylated lactuloses have modulatory effects on the intestinal . In this study, 60 healthy mice were randomly divided into six groups, namely, a normal control group, a lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,3-lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,6-lactulose group, a Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group, and a Neu5Ac-α2,6-lactulose group. After 14 days of lactulose administration, the feces of three mice from each group were collected, and the intestinal  were detected by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the sialylated lactulose groups, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased. At the family level, sialylated lactulose intervention decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidales S24-7 group and Helicobacteraceae and enhanced the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, which reflects the modulatory effect of sialylated lactulose on intestinal . Diversity analysis indicated that the index of Chao was higher in the sialylated lactulose groups than in the normal control group, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were higher in the Kdnα-2,6-lactulose group and the Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group than in the normal control group. The results of the intestinal  sample composition indicated that there were differences between the sialylated lactulose groups and the normal control group.

Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures. Colon tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the colon .We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by colon cancer cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery. Strategies to prevent emergence of these microbe communities or their enzymatic activities might be used to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The primary processing of Houpo requires sweating treatment, which is a special drying process and is considered to be an essential embodiment of high quality and genuine medicinal materials. The sweating of Houpo leads to peculiar changes in the microbial community structure and the content of main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine). Variation in the microbial community was considered the cause of the change in content of active substances of Houpo, although the microbial taxa responsible for the improvement of content remain unidentified.In this study, we used MiSeq high-throughput sequencing methods for partial bacterial 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequences to compare the bacterial and fungal community structures at different timepoints in the process of sweating. The content of the main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis to evaluate the effects of sweating.

The diversity of human gut  has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut  changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with inflammation and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut  along with the host aging process.

To investigate the effects of aging on the gut  independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut  was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut . Consistent with previous studies on the human gut , beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut -age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666028>Diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of litter-feeding cockroaches.</a></h2><p>Diet is a major determinant of bacterial community structure in termite guts, but evidence of its importance in the closely related cockroaches is conflicting. Here, we investigated the ecological drivers of the bacterial gut  in cockroaches that feed on lignocellulosic leaf litter.The physicochemical conditions determined with microsensors in the guts of Ergaula capucina, Pycnoscelus surinamensis, and Byrsotria rothi were similar to those reported for both wood-feeding and omnivorous cockroaches. All gut compartments were anoxic at the center and showed a slightly acidic to neutral pH and variable but slightly reducing conditions. Hydrogen accumulated only in the crop of B. rothi. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes documented that community structure in individual gut compartments correlated strongly with the respective microenvironmental conditions. A comparison of the hindgut  of cockroaches and termites from different feeding groups revealed that the vast majority of the core taxa in cockroaches with a lignocellulosic diet were present also in omnivorous cockroaches but absent in wood-feeding higher termites.Our results indicate that diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of wood- and litter-feeding cockroaches. The high similarity to the gut  of omnivorous cockroaches suggests that the dietary components that are actually digested do not differ fundamentally between feeding groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671768>Quantification of Urinary Phenyl-γ-Valerolactones and Related Valeric Acids in Human Urine on Consumption of Apples.</a></h2><p>Flavan-3-ols are dietary bioactive molecules that have beneficial effects on human health and reduce the risk of various diseases. Monomeric flavan-3-ols are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and released in the blood stream as phase II conjugates. Polymeric flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized by colonic gut  into phenyl-γ-valerolactones and their related phenylvaleric acids. These molecules are the main circulating metabolites in humans after the ingestion of flavan-3-ol rich-products; nevertheless, they have received less attention and their role is not understood yet. Here, we describe the quantification of 8 phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 3 phenylvaleric acids in the urine of 11 subjects on consumption of apples by using UHPLC-ESI-Triple Quad-MS with pure reference compounds. Phenyl-γ-valerolactones, mainly as sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates, reached maximum excretion between 6 and 12 after apple consumption, with a decline thereafter. Significant differences were detected in the cumulative excretion rates within subjects and in the ratio of dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone sulfate to glucuronide conjugates. This work observed for the first time the presence of two distinct metabotypes with regards to the excretion of phenyl-γ-valerolactone phase II conjugates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671152>Diet--disease: Investigating diet's influence on infectious disease resistance through alteration of the gut .</a></h2><p>Abiotic and biotic factors can affect host resistance to parasites. Host diet and host gut microbiomes are two increasingly recognized factors influencing disease resistance. In particular, recent studies demonstrate that (1) particular diets can reduce parasitism; (2) diets can alter the gut ; and (3) the gut  can decrease parasitism. These three separate relationships suggest the existence of indirect links through which diets reduce parasitism through an alteration of the gut . However, such links are rarely considered and even more rarely experimentally validated. This is surprising because there is increasing discussion of the therapeutic potential of diets and gut microbiomes to control infectious disease. To elucidate these potential indirect links, we review and examine studies on a wide range of animal systems commonly used in diet, , and disease research. We also examine the relative benefits and disadvantages of particular systems for the study of these indirect links and conclude that mice and insects are currently the best animal systems to test for the effect of diet-altered protective gut microbiomes on infectious disease. Focusing on these systems, we provide experimental guidelines and highlight challenges that must be overcome. Although previous studies have recommended these systems for  research, here we specifically recommend these systems because of their proven relationships between diet and parasitism, between diet and the , and between the  and parasite resistance. Thus, they provide a sound foundation to explore the three-way interaction between diet, the , and infectious disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655999>Composition and Structure of Gut  in Adolescents with Obesity and Different Breastfeeding Duration.</a></h2><p>Gut  of adolescents with obesity and different duration of breastfeeding was analyzed by metagenomic analysis of V3-V4 variable domains of the 16S rRNA gene.

Here we tested the hypothesis that maternal exercise before and during pregnancy would positively affect glucose homeostasis, pancreatic cell function, and gut  dysbiosis in high-fat diet (HFD) fed dams. Female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a HFD or a low-fat diet (LFD) for 12 weeks. The HFD mice were split into two groups for 4 weeks prior to pregnancy initiation and throughout the pregnancy: sedentary (HFD) or exercised (HFD + Ex). Food intake, body weight, body composition, and glucose and insulin tolerance were measured. At gestation day 19, blood, pancreas, gonadal visceral and subcutaneous fat, plantaris muscle, and cecum were collected for analysis. Both HFD and HFD + Ex mice had impaired glucose clearance compared to LFD mice at 15 days of gestation. No changes were found in pancreatic α- or β-cell health. HFD + Ex mice had significantly reduced visceral fat mass, serum insulin, and leptin levels and increased high-density lipoprotein levels, compared to HFD-fed mice. In contrast to our hypothesis,  diversity and composition were not different among groups. The relative abundance of five bacterial phyla, such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, and Actinobacteria, were not significantly altered with diet or exercise during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that maternal exercise prevents excess visceral fat accumulation, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia associated with a HFD, but not through the alterations of gut  composition or diversity during pregnancy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the use of such in silico pipelines for the microbial taxonomic classification of short sequences may lead to significant errors in the compositional outputs deduced from such sequencing data. To investigate the ability of such in silico pipelines, we employed two commonly applied bioinformatic tools, i.e., MetaPhlAn2 and Kraken2 together with two metagenomic datasets originating from human and animal fecal samples. By using these bioinformatic programs that taxonomically classify WSM data based on marker genes, we observed a tend to depict a lower complexity of the microbial communities. Here, we assess the limitations of the most commonly employed bioinformatic pipelines, i.e., MetaPhlAn2 and Kraken2, and based on our findings, we propose that such analyses should ideally be combined with experimentally-based microbiological validations.

There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases. Ames dwarf (df/df) mice are characterized by an extended life- and healthspan, and although these mice are protected from many age-related diseases, their  has not been studied. To determine the role of  on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the  by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in  according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut  plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the  in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health.

Rhodnius pallescens is a major vector of Chagas disease in Panama. Understanding the microbial ecology of disease vectors is important in the development of vector management strategies that target vector survival and fitness. In this study we examined the whole-body microbial composition of R. pallescens from three locations in Panama.We collected 89 R. pallescens specimens using Noireau traps in Attalea butyracea palms. We then extracted total DNA from whole-bodies of specimens and amplified bacterial  using 16S rRNA metabarcoding PCR.

Geographical location showed the largest difference in microbial composition with northern Veraguas Province having the most diversity and Panama Oeste Province localities being most similar to each other. Wolbachia was detected in high abundance (48-72%) at Panama Oeste area localities with a complete absence of detection in Veraguas Province.

We identify Gp15 as the PSA RBP and construct a synthetic phage library featuring sequence-randomized RBPs, from which host range mutants are isolated and subsequently integrated into a synthetic, polyvalent phage with extended host range. To enable rational design of chimeric RBPs, we determine the crystal structure of the Gp15 receptor-binding carboxyl terminus at 1.7-Å resolution and employ bioinformatics to identify compatible, prophage-encoded RBPs targeting different Listeria serovars. Structure-guided design enables exchange of heterologous RBP head, neck, or shoulder domains to generate chimeric phages with predictable and extended host ranges.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is found to be closely involved in the regulation of gut microbial dynamics. However, it is still not clear how AhR signaling shapes the gut . In the present study, adult zebrafish were acutely exposed to an AhR antagonist (CH223191), an AhR agonist (polychlorinated biphenyl 126; PCB126) or their combination for 7 d. Overall intestinal health and gut microbial community were temporally monitored (1 d, 3 d and 7 d) and inter-compared among different groups. The results showed that single exposure to PCB126 significantly disrupted the overall health of intestines (i.e., neural signaling, inflammation, epithelial barrier integrity, oxidative stress). However, CH223191 failed to inhibit but enhanced the physiological toxicities of PCB126, implying the involvement of extra mechanisms rather than AhR in the regulation of intestinal physiological activities. Dysbiosis of gut  was also caused by PCB126 over time as a function of sex. It is intriguing that CH223191 successfully abolished the holistic effects of dioxin on gut , which inferred that growth of gut microbes was directly controlled by AhR activation without the involvement of host feedback modulation. When coming to detailed alterations at certain taxon, both antagonistic and synergistic interactions existed between CH223191 and dioxin, depending on fish sex, exposure duration and bacterial species. Correlation analysis found that gut inflammation was positively associated with pathogenic Legionella bacteria, but was negatively associated with epithelial barrier integrity, suggesting that integral intestinal epithelial barrier can prevent the influx of pathogenic bacteria to induce inflammatory response. Overall, this study has deciphered, for the first time, the direct regulative effects of AhR activity on gut . Future research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms of AhR action on certain bacterial population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut  in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal  either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal immunity, fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host immunity and the gut .

Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in psychiatric illness has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic exploration. However, studies concerning the role of the GBA in OCD are limited. To investigate whether a naturally occurring obsessive-compulsive-like phenotype in a rodent model, i.e. large nest-building in deer mice, is associated with perturbations in the gut , we investigated and characterized the gut  in specific pathogen free bred and housed large (LNB) and normal (NNB) nest building deer mice of both sexes (n = 11 per group, including 3 males and 8 females). Following baseline characterisation of nest building behaviour, a single faecal sample was collected from each animal and the gut  analysed. Our results reveal the overall microbial composition of LNB animals to be distinctly different compared to controls (PERMANOVA p < 0.05). While no genera were found to be significantly differentially abundant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the normal phenotype showed a higher loading of Prevotella and Anaeroplasma, while the OC-phenotype demonstrated a higher loading of Desulfovermiculus, Aestuariispira, Peptococcus and Holdemanella (cut-off threshold for loading at 0.2 in either the first or second component of the PCA).

Thirty-two conventional M. hyopneumoniae free piglets were randomly selected from six different litters at 3 weeks of age and were experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae at 8 weeks of age. Lung lesion scores (LS) were recorded 4 weeks post-inoculation (12 weeks of age) from piglet lungs at necropsy. Fecal bacterial community composition of piglets at 3, 8 and 12 weeks of age were targeted by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The LS ranged from 0.3 to 43% with an evident clustering of the scores observed in piglets within litters. There were significant differences in species richness and alpha diversity in fecal microbiomes among piglets within litters at different time points (p < 0.05). The dissimilarity matrices indicated that at 3 weeks of age, the fecal  of piglets was more dissimilar compared to those from 8 to 12 weeks of age. Specific groups of bacteria in the gut that might predict the decreased severity of M. hyopneumoniae associated lesions were identified. The microbial shift at 3 weeks of age was observed to be driven by the increase in abundance of the indicator family, Ruminococcaceae in piglets with low LS (p < 0.05). The taxa, Ruminococcus_2 having the highest richness scores, correlated significantly between litters showing stronger associations with the lowest LS (r = -0.49, p = 0.005). These findings suggest that early life gut  can be a potential determinant for M. hyopneumoniae susceptibility in pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671546>Does the  Play a Pivotal Role in the Pathogenesis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome?</a></h2><p>The microbial community that lives in the human body, called the , consists of a large variety of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, eukaryotes and archae [...].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658673>Comparison of Different Invasive and Non-Invasive Methods to Characterize Intestinal  throughout a Production Cycle of Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>In the short life of broiler chickens, their intestinal  undergoes many changes. To study underlying biological mechanisms and factors that influence the intestinal  development, longitudinal data from flocks and individual birds is needed. However, post-mortem collection of samples hampers longitudinal data collection. In this study, invasively collected cecal and ileal content, cloacal swabs collected from the same bird, and boot sock samples and cecal droppings from the litter of the broilers' poultry house, were collected on days 0, 2, 7, 14 and 35 post-hatch.

The  of 247 samples was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analyses of α and β measures showed a similar development of  composition of cecal droppings compared to cecal content. Furthermore, the composition of cecal content samples was comparable to that of the boot socks until day 14 post-hatch. This study shows that the value of non-invasive sample types varies at different ages and depends on the goal of the  characterization. Specifically, cecal droppings and boot socks may be useful alternatives for cecal samples to determine intestinal  composition longitudinally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659035>Global imprint of mycorrhizal fungi on whole-plant nutrient economics.</a></h2><p>Mycorrhizal fungi are critical members of the plant , forming a symbiosis with the roots of most plants on Earth. Most plant species partner with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi, and these symbioses are thought to represent plant adaptations to fast and slow soil nutrient cycling rates. This generates a second hypothesis, that arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal plant species traits complement and reinforce these fungal strategies, resulting in nutrient acquisitive vs. conservative plant trait profiles. Here we analyzed 17,764 species level trait observations from 2,940 woody plant species to show that mycorrhizal plants differ systematically in nitrogen and phosphorus economic traits. Differences were clearest in temperate latitudes, where ectomycorrhizal plant species are more nitrogen use- and phosphorus use-conservative than arbuscular mycorrhizal species. This difference is reflected in both aboveground and belowground plant traits and is robust to controlling for evolutionary history, nitrogen fixation ability, deciduousness, latitude, and species climate niche. Furthermore, mycorrhizal effects are large and frequently similar to or greater in magnitude than the influence of plant nitrogen fixation ability or deciduous vs. evergreen leaf habit. Ectomycorrhizal plants are also more nitrogen conservative than arbuscular plants in boreal and tropical ecosystems, although differences in phosphorus use are less apparent outside temperate latitudes. Our findings bolster current theories of ecosystems rooted in mycorrhizal ecology and support the hypothesis that plant mycorrhizal association is linked to the evolution of plant nutrient economic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673757>Resolution of acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease.</a></h2><p>Allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (allo-HCT) represents an increasingly employed therapeutic approach to potentially cure patients suffering from life-threatening malignant and autoimmune disorders. Despite its lifesaving potential, immune-mediated allo-reactivity inherent to the allogeneic transplantation can be observed within up to 50% of all allo-HCT patients regularly resulting in the manifestation of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Mechanistically, especially donor T cells are assumed to chiefly drive inflammation that can occur in virtually all organs, with the skin, liver, and gut representing as the most frequently affected anatomic sites. Especially in the presence of intestinal manifestations of GvHD, the risk that the disease takes a life-threatening, potentially fatal course is significantly increased.

This study aimed to investigate whether the cattle breed affects specific ruminal taxonomic microbial groups and functions associated with feed conversion ratio (FCR), using two genetically related Angus breeds as a model. Total RNA was extracted from 24 rumen content samples collected from purebred Black and Red Angus bulls fed the same forage diet and then subjected to metatranscriptomic analysis. Multivariate discriminant analysis (sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA)) and analysis of composition of microbiomes were conducted to identify microbial signatures characterizing Black and Red Angus cattle. Our analyses revealed relationships among bacterial signatures, host breeds and FCR. Although Black and Red Angus are genetically similar, sPLS-DA detected 25 bacterial species and 10 functions that differentiated the rumen microbial signatures between those two breeds. In Black Angus, we identified bacterial taxa Chitinophaga pinensis, Clostridium stercorarium and microbial functions with large and small subunits ribosomal proteins L16 and S7 exhibiting a higher abundance in the rumen . In Red Angus, nonetheless, we identified the poorly characterized bacterial taxon Oscillibacter valericigenes with a higher abundance and pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. Analysis of composition of microbiomes revealed that C. pinensis and C. stercorarium exhibited a higher abundance in Black Angus compared to Red Angus associated with FCR, suggesting that these bacterial species may play a key role in the feed conversion efficiency of forage-fed bulls. This study highlights how the discovery of signatures of bacterial taxa and their functions can be used to harness the full potential of the rumen  in Angus cattle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667694>Clinical Predictors of Recurrence After Primary Clostridioides difficile Infection: A Prospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major public health threat. While clinical prediction tools exist, they do not incorporate the newest Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.This was a prospective longitudinal study of patients experiencing their first episode of uncomplicated CDI. Patients were followed from diagnosis through 8 weeks post-completion of their anti-CDI therapy to assess recurrence. Stool was collected at diagnosis and weekly for 8 weeks following treatment. Recurrence was defined as diarrhea as well as a positive stool test by toxin EIA (EIA) for C. difficile. Fisher's exact test for binary variables and Student's t test for continuous variables were performed. Cox regression was performed to assess for predictors of CDI recurrence.Seventy-five patients were enrolled between August 1, 2015, and September 1, 2018. Mean age 58.1 years ± 15.5, 69.3% female, 74.7% were white, 11.3% had baseline irritable bowel syndrome, and 54.7% were actively using PPIs. Over the 8-week follow-up period, 22 patients developed a confirmed CDI recurrence. Univariate predictors of recurrence included treatment with metronidazole (40.9% vs 15.1%, p = 0.03), initially diagnosis by EIA (77.3% vs 43.4%, p = 0.007) and platelet count (206 ± 72.1 vs 270.9 ± 114.8, p = 0.03).

What constitutes a unique feature of this model is its twofold objective of introducing an ileal microbial community and mimicking a dietary weaning transition. This model should then be ideally suited to test the dietary weaning strategies of piglets in vitro. Regarding the , the main phyla making up the model were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria although Bacteroidetes decreased after inoculation (p = 0.043 in ileum, p = 0.021 in colon) and Delta-Proteobacteria were favoured (p = 0.083 in ileum, p = 0.043 in colon) compared to Gamma-Proteobacteria. The designed model led to a low representation of Bacilli - especially Lactobacillus sp. in the ileum and a weak representation of Bacteroidia in the proximal colon. However, Mitsuokella and Prevotella were part of the major genera of the model along with Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera and Bacteroides. As a result of weaning, two major changes - normally occurring in vivo - were detected in the system: firstly, Firmicutes diminished when Bacteroidetes increased particularly in the proximal colon; secondly, Bacteroides decreased and Prevotella increased (mean value for four runs). In terms of metabolite production, while a ratio acetate: propionate: butyrate of 60:26:14 was obtained in post-weaned colon, the expected inversion of the ratio propionate: butyrate in the post-weaned ileum was unfortunately not observed. To conclude, the so-called baby-SPIME model meets expectations regarding the resident  of the proximal colon bioreactor and the metabolites produced thereof. In terms of the evolution of major groups of bacteria, the in vitro weaning process appeared to be successful. However, higher concentration of butyric acid would have been expected in ileum part of newly weaned piglets, as observed in vivo. The  in the ileum bioreactor seemed in fact to act like a pre-colon. This suggests that microbial profile in ileum bioreactor had to be improved.Copyright © 2019.

The causative organism, Paenibacillus larvae, attacks honey bee brood and renders entire hives dysfunctional during active disease states, but more commonly resides in hives asymptomatically as inactive spores that elude even vigilant beekeepers. The mechanism of this pathogenic transition is not fully understood, and no cure exists for AFB. Here, we evaluated how hive supplementation with probiotic lactobacilli (delivered through a nutrient patty; BioPatty) affected colony resistance towards a naturally occurring AFB outbreak. Results demonstrated a significantly lower pathogen load and proteolytic activity of honey bee larvae from BioPatty-treated hives. Interestingly, a distinctive shift in the  composition of adult nurse bees occurred irrespective of treatment group during the monitoring period, but only vehicle-supplemented nurse bees exhibited higher P. larvae loads. In vitro experiments utilizing laboratory-reared honey bee larvae showed Lactobacillus plantarum Lp39, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus kunkeei BR-1 (contained in the BioPatty) could reduce pathogen load, upregulate expression of key immune genes, and improve survival during P. larvae infection. These findings suggest the usage of a lactobacilli-containing hive supplement, which is practical and affordable for beekeepers, may be effective for reducing enzootic pathogen-related hive losses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654910>The mycobiota: fungi take their place between plants and bacteria.</a></h2><p>Eukaryotes host numerous intracellular and associated microbes in their .

Some fungal species are commensal organisms that are part of the normal human , and, as such, do not pose a threat to the immune system. However, when the natural balance of this association is disturbed or the host's immune system is compromised, these fungal pathogens overtake the organism, and cause IFI. To understand the invasiveness of these pathogens and to address the growing problem of IFI, it is essential to identify the cellular processes of the invading organism and their virulence. In this review, we will discuss the prevalence and current options available to treat IFI, including recent reports of drug resistance. Nevertheless, the main focus of this review is to describe the glycobiology of human fungal pathogens and how various components of the fungal cell wall, particularly cell wall polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, are involved in fungal pathogenicity, their biosynthesis and how they can be potentially exploited to develop novel antifungal treatment options.

We then review the factors impacting the composition of the child's gut , ranging from maternal stress to modality of delivery and from breastfeeding and diet composition to antibiotic treatment early in life. We discuss the topic of gut-brain communication with an emphasis on myelination, and propose the concept that gut microbes produce metabolites which may constitute a "metabolic" niche. Distinct bacterial communities may create very different "niches", some permissive and others inhibitory for myelin generation or maintenance. We speculate that this concept of "gut dysbiosis" may also in part explain the reduced myelin content detected in several neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The distribution of the  between the two groups was compared.CG patients had a greater microbial flora that was more diverse than the HC. Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Actinomyces, Rothia, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, and Aggregatibacter had a significantly higher abundance in CG patients. In contrast, Streptococcus and Campylobacter were the most abundant genera in HC with a mean relative abundance of 63% and 2%, respectively. The microbiological network indicated that most of the bacteria that were enriched at greater levels in CG patients were likely to be Prevotella, Actinomyces, and Rothia.

Trophic interactions may be altered through climate-dependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of 2°C warmer climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits (body condition, gut ) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662859>Gut  in chronic rheumatic and inflammatory bowel diseases: Similarities and differences.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and chronic rheumatic diseases (CRDs) are systemic chronic disorders sharing common genetic, immune and environmental factors. About half of patients with IBD develop rheumatic ailments and microscopic intestinal inflammation is present in up to half of CRD patients. IBD and CRD patients also share a common therapeutic armamentarium. Disequilibrium in the complex realm of microbes (known as dysbiosis) that closely interact with the gut mucosal immune system has been associated with both IBD and CRD (spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). Whether dysbiosis represents an epiphenomenon or a prodromal feature remains to be determined.In an attempt to further investigate whether specific gut dysbiosis may be the missing link between IBD and CRD in patients developing both diseases, we performed here a systematic literature review focusing on studies looking at bacterial  in CRD and/or IBD patients.We included 80 studies, with a total of 3799 IBD patients without arthritis, 1084 CRD patients without IBD, 132 IBD patients with arthropathy manifestations and 12 spondyloarthritis patients with IBD history.

The discovery of peculiar inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbial strains will not only shed new light on inflammatory bowel disease aetiogenesis, they may also support the development of novel therapeutic strategies not merely treating symptoms, but precisely counteracting the primary cause of chronic intestinal inflammation.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654911>Harnessing the  to control plant parasitic weeds.</a></h2><p>Microbiomes can significantly expand the genomic potential of plants, contributing to nutrient acquisition, plant growth promotion and tolerance to (a)biotic stresses. Among biotic stressors, root parasitic weeds (RPWs), mainly of the genera Orobanche, Phelipanche and Striga, are major yield-limiting factors of a wide range of staple crops, particularly in developing countries. Here, we provide a conceptual synthesis of putative mechanisms by which soil and plant microbiomes could be harnessed to control RPWs. These mechanisms are partitioned in direct and indirect modes of action and discussed in the context of past and present studies on microbe-mediated suppression of RPWs. Specific emphasis is given to the large but yet unexplored potential of root-associated microorganisms to interfere with the chemical signalling cascade between the host plant and the RPWs. We further provide concepts and ideas for future research directions and prospective designs of novel control strategies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Bioaugmentation has been proposed for the biodegradation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) and carbanilide (NCC) in soil. The isolated TCC-degrading strain Ochrobactrum sp. TCC-2 and chloroanilines-degrading strain Diaphorobacter sp. LD72 were used to study the removal efficiency of TCC, DCC and NCC mixture and their chloroanilines intermediates, respectively. The potential degradation competition between TCC and its dechlorinated congeners, and the response of bacterial community during the bioremediation were also investigated. The biodegradation of DCC and TCC was significantly enhanced for soil with inoculums compared with sterilized and natural soils. Chloroanilines products could also be effectively removed. For the degradation of combined substrates in the aqueous medium, NCC had negative effect on the degradation of TCC and DCC, while TCC and DCC negatively influenced each other. The bioaugmentation with two degraders obviously changed the phylogenetic composition and function of indigenous soil . Importantly, the inoculated degraders could be maintained, suggesting their adaptability and potential application in bioaugmentation for such recalcitrant contaminants. This study offers new insights into the enhanced bioremediation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners contaminated soils by the bioaugmentation of functional degraders and the structure and function response of the indigenous soil  to the bioremediation process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since prevention of osteoporosis is important, it might act as a potential cofactor in osteoporosis prevention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of VSEE on osteoporosis and abnormal lipid metabolisms.MC3T3-E1 cell and OVX rat model were used to evaluate VSEE on regulation of bone and lipid metabolisms. Differentiation and matrix mineralization of preosteoblast were significantly increased by VSEE (P <0.05), which attributed to stimulating calcium influx, then to activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and regulating runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). VSEE could cross Caco-2/HT-29 co-cultured monolayer via paracellular pathway and peptide transporter (PepT1), and could be detected in blood and maximum concentration was 122.84± 3.68 mg/L at 60 min. Additionally, VSEE was found to reverse bone loss and regulate dyslipidemia through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in OVX rats. Firmicutes phylum, Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae and six genera in VSEE group were significantly different compared with Model group (P <0.05).VSEE promotes bone growth and inhibit abnormal lipid metabolism in OVX model through the regulation of intestinal  compositions and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.

Several sample types have been used to investigate the lung , each presenting specific challenges for preparation and analysis of microbial communities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) enables the identification of  specific to the lower lung but commonly has low bacterial density, increasing the risk of false-positive signal from contaminating DNA. The objectives of this study were to investigate the extent of contamination across a range of sample densities representative of BALF and identify features of contaminants that facilitate their removal from sequence data and aid in the interpretation of BALF sample 16S sequencing data.Using three mock communities across a range of densities ranging from 8E+ 02 to 8E+ 09 16S copies/ml, we assessed taxonomic accuracy and precision by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the proportion of reads arising from contaminants. Sequencing accuracy, precision, and the relative abundance of mock community members decreased with sample input density, with a significant drop-off below 8E+ 05 16S copies/ml. Contaminant OTUs were commonly inversely correlated with sample input density or not reproduced between technical replicates. Removal of taxa with these features or physical concentration of samples prior to sequencing improved both sequencing accuracy and precision for samples between 8E+ 04 and 8E+ 06 16S copies/ml. For the lowest densities, below 8E+ 03 16S copies/ml BALF, accuracy and precision could not be significantly improved using these approaches. Using clinical BALF samples across a large density range, we observed that OTUs with features of contaminants identified in mock communities were also evident in low-density BALF samples.Relative abundance data and community composition generated by 16S sequencing of BALF samples across the range of density commonly observed in this sample type should be interpreted in the context of input sample density and may be improved by simple pre- and post-sequencing steps for densities above 8E+ 04 16S copies/ml.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666584>An algorithm-based meta-analysis of genome- and proteome-wide data identifies a combination of potential plasma biomarkers for colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Screening programs for colorectal cancer (CRC) often rely on detection of blood in stools, which is unspecific and leads to a large number of colonoscopies of healthy subjects. Painstaking research has led to the identification of a large number of different types of biomarkers, few of which are in general clinical use. Here, we searched for highly accurate combinations of biomarkers by meta-analyses of genome- and proteome-wide data from CRC tumors. We focused on secreted proteins identified by the Human Protein Atlas and used our recently described algorithms to find optimal combinations of proteins. We identified nine proteins, three of which had been previously identified as potential biomarkers for CRC, namely CEACAM5, LCN2 and TRIM28. The remaining proteins were PLOD1, MAD1L1, P4HA1, GNS, C12orf10 and P3H1. We analyzed these proteins in plasma from 80 patients with newly diagnosed CRC and 80 healthy controls. A combination of four of these proteins, TRIM28, PLOD1, CEACAM5 and P4HA1, separated a training set consisting of 90% patients and 90% of the controls with high accuracy, which was verified in a test set consisting of the remaining 10%.

However, its importance on the periphery is still not fully elucidated. KYNA is produced endogenously in various types of peripheral cells, tissues and by gastrointestinal . Furthermore, it was found in several products of daily human diet and its absorption in the digestive tract was evidenced. More recent studies were focused on the potential role of KYNA in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy; however, the results were ambiguous and the biological activity of KYNA in these processes has not been unequivocally established. This review aims to summarize the current views on the relationship between KYNA and cancer. The differences in KYNA concentration between physiological conditions and cancer, as well as KYNA production by both normal and cancer cells, will be discussed.

These infections, even when mild, interfere with blood glucose control. The aim of this review is to describe the infections that occur in children and adolescents with DM, as well as to provide recommendations on glycemia management during these episodes.A non-systematic review was carried out in the PubMed database, using the terms "diabetes mellitus," "infection," "children," and "adolescents." The most relevant publications were selected.In addition to the usual community infections, some of them occur predominantly in diabetic patients, especially when there is inadequate glycemic control, and common infections can be more severe in these patients. Alterations caused by the disease itself and the immune response, together with changes in the , are responsible for the higher frequency and severity of infections. During the infections, an increase in blood glucose occurs and usually an increase in insulin dose is required.The pediatric patient with diabetes will have elevated blood glucose during infections, with risk of decompensation. Therefore, blood glucose monitoring - as well as increased insulin doses -are critical to prevent the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. It should also be noted that many infections are preventable and can be avoided with adequate vaccine coverage.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

We set out to (1) further define the key microbial characteristics driving disease, and (2) examine the effects of tumour necrosis factor-inhibitor (TNFi) therapy upon the .The stools from a case-control cohort of 250 Han-Chinese subjects underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. All subjects were genotyped using the Illumina CoreExome SNP microarray.Previous reports of gut dysbiosis in AS were reconfirmed and several notable bacterial species and functional categories were differentially abundant. TNFi therapy was correlated with a restoration the perturbed  observed in untreated AS cases to that of healthy controls, including several important bacterial species that have been previously associated with AS and other related diseases. Enrichment of bacterial peptides homologous to HLA-B27-presented epitopes was observed in the stools of patients with AS, suggesting that either HLA-B27 fails to clear these or that they are involved in driving HLA-B27-associated immune reactions. TNFi therapy largely restored the perturbed  observed in untreated AS cases to that of healthy controls, including several important bacterial species that have been previously associated with AS and other related diseases. TNFi therapy of patients with AS was also associated with a reduction of potentially arthritogenic bacterial peptides, relative to untreated patients.These findings emphasise the key role that the gut  plays in driving the pathogenesis of AS and highlight potential therapeutic and/or preventative targets.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The  also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile acids. Lactate and bile acids (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile acid diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7-1.4 mM, 0.3-6.0 mM, and 1.0-7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of lactate and BA quantification in canine feces.

In the current study, we isolated a novel strain of Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense, named APCKJ1, from the faeces of a four-week old breastfed infant, based on the ability of the strain to utilise the HMO component fucosyllactose. We then determined the full genome sequence of this strain, and employed the generated data to analyze fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Transcriptomic and growth analyses, combined with metabolite analysis, in vitro hydrolysis assays and heterologous expression, allowed us to elucidate the pathway for fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Homologs of the key genes for this metabolic pathway were identified in particular in infant-derived members of the Bifdobacterium genus, revealing the apparent niche-specific nature of this pathway, and allowing a broad perspective on bifidobacterial fucosyllactose and L-fucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662903>Are Nonnutritive Sweeteners Obesogenic?

The study explored changes in the faecal  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal  was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7.5 units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

Gut  play pivotal roles in mediating psychological behaviors by regulating gut barrier integrity and systemic inflammatory responses. Here, we found that oral sesamin administration (50 mg/kg·bodyweight/day) significantly attenuated depressive, aversive, repetitive, and anxiety-like behaviors in a long-term multiple nonsocial stress-treated mice model. Sesamin inhibited stress-induced gut barrier integrity damage, reduced circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, sesamin treatment also restructured the gut  by enhancing the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and S24-7. The correlation analysis indicated that the  composition changes were strongly correlated with behavioral disorders, serotonin, norepinephrine, and LPS levels. In conclusion, sesamin has preventive effects on stress-induced behavioral and psychological disorders, which might be highly related to the reshaped  composition.

We sought to examine the associations between prenatal dog or cat keeping with caregiver-reported ADHD in preadolescents in the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS) birth cohort (N = 1258).At an interview with the caregiver at child age 10-12 years, caregivers reported if the WHEALS child had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. Similarly, during an interview with the mother prenatally, pet keeping (defined as dog or cat kept inside ≥1 h/day) was ascertained. Logistic regression models were fit to examine the association of prenatal pet keeping (dog keeping and cat keeping, separately) with ADHD.A subset of 627 children were included in the analyses: 93 who had ADHD and 534 with neurotypical development. After accounting for confounders and loss to follow-up, maternal prenatal dog exposure was associated with 2.23 times (95% CI: 1.15, 4.31; p = 0.017) greater odds of ADHD among boys. Prenatal dog keeping was not statistically significantly associated with ADHD in girls (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.06, 1.12; p = 0.070). Prenatal cat keeping was not associated with ADHD.In boys, but not girls, maternal prenatal dog keeping was positively associated with ADHD.

Most members of the root  possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root . In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root , as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the culturable subset of soil microbial community (SMB) on the stress response of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, upon exposure to one of the major soil contaminants, cadmium (Cd). Life history traits and the stress responses to Cd exposure were compared between SMB- and Escherichia coli strain OP50-fed worms. SMB-fed worms showed higher reproduction rates and longer lifespans. Also, the SMB-fed worms showed more tolerant response to Cd exposure. Gene expression profiling suggested that the chemical stress and immune response of worms were boosted upon SMB feeding. Finally, we investigated C. elegans gut microbial communities in the presence and absence of Cd in OP50- and SMB-fed C. elegans. In the OP50-fed worms, changes in microbial community by Cd exposure was severe, whereas in the SMB-fed worms, it was comparatively weak. Our results suggest that the SMB affects the response of C. elegans to Cd exposure and highlight the importance of the gut  in host stress response.Copyright © 2019.

Sensitivity to glyphosate varies with bacteria, particularly those residing in the intestine, where  is exposed to glyphosate residues. Therefore, less susceptible pathogenic isolates could have a distinct advantage compared to more sensitive commensal isolates, probably leading to dysbiosis.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A multicenter case-control study was performed in The Netherlands to elucidate the clinical relevance of molecular diagnostics results in gastroenteritis (GE). Samples from this case-control study were used to perform a detailed analysis on the presence of D. fragilis and Blastocystis in relation to gastrointestinal symptoms. In the present study, a real-time PCR for Blastocystis was performed on 1374 case samples and 1026 control samples from the multicenter gastroenteritis case-control study previously tested for D. fragilis. Prevalence of both micro-organisms was highest in children under 20 years of age and lowest in the oldest age group. A significantly lower overall detection of D. fragilis and Blastocystis was found in cases (both 25.8%) as compared to controls (37.6% and 40.0%, respectively). The difference for D. fragilis was statistically significant for subjects above 20 years of age. For Blastocystis, the difference was statistically significant in all age groups, except in children less than 5 years of age. A negative relation between D. fragilis-positive cases and diarrhea was found in this study population. More GE symptoms were reported in cases without D. fragilis or Blastocystis. In the present study, prevalence of both D. fragilis and Blastocystis is lower in cases with gastroenteritic symptoms than in controls. Besides, in cases with D. fragilis or Blastocystis, no association is shown between any of the GE symptoms.

Our objective was to investigate whether these dysbiotic bacteria act as pathobionts of T. vaginalis infection by altering pathogenic capabilities of the parasite, particularly in regard to adhesion to vaginal substrates and viability of human ectocervical cells. Assays interrogated the performance of T. vaginalis adhesion to biofilm produced by vaginal dysbiotic bacteria and whether these bacteria were capable of altering the ability of the parasite to bind to mucins and cells. The binding activities of T. vaginalis were quantified by flow cytometry. Host cell viability and apoptosis, as affected by T. vaginalis with or without the bacteria, were also measured experimentally. An in vitro biofilm was shown to provide adhesion for T. vaginalis. The binding of parasites to mucins and cells was modulated by the vaginal dysbiotic bacteria. Parasite cytoadhesion was significantly increased by these bacteria. In addition, these bacteria enhanced the pathogenic effects of the parasite to host cells. Together, this study showed that dysbiotic bacteria accompanying T. vaginalis infection in the vagina function as pathobionts as they are capable of enhancing the pathogenic capabilities of this parasite.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of omega-7-enriched Decaisnea insignis seed oil (DISO) on reducing TMAO formation to prevent the L-carnitine-induced hepatic damage in mice. Feeding of mice with 3% L-carnitine in drinking water clearly increased the serum and urinary levels of TMAO (p<0.05 vs Normal), whereas the serum and urinary TMAO formation was sharply reduced by DISO administration (p<0.05). Meanwhile, DISO resulted in strong inhibition against the elevation of hepatic injury markers (AST, ALT and ALP) activities and dyslipidemia (TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C), as well as liver inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and TNF-β) release in L-carnitine-fed mice, respectively (p<0.05). As revealed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing, DISO significantly inhibited the L-carnitine-induced elevations in the abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Erysipelotrichaceae, and the increases in the proportion of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, revealing that DISO attenuated the L-carnitine-caused gut dysbiosis.

It is not necessarily more difficult to measure antimicrobial activity the traditional way, but it is, however, more laborious. In the present study, we developed a new method to measure the antimicrobial activity of LA in multiple samples with a microplate reader. A "test complex" (TC) was produced consisting of 100 μL of agar medium with LA in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth in the top layer in 96-well deep-well microplates. Afterward, analysis of the broth in the top layer showed that the antimicrobial activity was the same as that of the "control complex," (CC) which consisted of 100 μL of agar medium in the bottom layer and 300 μL of broth with LA in the top layer. Furthermore, evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of the TC when using a microplate reader was the same as that with the use of the colony counting method. The colony counting method has confirmed that the antimicrobial activity of LA when bacteria are inoculated into the broth was equivalent between CC and TC, and we validated this by correlating the number of bacteria with absorbance. In addition, the broth itself in TC was transparent enough that the turbidity of broth can be used as an index of the number of bacteria, which enabled the use of a microplate reader for multiple samples. For human gut microbes, LA was shown to have low antimicrobial activity against commensal lactic acid bacteria, but high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic  and , suggesting that LA might modulate intestinal health, as confirmed by the proposed method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662860>Fecal  transplantation in irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Modulating gut  is a potential treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

We sought to develop a three-dimensional gingivae-biofilm interface model using a commercially available gingival epithelium to study the tissue inflammatory response to oral biofilms associated with "health", "gingivitis" and "periodontitis". These biofilms were developed by sequential addition of microorganisms to mimic the formation of supra- and sub-gingival plaque in vivo. Secondly, to mimic the interactions between gingival epithelium and immune cells in vivo, we integrated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD14 monocytes into our three-dimensional model and were able to assess the inflammatory response in the immune cells cultured with and without gingival epithelium. We describe a differential inflammatory response in immune cells cultured with epithelial tissue, and more so following incubation with epithelium stimulated by "gingivitis-associated" biofilm. These results suggest that gingival epithelium-derived soluble mediators may control the inflammatory status of immune cells in vitro, and therefore targeting of the epithelial response may offer novel therapies.

As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of obesity and diabetes, this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor function on the gut  composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0.2 mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP-2 receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut  signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial metabolic pathways.

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile acids (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut . Here we summarise the BA metabolic pathways focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut ? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut  is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660354>Corrigendum: The Role of Fecal  Transplantation in Reducing Intestinal Colonization With Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms: The Current Landscape and Future Directions.</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.][This corrects the article DOI: 10.1093/ofid/ofz288.].© The Author(s) 2019.

We found that in the periodontitis state, the shift in the subgingival  from the healthy state was less prominent in T2DM compared with ND subjects, yet the clinical signs of disease were similar for both. Furthermore, we revealed highly correlated presence of pathogenic species in relative abundance not only in the periodontitis state, but also in the healthy state in T2DM, suggesting an elevated risk of progression to periodontitis in this cohort. We further investigated the functional potentials of the subgingival  and identified a set of microbial marker genes associated with the clinical states. These genes were significantly enriched in 21 pathways, some of which are associated with periodontitis and some potentially link T2DM and periodontitis. This study identified the longitudinal changes of the subgingival  associated with periodontitis in T2DM and suggests that T2DM patients are more susceptible to shifts in the subgingival  toward dysbiosis, potentially due to impaired host metabolic and immune regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674687>Modulations of Probiotics on Gut  in a 5-Fluorouracil-Induced Mouse Model of Mucositis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal mucositis remained one of the most deleterious complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 5-FU treatment was reported to affect the abundance of gut  and cause mucositis, which might be ameliorated by probiotics.

Proper integration of various cell signaling pathways and a balanced cross talk between different cell types composing the organ are required to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Dysregulation of this balance can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we review important insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms of CRC. We discuss how perturbation in complex regulatory networks, including the Wnt, Notch, BMP, and Hedgehog pathways; and how variations in inflammatory signaling, nutrients, and  can affect intestinal homeostasis contributing to the malignant transformation of intestinal cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Little is known regarding the changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and potential pathogen burden that occur in pediatric recipients of FMT. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in AMR genes, potential pathogens, species, and functional pathways with FMT in children.Nine children with recurrent CDI underwent FMT. Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope 2.0.All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT ( < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes ( < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT ( < .001), with an increase post-FMT ( ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples ( < .001). Bacterial species  and  showed higher abundance in donors than recipients ( = .008 and  = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT. Biosynthetic pathways predominated in the donor and increased in the recipient post-FMT.FMT for CDI in children decreases AMR genes and potential pathogens and changes  composition and function. However, acquisition of certain AMR genes post-FMT combined with low levels of potential pathogens found in donors suggests that further study is warranted regarding screening donors using metagenomics sequencing before FMT.© The Author(s) 2019.

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut  and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut , and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and cancer. Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health.

Therefore we want to investigate whether the dCCA has a certain correlation with biliary microecology, and to detect specific strains.A total of 68 adults were enrolled, of whom 8 with dCCA, 16 with recurrent choledocholithiasis, and 44 with the onset of common bile duct stones. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancretography (ERCP) was utilized to collect bile samples for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by analysis of bile  composition.First, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most dominant phyla in the bile of patients with dCCA and the onset of common bile duct stoes. Secondly, compared with the onset of common bile duct stones patients, we got a significant increase in the phylum Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and Planctomycetes in dCCA patients. Finally, at the genus level, we obtained sequencing results of 252 bacterial genera from patients with dCCA, recurrent choledocholithiasis, and the new onset of common bile duct stones, revealing heterogeneity among individuals.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the dysbiosis of bile flora in patients with dCCA. This micro-ecological disorder may be a decisive factor in the formation of dCCA. At the same time, for the first time, this study provides a test chart of biliary microbial populations that may be associated with recurrent choledocholithiasis. The compositional changes of the core microbial group of the biliary tract have potentially important biological and medical significance for the microbiological biliary disorders of dCCA.Copyright © 2019 Bingrong Chen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666478>Japanese Diet Score Is Associated with Gut  Composition in Young Japanese Adults.</a></h2><p>The Japanese diet (JD) is accepted as a healthy dietary pattern, which has protective effects against cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, it remains unclear whether there is any association between the JD and fecal  composition. This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between JD scores and fecal  in young Japanese adults, through the analysis of fecal  using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. JD scores were calculated with regard to nine food groups (rice, miso soup, pickles, green and yellow vegetables, seaweeds, fish, green tea, meat, and coffee) based on a brief self-administered diet-history questionnaire. JD total scores were categorized as low (score 0-3) or high (score 4-8). The high-scoring JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides than the low JD group, whereas the low JD group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella than the high JD group. With regard to food group intakes, a higher consumption of rice was associated with a significantly lower relative abundance of Prevotella, whereas a higher consumption of green tea was associated with a significantly higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an association between JD score and fecal  and may allow the prediction of changes in fecal  due to changes in the JD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674054>Long-term impact of tylosin on fecal  and fecal bile acids of healthy dogs.</a></h2><p>Tylosin is commonly prescribed to dogs with diarrhea.

Those who relocate from Latin America to the USA at an early age have reductions in Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios that persist across the life course.

In contrast, those who relocate to the USA during adulthood, over 45 years old, have high bacterial and fungal diversity and high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios, compared to USA-born and childhood arrivals. Low bacterial diversity is associated in turn with obesity. Contrasting with prior studies, our study of the Latino population shows increasing Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio with greater obesity. Taxa within Acidaminococcus, Megasphaera, Ruminococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, YS2 (Cyanobacteria), and Victivallaceae are significantly associated with both obesity and earlier exposure to the USA, while Oscillospira and Anaerotruncus show paradoxical associations with both obesity and late-life introduction to the USA.Our analysis of the gut  of Latinos demonstrates unique features that might be responsible for health disparities affecting Hispanics living in the USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675161>Interaction of Gut  and High-sodium, Low-potassium Diet in Altering Plasma Triglyceride Profiles Revealed by Lipidomics Analysis.</a></h2><p>High-sodium and low-potassium (HNaLK) intake increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome. We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut  to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

We focused on examining bacterial community composition, antibiotic resistance (AR) and microbial source tracking (MST) of fecal bacteria on the floor surfaces. Swab samples were collected from carpet and vinyl floors in three different buildings (medical, veterinary, and office buildings) from high and low traffic areas. Bacterial communities were determined with 16S rRNA sequencing, and AR (tetracycline (Q), sulfonamide, and carbapenem (KPC)) and MST (human-, canine-, avian-, and ruminant-specific fecal bacteria) were examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results show that  and  were the most abundant phyla. Traffic level significantly affected the number of operational taxonomic units. Traffic level was a key factor for distinctive bacterial community in the medical center.

Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic  is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

No clear site associated differences in population genetic structure was found between populations using the AFLP marker loci. Further, no relationship between ionising radiation exposure levels and the percentage of methylated loci or pattern of distribution of DNA methylation marks was found.  structure was clearly site dependent, with gut  community structure and diversity being systematically associated with calculated site-specific earthworm dose rates. There was, however, also co-correlation between earthworm dose rates and other soil properties, notably soil pH; a property known to affect soil bacterial community structure. Such co-correlation means that it is not possible to attribute  changes unequivocally to radionuclide exposure. A better understanding of the relationship between radionuclide exposure soil properties and their interactions on bacterial  community response is, therefore, needed to establish whether these the observed  changes are attributed directly to radiation exposure, other soil properties or to an interaction between multiple variables at sites within the CEZ.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, insects' tolerance to Bt is influenced by environmental factors affecting immunity. To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants.

The brown dog tick ( sensu lato) is the principal vector of this pathogen in Arizona. Domesticated dogs () are the tick's main host, so free-roaming dogs in peridomestic areas have been named the primary risk factor for human cases of RMSF. However, the sudden emergence and long-distance dispersal of the pathogen have not been adequately explained, and one possible mechanism could include wildlife. Coyotes () are wide ranging in Arizona and closely related to dogs, so it is possible that brown dog ticks parasitize coyotes and infect them. Although  is the most severe spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsial pathogen in humans, others occur in Arizona, and antibodies raised against them are cross-reactive, so we more-broadly hypothesized that coyotes in Arizona are exposed to SFG rickettsiae.

However, characterizing how microbes interact and work together within closely packed and highly heterogeneous microbial ecosystems is extremely challenging. Here, we describe a rule-of-thumb framework for visualizing polymicrobial interactions and extracting general principles that underlie microbial communities. We integrate elements of metabolic ecology, behavioral ecology, and game theory to quantify the interactive strategies by which microbes at any taxonomic level compete for resources and cooperate symbiotically with each other to form and stabilize ecological communities. We show how the framework can chart an omnidirectional landscape of microbial cooperation and competition that may drive various natural processes. This framework can be implemented into genome-wide association studies to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying microbial interaction networks and their evolutionary consequences along spatiotemporal gradients. Identifying general biological rules that underlie the complexity and heterogeneity of microbial communities has proven to be highly challenging. We present a rule-of-thumb framework for studying and characterizing how microbes interact with each other across different taxa to determine community behavior and dynamics. This framework is computationally simple but conceptually meaningful, and it can provide a starting point to generate novel biological hypotheses about microbial interactions and explore internal workings of microbial community assembly in depth.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656031>Characterization of the gut  in frail elderly patients.</a></h2><p>The change in the composition of gut  has been reported in the elderly and in the frail individuals; however, studies on gut  in frail elderly are limited.This study aimed to investigate the gut  of the frail elderly.From September 2017 to February 2018, 27 elderly patients hospitalized in the Department of Geriatrics of our hospital were enrolled and divided into the frailty group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 12) based on the cutoff of 0.25 for the frailty index.

Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut , have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal  analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659049>Microbial communities in the tropical air ecosystem follow a precise diel cycle.</a></h2><p>The atmosphere is vastly underexplored as a habitable ecosystem for microbial organisms. In this study, we investigated 795 time-resolved metagenomes from tropical air, generating 2.27 terabases of data. Despite only 9 to 17% of the generated sequence data currently being assignable to taxa, the air harbored a microbial diversity that rivals the complexity of other planetary ecosystems. The airborne microbial organisms followed a clear diel cycle, possibly driven by environmental factors. Interday taxonomic diversity exceeded day-to-day and month-to-month variation. Environmental time series revealed the existence of a large core of microbial taxa that remained invariable over 13 mo, thereby underlining the long-term robustness of the airborne community structure. Unlike terrestrial or aquatic environments, where prokaryotes are prevalent, the tropical airborne biomass was dominated by DNA from eukaryotic phyla. Specific fungal and bacterial species were strongly correlated with temperature, humidity, and CO concentration, making them suitable biomarkers for studying the bioaerosol dynamics of the atmosphere.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut  in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664137>Exploring possible associations of the intestine bacterial  with the pre-weaned weight gaining performance of piglets in intensive pig production.</a></h2><p>The pre-weaned weight gain is an important performance trait of pigs in intensive pig production. The bacterial  inside the host is vital to host health and growth performance. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible associations of the intestinal  with the pre-weaned weight gain in intensive pig production. In this study, several anatomical sites (jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) were examined for bacterial  structure using 16S rRNA V4-V5 region sequencing with Illumina Miseq. The results showed that the microbial richness (estimated by Chao1 index) in jejunum was positively correlated with the pre-weaned weight gain. This study also revealed that the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in colon were the weight gaining-related phyla; while the Selenomonas and Moraxella in ileum and the Lactobacillus in both cecum and colon were the weight gaining-related genera for the pre-weaned piglets in intensive pig prodution. Several intra-microbial interactions within commensal  correlated with the pre-weaned weight gain were excavated, as well. Overall, this study provides an expanded view of the commensal bacterial community inside four anatomical intestinal sites of the commercial piglets and the associations of the intestinal  with the pre-weaned weight gaining performance in intensive pig production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667416>A new method for extracting DNA from the grape berry surface, beginning in the vineyard.</a></h2><p>Isolating DNA from microbes on the surface of a grape berry is a challenge due to their adhesion to the thick berry skin and cuticle, making studies of the grape  challenging. We developed a field-to-lab DNA extraction procedure that starts in the vineyard, disrupts the grape berry surface while en route to the lab through agitation, and efficiently extracts microbial DNA from the surface of the grape. It is cost effective and utilizes commonly available laboratory chemicals with low toxicity (Table 1). This protocol allows researchers to extract DNA from the grape berry surface in the field, therefore undergoing minimal manipulation of those microbiomes before DNA extraction.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665573>Fecal  Transplantation for Dysbiosis - Predictable Risks.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670354>Whole barley prevents obesity and dyslipidemia without the involvement of the gut  in germ free C57BL/6J obese mice.</a></h2><p>Whole barley (WB) consumption is the subject of renewed interest because of its health benefits. However, there are still controversies regarding the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of WB. The gut  has recently become a focus of research into obesity-related disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the gut  to the anti-obesity effects of WB. Germ-free (GF) C57BL/6J mice underwent gastric inoculation with human feces to obtain human flora-associated (HFA) mice, and then both the GF and HFA mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 46% WB or refined barley for 9 weeks. Features of obesity and dyslipidemia were compared between the GF and HFA mice and the cecal  was analyzed using next-generation sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA. WB prevents obesity and hypercholesterolemia in the GF and HFA mice. The mechanism may include the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, because sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) expression was downregulated, and a reduction in cholesterol accumulation, because cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression was upregulated, independent of the gut . Furthermore, WB intake enriched a variety of bacterial genera that are negatively associated with obesity, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, suggesting that WB counteracted gut dysbiosis in obese mice. Thus, WB helps prevent obesity and dyslipidemia via both gut -dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and  in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h2><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P. clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, 2, 5 and 10 mg/L) of cadmium (Cd). We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and  in P. clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P. clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal  in P. clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the pathways related to metabolism, diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal  composition and functions of P. clarkii. Our study can be an important step toward a better understanding of the toxic effects of Cd on aquatic crustaceans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In sustainable agriculture, it is important to investigate bacteria diversity in various plant species and how edaphic factors influence the bacterial . In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to assess bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere and root interior of canola, wheat, field pea, and lentil grown at four locations in Saskatchewan, Canada. Rhizosphere bacteria communities exhibited distinct profiles among crops and sampling locations. However, each crop associated with distinct root endophytic bacterial communities, suggesting that crop species may influence the selection of root bacterial . Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the root interior, whereas Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria were prevalent in the rhizosphere soil. Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas were predominant in the rhizosphere and root interior, whereas Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Rhizobium, Streptomyces, Variovorax and Xanthomonas were dominant in the root interior of all crops. The relative abundance of specific bacterial groups in the rhizosphere, correlated with soil pH, silt and organic matter contents, however, there was no correlation between root endophytes and analyzed soil properties. These results suggest that the root  may be modulated by plant factors rather than soil characteristics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674052>Duodenal and rectal mucosal  related to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in diarrhea-predominant IBS.</a></h2><p>Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been proposed as an etiologic factor in irritable bowel syndrome, particularly the diarrhea-predominant subtype (IBS-D). We aimed to identify potential intestinal microbial pattern in IBS-D patients with SIBO.IBS-D patients fulfilling Rome-III criteria were recruited, and randomly divided into an exploratory cohort (57 cases) and a validation cohort (20 cases). SIBO was identified according to standard glucose hydrogen breath test. For 16S-rRNA gene sequencing, samples of duodenal mucosa, duodenal fluid, rectal mucosa and fresh feces were collected and performed. The α and β diversity, as well as differences in microbial composition and function, in SIBO and SIBO IBS-D subjects were evaluated.The microbial diversity and composition obviously differed between SIBO and SIBO IBS-D in duodenal and rectal mucosa, but not in duodenal fluid and fresh feces. For rectal-mucosal , it displayed markedly reduced aerobe and Gram-negative bacteria, and increased facultative anaerobe and Gram-positive bacteria, moreover, altered functions of microbial metabolism in SIBO IBS-D. Significantly higher rectal mucosa-related MDI was observed in SIBO IBS-D, and a cutoff value at -0.37 had a sensitivity of 56.55% and specificity of 90.91% to identify the SIBO in IBS-D subjects.Mucosal , rather than luminal bacteria, has a more apparent dysbiosis in SIBO IBS-D patients relative to those without SIBO. Rectal mucosa-associated  may act as a potential predictor of SIBO in IBS-D patients.This article is protected by copyright.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut  of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this  can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut  is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA  profiling.  diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the  profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut . Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut . Although the  was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674912>Life on a leaf.</a></h2><p>Microscopic water films allow bacteria to survive the seemingly dry surface of plant leaves.© 2019, Tecon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665823>Translating In Vitro Acrolein-Trapping Capacities of Tea Polyphenol and Soy Genistein to In Vivo Situation is Mediated by the Bioavailability and Biotransformation of Individual Polyphenols.</a></h2><p>Acrolein is a highly toxic unsaturated aldehyde. Humans are both endogenously and exogenously exposed to acrolein. Long-term exposure to acrolein leads to various chronic diseases. Dietary polyphenols have been reported to be able to attenuate acrolein-induced toxicity in vitro via formation of acrolein-polyphenol conjugates. However, whether in vitro acrolein-trapping abilities of polyphenols can be maintained under in vivo environments is still unknown.Two most commonly consumed dietary polyphenols, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from tea and genistein from soy, were used to evaluate for their anti-acrolein behaviors both in vitro and in mice. Tea EGCG exerted much higher capacity to capture acrolein than soy genistein in vitro. But translation of in vitro anti-acrolein activity into in vivo was mainly mediated by bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols. We found that 1) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could trap endogenous ACR by forming mono-ACR adducts and eventually be excreted into mouse urine; 2) both absorbed EGCG and genistein could produce active metabolites, MeEGCG and orobol, to scavenge endogenous ACR; 3) both MeEGCG and non-absorbed EGCG showed ability to trap ACR in the gut; 4) considerable amounts of microbial metabolites of genistein displayed enhanced anti-ACR capacity both in the body and in the gut, compared to genistein; and 5) biotransformation of genistein is able to boost its in vivo anti-ACR capacity, compared to EGCG.Our findings demonstrate that in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols cannot be reflected solely based on their in vitro ability. The bioavailability and biotransformation of individual polyphenols especially gut  contribute to in vivo anti-acrolein ability of dietary polyphenols. This article is protected by copyright.

The results indicated that chemical pollution of sediments from Taizhou was higher than that from Xiamen. The number of sediment bacterial genera was negatively (Taizhou) or positively (Xiamen) correlated with offshore distance, owing to shifts in the primary and secondary status of organic matter and chemical pollutants for the promotion or inhibition of the sediment . The total number of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in sediments from Taizhou was larger than from Xiamen, while the number of core OTUs was smaller indicating that Taizhou had more impact on core microbes in sediments than Xiamen. This study suggests that chemical pollutants and organic matter result in different co-regulation of the off-shore sediment  of coastal industrial and tourist cities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
