Here we show that elaidic  (EA), the most abundant TFA in diet, alters the electrophysiological properties of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) of . Purified bovine brain VDAC, when incorporated in the planar lipid bilayer (PLB) composed of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphatidyl choline (DPhPC) and EA in a 9 to 1 ratio (wt/wt), exhibited complete closing events at different voltages. The closing events were observed at even -10 mV, a voltage at which VDAC usually remains fully open all the time. Additionally, the voltage sensitivity of VDAC was lost in presence of EA; the channel conductance did not decrease with increasing voltages. In identical experimental conditions, membrane containing  (OA), the cis isomer of EA did not produce any such effect. We propose that EA possibly exerts its adverse effect by modulating VDAC.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Temperature-dependent NIR spectral profiles indicate that dynamical variances of COOH group dominate its γ → α phase transition, while the transition from active α to β phase mainly relates to the conformational transfer of acyl chain. Through operating multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares with factor analysis, instantaneous contribution of each active polymorph during the transition process was illustrated for displaying the progressive evolutions of functional groups. Calculated contributions reveal that the α phase of  initially is present at around -18 °C, but sharply grows up around -2.2 °C from the transformation of γ phase and finally disappears at the melting point. On the other hand, the β phase of  is sole self-generation after melt even it embryonically appears at -2.2 °C.

Mushrooms are widely used as healthy nutritious food. In the present study, the nutritional composition of four different Pleurotus sp. was determined. Prior to extraction, all the selected mushrooms were subjected for proximate composition analysis. The protein, fat, ash, total carbohydrate, fiber and  contents were in the range of (16.07- 25.15%), (0.64-2.02%), (2.1-9.14%), (65.66-82.47%), (6.21-54.12%) and (342.20-394.30Kcal/100g), respectively. The spectrophotometric analysis showed that the concentration of protein was in the range of 45.78-33.47 mg/g in all Pleurotus sp. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of sugars showed six different mono and disaccharides in all the selected mushrooms. The fatty  profile by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the main fatty acids in selected mushrooms were present in the order linoliec > > palmitic .

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of N-Oleoyl glycine (OLGly), a lipoamino , on 3T3-L1  and to explore the likely mechanisms underlying this process. Lipid accumulation were evaluated using Oil Red O staining and triglyceride content assay. The mRNA expressions of cannabinoid receptors and the protein expressions of adipogenic genes and intracellular signaling pathway were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. The results indicated that OLGly itself, but not its degradation products, stimulated lipid accumulation and significantly increased adipogenic genes (PPARγ and aP2), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, OLGly markedly increased the mRNA expression of CB1 receptor (CB1R) and the inhibition of CB1R by its antagonist SR141716 abolished the promotive effects of OLGly on lipid accumulation and the protein expression of PPARγ and aP2. Furthermore, OLGly increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt and p-FoxO1/FoxO1, which could be reversed by SR141716. Moreover, OLGly-induced enhancement of , activation of insulin-mediated Akt signaling pathway and inactivation of FoxO1 were effectively blocked by Wortmannin, a specific PI3K/Akt inhibitor, indicating the essential role of Akt signaling pathway in the process of OLGly-stimulated 3T3-L1 . In conclusion, OLGly, a lipoamino , was able to promote 3T3-L1  through the activation of CB1 receptor and the enhancement of insulin-mediated Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggested the potential role of OLGly in increasing insulin sensitivity and suppressing obesity and diabetes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of several unsaturated fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) docosahexaenoic  (DHA), α linolenic  (ALA), linoleic  (LA), and  (OA) have received much attention in past years. In addition, results from recent studies revealed that several other uncommon fatty acids (fatty acids present at a low content or else not contained in usual foods), such as furan fatty acids, -3 docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and conjugated fatty acids, also have favorable effects on cardiometabolic health. In the present report, we searched the literature in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to review the research progress on anti-CVD effect of these uncommon fatty acids. DPA has a favorable effect on cardiometabolic health in a different way to other long-chain -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC -3 PUFAs), such as EPA and DHA. Furan fatty acids and conjugated linolenic  (CLNA) may be potential bioactive fatty acids beneficial for cardiometabolic health, but evidence from intervention studies in humans is still limited, and well-designed clinical trials are required. The favorable effects of conjugated linoleic  (CLA) on cardiometabolic health observed in animal or in vitro cannot be replicated in humans. However, most intervention studies in humans concerning CLA have only evaluated its effect on cardiometabolic risk factors but not its direct effect on risk of CVD, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be required to clarify this point. However, several difficulties and limitations exist for conducting RCTs to evaluate the effect of these fatty acids on cardiometabolic health, especially the high costs for purifying the fatty acids from natural sources.

The rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) plays a key role in conveying to the spinal cord pain modulatory influences triggered in higher brain centres, with co-existence of inhibitory (antinociceptive) and facilitatory (pronociceptive) effects. In spite of some reports of TRPV1 expression in the RVM, it remains unknown if endovanilloid signalling plays a direct role in local pain modulation. Here we used a model of diabetic neuropathy, the streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rat, to study the role of endovanilloid signalling in RVM-mediated pain modulation during chronic pain. Four weeks after  induction, the levels of TRPV1 mRNA and fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), a crucial enzyme for endovanilloid catabolism, in the RVM of STZ-diabetic rats were higher than control. The RVM of STZ-diabetic rats presented decreased levels of several TRPV1 endogenous ligands, namely anandamide (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA). Administration of capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) into the RVM decreased nociceptive behavioural responses in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test (phase 2). These findings suggest that diabetic neuropathy induces plastic changes of RVM endovanilloid signalling, indicating that TRPV1 may be a putative target for pain modulation in this chronic pain condition.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For acetaminophen (APAP), a role of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is suspected since the activity of this enzyme is consistently enhanced during NAFLD. The first aim of our study was to set up a cellular model of NAFLD characterized not only by triglyceride accumulation but also by higher CYP2E1 activity. To this end, human HepaRG cells were incubated for one week with stearic  or , in the presence of different concentrations of insulin. Although cellular triglycerides and the expression of lipid-responsive genes were similar with both fatty acids, CYP2E1 activity was significantly increased only by stearic . CYP2E1 activity was reduced by insulin and this effect was reproduced in cultured primary human hepatocytes. Next, APAP cytotoxicity was assessed in HepaRG cells with or without lipid accretion and CYP2E1 induction. Experiments with a large range of APAP concentrations showed that the loss of ATP and glutathione was almost always greater in the presence of stearic . In cells pretreated with the CYP2E1 inhibitor chlormethiazole, recovery of ATP was significantly higher in the presence of stearate with low (2.5mM) or high (20mM) concentrations of APAP. Levels of APAP-glucuronide were significantly enhanced by insulin. Hence, HepaRG cells can be used as a valuable model of NAFLD to unveil important metabolic and hormonal factors which can increase susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

BO significantly reduced n-6/n-3 levels in plasma, liver and adipose tissues as well as serum triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but contrarily increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, HBO treatments decreased mRNA expression of lipid anabolism-related genes, lipid inflammatory-related genes, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and increased lipid catabolism-related genes as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma mRNA (PPARγ mRNA).

To augment the simple mass characterizations, we have employed stoichiometric considerations; we have supplemented the analysis further by using the detailed information available from product analysis of batch reactor TG cracking. Both the VUV photoionization and batch reactor studies indicated that formation of C7-sized stable products is a marker of significant triolein decomposition that is coupled with PAH formation.

High Alt Med Biol 18:322-329, 2017.-High-altitude (HA) hypoxia is a stressful condition endured by organisms through different mechanisms. Failing to adapt to chronic HA exposure leads to a disease called chronic mountain sickness (CMS) characterized by excessive erythrocytosis (hemoglobin [Hb] ≥19 g/dL for women and ≥21 g/dL for men). Genes encoding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subunits α and γ have been proposed as candidate genes for HA adaptation. N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) are endogenous fatty  substances that bind to PPAR-α and -γ. NAEs are also able to modulate the endocannabinoid system, a signaling pathway activated in physiological stressful conditions.

The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for NAFLD is of recent interest. Because primary de novo lipogenesis occurs in chicken liver as in human liver, adult chickens with age-associated steatosis resembling human NAFLD is an appealing animal model. The objective of this study was to screen potential biomarkers in the chicken model for NAFLD by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Hy-Line W-36 laying hens were fed standard feed from 25 to 45 wk of age to induce fatty liver. They were killed every 4 wk, and liver and plasma were collected at each time point to assess fatty liver development and for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Next, selected biomarkers were confirmed in additional experiments by providing supplements of the hepatoprotective nutrients betaine [300, 600, or 900 parts per million (ppm) in vivo; 2 mM in vitro] or docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) to 30-wk-old Hy-Line W-36 laying hens for 4 mo and to Hy-Line W-36 chicken primary hepatocytes with -induced steatosis. Liver or hepatocyte lipid contents and the expression of biomarkers were then examined. Plasma acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), glutamine synthetase (GLUL), and glutathione -transferase (GST) concentrations are well-established biomarkers for NAFLD. Selected biomarkers had significant positive associations with hepatic lipid deposition ( < 0.001). Betaine (900 ppm in vivo; 2 mM in vitro) and DHA (1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) supplementation both resulted in lower steatosis accompanied by the reduced expression of selected biomarkers in vivo and in vitro ( < 0.05). This study used adult laying hens to identify biomarkers for NAFLD and indicated that AACS, DPP4, GLUL, and GST could be considered to be potential diagnostic indicators for NAFLD in the future.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923965>Sources of microbial oils with emphasis to Mortierella (Umbelopsis) isabellina fungus.</a></h2><p>The last years a constantly rising number of publications have appeared in the literature in relation to the production of oils and fats deriving from microbial sources (the "single cell oils"-SCOs). SCOs can be used as precursors for the synthesis of lipid-based biofuels or employed as substitutes of expensive oils rarely found in the plant or animal kingdom. In the present review-article, aspects concerning SCOs (economics, biochemistry, substrates, technology, scale-up), with emphasis on the potential of Mortierella isabellina were presented. Fats and hydrophilic substrates have been used as carbon sources for cultivating Zygomycetes. Among them, wild-type M. isabellina strains have been reported as excellent SCO-producers, with conversion yields on sugar consumed and lipid in DCW values reported comparable to the maximum ones achieved for genetically engineered SCO-producing strains. Lipids produced on glucose contain γ-linolenic  (GLA), a polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) of high dietary and pharmaceutical importance, though in low concentrations. Nevertheless, due to their abundance in , these lipids are perfect precursors for the synthesis of 2nd generation biodiesel, while GLA can be recovered and directed to other usages. Genetic engineering focusing on over-expression of Δ6 and Δ12 desaturases and of C16 elongase may improve the fatty  composition (viz. increasing the concentration of GLA or other nutritionally important PUFAs) of these lipids.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25458530>Ellagic  modulates lipid accumulation in primary human adipocytes and human hepatoma Huh7 cells via discrete mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Previously, we have reported that consumption of a muscadine grape phytochemical powder (MGP) decreased lipid accumulation in high-fat fed mice. The aim of this study was to identify the responsible polyphenolic constituents and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In mice, MGP supplementation significantly reduced visceral fat mass as well as adipocyte size. To determine whether MGP affects  or hypertrophic lipid accumulation, we used a human adipogenic stem cell (hASCs) model. Among the MGP, ellagic  (EA) was identified as a potent negative regulator of  of hASCs. In addition, EA substantially decreased the conversion of [(3)H]-acetyl CoA into fatty acids (FAs), suggesting that EA inhibits de novo synthesis of FA in mature adipocytes. Similarly, MGP supplementation significantly decreased hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels. The TG-lowering effects of EA were confirmed in human hepatoma Huh7 cells. EA reduced [(3)H]- esterification into [(3)H]-TG as well as the de novo synthesis of FA from [(3)H]-acetyl CoA in Huh7 cells. Intriguingly, EA also increased oxygen consumption rate and β-oxidation-related gene expression. Taken together, EA attenuated new fat cell formation and FA biosynthesis in adipose tissue, while it reduced the synthesis of TG and FA and increased FA oxidation in the liver. These results suggest that EA exerts unique lipid-lowering effects both in adipose tissue and liver via discrete mechanisms.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Increased  markers were found in C, G and GS rats. Cholesterol feeding increased liver size, fat, and cholesterol and reduced antioxidant enzyme levels and expressions. Cholesterolemia was lower in HG and HGS than in HC. GS vs. G showed higher stearic but lower  levels. SFA and PUFA decreased while MUFA increased by cholesterol feeding. The arachidonic/linoleic and docosahexaenoic/alpha-linolenic ratios were lower in HC, HG, and HGS vs. C, G, and GS, respectively, suggesting a delta-6-elongase-desaturase system inhibition. Moreover, cholesterol feeding, mainly in HGS, decreased low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression and the delta-5-desaturase activity and increased the delta-9-desaturase activity. In conclusion, the liver production of highly unsaturated fatty acids was limited to decrease their oxidation in presence of hypercholesterolaemia.

Hochst (Marula) oil: A clinical perspective.</a></h2><p>Sclerocarya birrea (A.Rich.) Hochst (Marula) nut oil is a popular ingredient in cosmetics such as skin lotions, lipsticks and foundations. The demand for this African oil increased tremendously such that in 2008 almost US$ 20 million was spent on Marula oil for cosmetic product manufacturing. The ethnobotanical literature states that the Zulu people in South Africa amongst others applied the oil to maintain a healthy skin. Scientific studies to support the traditional use as well as the inclusion of Marula oil in cosmetic products is lacking. This study evaluated the irritancy potential (safety), the moisturising and hydrating effects as well occlusivity properties (efficacy) of Marula oil after topical application. In addition, the Marula oil used in this study was comprehensively characterised using two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.Quantification of the fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) was done using a LECO Pegasus 4D GC × GC-MS. To determine the safety and efficacy of Marula oil healthy caucasian adult female volunteers (n = 20) who complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the irritancy patch, moisture efficacy, hydrating and occlusivity tests were recruited for each study. A 2 × magnifying lamp (visual observation), Chromameter®, Aquaflux® and Corneometer® instruments were used to evaluate and monitor the irritancy level, skin  , transepidermal water loss, hydrating and occlusive effects of topically applied Marula oil.The GC × GC-MS analysis identified several saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids.  was the major fatty  constituting 69.0% of the oil followed by palmitic  (15.3%), linoleic  (9.2%), palmitoleic  (4.1%) and stearic  (1.5%). The clinical study revealed that Marula oil is non-irritant (p < 0.001), with moisturising and hydrating properties (p < 0.001) when applied to a lipid-dry (xerosis) skin. Additionally the oil exhibited occlusive effects (p < 0.001) when applied to normal skin. These findings may be linked to the absorption of the oil into the skin due to the high percentage of  and the presence of palmitic  which are known to disturb the stratum corneum intercellular lipids. These fatty acids present in Marula oil are very similar to those present in the epidermis, and can be considered biomimetic.Marula oil rich in fatty acids exhibits moisturising, hydrating and occlusive properties. As the oil is non-irritating and provides a moisturising effect with moderate prevention of transepidermal water loss, average moisture retention properties and noteworthy occlusive effects, its inclusion in cosmetic products based on its traditional use may be justified depending on the application.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The body weight of the rats was not influenced by the four diets containing the different vegetable oils during the 4-week feeding period. Highest adduct levels of etheno-dC (430 +/- 181 adducts/10(9) parent bases), HNE-dGp (617 +/- 96 adducts/10(9) parent bases) and 8-Oxo-dG (37,400 +/- 12,200 adducts/10(9) parent bases) were seen in rats on sunflower oil diet (highest linoleic  content).

Influences of an extraction technology on the oil fatty  composition and the content of minor bioactive compounds, including tocopherols, polyphenols, and squalene, were investigated in detail. High-fat-diet Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model was then established to probe the impact of cold-pressed peanut oil (CPO), hot-pressed peanut oil (HPO), and enzyme-assisted aqueous-extracted peanut oil (EAO) on lipid  outcomes, to explore influences of different extraction technologies on lipid functional quality. Results showed that  was the predominate fatty  in the EAO (52.57 ± 0.11%), which was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) than CPO and HPO. The HPO showed higher total tocopherol and polyphenol contents (206.84 ± 6.93 mg/kg and 47.87 ± 6.50 mg GA/kg, respectively) than CPO and EAO (P < 0.05). However, the squalene content in CPO was 475.47 ± 12.75 mg/kg, which was the highest among the three oils (P < 0.05). The animal experiment results revealed that EAO could be more prone to induce lipid accumulation in the liver, which may likely to cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the serum lipid profiles indicated that the CPO was more beneficial than the EAO and HPO in lowering the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase contents, and increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol content.

The structure, morphology, and texture of DOX-loaded NPs were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The initial burst release of DOX-loaded NPs was controlled by the presence and chain length of fatty acids. In vitro cytotoxicity studies with three cancer cell lines (A549, HT-29, and PANC-1) suggested that fattigation-platform NPs have distinctive cytotoxic effects compared to Doxil. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry exhibited that the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded NPs was varied by the different chain lengths of fatty acids.

Because peroxisomes consume oxygen for H2O2 production and are induced by WY-14,643 treatment, it is possible that peroxisomal beta-oxidation can account for some of this increase in cellular respiration. Therefore, cyanide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, was infused into livers of WY-14,643-fed rats (0.1% WY-14,643 in laboratory rat chow for 1, 21, and 105 days) to assess peroxisomal cyanide-insensitive respiration. As expected, the addition of cyanide abolished oxygen uptake nearly completely; however, after approximately 20 min oxygen consumption unexpectedly returned to basal levels in 105-day WY-14,643-treated animals but not in untreated controls. Urea synthesis, a process dependent upon ATP, was decreased and remained low during cyanide infusion in livers from both groups, indicating that mitochondria were not responsible for this unusual increase in oxygen uptake in the presence of cyanide. Methanol metabolism, which requires oxygen to form H2O2, was decreased from 37 +/- 5 to 6 +/- 1 micromol/g/hr in all groups treated with cyanide; however, it was increased significantly about 20 min later to 25 micromol/g/hr in livers from WY-14,643-treated rats, indicating that oxygen for peroxisomal H2O2 production is involved in cellular respiration in the presence of cyanide. Fasting abolished the recovery of both oxygen uptake and methanol metabolism in WY-14,643-fed rats, suggesting that ATP for acyl CoA synthetase, an enzyme which metabolizes fatty acids to acyl CoA compounds, is provided by . Indeed, oleate significantly increased methanol metabolism in fed control rats from 8 +/- 4 to 26 +/- 3 micromol/g/hr in the presence of cyanide, indicating that fatty  supply is necessary for peroxisomal respiration.

We aimed to investigate the contribution of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein secretion in primary mouse and human hepatocytes.We used highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of DGAT1 and DGAT2, and we tracked storage and secretion of lipids synthesized de novo from [(3)H]acetic  and from exogenously supplied [(3)H]. Inactivation of individual DGAT activity did not affect incorporation of either radiolabeled precursor into intracellular triacylglycerol, whereas combined inactivation of both DGATs severely attenuated triacylglycerol synthesis. However, inhibition of DGAT2 augmented fatty  oxidation, whereas inhibition of DGAT1 increased triacylglycerol secretion, suggesting preferential channeling of separate DGAT-derived triacylglycerol pools to distinct metabolic pathways. Inactivation of DGAT2 impaired cytosolic lipid droplet expansion, whereas DGAT1 inactivation promoted large lipid droplet formation. Moreover, inactivation of DGAT2 attenuated expression of lipogenic genes. Finally, triacylglycerol secretion was significantly reduced on DGAT2 inhibition without altering extracellular apolipoprotein B levels.Our data suggest that DGAT1 and DGAT2 can compensate for each other to synthesize triacylglycerol, but triacylglycerol synthesized by DGAT1 is preferentially channeled to oxidation, whereas DGAT2 synthesizes triacylglycerol destined for very low-density lipoprotein assembly.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28668514>Photocatalytic study and superparamagnetic nature of Zn-doped MgFeO colloidal size nanocrystals prepared by solvothermal reflux method.</a></h2><p>Biocompatible MgZnFeO (x=0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 & 0.8) nanoparticles were synthesized by solvothermal reflux method.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of palmitic  (C16:0) or  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with palmitic  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic palmitic and  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells.

Oleate protects from palmitate-induced apoptosis and variation of NAMPT and NAD levels. Palmitate-induced cell stress leads to an increase of NAMPT mRNA and accumulation in the supernatant.

Dietary intake of  elevates circulating levels of OEA in humans by increasing substrate availability for OEA biosynthesis. Numerous clinical studies demonstrate a beneficial relationship between high- diets and body composition, with emerging evidence to suggest OEA may mediate this response through modulation of lipid metabolism and energy intake. OEA exposure has been shown to stimulate fatty  uptake, lipolysis, and β-oxidation, and also promote food intake control. Future research on high- diets and body composition is warranted to confirm these outcomes and elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which  exerts its biological effects.

This study aimed to evaluate the osthole suppressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease effects in  (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis and if it can modulate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. FL83B cells were pretreated with OA (250μΜ) for 24h, and then added different concentrations of osthole (3-100μM) for 24h. Subsequently, lipolysis and transcription factors of  and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase proteins were measured. In addition, cells with OA-induced steatosis were HO-stimulated, and then incubated with osthole to evaluated if it could suppress its progression to steatohepatitis. Osthole significantly enhanced glycerol release and lipolysis protein expression. Osthole also promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinases and increased the activity of triglyceride lipase and hormone- sensitive lipase. Osthole suppressed the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and decreased the malondialdehyde concentration in FL83B cells with OA-induced steatosis that were treated with HO. These results suggest that osthole might suppress nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by decreasing lipid accumulation, and through its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects via blocked NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Treatment with the PARP1 inhibitor PJ34 and transfection with PARP1 small interfering RNA both prevented the -induced impairment of the  signaling pathway. Furthermore, treatment with PJ34 reversed the -induced decrease in intracellular NAD concentration, while exogenous NAD protected cells against -induced  insensitivity. Combined NAD and PJ34 administration did not enhance the effects obtained by treatment with either NAD or PJ34 alone. Interestingly, when cells were treated with the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527, the protective effects of PJ34 and NAD treatment were diminished.

Scarcity of identified marker-trait associations is a major limitation toward development of successful marker-assisted breeding programs in safflower. In the present study, a safflower panel (CartAP) comprising 124 accessions derived from two core collections was assayed for its suitability for association mapping. Genotyping of CartAP using microsatellite markers revealed significant genetic diversity indicated by Shannon information index ( = 0.7537) and Nei's expected heterozygosity ( = 0.4432). In Principal Coordinate Analysis, the CartAP accessions were distributed homogeneously in all quadrants indicating their diverse nature. Distance-based Neighbor Joining analysis did not delineate the CartAP accessions in consonance with their geographical origin. Bayesian analysis of population structure of CartAP demonstrated the unstructured nature of the association panel. Kinship analysis at population ( ) and individual level ( ) revealed absence of or weak relatedness between the CartAP accessions. The above parameters established the suitability of CartAP for association mapping.

In lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density, the carnivorous transfer exogenous palmitic non-polar triglycerides. The herbivorous also transfer palmitic non-polar triglycerides though synthesized by hepatocytes from glucose endogenically. In herbivorous, transferring of palmitic non-polar triglycerides prior to synthesis of insulin is forming apoB-100 in composition of lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density. The hydrolysis of palmitic non-polar triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density is activated by hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-III; cells absorb lipoproteins of low density by means of apoB-100 endocytosis.

At later stages of phylogenesis insulin formed fatty acids transferring in form of  triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density of the same name without forming of  lipoproteins of low density; the electrophoregram of lipoproteins reﬂects absence of hepatic glycerol hydrogenase. In phylogenesis three types of fatty acids transferring to triglycerides in composition of lipoproteins formed sequentially: 1) chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low and density + lipoproteins of low density; 2) lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density; 3) only in lipoproteins of very low density. The frst one is specifc to piscivorous (carnivorous) while living in ocean. The second one is implemented by herbivorous while they didn't begin to synthesize insulin and hepatocytes not yet transform all endogenous palmitic fatty  into  fatty .

The aphysiological induction by substrate, surplus of palmitic fatty acids in food initiate negative alterations in composition of lipoproteins in opposite direction than in case of phylogenesis. When homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begins to misuse carnivorous (meat) food then instead of normolipoproteinemia in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins one can initially detect transitory hyperlipoproteinemia type IV and then prolonged hyperlipoproteinemia type IIb. If patient factually passes on to carnivorous diet then hyperlipoproteinemia type V is developing. If content of exogenous palmitic fatty  in food surpasses physiological capacities of its transferring in  triglycerides as palmitoyl-oleyl-palmitate glycerol, palmitic triglycerides as oleyl-palmitoyl-palmitate glycerol begin to form and epigenetically aphysiological non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density → lipoproteins of low density are formed. Their circulation in blood is a cause of hypertriglyceridemia, higher level of cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density, compensatory increasing of apoC-III.

However, the mRNA levels of adiponectin and interleukin-10 (IL-10), two adipose-derived adipocytokines with anti-inflammatory effects, were greatly enhanced (P < 0.05) by 2 mmol/L glycine. Compared with non-treated controls, 10 μmol/L isoproterenol significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the intracellular lipid and triglyceride contents induced by  in Hela and HepG2 cells. mRNA level of fatty  synthase (FASN), a gene involved in fatty  synthesis, was significantly reduced (P < 0.05), while that for ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase), genes involved in lipolysis were significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) by isoproterenol. However,  induced the accumulation of intracellular triglyceride and lipid contents were not affected by glycine. In conclusion, glycine exposure enhanced the mRNA levels of adipose-derived adiponectin and IL-10 without affecting adipogenesis and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings provide a possible explanation for the anti- and anti-diabetic effects of glycine that were previously reported in animal models. More studies are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for this regulatory effect of glycine on anti-inflammatory adipocytokines expression in both in vitro and in vivo models.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054773>Fresh and stored copra meal in meat quail diets.</a></h2><p>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the addition of fresh and stored copra meal to the diet of meat quails. Two hundred eighty-seven-day-old male and female quails were distributed in a completely randomized design, with five treatments, in a 2 × 2 + 1factorial arrangement. Two copra meal types (fresh and stored) at inclusion levels of 12.5% and 25%, respectively, were added to a corn-soybean meal-based diet, with seven replicates, of eight quails each. Copra meal acidity index recorded  percentage increase from 0.47 to 3.03% after six storage months. However, regardless of storage type, its addition to quails' diet resulted in higher values of metabolizable energy, in lower feed intake and better feed conversion than corn-soybean meal diet. Copra meal addition to quails' diet did not affect carcass traits, liver and pancreas relative , and bone growth and quality.

Fisetin has also been demonstrated to have anti-obesity properties in mice. However, the effect of fisetin on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still elusive. Thus, the present study evaluated whether fisetin improves hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and regulates lipid metabolism of FL83B hepatocytes in vitro.NAFLD was induced by HFD in male C57BL/6 mice. The mice were then injected intraperitoneally with fisetin for 10 weeks. In another experiment, FL83B cells were challenged with  to induce lipid accumulation and treated with various concentrations of fisetin.NAFLD mice treated with fisetin had decreased  and epididymal adipose tissue  compared to NAFLD mice. Fisetin treatment also reduced liver lipid droplet and hepatocyte steatosis, alleviated serum free fatty , and leptin concentrations, significantly decreased fatty  synthase, and significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα and the production of sirt-1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in the liver tissue. In vitro, fisetin decreased lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.This study suggests that fisetin is a potential novel treatment for alleviating hepatic lipid metabolism and improving NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK and β-oxidation pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

BBB permeation was determined by calculation of a BBB  percentage (Pi) from brain/blood concentrations. The PiS of Evan's blue, which does not permeate the intact BBB, and 4TMA-AP were not significantly different in rats without known BBB disruption, suggesting a lack of 4TMA-AP permeation through the intact BBB. When MD probes were slowly implanted into the frontal cortex, 4TMA-AP PiS were usually zero. Intracarotid  injection to open the BBB significantly increased 4TMA-AP PiS, suggesting that 4TMA-AP entered brain ECF when the BBB was compromised. Rapid probe implantation produced increased 4TMA-AP PiS, suggesting BBB disruption.

Levels of growth hormone (GH) are elevated in T1D, which aggravates both hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. The hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) regulates the release of GH by the pituitary but also exerts separate actions on peripheral GHRH receptors, the functional role of which remains elusive in T1D. In a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D, GHRH receptor expression was found to be up-regulated in the distal small intestine, a tissue involved in chylomicron synthesis. Treatment of T1D rats with a GHRH antagonist, MIA-602, at a dose that did not affect plasma GH levels, significantly reduced TRL, as well as markers of renal injury, and improved endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) reduces hyperglucagonemia and postprandial TRL, the latter in part through a decreased synthesis of apolipoprotein B-48 (ApoB-48) by intestinal cells. Although plasma GLP-1 levels were elevated in diabetic animals, this was accompanied by increased rather than reduced glucagon levels, suggesting impaired GLP-1 signaling. Treatment with MIA-602 normalized GLP-1 and glucagon to control levels in T1D rats. MIA-602 also decreased secretion of ApoB-48 from rat intestinal epithelial cells in response to  stimulation in vitro, in part through a GLP-1-dependent mechanism. Our findings support the hypothesis that antagonizing the signaling of GHRH in T1D may improve GLP-1 function in the small intestine, which, in turn, diminishes TRL and reduces renal and vascular complications.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3114584>Effects of phorbol esters, A23187 and vasopressin on oleate metabolism in isolated rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Studies were conducted to compare the metabolic effects of vasopressin, 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and A23187 on ketogenesis and oleate metabolism in isolated hepatocytes from fed rats. Vasopressin inhibited the formation of -soluble products from [1-14C]oleate (0.25 mM, 0.5 mM and 1 mM), the inhibition being most marked at low (0.25 mM) concentration of oleate. Conversion of [1-14C]oleate into 14CO2 and esterified products was stimulated by vasopressin. The stimulatory effect of this hormone on 14CO2 production was most marked at high (1 mM) concentration of oleate, whereas that on [1-14C]oleate esterification was most marked at low (0.25 mM) concentration of oleate. These vasopressin actions were abolished when hepatocytes were incubated in the absence of calcium in the medium. Our results strongly suggest that both increase in esterification and increase in oxidation to CO2 contribute to the anti-ketogenic action of vasopressin when oleate is added as substrate, although the relative extent of their contribution varies according to the oleate concentration. The anti-ketogenic action of vasopressin was mimicked by PMA but not by A23187. PMA also caused a stimulation of [1-14C]oleate esterification although the effect was diminished at 1 mM [1-14C]oleate. A23187 failed to affect [1-14C]oleate esterification. The metabolic effects of PMA were elicited in the absence of extracellular calcium, too. Conversion of [1-14C]oleate into 14CO2 was only slightly increased by both PMA and A23187 when 1 mM [1-14C]oleate was added as substrate.

Enhanced incretin release may have beneficial metabolic effects. However, dietary fat may promote  gain and should therefore be restricted in obesity. We designed C4-dietary oil (1,3-di-butyryl-2-oleoyl glycerol) as a 2-oleoyl glycerol (2-OG)-generating fat type, which would stimulate incretin release to the same extent while providing less calories than equimolar amounts of common triglycerides, e.g., olive oil.We studied the effect over 180 min of (a) 19 g olive oil plus 200 g carrot, (b) 10.7 g C4 dietary oil plus 200 g carrot and (c) 200 g carrot, respectively, on plasma responses of gut and pancreatic hormones in 13 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Theoretically, both oil meals result in formation of 7.7 g 2-OG during digestion.Both olive oil and C4-dietary oil resulted in greater postprandial (P ≤ 0.01) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses (incremental area under curve (iAUC)): iAUC: 645 ± 194 and 702 ± 97 pM × min; iAUC: 4,338 ± 764 and 2,894 ± 601 pM × min) compared to the carrot meal (iAUC: 7 ± 103 pM × min; iAUC: 266 ± 234 pM × min). iAUC for GLP-1 and GIP were similar for C4-dietary oil and olive oil, although olive oil resulted in a higher peak value for GIP than C4-dietary oil.C4-dietary oil enhanced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP to almost the same extent as olive oil, in spite of liberation of both 2-OG and , which also may stimulate incretin secretion, from olive oil.

In the present work, it was found that in a [Cd(OA)2 + Se[double bond, length as m-dash]P(C8H17)3 + HPPh2 + HY] mixture, HY behaves as a mediator for the formation of the initial kind of monomer, besides as a hydrogen/proton donor in the release of  and as an accelerant in the Se-P bond cleavage, which follows the mechanism of hydrogen-shift/nucleophilic-attack. The capability of the HY additive to provide a H-source decreases in the order SePPh2H > RSH > HPPh2 > ROH > RNH2, while the performance of HY to accelerate Se-P bond cleavage decreases in the order HPPh2 > RSH > RNH2 > ROH. The capacity of HY to promote the formation of the Ph2P-SeCd-Y monomer decreases in the order RSH > HPPh2 > ROH > RNH2, while the effect of HY to drive the formation of the Ph2P-SeCdSe-Y monomer decreases in the order HPPh2 > RSH > RNH2 > ROH. The activation strain  plays a key role in both the Se-P and H-Y bond cleavage, which correlates negatively to the size of the coordinated atom radius. When only HPPh2 is present without other HY species (HY = RNH2, or RSH, or ROH), Ph2P-SeCdSe-PPh2 is preferentially formed.

Rat hepatocyte cells were subjected to  in different concentrations (1.2-2.4 mM) for 24 hours. The cell morphological injury index and the changes in the MAPK/TLR4 signaling pathway-related proteins were evaluated. We found that the microstructure of the cells in the  treatment group was damaged, and higher phosphorylation levels of the MAPK pathway-related proteins were detected than those in the control group. In addition, the protein expression of TLR4, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, and   synthase were increased in the  treatment group. Our findings demonstrate that  causes toxic damage to rat hepatocyte cells, and the MAPK/TLR4 signaling pathway plays a significant role in lipid storage.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760667>Systematic Analysis of Selective Bactericidal Activity of Fatty Acids against Staphylococcus aureus with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration.</a></h2><p>Bacterial flora on the skin surface contains Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) which causes rough skin and atopic dermatitis and enhances innate , respectively. In this study, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated for six saturated fatty acids and two unsaturated fatty acids against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The antimicrobial behavior in the liquid medium was categorized into three groups. The first was the selective antibacterial activity group comprising myristic  (C14:0 fatty ), palmitoleic  (C16:1 fatty ), and  (C18:1 fatty ) and preferentially displayed antimicrobial activity for S. aureus (group 1). C16:1 fatty  displayed high antimicrobial activity only for S. aureus. The second was the non-selective antibacterial activity group which displayed antibacterial activity for both Staphylococci (group 2). Caprylic  (C8:0 fatty ), capric  (C10:0 fatty ), and lauric  (C12:0 fatty ) comprised group 2. The third was the nonantibacterial activity group which did not show significant antimicrobial activity (group 3). Bactericidal activities were confirmed for C12:0 fatty  and C16:1 fatty  by evaluating the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) on the agar medium. C12:0 fatty  displayed non-selective bactericidal behavior against S. aureus and S. epidermidis when the fatty  concentration was above 250 μg mL.

Alteration in cardiac fat may affect cardiac  and contribute to heart dysfunction. We previously observed a link between alteration in pericardial fat (PAT) and local adverse effects on myocardial fibrosis in obese minipigs. This study investigated the role of PAT on cardiac  and mitochondrial function, and elucidated a potential mechanism for PAT in cardiac fibrosis.Five-month-old Lee-Sung minipigs were made obese by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 months. The conditioned medium from PAT of obese minipigs (PAT-CM) was collected and H9C2 cells were treated with it to study mechanisms.HFD caused a cardiac  deficit and fibrosis in the left ventricle. An elevated content of IL6 and malondialdehyde was found in the PAT of obese pigs. Obese pigs exhibited an increased level of  and a reduced level of saturated fatty acids in PAT compared to control pigs. HFD did not alter the metabolic characteristics of epicardial fat. PAT-CM caused apoptosis of H9C2 cells and inhibited basal mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Protein expressions for mitochondrial dynamics- (Mfn2, Opa1, Drp1, and Fis1) and a mitophagy-related protein (Parkin) were suppressed by PAT-CM. PAT-CM enhanced the protein expression of LC3II, and the ratio of LC3II/LC3I. To conclude, PAT was involved in cardiac fibrosis of HFD-fed minipigs. The secretomes of PAT impaired mitochondrial functions and caused cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a paracrine manner.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation.

Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with  and palmitic  increased lipogenesis and the content of different fatty acids. CeONPs reduced palmitic and stearic  and most fatty acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced fatty  content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in fatty  metabolism, thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603076>Effects of Rhizoma Alismatis extract on biochemical indices and adipose gene expression in -induced hepatocyte injury in Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

We investigated the metabolic fate of OLE in pig enterocytes at birth (d0) and after 2 d of suckling (d2). Cellular TG and phospholipids (PL) and FA composition were analyzed. Metabolic end-products of [1-¹⁴C]OLE were measured in enterocyte incubations. We characterized intestinal carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the key enzyme of mitochondrial FA oxidation. The TG content was 6.6-fold higher in enterocytes from pigs on d 2 than in those obtained on d 0, whereas the PL content did not differ. The level of OLE in TG and PL increased from 15 and 11% of total FA, respectively, in enterocytes from newborn piglets to 30 and 17%, respectively, in those from d2 pigs. The capacity for OLE utilization was 2.8-fold greater in d2 than in d0 pig enterocytes. The oxidation and esterification rates were enhanced in enterocytes from piglets on d 2 compared to those obtained on d 0, by 4- and 2.6-fold, respectively. The predominant OLE fate was the esterification pathway, representing >85% of OLE metabolized in both groups. The limited OLE oxidation observed at d 2 may result from the presence of a highly malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPT1A, because the half maximal inhibitory concentration for malonyl-CoA was 162 ± 25 nmol/L.

Initially, 0.4 mM  and 0.2 mM palmitate were added to the growth media of HepG2 and LO2 cells for 72 hours. We discovered increased Higd1a expression, and knocking down Higd1a impaired mitochondrial transmembrane potential and induced cell apoptosis. We then identified that elevated reactive  species (ROS) is responsible for increased Higd1a expression. Furthermore, we found that ROS promoted Higd1a expression by upregulating HIF-1a and PGC-1a expressions, and these two proteins could exert synergistic effects in inducing Higd1a expression.

The metabolism of FFA, TG, and glucose, in parallel with long-term cell survival in the absence of serum, was investigated in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines and in nontransformed MCF-10A cells after treatment with exogenous oleate. Short-term (3-24 h) exposure of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells to exogenous oleate resulted in a dose-dependent long-term (10 day) serum-free survival that correlated with the accumulation of TG in lipid droplets and with upregulation of lipolysis.

Several studies indicate that dietary protein reduction during the growing-finishing period of pigs enhances IMF content, but its consequence on carcass fat deposition is still contradictory. In this study, we hypothesized that the effects of reduced protein diets (RPD), corrected or not with the limiting amino  lysine, on subcutaneous fat deposition from pigs with distinct genotypes are mediated by adipose membranes biophysical properties. In total, 36 crossbred (Large White×Landrace×Pietrain - a lean genotype) and purebred (Alentejana breed - a fatty genotype) male pigs were randomly assigned to the control group, the RPD group or the reduced protein diet equilibrated for lysine (RPDL) group, allowing a 2×3 factorial arrangement (n=6). Backfat thickness and total fatty  content were higher in Alentejana relative to crossbred pigs. Although dietary treatments did not change backfat thickness, RPD and RPDL increased total fatty acids content of subcutaneous fat. In order to understand this effect, adipose tissue membranes isolated from pig's subcutaneous fat were assayed for glycerol permeability and fluidity, using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-(4-(trimethylamino)-phenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) probes. The glycerol transport across adipose membranes was not mediated by aquaglyceroporins and remained unchanged across dietary groups. Regardless of lysine correction, RPD increased membrane fluidity at the hydrocarbon region (lower DPH fluorescence anisotropy) in both genotypes of pigs. This result was associated with a lower ratio between  and linoleic  on membrane's fatty  composition. Adipose membrane's cholesterol content was independent from genotype and diet. Taken together, the present study shows that dietary protein reduction is successful in maintaining backfat thickness, although a negative side effect was observed on total fatty acids in subcutaneous fat, which may be due to changes in the fluidity of adipose membranes.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29628230>Chitosan stabilized nasal emulsion delivery system for effective humoral and cellular response against recombinant tetravalent dengue antigen.</a></h2><p>Nasal vaccine delivery systems are emerging alternatives to the conventional sub unit vaccine delivery systems owing to their ability to stimulate potent antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Additional virtue of nasal delivery is its close proximity of immune cells to external epithelial layer which is the route of entry to pathogens.

Proving the hypothesis, emulsion when immunized along with recombinant tetravalent dengue antigen has elicited a profound antigen specific humoral and cellular response. Antigen cross presenting and sustained release of antigen by emulsion is the key factor in shaping this immune response. Moreover, the dose sparing effect of emulsion has also been proven which has a crucial role in modern day vaccine delivery.

The levels of glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic  (AsA) in lenses with selenite‑induced cataracts declined to one‑third of that of controls, and the reduction in GSH and AsA levels was rescued following hesperetin, Hes‑S or Hes‑O treatment, with concentrations remaining to 70‑80% of that of controls. However, there were no changes in the plasma levels of GSH and AsA following treatments. Administration of either hesperetin or hesperetin‑derived compounds prevented the reduction of chaperone activity in the lens, and rats treated with Hes‑S or Hes‑O treatment had significantly greater chaperone activity than hesperetin‑treated rats.

Evaluating the hazards associated with TiO2 NPs is crucial as it enables risk assessment related to human and environmental exposure. In this study the in vitro human toxicity of a set of TiO2 NPs modified with acetic,  and boric  were studied in order to assess the hazard in view of a future scale-up of the synthesis. The surface reactivity of the powders under simulated solar illumination and in the dark has been evaluated by means of EPR spectroscopy. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) have been chosen as a model for lung epithelium. Cytotoxicity has been assessed by measuring the cells membrane integrity by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and the inflammatory response evaluated as nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α production, and oxidative stress measured as intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, and induced lipoperoxidation. Aeroxide P25 was used for comparison. The results demonstrated a low photoreactivity and toxic effects lower than Aeroxide P25 of the nano-TiO2 powders, probably as a consequence of the presence of acidic moieties at the surface.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in FFAs accumulation and its modulation could drive the development of potential therapies for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of picroside II, a phytoactive found in , on fatty  accumulation vis-à-vis silibinin, a known hepatoprotective phytoactive from .HepG2 cells were loaded with FFAs (:palmitic /2:1) for 20 hours to mimic hepatic steatosis. The FFAs concentration achieving maximum fat accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity (500 μM) was standardized. HepG2 cells were exposed to the standardized FFAs concentration with and without picroside II pretreatment.Picroside II pretreatment inhibited FFAs-induced lipid accumulation by attenuating the expression of fatty  transport protein 5, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Preatreatment with picroside II was also found to decrease the expression of forkhead box protein O1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.These findings suggest that picroside II effectively attenuated fatty  accumulation by decreasing FFAs uptake and lipogenesis.

During the development of obesity and NAFLD, mitochondria adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of fatty  oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing inflammation. Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than  loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO-OA and the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment, liver  and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic fatty acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by obesity, without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we used transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 to gain a genome-wide view of the mechanisms of environmental-friendly biopolymers accumulation under nitrogen-limiting conditions during conversion of metabolically different carbon sources (sodium gluconate and ). Transcriptomic data revealed that phaG expression is associated with medium-chain-length-PHAs' synthesis not only on sodium gluconate but also on , suggesting that PhaG may play a role in this process, as well. Moreover, genes involved in the β-oxidation pathway were induced in the PHAs production phase when sodium gluconate was supplied as the only carbon and  source. The transition from exponential growth to stationary phase caused a significant expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism,  supply, and transport system.

Dietary intakes of participants without T2D (n=2,139) were assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire. To assess the risk of T2D after 6 years of follow-up, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Three major dietary fat patterns were: (1) high amounts of dietary cholesterol, saturated fats, , linoleic , linolenic , and trans fats; (2) high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fats; and (3) high amounts of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats.

The diets contained 30% energy as fat of which 2/3 was either corn oil or beef tallow with and without 115 mg/4.2 MJ of supplemental cholesterol in the form of cooked egg yolk. The susceptibility of LDL to oxidation was assessed during a challenge with hemin and hydrogen peroxide, and results are expressed as lag time to oxidation in minutes. Addition of moderate amounts of cholesterol to either the corn oil or beef tallow enriched diet resulted in increased susceptibility of LDL to oxidation (decreased lag time): 69+/-22 min versus 96+/-24 min in the corn oil diet with versus without supplemental cholesterol, respectively, P = 0.006; 82+/-20 min versus 96+/-26 min in the beef tallow diet with versus without supplemental cholesterol, respectively, P = 0.025.

We identify an age-dependent lipid homeostasis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates the mobilization of lipids from the soma to the germline, which supports fecundity but at the cost of survival in nutrient-poor and oxidative stress environments. This trade-off is responsive to the levels of dietary carbohydrates and organismal  and is coupled to activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1 in both laboratory-derived and natural isolates of C. elegans. The homeostatic balance of lipid stores between the somatic and germ cells is mediated by arachidonic  (omega-6) and eicosapentaenoic  (omega-3) precursors of eicosanoid signaling molecules.

It showed anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties in mice with acute lung injuries and regulated lipid metabolism through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes. However, the effects of licochalcone A on reducing  gain and improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. Thus, the present study investigated whether licochalcone A ameliorated  loss and lipid metabolism in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and NAFLD, and then were injected intraperitoneally with licochalcone A. In another experiment, a fatty liver cell model was established by incubating HepG2 hepatocytes with  and treating the cells with licochalcone A to evaluate lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrated that HFD-induced obese mice treated with licochalcone A had decreased  as well as inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue  compared with HFD-treated mice. Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased liver tissue  and lipid droplet accumulation in liver tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of lipogenesis and fatty  synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce fatty  chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes. Licochalcone A can potentially ameliorate obesity and NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolism', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24275089>Monascin and ankaflavin act as natural AMPK activators with PPARα agonist activity to down-regulate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6 mice.</a></h2><p>Yellow pigments monascin (MS) and ankaflavin (AK) are secondary metabolites derived from Monascus-fermented products.

Our aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms and the associated biomarkers of this progression, focusing on severe phenotypes, using transcriptomics and metabolomics.Twenty-five subjects were included in the study. Plasma samples were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Individuals were classified in four groups-"nonallergic," "mild," "moderate," and "severe"-based on their clinical history, their response to an oral challenge test with profilin, and after a refinement using a mathematical metabolomic model. PBMCs were used for microarray analysis.We found a set of transcripts and metabolites that were specific for the "severe" phenotype. By metabolomics, a decrease in carbohydrates and pyruvate and an increase in lactate were detected, suggesting aerobic glycolysis. Other metabolites were incremented in "severe" group: lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine-1-phosphate, and lauric, myristic, palmitic, and  fatty acids. On the other hand, carnitines were decreased along severity. Significant transcripts in the "severe" group were found to be downregulated and were associated with platelet functions, protein synthesis, histone modification, and fatty  metabolism.We have found evidence that points to the association of severe allergic  with platelet functions alteration, together with reduced protein synthesis, and switch of immune cells to aerobic glycolysis.© 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Therefore, when assessing the pathological significance of ER stress, it is important to monitor and quantify ER stress levels. Here, we have established a novel system to monitor ER stress levels quickly and sensitively, and using this method, we have clarified the effect of differences in glucose concentration and various fatty acids on the ER of pancreatic β cells. First, we developed a cell system that secretes Gaussia luciferase in culture medium depending on the activation of the GRP78 promoter.

Myoblasts were cultured and differentiated to myotubes from satellite cells isolated from biopsy of musculus vastus lateralis. FA metabolism was studied in myotubes using [C]. Lipid distribution was assessed by thin layer chromatography, and FA accumulation, lipolysis and re-esterification were measured by scintillation proximity assay. Gene and protein expressions were studied. Myotubes from athletic subjects showed lower FA accumulation, lower incorporation of FA into total lipids, triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester, higher TAG-related lipolysis and re-esterification, and higher complete oxidation and incomplete β-oxidation of FA compared to myotubes from sedentary subjects. mRNA expression of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III gene UQCRB was higher in cells from athletic compared to sedentary.

One lysosome-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathway is mediated by a lysosome-associated fatty  binding protein LBP-8 in Caenorhabditis elegans. LBP-8 shuttles lysosomal lipids into the nucleus to activate lipid regulated nuclear receptors NHR-49 and NHR-80 and consequently promote longevity.

The treatment of the cells with  increased reactive  species (ROS) generation and expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), decreased expression of uncoupling protein 2, and decreased mitochondrial content and markers of biogenesis. The treatment with 1-10 μM polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, cyanidin, kuromanin, and berberine), as well as phenolic degradation products (caffeic , protocatechuic , and 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde), all protected by more than 50% against the  induced increase in ROS. In other mechanisms involved, the polyphenols except anthocyanins strongly prevented or reversed the effect on mitochondrial content/biogenesis, increased expression of manganese superoxide dismutase, and prevented the large increase in TNF-α expression. Most polyphenols also prevented the decrease in uncoupling protein 2. The anthocyanins were unique in decreasing ROS generation without inducing mitochondrial biogenesis or manganese superoxide dismutase expression.While different polyphenols similarly decreased cellular ROS in this model of steatosis, they differed in their ability to suppress TNF-α expression and induce mitochondrial biogenesis and content.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Different effects of the fatty acids were observed. Supplementation with naturally occurring fatty acids (linolenic, linoleic, , palmitoleic ), which may become metabolically incorporated into sperm lipids, increased the number of motile and progressively motile sperm after 2 days of storage during a thermo-resistance test (5 h at 38 °C) to that of control samples preserved at 17 °C in pure Beltsville Thawing Solution. With the exception of linolenic , all naturally occurring fatty acids enhanced the number of sperm with active  after 3 days of storage.

This is the first well-defined study that manages to correlate NPh grafting density with CT numbers and water dispersibility, laying the groundwork for the development of the next generation CT-guided diagnostic and/or theranostic materials.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30095299>High-fat diet overfeeding promotes nondetrimental  steatosis in female mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD) feeding or leptin-deficient mice are extensively used as models resembling features of human nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The concurrence of experimental factors as fat content and source or total caloric intake leads to prominent differences in the development of the hepatic steatosis and related disturbances. In this work, we characterized the hepatic lipid accumulation induced by HFD in wild-type (WT) and ob/ ob mice with the purpose of differentiating adaptations to HFD from those specific of increased overfeeding due to leptin deficiency-associated hyperphagia. Given that most published works have been done in male models, we used female mice with the aim of increasing the body of evidence regarding NAFLD in female subjects. HFD promoted  lipid accumulation only in the hyperphagic strain. Nevertheless, a decrease of lipid droplet-associated cholesteryl ester (CE) in both WT and obese animals was observed. These changes were accompanied by an improvement in the profile of lipoproteins that transport cholesterol and  function markers in plasma from ob/ ob mice and a lower hepatic index. Using primary hepatocytes from female mice, overaccumulation of CE induced by 0.4 mM  reversed in the presence of a specific Takeda G protein-coupled bile  receptor agonist. Nevertheless, hepatocytes from male mice were not responsive. This study suggests that enterohepatic circulation of bile acids might be one of the factors that can affect sex dimorphism in NAFLD development, which underlines the importance of including female models in the NAFLD research field. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This work provides new insight into the use of high-fat diet as a model to induce nonalcoholic  disease in wild-type and ob/ ob female mice. We show that high-fat diet induces steatosis only in ob/ ob mice while, surprisingly, several health indicators improve. Noteworthy, experiments with primary hepatocytes from male and female mice show that they express Takeda G protein-coupled bile  receptor and that it and bile  enterohepatic circulation might be accountable for sex dimorphism in nonalcoholic  disease development.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678374>Yeast Smell Like What They Eat: Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds of  in Growth Media Supplemented with Different Lipids.</a></h2><p> is part of the human skin .

Some compounds previously reported for  (γ-dodecalactone, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, and hexan-1-ol) were also found. Through our experiments, using univariate and multivariate unsupervised (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and supervised (Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)) statistical techniques, we have proven that each tested growth medium stimulates the production of a different volatiles profile in . Carbon dioxide, hexan-1-ol, pentyl acetate, isomer5 of methyldecane, dimethyl sulphide, undec-5-ene, isomer2 of methylundecane, isomer1 of methyldecane, and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran were established as differentiating compounds among treatments by all the techniques.

Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) are closely associated with blood lipid metabolism as well as many diseases including metabolic syndrome. This study is to investigate whether mangiferin has effects on FFA metabolism in hyperlipidemic rats. Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet and administered mangiferin simultaneously for 6 weeks. Mangiferin (50, 100, 150 mg/kg BW) decreased dose-dependently FFA and triglycerides (TG) levels in plasma, and their accumulations in liver, but increased the β-hydroxybutyrate levels in both plasma and liver of hyperlipidemic rats. HepG2 cells were treated with  (OA, 0.2 mmol/L) to simulate the condition of high level of plasma FFA in vitro, and were treated with different concentrations of mangiferin simultaneously for 24 h. We found that mangiferin significantly increased FFA uptake, significantly decreased intracellular FFA and TG accumulations in HepG2 cells. Mangiferin significantly increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and its downstream proteins involved in fatty  translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), but significantly decreased acyl-CoA: diacylgycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) expression and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity by increasing its phosphorylation level in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Furthermore, these effects were reversed by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor in HepG2 cells. For upstream of AMPK, mangiferin increased AMP/ATP ratio, but had no effect on LKB1 phosphorylation. In conclusion, mangiferin decreased plasma FFA levels through promoting FFA uptake and oxidation, inhibiting FFA and TG accumulations by regulating the key enzymes expression in liver through AMPK pathway. Therefore, mangiferin is a possible beneficial natural compound for metabolic syndrome by improving FFA metabolism.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631760>Changes of the Fatty  Profile in Erythrocyte Membranes of Patients following 6-Month Dietary Intervention Aimed at the Regression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to the metabolism disorders of fatty acids. The pathogenesis of the disease includes an increased concentration of FFA in blood, an increase in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, and disorders in the process of -oxidation.The aim of the study was to analyze the fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes among 55 patients with NAFLD who were subjected to a 6-month dietary intervention in order to reduce fatty liver.Basic anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed. The profile of fatty acids was measured in the membranes of erythrocytes and analyzed by gas chromatography. The dietary compliance was evaluated using 72-diary questionnaires, anthropometric measurements.With the reduction of fatty liver (p<0.01), the patients' biochemical and anthropometric parameters were significantly improved. A significant decrease in the concentration of alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01) and asparagine aminotransferase (p<0.01) was observed, along with a decrease in the amount of  (p<0.05) and  (p<0.05). Significant changes in terms of the fatty  profile were observed among patients who followed the dietary intervention. There was a noticeable tendency in terms of the reduction palmitic  (p<0.055) and a significant reduction of stearic  (p<0.05). Significant changes in the profile of fatty acids were also associated with the reductionof palmitoleic (p<0.05) and  acids (p<0.05).

The ChDiPiCa showed excellent in vitro biocidal activity against MRSA at 26 μg/mL compared to the antibiotic streptomycin and bacitracin 14 μg/mL and 13 μg/mL at 10 μg concentration respectively. The membrane damaging property was confirmed by the SEM analysis. Further, we addressed the new approach for the first time to overcome antibiotic resistance of MRSA through membrane microdomain miss loading to lipids. By which, the ChDiPiCa confirms the significant activity in miss loading of FMM of MRSA which is validated by the fatty  profile and  analysis. The result shows that, altered saturated (Lauric  and Myristic ), mono unsaturated (), and poly unsaturated (Linoleic  and Linolenic ) fatty acids and hypothesises, altered the membrane functional lipids. For the better understanding of miss loading of FMM by the ChDiPiCa, the in-silico molecular docking studies was analyzed and confirmed the predicted role.

We investigated in vitro effects of various concentrations of SFA (palmitate) and UFA (, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic) acids in activation of these cells. These cells in presence of palmitate, but not UFA, exhibited time, and concentration-dependent emergence of insulin receptors, GLUT 4 expression, generation of ROS, cytokines, lipid peroxidation, and IRS-1. We conclude that both T-lymphocytes and HAEC share common characteristics in exhibiting activation of these cells to palmitate, but not to UFA, by developing insulin receptors and becoming insulin responsive tissues, a hitherto unknown response to palmitate.

Here, gold nanoparticles were synthesized by vacuum evaporation (VE) methods in ricinoleic  and , two typical unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The two solvents formed black aggregates after deposition and then shrunk and finally disappeared with the progress of time. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, nanoparticles in ricinoleic acids formed aggregates and then dispersed by time, while in  big aggregates were not observed in all timescales. From TEM images and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, the mean size of the nanoparticles was about 4 nm in both ricinoleic and  acids. UV-Vis spectra were also taken as a function of time and the results were consistent with the growth behavior presumed by TEM images. Air exposure had an influence on the behavior of the sample triggering the nanoparticle formation in both solvents. From control experiments, we discovered that  gas triggered the phenomenon and nanoparticles function as a catalyst for the oxidation of the UFAs. It stimulates the phenomenon and in ricinoleic , specifically, electrons are transferred from riconleic  to the gold nanoparticles, enhancing the surface potential of the nanoparticles and the repulsive force between their electronic double layers.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905779>Comprehensive characterization of nanostructured lipid carriers using laboratory and synchrotron X-ray scattering and diffraction.</a></h2><p>The development of lipid nanoparticles requires knowledge on the crystalline structure, polymorphic transitions and lipid-drug interactions. This study aimed at introducing advanced techniques to characterize nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) comprising palmitic , , stabilizer and Domperidone. Crystallinity of single components and mixtures was investigated by laboratory Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). NLC were studied with laboratory Small and Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (SWAXS). Photon Correlation Spectroscopy and Freeze Fracture Transmission Electron Microscopy were used to monitor particle size, zeta potential and shape. Stability of NLC was investigated using synchrotron X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and SAXS and laboratory SAXS. Palmitic  showed a lamellar structure (polymorph C), which was still present after particle preparation. Spherical 300 nm-sized particles with zeta potential values above -30 mV were obtained and Domperidone was incorporated in its amorphous form. During storage, no differences in synchrotron XRD spectra were seen. However, laboratory SAXS measurements showed a second lamellar structure, identified as polymorph B. Synchrotron SAXS temperature scans confirmed that polymorph B did not affect the morphology of the encapsulated drug or the shape of NLC.

Among a variety of assembly techniques, evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) is one of the prospective approaches because of its simplicity. Although EISA has shown its potential to form highly ordered nanocrystal arrays, the formation of uniform nanocrystal arrays over large areas remains a challenging subject. Here, we introduce a new EISA method and demonstrate the formation of large-scale highly ordered monolayers of barium titanate (BaTiO₃, BT) nanocubes at the air-water interface. In our method, the addition of an extra surfactant to a water surface assists the EISA of BT nanocubes with a size of 15⁻20 nm into a highly ordered arrangement. We reveal that the compression pressure exerted by the extra surfactant on BT nanocubes during the solvent evaporation is a key factor in the self-assembly in our method. The BT nanocube monolayers transferred to substrates have sizes up to the millimeter scale and a high out-of-plane crystal orientation, containing almost no microcracks and voids.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868595>Resource partitioning between two young-of-year cownose rays Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis within a communal nursery inferred by trophic biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Although interspecific trophic interactions plays a principal role within elasmobranch communal nurseries, little is known over variation in foraging strategies adopted by young-of-year of sympatric species. To test the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning between batoids within a communal nursery, we investigated two cownose ray species, Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis, which occur in heterospecific groups, a strategy predicted to increase survival and foraging success. Using two biochemical tracers, fatty acids (FA) and stable isotopes (δ N and δ C), the combined effects of maternal investment and the formation of heterospecific groups implying competition for, or partitioning of available food resources were investigated. Through univariate and multivariate analyses of biochemical tracers in several tissues (fin clip, muscle, liver, red blood cells; RBC) and plasma, our results revealed significant interspecific differences in tracers between the two species. Total FAs (∑saturated FA, ∑monounsaturated FA and ∑polyunsaturated FA) and trophic biomarkers (i.e., docosahexaenoic , arachidonic ,  and δ N) were the principle tracers responsible for the differences detected. These data revealed that R. brasiliensis was less enriched in physiologically important essential FAs than R. bonasus. Our findings suggest that these congeneric species differ in maternal investment strategy and moderately partition food resources over relatively fine spatial scales within a single nursery habitat to limit competition.

Due to the ineffectiveness of conventional treatments, there is growing interest in research involving compounds of natural origin. One such compound is curcumin (CUR), which has been proven to be effective against this microorganism. However, some of CUR's physicochemical properties, especially its low aqueous solubility, make the therapeutic application of this compound difficult. Thus, the incorporation of CUR in mucoadhesive liquid crystalline systems (MLCSs) for vaginal administration may be an efficient strategy for the treatment of VVC. MLCSs are capable of potentiating the compound's action, releasing it in a controlled manner, and can enable longer exposure at the site of infection. In this study, MLCSs consisting of  and ergosterol 5:1 (w/w) as the oily phase, PPG-5-CETETH-20 as the surfactant, and a polymer dispersion of 1% chitosan as the aqueous phase, were developed for the application of CUR (MLCS-CUR) in VVC treatment. The formulations were characterized by polarized light microscopy (PLM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), oscillatory rheometry, continuous shear rheometry, texture profile analysis, and in vitro mucoadhesion. In addition, the antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro, and the effects on local fungal burden and cytokine profiles were investigated in a murine model of VVC. PLM and SAXS showed that the developed formulations presented a characteristic of a microemulsion. However, after the addition of artificial vaginal mucus (AVM), PLM showed that the formulations had structures similar to the "Maltese cross" characteristic of lamellar MLCS. Mucoadhesive test results showed an increase in the mucoadhesive strength of these formulations. Rheology analyses suggested long-lasting action of the formulation at the infected site. The in vitro antimicrobial activity assays suggested that CUR possesses antifungal activity against Candida albicans, determined after its incorporation into the MLCS. Further, MLCS-CUR was also more effective in vivo in the control of vaginal infection than treatment with fluconazole. Immunological assays showed that the ratio of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β) to anti-inflammatory (TGF-β) cytokines has decreased and that there is a reduction in the number of polymorphonuclear neutrophils recruited to the vaginal lumen, showing that treatment with MLCS-CUR was effective in modulating the inflammatory reaction associated with the infection.

In the present study, we investigated whether LDL apheresis performed with different techniques affects in vitro diene formation (lag phase) and modification of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB). Baseline and posttreatment diene formation was correlated with the baseline pattern of plasma total fatty acids. We then performed a computer-simulation study to test the hypothesis that LDL apheresis-induced changes in LDL oxidizability are related to changes in the mass ratio between freshly produced and older LDL. In 19 patients aged 49+/-7 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) regularly treated with either immunoadsorption, heparin-induced LDL precipitation (HELP), or dextran sulfate (DS) adsorption, we determined lipoprotein levels, the lag phase, apoB modification, and the fatty  pattern in plasma samples drawn at the onset and termination of one LDL apheresis. LDL apheresis significantly decreased total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides by 50.4%, 14.9%, 62.6%, and 33.6%, respectively. The lag phase increased by a significant mean of 9.8%; the charge of apoB was not altered. The lag phase before treatment positively correlated with the baseline concentration of plasma total palmitic, myristic, and . The increase in the lag phase during treatment correlated with a high pretreatment concentration of lauric, linoleic, and docosahexanoic . The simulation study indicates that a temporary imbalance between two LDL compartments, one representing freshly secreted LDL and the other representing older LDL, could explain the observed increase in the lag phase after LDL apheresis. In conclusion, in patients with heterozygous FH, LDL apheresis performed with different techniques decreases the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation.

Meat samples were collected from the longissimus dorsi muscles of 1000 Hanwoo steers that were 30-month-old (progeny of 85 proven Hanwoo bulls) to determine intramuscular fatty  profiles. Phenotypic data on carcass  (CWT), eye muscle area (EMA), back fat thickness (BFT), marbling score (MS), Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and intramuscular fat content (IMF) were also investigated using this half-sib population. Variance and covari.ance components were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood procedures under univariate and pairwise bivariate animal models.  (C18:1n-9) was the most abundant fatty , accounting for 50.69% of all investigated fatty acids, followed by palmitic (C16:0; 27.33%) and stearic  (C18:0; 10.96%). The contents of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were 41.64%, 56.24% and 2.10%, respectively, and the MUFA/SFA ratio, PUFA/SFA ratio, desaturation index (DI) and elongation index (EI) were 1.36, 0.05, 0.59 and 0.66, respectively. The h 2 estimates for individual fatty acids ranged from very low to high (0.03±0.14 to 0.63±0.14). The h 2 estimates for SFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, DI and EI were 0.53±0.14, 0.49±0.14, 0.23±0.10, 0.51±0.13 and 0.53±0.13, respectively. The genetic and phenotypic correlations among individual fatty acids and fatty  classes varied widely (-0.99 to 0.99). Notably, C18:1n-9 had favourable (negative) genetic correlations with two detrimental fatty acids, C14:0 (-0.76) and C16:0 (-0.92). Genetic correlations of individual and group fatty acids with CWT, EMA, BFT, MS, WBSF and IMF ranged from low to moderate (both positive and negative) with the exception of low-concentration PUFAs. Low or near-zero phenotypic correlations reflected potential non-genetic contributions. This study provides insights on genetic variability and correlations among intramuscular fatty acids as well as correlations between fatty acids and carcass and meat-quality traits, which could be used in Hanwoo breeding programmes to improve fatty  compositions in meat.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28762006>Oleaginous Microalgae from Dairy Farm Wastewater for Biodiesel Production: Isolation, Characterization and Mass Cultivation.</a></h2><p>Producing biodiesel from microalgae grown in wastewater is environment-friendly and cost-effective. The present study investigated the algae found in wastewater of a local dairy farm for their potential as biodiesel feedstocks. Thirteen native algal strains were isolated. On the basis of morphology and 16S/18S rRNA gene sequences, one strain was identified to be a member of cyanobacteria, while other 12 strains belong to green algae. After screening, two Scenedesmus strains out of the 13 microalgae isolates demonstrated superiority in growth rate, lipid productivity, and sedimentation properties, and therefore were selected for further scale-up outdoor cultivation. Both Scenedesmus strains quickly adapted to the outdoor conditions, exhibiting reasonably good growth and strong anti-contamination capabilities. In flat-plate photobioreactors (PBRs), algal cells accumulated predominantly neutral lipids that accounted for over 60% of total lipids with almost 70% being triacylglycerol. In addition, Scenedesmus obliquus had a high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, of which the amount of  (C18:1) was up to 27.11%. Based on these findings, the dairy farm wastewater-isolated Scenedesmus strains represent promising sources of low-cost, high-quality oil for biofuel production.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246833>Cytotoxic Activity and Chemical Composition of the Root Extract from the Mexican Species Linum scabrellum: Mechanism of Action of the Active Compound 6-Methoxypodophyllotoxin.</a></h2><p>The cytotoxic activity and the chemical composition of the dichloromethane/methanol root extract of Linum scabrellum Planchon (Linaceae) were analyzed.

Increasing evidence highlights the importance of postprandial measurements to evaluate atherogenic risk. Postprandial effects of alpha-linolenic  (ALA) in women are poorly characterized. We therefore studied the postprandial lipid response of women to an ALA-rich oil in comparison with olive oil and butter, and characterized the fatty  composition of total lipids, TAGs, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in plasma.A randomized crossover design (n = 19) was used to compare the postprandial effects of 3 meals containing 35 g fat. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals for 7 h. Statistical analysis was carried out with ANOVA (significant difference = P < 0.05).No significant difference was seen in incremental area under the curve (iAUC) plasma-TAG between the meals. ALA and  levels were significantly increased in plasma after ALA-rich oil and olive oil meals, respectively. Palmitic  was significantly increased in plasma-TAG after the butter meal.

The current study demonstrated the anti‑proliferation and pro‑apoptosis activities of ximenynic  by cell viability assay and flow cytometry analysis. The expression of anti‑apoptosis protein silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1) was significantly suppressed by ximenynic .

This impairment can be simulated in vitro by chronic culture of 832/13 insulinoma cells with high concentrations of free fatty acids, or by study of lipid-laden islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Here we show that impaired GSIS is not a simple result of saturation of lipid storage pathways, as adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a cytosolically localized variant of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in either cellular model results in dramatic lowering of cellular triglyceride stores but no improvement in GSIS. Instead, the glucose-induced increment in "pyruvate cycling" activity (pyruvate exchange with tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates measured by (13)C NMR), previously shown to play an important role in GSIS, is completely ablated in concert with profound suppression of GSIS in lipid-cultured 832/13 cells, whereas glucose oxidation is unaffected. Moreover, GSIS is partially restored in both lipid-cultured 832/13 cells and islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats by addition of a membrane permeant ester of a pyruvate cycling intermediate (dimethyl malate).

The inhibitory activity of α-glucosidase was determined using the standard method with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Pancreatic lipase (PL) activity was measured by absorbance at 412 nm, and the data obtained were compared with orlistat.

However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O (palmitic  and  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics.

It is also a major non-cytochrome P450 enzyme in the phase I metabolism of carbonyl-containing drugs, and is highly expressed in the intestine. In this study, we found that long-chain fatty acids and their CoA ester derivatives inhibit CBR1. Among saturated fatty acids, myristic, palmitic and stearic acids were inhibitory, and stearic  was the most potent (IC 9µM). Unsaturated fatty acids (, elaidic, γ-linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids) and acyl-CoAs (palmitoyl-, stearoyl- and oleoyl-CoAs) were more potent inhibitors (IC 1.0-2.5µM), and showed high inhibitory selectivity to CBR1 over its isozyme CBR3 and other SDR superfamily enzymes (DCXR and DHRS4) with CBR activity. The inhibition by these fatty acids and acyl-CoAs was competitive with respect to the substrate, showing the K values of 0.49-1.2µM. Site-directed mutagenesis of the substrate-binding residues of CBR1 suggested that the interactions between the fatty acyl chain and the enzyme's Met141 and Trp229 are important for the inhibitory selectivity.

Controls received standard diet without any supplementation as non-treated control. All animals were killed at the end of week 28, and the major organs were carefully examined for preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. No DAG oil treatment-related changes were noted in survival, general conditions, body weights, food consumption and organ weights. Upon quantitative analysis of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci of the liver, DAG oil was not found to exert any effects. The incidence of  adenomas was significantly increased in rats given 1.375% DAG oil, but not 2.75% and 5.5% DAG oil, when compared to the control (5.5% TG group) value. Furthermore, incidences and multiplicity of hyperplasias and adenomas and/or adenocarcinomas were comparable across all DAG oil-treated groups. In contrast, incidences of  adenomas and/or adenocarcinomas were significantly increased in rats given 5.5% HOTG, and adenomas with MCTG, but not 5.5% HLTG, as compared to the 5.5% TG value. Preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions induced by DMBDD treatment in various organs other than the large intestine were comparable in all cases. Thus, the current results indicate that DAG oil may not exert modifying potential on tumor development, even in the  because of the lack of dose-dependence. DAG oil was equivalent to HOTG (standard cocking oil composed of naturally occurring fatty acids), with regard to  tumor development.

We identified 153 unigenes associated with lipid biosynthesis, including 107 unigenes for fatty  biosynthesis, 34 for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, 7 for oil bodies, and 5 for transcription factors involved in oil synthesis. The genes associated with fatty  synthesis were the most abundantly expressed genes at 120 DAF. Additionally, the biosynthesis of oil began to increase while crude fat contents increased from 16.61 to 74.45% (165 DAF).

Increased sarcolemmal fatty  translocase (FAT/CD36) imports more fatty  into the diabetic myocardium, feeding increased fatty  oxidation and elevated lipid deposition. Unlike other metabolic modulators that target mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, we proposed that pharmacologically inhibiting fatty  uptake, as the primary step in the pathway, would provide an alternative mechanism to rebalance metabolism and prevent lipid accumulation following hypoxic stress.Hearts from type 2 diabetic and control male Wistar rats were perfused in normoxia, hypoxia and reoxygenation, with the FAT/CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) infused 4 min before hypoxia. SSO infusion into diabetic hearts decreased the fatty  oxidation rate by 29% and myocardial triglyceride concentration by 48% compared with untreated diabetic hearts, restoring fatty  metabolism to control levels following hypoxia-reoxygenation. SSO infusion increased the glycolytic rate by 46% in diabetic hearts during hypoxia, increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by 53% and decreased lactate efflux rate by 56% compared with untreated diabetic hearts during reoxygenation. In addition, SSO treatment of diabetic hearts increased intermediates within the second span of the Krebs cycle, namely fumarate, oxaloacetate, and the FAD total pool. The cardiac dysfunction in diabetic hearts following decreased  availability was prevented by SSO-infusion prior to the hypoxic stress. Infusing SSO into diabetic hearts increased rate pressure product by 60% during hypoxia and by 32% following reoxygenation, restoring function to control levels.Diabetic hearts have limited metabolic flexibility and cardiac dysfunction when stressed, which can be rapidly rectified by reducing fatty  uptake with the FAT/CD36 inhibitor, SSO.

Additionally, HDT pretreatment protected against the increase of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in an acute hyperlipidemia mouse model with enhancement of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities. Taken together, HDT inhibits OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation via activation of AMPK and proliferator activated receptor-α/carnitine palmitoyltransferase signaling and enhancement of antioxidant activity as a potent candidate for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'hyperlipedemia', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846740>Bioactive properties of faveleira (Cnidoscolus quercifolius) seeds, oil and press cake obtained during oilseed processing.</a></h2><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature concerning the bioactive properties of faveleira products. This work focuses on the physicochemical evaluation of faveleira oil, as well as it investigates the bioactive properties of faveleira seeds, faveleira oil and the press cake obtained during the oilseed processing. The seeds were cold pressed and the following tests were performed: physicochemical characteristics (acidity, peroxide values, moisture and volatile matter, density and viscosity) and fatty  profile of faveleira oil; total phenolic and flavonoid content of faveleira seed and press cake; antibacterial activity of seed, oil and press cake; and antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power assay, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide radical scavenging assay and  radical absorbance capacity) of seed, oil and press cake. Our work demonstrated that the faveleira seed oil has low acidity (0.78 ± 0.03% ) and peroxide value (1.13 ± 0.12 mEq/1000g), associated with the relevant concentration of linoleic  (53.56%). It was observed that important phenolics (398.89 ± 6.34 mg EAG/100 g), especially flavonoids (29.81 ± 0.71 mg RE/g) remain in the press cake, which indicates that the by-product of the faveleira oilseed production constitutes a rich residual source of bioactive compounds. No bacterial growth inhibition was detected, but all samples including faveleira seeds, press cake, oil and its fractions have potent antioxidant activities, mainly the press cake, with  radical absorbance capacity of 28.39 ± 4.36 μM TE/g. Our results also show that faveleira oil has potential to be used as edible oil and the press cake should be used to contain the most antioxidants from seed.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344666>Nitro- Reduces J774A.1 Macrophage Oxidative Status and Triglyceride Mass: Involvement of Paraoxonase2 and Triglyceride Metabolizing Enzymes.</a></h2><p>Nitro-fatty acids possess anti-atherogenic properties, but their effects on macrophage oxidative status and lipid metabolism that play important roles in atherosclerosis development are unclear. This study compared the effects of nitro- (OLA-NO2) with those of native  (OLA) on intracellular reactive  species (ROS) generation, anti-oxidants and metabolism of triglycerides and cholesterol in J774A.1 macrophages. Upon incubating the cells with physiological concentrations of OLA-NO2 (0-1 µM) or with equivalent levels of OLA, ROS levels measured by 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, decreased dose-dependently, but the anti-oxidative effects of OLA-NO2 were significantly augmented. Copper ion addition increased ROS generation in OLA treated macrophages without affecting OLA-NO2 treated cells. These effects could be attributed to elevated glutathione levels and to increased activity and expression of paraoxonase2 that were observed in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated cells. Beneficial effects on triglyceride metabolism were noted in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated macrophages in which cellular triglycerides were reduced due to attenuated biosynthesis and accelerated hydrolysis of triglycerides. Accordingly, OLA-NO2 treated cells demonstrated down-regulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase1, the key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis, and increased expression of hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase that regulate triglyceride hydrolysis. Finally, OLA-NO2 vs OLA treatment resulted in modest but significant beneficial effects on macrophage cholesterol metabolism, reducing cholesterol biosynthesis rate and low density lipoprotein influx into the cells, while increasing high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Collectively, compared with OLA, OLA-NO2 modestly but significantly reduces macrophage oxidative status and cellular triglyceride content via modulation of cellular anti-oxidants and triglyceride metabolizing enzymes.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26989489>A single oral dose of a polyglucosamine influences the bioavailability of [9-(14)C]- in adult female Göttingen minipigs.</a></h2><p>Worldwide  has nearly doubled since 1980 and is a leading risk for global deaths, profoundly affecting morbidity, mortality, health-care costs, and professional and personal quality of life. Treatment of  and its consequences include lifestyle intervention, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Polyglucosamines have been proposed as an alternative strategy for treating , by reducing the amount of absorbed fat through interaction with dietary fat through various mechanisms. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of polyglucosamine on the bioavailability of the model compound [9-(14)C]- in female Göttingen minipigs.The study consisted of two treatment groups, each consisting of six adult female Göttingen minipigs with a catheterized vena jugularis to enable frequent blood sampling. One group served as the untreated group (control) and the other group was pre-treated with 2 tablets of 500 mg formoline L112. After 30 min, all animals were dosed orally with [9-(14)C]-. Excreta and blood samples were collected for analysis of radioactivity from 48 h pre-dose up to 144 h post-dosing. At sacrifice, the liver and contents of the gastrointestinal tract were collected for radioanalysis.Upon treatment with polyglucosamine (formoline L112), the Tmax of [(14)C]- in plasma was shifted from 4 to 16 h, and the Cmax decreased significantly from 14.1 μg/g to 3.3 μg/g. In addition, upon treatment with polyglucosamine the internal exposure to [(14)C]- as reflected by the area under the curve during the 0-12 h post-dose time interval (AUC0-12h), is significantly decreased to 32.9 % of the plasma value of [(14)C]- in untreated animals. Even up to 24 h post-dose, the AUC0-24h is significantly decreased to 50.7 % of the plasma value in untreated animals and this significant effect is prolonged up to 60 h post-dose.This study shows that treatment with polyglucosamine (formoline L112) reduces (as judged by Cmax & AUC) and delays (as judged by Tmax) fat absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation and limits peak exposure to free fatty acids which may contribute to a more beneficial condition in overweight humans.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23526996>Fatty  ethyl esters induce intestinal epithelial  dysfunction via a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism in a three-dimensional cell culture model.</a></h2><p>Evidence is accumulating that ethanol and its oxidative metabolite, acetaldehyde, can disrupt intestinal epithelial , an important factor contributing to ethanol-induced liver injury.

Changes in triacylglycerol content, the activity and expression of enzymes involved in  and fatty  oxidation were measured.Supplementation of an olive oil-rich diet with TFA increased liver triacylglycerols, the activity and expression of lipogenic enzymes and sterol regulatory element-binding protein SREBP-1a expression.

No significant differences were observed among the experimental groups in the activity and expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-Ia, body and liver weights or serum triacylglycerol concentrations.The effect of TFA on liver fat accumulation depends on the dietary fatty  composition. Steatosis induced by TFA when included in an olive oil diet (but not in a corn oil diet) was associated with an increased  but not with a decreased fatty  oxidation in animals fed on the olive oil diet.

Possibly due to this complexity, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. To gain insight from a non-mammalian experimental system, we have investigated the regulation of ApoO levels in an alternative, well-suited model for studies on lipid metabolism, the chicken. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with our rabbit anti-chicken ApoO antiserum demonstrated ApoO in the liver of chickens fed a control or a fat-enriched diet, as well as in 2 chicken hepatoma cell lines, LMH cells and the estrogen-responsive LMH-2A cells, under conditions of lipid loading by incubation with BSA-complexed . Induced triglyceride accumulation in both the liver and the hepatic cells was associated with significantly increased levels of ApoO mRNA and protein. Furthermore, upon treatment for 24 h with estrogen of the estrogen receptor-expressing LMH-2A cells, quantitative analysis of ApoO transcripts and Western blotting revealed increases of ApoO expression. Finally, upon a single administration of estrogen to roosters that leads to , higher hepatic levels of both ApoO transcript and protein were observed within 24 h. Based on these data, we propose that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones. The findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

In this study we compared the characteristics of tumor and bacterial cell death induced by HAMLET, a human milk complex of alpha-lactalbumin and .We show that HAMLET-treated bacteria undergo cell death with mechanistic and morphologic similarities to apoptotic death of tumor cells.

This study investigates the effects of the saturated FA palmitate and unsaturated FA oleate on monocyte phenotype and function. Incubation of human U937 and THP-1 monocytes with palmitate for 24h increased cell surface expression of integrin CD11b and scavenger receptor CD36 in a concentration-dependent manner with some decrease in mitochondrial reducing capacity at high concentration (300 μM). Monocytes incubated with palmitate, but not oleate, showed increased uptake of oxidized LDL and increased adhesion to rat aortic endothelium, particularly at bifurcations. The palmitate-induced increase in CD11b and CD36 expression was associated with increased cellular C16 ceramide and sphingomyelin, loss of reduced glutathione, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased monocyte surface CD11b and CD36 was inhibited by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, but not by the superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBap. In contrast, MnTBap prevented the mitochondrial ROS increase and metabolic inhibition due to 300μM palmitate. This study demonstrates that in viable monocytes, palmitate but not oleate increases expression of surface CD11b and CD36.

Transport experiments showed that the uptake rate of [ C]-DHA in human FATP1-expressing HEK293 cells was significantly greater than that in empty vector-transfected (mock) HEK293 cells. The steady-state intracellular DHA concentration was nearly 2-fold smaller in FATP1-expressing than in mock cells, suggesting that FATP1 works as not only an influx, but also an efflux transporter for DHA. [ C]-DHA uptake by a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) increased in a time-dependent manner, and was inhibited by unlabeled DHA and a known FATP1 substrate, . Knock-down of FATP1 in hCMEC/D3 cells with specific siRNA showed that FATP1-mediated uptake accounts for 59.2-73.0% of total [ C]-DHA uptake by the cells. Insulin treatment for 30 min induced translocation of FATP1 protein to the plasma membrane in hCMEC/D3 cells and enhanced [ C]-DHA uptake. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain sections showed that FATP1 protein is preferentially localized at the basal membrane of brain microvessel endothelial cells. We found that two neuroprotective substances, taurine and biotin, in addition to DHA, undergo FATP1-mediated efflux. Overall, our results suggest that FATP1 localized at the basal membrane of brain microvessels contributes to the transport of DHA, taurine and biotin into the brain, and insulin rapidly increases DHA supply to the brain by promoting translocation of FATP1 to the membrane.

The major bioactive ingredients include , palmitic , palmitoleic , linoleic , proline, and glutamic . Although HD is associated with immunoregulatory activities in allergic diseases, the therapeutic mechanisms of the action of HD in allergic diseases have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-asthmatic potential of HD in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of allergic asthma. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential of HD was examined to identify a plausible mechanism of action of HD in vitro. HD strongly reduced goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophil infiltration, and reactive  species (ROS), which reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammation, and the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The expression of IL-5, IL-4, eotaxin-2, lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2), and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was attenuated in the lungs. In an in vitro assay, HD exerted immunomodulatory effects through the suppression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13), IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production through downregulation of GATA-3 expression in EL-4 T cells. These findings suggest that the anti-asthmatic activity of HD may occur through the suppression of Th2 cytokines and total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production by inhibition of the GATA-3 transcription pathway. Our results suggest that HD may be a potential alternative therapy, or a novel therapeutic traditional medicine, for the treatment of allergic asthma.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1855245>Hydrodynamic and energetic aspects of exogenous free fatty  perfusion in the isolated rat heart during high flow anoxia and reoxygenation: a 31P magnetic resonance study.</a></h2><p>The aim was to show differences between the effects of various dietary long chain fatty acids (palmitic, , linoleic, alpha and gamma linolenic acids) perfused in isolated rat hearts subjected to a sequence of high flow anoxia and subsequent reoxygenation.Isolated working rat hearts perfused with selected exogenous fatty acids were allowed an initial 30 min equilibration period followed by 60 min of high flow anoxia and 40 min of reoxygenation. Ventricular function and tissue contents of phosphorylated metabolites were monitored concomitantly using standard procedures and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy respectively.Hearts were removed from male Wistar rats weighing 350-400 g. Results from eight hearts were pooled for each of the five fatty acids perfused.High coronary flow maintained during anoxia led to an increased extracellular washout of lactate and only to mild intracellular acidosis, limiting myocardial damage by metabolites of anaerobic . Under these conditions, marked differences between the classes of perfused fatty acids were observed. Hearts which received  showed the most depressed ventricular function and a greater depletion in high energy phosphates content. These deleterious effects were completely reversed by the separate administration of two fatty  metabolism blocking agents, nicotinic  and oxfenicine. Cardioprotection was enhanced by perfusion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic , alpha and gamma linolenic acids). Hearts perfused either with glucose or with palmitic  behaved similarly and showed an intermediate functional and metabolic postanoxic recovery.This study documents the relation between the chemical structure of exogenous fatty acids used in heart perfusion and their ability to improve or impair postanoxic myocardial recovery.

Methods and Results A randomized, controlled, 3-period, crossover, feeding trial was conducted in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease (n=45). Following a 2-week standard Western diet run-in (12% saturated FAs [ SFA ], 7% polyunsaturated FAs, 12% monounsaturated FAs), participants consumed 3 isocaloric -maintenance diets for 6 weeks each: a walnut diet ( WD ; 7% SFA , 16% polyunsaturated FAs, 3% ALA , 9% monounsaturated FAs); a walnut FA -matched diet; and an -replaced- ALA diet (7% SFA , 14% polyunsaturated FAs, 0.5% ALA , 12% monounsaturated FAs), which substituted the amount of ALA from walnuts in the WD with . This design enabled evaluation of the effects of whole walnuts versus constituent components. The primary end point, central systolic blood pressure, was unchanged, and there were no significant changes in arterial stiffness. There was a treatment effect ( P=0.04) for central diastolic blood pressure; there was a greater change following the WD versus the -replaced-ALA diet (-1.78±1.0 versus 0.15±0.7 mm Hg, P=0.04). There were no differences between the WD and the walnut fatty -matched diet (-0.22±0.8 mm Hg, P=0.20) or the walnut FA-matched and -replaced-ALA diets ( P=0.74). The WD significantly lowered brachial and central mean arterial pressure. All diets lowered total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, and non- HDL cholesterol. Conclusions Cardiovascular benefits occurred with all moderate-fat, high-unsaturated-fat diets. As part of a low- SFA diet, the greater improvement in central diastolic blood pressure following the WD versus the -replaced-ALA diet indicates benefits of walnuts as a whole-food replacement for SFA .

These epoxy FAs comprise epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and epoxy-octadecenoic acids (EpOMEs), which are formed by CYP epoxygenases from arachidonic  (AA) and linoleic , respectively, and then are hydrolyzed to their respective diols, the so-called DHETs and DiHOMEs. Although EETs and EpOMEs are also substrates for mEH, its role in lipid signaling is considered minor due to lower abundance and activity relative to sEH. Surprisingly, we found that in plasma from mEH KO mice, hydrolysis rates for 8,9-EET and 9,10-EpOME were reduced by 50% compared to WT plasma. This strongly suggests that mEH contributes substantially to the turnover of these FA epoxides-despite kinetic parameters being in favor of sEH. Given the crucial role of  in controlling plasma diol levels, we next studied the capacity of sEH and mEH KO  microsomes to synthesize DHETs with varying concentrations of AA (1-30 μM) and NADPH. mEH-generated DHET levels were similar to the ones generated by sEH, when AA concentrations were low (1 μM) or epoxygenase activity was curbed by modulating NADPH. With increasing AA concentrations sEH became more dominant and with 30 μM AA produced twice the level of DHETs compared to mEH. Immunohistochemistry of C57BL/6  slices further revealed that mEH expression was more widespread than sEH expression. mEH immunoreactivity was detected in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and bile duct epithelial cells, while sEH immunoreactivity was confined to hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells. Finally, transcriptome analysis of WT, mEH KO, and sEH KO  was carried out to discern transcriptional changes associated with the loss of EH genes along the CYP-epoxygenase-EH axis. We found several prominent dysregulations occurring in a parallel manner in both KO livers: (a) gene expression of Ephx1 (encoding for mEH protein) was increased 1.35-fold in sEH KO, while expression of Ephx2 (encoding for sEH protein) was increased 1.4-fold in mEH KO ; (b) Cyp2c genes, encoding for the predominant epoxygenases in mouse , were mostly dysregulated in the same manner in both sEH and mEH KO mice, showing that loss of either EH has a similar impact. Taken together, mEH appears to play a leading role in the hydrolysis of 8,9-EET and 9,10-EpOME and also contributes to the hydrolysis of other FA epoxides. It probably profits from its high affinity for FA epoxides under non-saturating conditions and its close physical proximity to CYP epoxygenases, and compensates its lower abundance by a more widespread expression, being the only EH present in several sEH-lacking cell types.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599279>Predictive metabolic signatures for the occurrence and development of diabetic nephropathy and the intervention of Ginkgo biloba leaves extract based on gas or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the leading causes of death in  (DM). Early warning and therapy has significant clinical value for DN. This research sought to find biomarkers to predict the occurrence and development of DN and the intervention of Ginkgo biloba leaves extract (GBE) by quantifying fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleosides and nucleobases in rat plasma. Samples were respectively collected at the weekend of 5-10 weeks after diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin were defined.

Fatty acids, amino acids and nucleosides and nucleobases in rat plasma were analyzed by gas chromatography or liquid phase chromatography and mass spectrometry, respectively. From the biochemical index and morphological change of kidney, the rats from the 5th to 7th week were in the stage of DM while from the begin of 8th week the rats were suggested in the early stage of DN. The results of quantitative metabolomics showed that 16 differential metabolites were related to the progression of DN, and , glutamate and guanosine might be the potential biomarkers of kidney injury. 14 differential metabolites were related to GBE against the progression of DN, while  and glutamate might be the potential biomarkers of GBE against kidney injury. Those findings potentially promote the understanding of the pathogenic progression of DN and reveal the therapeutic mechanism of GBE against DN.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for  loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (, found in olive oil) are less likely to promote insulin resistance, inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly palmitic  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for energy and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased energy expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective.

The involvement of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as a molecular target for scopolin was also explored. Scopolin decreased the Km of SIRT1 for p53 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide without altering Vmax in a cell-free system. Scopolin alleviated -induced lipid accumulation and downregulation of SIRT1 activity in HepG2 cells, and these beneficial effects of scopolin were abolished in the presence of SIRT1 inhibitor.

Since the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is required for function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, we examined the dynamics of CL synthesis in growing Hela cells immediately after and 12h post-fusion. Cells were transiently transfected with Mfn-2, to promote fusion, or Mfn-2 expressing an inactive GTPase for 24h and de novo CL biosynthesis was examined immediately after or 12h post-fusion. Western blot analysis confirmed elevated Mfn-2 expression and electron microscopic analysis revealed that Hela cell mitochondrial structure was normal immediately after and 12h post-fusion. Cells expressing Mfn-2 exhibited reduced CL de novo biosynthesis from [1,3-(3)H]glycerol immediately after fusion and this was due to a decrease in phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase (PGPS) activity and its mRNA expression. In contrast, 12h post-mitochondrial fusion cells expressing Mfn-2 exhibited increased CL de novo biosynthesis from [1,3-(3)H]glycerol and this was due to an increase in PGPS activity and its mRNA expression. Cells expressing Mfn-2 with an inactive GTPase activity did not exhibit alterations in CL de novo biosynthesis immediately after or 12h post-fusion. The Mfn-2 mediated alterations in CL de novo biosynthesis were not accompanied by alterations in CL or monolysoCL mass. [1-(14)C]Oleate incorporation into CL was elevated at 12h post-fusion indicating increased CL resynthesis. The reason for the increased CL resynthesis was an increased mRNA expression of tafazzin, a mitochondrial CL resynthesis enzyme. Ceramide-induced expression of PGPS in Hela cells or in CHO cells did not alter expression of Mfn-2 indicating that Mfn-2 expression is independent of altered CL synthesis mediated by elevated PGPS. In addition, Mfn-2 expression was not altered in Hela cells expressing phospholipid scramblase-3 or a disrupted scramblase indicating that proper CL localization within  is not essential for Mfn-2 expression. The results suggest that immediately post-mitochondrial fusion CL de novo biosynthesis is "slowed down" and then 12h post-fusion it is "upregulated".

AEA is hydrolyzed by fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme localized on the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast to most neuromodulators, the hydrophilic cytosol poses a diffusional barrier for the efficient delivery of AEA to its site of catabolism. Therefore, AEA likely traverses the cytosol with the assistance of an intracellular carrier that increases its solubility and rate of diffusion. To study this process, AEA uptake and hydrolysis were examined in COS-7 cells expressing FAAH restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum, , or the Golgi apparatus. AEA hydrolysis was detectable at the earliest measurable time point (3 seconds), suggesting that COS-7 cells, normally devoid of an endocannabinoid system, possess an efficient cytosolic trafficking mechanism for AEA. Three fatty  binding proteins (FABPs) known to be expressed in brain were examined as possible intracellular AEA carriers. AEA uptake and hydrolysis were significantly potentiated in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells after overexpression of FABP5 or FABP7, but not FABP3. Similar results were observed in COS-7 cells stably expressing FAAH. Consistent with the roles of FABP as AEA carriers, administration of the competitive FABP ligand  or the selective non-lipid FABP inhibitor BMS309403 attenuated AEA uptake and hydrolysis by approximately 50% in N18TG2 and COS-7 cells.

This project aimed to examine the use of HO peanuts as a feed ingredient for layer hens to determine the effect on performance, egg  chemistry, and quality of the eggs produced. Forty-eight 40-wk-old layer hens were fed a conventional soybean meal + corn control diet or a HO peanut + corn diet for 10 wk in conventional battery cages. Body and feed weights were collected weekly. Pooled egg samples were analyzed for quality,  analysis, and peanut protein allergenicity. There were no significant differences in hen performance or egg quality as measured by USDA grade quality, egg albumen height, or egg Haugh unit between the treatment groups. However, eggs produced from layer hens fed the HO peanut + corn diet had reduced egg weights relative to the controls (P = 0.0001). Eggs produced from layer hens fed the HO peanut diet had greater yolk color scores (P < 0.0001), HO fatty  (P < 0.0001), and β-carotene (P < 0.0001) levels in comparison to the controls.

We have shown that ethanol consumption leads to microtubule hyperacetylation that can explain ethanol-induced defects in protein trafficking. Because almost all steps of the lipid droplet life cycle are microtubule dependent and because microtubule acetylation promotes adipogenesis, we examined droplet dynamics in ethanol-treated cells. In WIF-B cells treated with ethanol and/or  (a fatty  associated with the "Western" diet), we found that ethanol dramatically increased lipid droplet numbers and led to the formation of large, peripherally located droplets. Enhanced droplet formation required alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol , and peripheral droplet distributions required intact microtubules. We also determined that ethanol-induced microtubule acetylation led to impaired droplet degradation. Live-cell imaging revealed that droplet motility was microtubule dependent and that droplets were virtually stationary in ethanol-treated cells. To determine more directly whether microtubule hyperacetylation could explain impaired droplet motility, we overexpressed the tubulin-specific acetyltransferase αTAT1 to promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Droplet motility was impaired in αTAT1-expressing cells but to a lesser extent than in ethanol-treated cells. However, in both cases, the large immotile droplets (but not small motile ones) colocalized with dynein and dynactin (but not kinesin), implying that altered droplet-motor microtubule interactions may explain altered dynamics. These studies further suggest that modulating cellular acetylation is a potential strategy for treating alcoholic liver disease.

Endogenous oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and the dietary metabolite, 2-monoacylglycerol (2-OG), can each activate GPR119. Here, we compared mucosal responses with selective, synthetic GPR119 agonists (AR440006 and AR231453) and the lipids, OEA, 2-OG, and N-oleoyldopamine (OLDA), monitoring epithelial ion transport as a readout for L-cell activity in native mouse and human gastrointestinal (GI) mucosae. We also assessed GPR119 modulation of colonic motility in wild-type (WT), GPR119-deficient (GPR119-/-), and PYY-deficient (PYY-/-) mice. The water-soluble GPR119 agonist, AR440006 (that cannot traverse epithelial tight junctions), elicited responses, when added apically or basolaterally in mouse and human colonic mucosae. In both species, GPR119 responses were PYY, Y1 receptor mediated, and glucose dependent. AR440006 efficacy matched the GI distribution of L-cells in WT tissues but was absent from GPR119-/- tissue. OEA and 2-OG responses were significantly reduced in the GPR119-/- colon, but OLDA responses were unchanged. Alternative L-cell activation via free fatty  receptors 1, 3, and 4 and the G protein-coupled bile  receptor TGR5 or by the melanocortin 4 receptor, was unchanged in GPR119-/- tissues. The GPR119 agonist slowed transit in WT but not the PYY-/- colon in vitro. AR440006 (intraperitoneally) slowed WT colonic and upper-GI transit significantly in vivo. These data indicate that luminal or blood-borne GPR119 agonism can stimulate L-cell PYY release with paracrine consequences and slower motility. We suggest that this glucose-dependent L-cell response to a gut-restricted GPR119 stimulus has potential therapeutic advantage in modulating insulinotropic signaling with reduced risk of hypoglycemia.</p><p>Keyword:['tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367738>Differential effects of reticulophagy and mitophagy on nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Autophagy affects the pathological progression of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD); however, the precise role of autophagy in NAFLD remains unclear. In this study, we want to identify the role of autophagy including reticulophagy and mitophagy in NAFLD pathogenesis. When HepG2 cells were treated with 400 μM  (OA), increased reticulophagy was induced 8 h after treatment, which correlated with an anti-apoptotic response as shown by the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, an increase in BCL-2 expression, and the downregulation of OA-induced lipotoxicity. When treated with OA for 24 h, DRAM expression-dependent mitophagy resulted in increased apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of reticulophagy aggravated and increased lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis 8 h after treatment; however, the inhibition of mitophagy decreased hepatocyte apoptosis after 24 h of OA treatment. Results from the analysis of patient  samples showed that autophagic flux increased in patients with mild or severe NAFL. PI3K/AKT phosphorylation was observed only in samples from patients with low-grade steatosis, whereas DRAM expression was increased in samples from patients with high-grade steatosis. Together, our results demonstrate that reticulophagy and mitophagy are independent, sequential events that influence NAFLD progression, which opens new avenues for investigating new therapeutics in NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29626587>Metabolite changes in risk of type 2  in cohort studies: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, and glycated hemoglobin are diagnostic markers for type 2  (T2DM). However, it is necessary to detect physiological changes in T2DM rapidly and stratify diabetic stage using other biomarkers. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to contribute to the development of objective and sensitive diagnostic indicators by integrating metabolite biomarkers derived from large-scale cohort studies.We searched for metabolomics studies of T2DM cohort in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published within the last 10 years from January 2008 to February 2017. The concentrations of metabolites and odds ratios (ORs) were integrated and risk ratio (RR) values were estimated to distinguish subjects with T2DM and normal participants.Fourteen cohort studies were investigated in this meta-analysis. There were 4592 patients in the case group and 11,492 participants in the control group. We noted a 1.89-, 1.63-, and 1.87-fold higher risk of T2DM associated with leucine (RR 1.89 [95% CI 1.57-2.29]), alanine (RR 1.63 [95% CI 1.48-1.79]), and  (RR 1.87 [95% CI 1.62-2.17]), respectively. Lysophosphatidylcholine C18:0 (RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.72-0.90]) and creatinine (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.53-0.74]) were associated with 20% and 37% decreased T2DM risks, respectively.Most amino acids in patients were positively related to , while creatinine and some lysophosphatidylcholines showed a negative relationship.

Herein, we report HA polymeric micelles encapsulating  coated SPIONs, having a hydrodynamic size of about 100 nm and SPION loading capacity of 1-2 wt %. The HA-SPION polymeric micelles were found to be selectively cytotoxic toward a number of human  cell lines, mainly those of  adenocarcinoma (HT-29). The selective inhibition of cell growth was even observed when the SPION loaded HA polymeric micelles were incubated with a mixture of control and  cells. The selective in vitro inhibition could not be connected with an enhanced CD44 uptake or radical oxygen species formation and was rather connected with a different way of SPION intracellular release. While aggregated iron particles were visualized in control cells, nonaggregated solubilized iron oxide particles were detected in  cells. In vivo SPION accumulation in intramuscular tumor following an intravenous micelle administration was confirmed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and histological analysis.

In this study we investigated whether fucoxanthin could inhibit lipids accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes. FL83B cells were induced as fatty liver cell model by 0.5 mM  for 48 h, and treated with various concentration of fucoxanthin for 24 h. The results demonstrated that fucoxanthin significantly suppressed lipid accumulation and decreased lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes. Fucoxanthin could decrease lipogenesis-related transcription factor expression, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. It also reduced fatty  synthase expression and increased adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase production for lipolysis. Furthermore, fucoxanthin significantly increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for regulating fatty  synthesis.

HEK-293 mock- and FATP-1 siRNA transfected cells or mock and FATP-1 expressing cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.1 mM  bound to albumin (1:1 molar ratio) then incubated for 24 h with 0.1 mM [1,3-(3)H]glycerol and radioactivity incorporated into CL determined. FATP-1 siRNA transfected cells exhibited reduced FATP-1 mRNA and increased incorporation of [1,3-(3)H]glycerol into CL (2-fold, p<0.05) compared to controls indicating elevation in de novo CL biosynthesis. The reason for this was an increase in [1,3-(3)H]glycerol uptake and increase in activity and mRNA expression of the CL biosynthetic enzymes. In contrast, expression of FATP-1 resulted a reduction in incorporation of [1,3-(3)H]glycerol into CL (65%, p<0.05) indicating reduced CL synthesis. [1,3-(3)H]Glycerol uptake was unaltered whereas activity of cytidine-5'-diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol synthetase (CDS) and CDS-2 mRNA expression were reduced in FATP-1 expressing cells compared to control.

These analyses revealed a number of metabolic characteristics over 56 days of symbiotic interaction with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices, when compared to the controls, i.e. nonmycorrhizal roots supplied with low and high amounts of phosphate. During the most active stages of overall root mycorrhization, elevated levels of certain amino acids (Glu, Asp, Asn) were observed accompanied by increases in amounts of some fatty acids (palmitic and  acids), indicating a mycorrhiza-specific activation of plastidial metabolism. In addition, some accumulating fungus-specific fatty acids (palmitvaccenic and vaccenic acids) were assigned that may be used as markers of fungal root . Stimulation of the biosynthesis of some constitutive isoflavonoids (daidzein, ononin and malonylononin) occurred, however, only at late stages of root mycorrhization. Increase of the levels of saponins correlated AM-independently with plant growth. Only in AM roots was the accumulation of apocarotenoids (cyclohexenone and mycorradicin derivatives) observed. The structures of the unknown cyclohexenone derivatives were identified by spectroscopic methods as glucosides of blumenol C and 13-hydroxyblumenol C and their corresponding malonyl conjugates. During mycorrhization, the levels of typical cell wall-bound phenolics (e.g. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, ferulic ) did not change; however, high amounts of cell wall-bound tyrosol were exclusively detected in AM roots. Principal component analyses of nonpolar primary and secondary metabolites clearly separated AM roots from those of the controls, which was confirmed by an hierarchical cluster analysis. Circular networks of primary nonpolar metabolites showed stronger and more frequent correlations between metabolites in the mycorrhizal roots. The same trend, but to a lesser extent, was observed in nonmycorrhizal roots supplied with high amounts of phosphate. These results indicate a tighter control of primary metabolism in AM roots compared to control plants. Network correlation analyses revealed distinct clusters of amino acids and sugars/aliphatic acids with strong metabolic correlations among one another in all plants analyzed; however, mycorrhizal symbiosis reduced the cluster separation and enlarged the sugar cluster size. The amino  clusters represent groups of metabolites with strong correlations among one another (cliques) that are differently composed in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots.

Therefore, we investigated the effects of oleate on atrophy-related factors in palmitate-conditioned myotubes.

Consequently, investigations into the diagnosis, treatment and the basic metabolism of cancer cells have been directed by this perception. However, the data on cancer metabolism are equivocal, and in this study we have sought to clarify the issue. Using an innovative system we have measured the total ATP turnover of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, the contributions to this turnover by oxidative and glycolytic ATP production and the contributions to the oxidative component by glucose, lactate, glutamine, palmitate and oleate. The total ATP turnover over approx. 5 days was 26.8 micromol of ATP.10(7) cells(-1).h(-1). ATP production was 80% oxidative and 20% glycolytic. Contributions to the oxidative component were approx. 10% glucose, 14% glutamine, 7% palmitate, 4% oleate and 65% from unidentified sources. The contribution by glucose ( and oxidation) to total ATP turnover was 28.8%, glutamine contributed 10.7% and glucose and glutamine combined contributed 40%. Glucose and glutamine are significant fuels, but they account for less than half of the total ATP turnover.

However, it is not known whether the expression of alcohol metabolism genes is altered in the livers of simple steatosis. There is also a current debate on whether fatty acids induce CYP2E1 in fatty livers. In this study, expression of alcohol metabolizing genes in the liver biopsies of simple steatosis patients was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), in comparison to biopsies of  livers and normal controls. Induction of alcohol metabolizing genes was also examined in cultured HepG2 cells treated with ethanol or , by qRT-PCR and Western blots. We found that the mRNA expression of alcohol metabolizing genes including ADH1C, ADH4, ADH6, catalase and CYP2E1 was elevated in the livers of simple steatosis, to similar levels found in  livers. In cultured HepG2 cells, ethanol induced the expression of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein, but not ADH4 or ADH6;  did not induce any of these genes. These results suggest that elevated alcohol metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD at the stage of simple steatosis as well as more severe stages.

This study evaluated the synergistic effects of ZnO NPs and palmitic  (PA) or free fatty acids (FFAs) mixture (/PA 2:1) on toxicity to human colon epithelial (Caco-2) cells. The ZnO NPs exposure concentration dependently induced cytotoxicity to Caco-2 cells showing as reduced proliferation and activity measured by 3 different assays. PA exposure induced cytotoxicity, and coexposure to ZnO NPs and PA showed the largest cytotoxic effects. The presence of FFAs mixture did not affect the ZnO NPs-induced cytotoxicity. Filtration of freshly prepared suspension of NPs through a 0.45-µm pore size membrane significantly reduced the cytotoxicity, indicating a role of concentration or size of particles in cytotoxic effects. The ZnO NPs and PA coexposure induced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) but not intracellular ROS production, whereas FFAs mixture exposure did not induce mROS and inhibited intracellular ROS. Both ZnO NPs and fatty acids (PA and FFAs mixture) promoted lysosomal destabilization, which was not correlated with cytotoxicity. These results indicated that PA can enhance ZnO NPs-induced cytotoxicity probably by the augmentation of mROS production, whereas FFAs mixture did not affect ROS production.

The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, , palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects.

Previous studies have reported a dysregulation of immune responses caused by lipid challenge; however, the mechanisms underlying that dysregulation are still not completely understood. Autophagy is an essential catabolic process through which cellular components are degraded by the lysosomal machinery. In T cells, autophagy is an actively regulated process necessary to sustain homeostasis and activation. Here, we report that CD4 T cell responses are inhibited when cells are challenged with increasing concentrations of fatty acids. Furthermore, analysis of T cells from diet-induced obese mice confirms that high lipid load inhibits activation-induced responses in T cells. We have found that autophagy is inhibited in CD4 T cells exposed in vitro or in vivo to lipid stress, which causes decreased autophagosome formation and degradation. Supporting that inhibition of autophagy caused by high lipid load is a key mechanism that accounts for the effects on T cell function of lipid stress, we found that ATG7 (autophagy-related 7)-deficient T cells, unable to activate autophagy, did not show additional inhibitory effects on their responses to activation when subjected to lipid challenge. Our results indicate, thus, that increased lipid load can dysregulate autophagy and cause defective T cell responses, and suggest that inhibition of autophagy may underlie some of the characteristic obesity-associated defects in the T cell compartment.

Therefore, we have compared enzyme activities and rates of mitochondrial palmitate oxidation in muscles of wild-type (WT) and FAT/CD36 knockout (KO) mice, at rest and after muscle contraction. In WT and KO mice, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, citrate synthase, and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities did not differ in subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF)  of WT and FAT/CD36 KO mice.

Muscle contraction increased fatty  oxidation (+18%) and mitochondrial FAT/CD36 protein (+16%) in WT IMF but not in WT SS, or in either mitochondrial subpopulation in KO mice. This revealed that the difference in IMF mitochondrial fatty  oxidation between WT and KO mice can be increased approximately 2.5-fold from 13% under basal conditions to 35% during muscle contraction. The FAT/CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), inhibited palmitate transport across the plasma membrane in WT, but not in KO mice. In contrast, SSO bound to mitochondrial membranes and reduced palmitate oxidation rates to a similar extent in both WT and KO  ( approximately 80%; P < 0.05). In addition, SSO reduced state III respiration with succinate as a substrate, without altering mitochondrial coupling (P/O ratios). Thus, while SSO inhibits FAT/CD36-mediated palmitate transport at the plasma membrane, SSO has undefined effects on .

Changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism in BrCa have been widely reported, yet the contribution of fatty acids (FAs) in BrCa biology remains to be determined. We recently reported that adipocyte coculture alters MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell metabolism and promotes proliferation and migration. Since adipocytes are FA-rich, and these FAs are transferred to BrCa cells, we sought to elucidate the FA metabolism of BrCa cells and their response to FA-rich environments. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in serum-containing media supplemented with FAs accumulate extracellular FAs as intracellular triacylglycerols (TAG) in a dose-dependent manner, with MDA-MB-231 cells accumulating more TAG. The differences in TAG levels were a consequence of distinct differences in intracellular partitioning of FAs, and not due to differences in the rate of FA uptake. Specifically, MCF-7 cells preferentially partition FAs into mitochondrial oxidation, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells partition FAs into TAG synthesis. These differences in intracellular FA handling underpin differences in the sensitivity to palmitate-induced lipotoxicity, with MDA-MB-231 cells being highly sensitive, whereas MCF-7 cells are partially protected. The attenuation of palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in MCF-7 cells was reversed by inhibition of FA oxidation. Pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with FAs increased TAG synthesis and reduced palmitate-induced apoptosis. Our results provide novel insight into the potential influences of obesity on BrCa biology, highlighting distinct differences in FA metabolism in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and how lipid-rich environments modulate these effects.© 2018 The Authors.

Among them, the most widely applied mitochondrial targeting moiety is triphenylphosphonium (TPP), which is a delocalized cationic lipid that readily accumulates and penetrates through the mitochondrial membrane due to the highly negative mitochondrial membrane potential.

We tested the hypothesis that a high SFA diet, compared to a high MUFA ( 18:1n-9) diet, reduces ALA conversion to long chain n-3 fatty acids. Mice were fed for 12 weeks on three diets: (1) a control, 16 % fat energy diet consisting of similar levels of SFA and MUFA (2) a 50 % fat energy high MUFA energy diet (35 % MUFA and 7 % SFA) or (3) a 50 % fat energy, high SFA energy diet (34 % SFA, 8 % MUFA). ALA and LNA content remained constant. Analysis of hepatic lipids demonstrated a selective reduction (40 %) in ALA but not LNA and a 35 % reduction in eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; 20:5n-3) in the high MUFA mice compared to the other groups. Lower content of ALA was reflected in the neutral lipid fraction, while smaller levels of phospholipid esterified EPA and docosapentaenoic  (DPA; 22:5n-3) were evident. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) content was elevated by the high SFA diet. Expression of Fads1 (Δ5 desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6 desaturase) was elevated by the high MUFA and reduced by the high SFA diet. These data indicate that a high MUFA diet, but not a high SFA diet, reduces ALA metabolism and point to selective hepatic disposition of ALA versus LNA.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534819>Ginsenoside Rb2 Alleviates Hepatic Lipid Accumulation by Restoring Autophagy via Induction of Sirt1 and Activation of AMPK.</a></h2><p>Although Panax ginseng is a famous traditional Chinese medicine and has been widely used to treat a variety of metabolic diseases including hyperglycemia, , and hepatosteatosis, the effective mediators and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study we found that ginsenoside Rb2, one of the major ginsenosides in Panax ginseng, was able to prevent hepatic lipid accumulation through autophagy induction both in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of male db/db mice with Rb2 significantly improved glucose tolerance, decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, and restored hepatic autophagy. In vitro, Rb2 (50 µmol/L) obviously increased autophagic flux in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes, and consequently reduced the lipid accumulation induced by  in combination with high glucose. Western blotting analysis showed that Rb2 partly reversed the high fatty  in combination with high glucose (OA)-induced repression of autophagic pathways including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and silent information regulator 1 (sirt1). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the sirt1 or AMPK pathways attenuated these beneficial effects of Rb2 on hepatic autophagy and lipid accumulation. Taken together, these results suggested that Rb2 alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation by restoring autophagy via the induction of sirt1 and activation of AMPK, and resulted in improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and glucose tolerance.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804268>Effects of canola and high- canola oils on abdominal fat mass in individuals with central .</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of diets low in saturated fatty acids and high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids on body composition in participants at risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS).This study was a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study.

Within each production group, a truncated Latin square arrangement of fatty  (FA) treatments was used in 2 consecutive 35-d periods. The FA treatments supplemented at 1.5% of diet dry matter were (1) 80:10 (80% C16:0 + 10% cis-9 C18:1), (2) 73:17 (73% C16:0 + 17% cis-9 C18:1), (3) 66:24 (66% C16:0 + 24% cis-9 C18:1), and (4) 60:30 (60% C16:0 + 30% cis-9 C18:1). Treatment × production group interactions were observed for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, milk fat, milk protein, and milk lactose and energy partitioned to milk. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments reduced fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk energy output in low-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments did not affect milk yield, milk protein yield, and milk lactose yield in low- and medium-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Regardless of production level, there was no effect of treatments on dry matter intake; however, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased  change and  condition score change. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased total FA digestibility due to a linear increase in 16- and 18-carbon FA digestibilities. Interactions between FA treatments and production level were observed for the yield of milk fat and milk FA sources. In low-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments decreased milk fat yield due to a decrease in de novo and mixed milk FA without changes in preformed milk FA. In contrast, in high-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased milk fat yield due to an increase in de novo and preformed milk FA. Our results indicate that high-producing dairy cows (averaging 60 kg/d) responded better to a fat supplement containing more cis-9 C18:1, whereas low-producing cows (averaging 45 kg/d) responded better to a supplement containing more C16:0.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Here we propose that HAMLET causes macroautophagy in tumor cells and that this contributes to their death. Cell death was accompanied by mitochondrial damage and a reduction in the level of active mTOR and HAMLET triggered extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and the formation of double-membrane-enclosed vesicles typical of macroautophagy. In addition, HAMLET caused a change from uniform (LC3-I) to granular (LC3-II) staining in LC3-GFP-transfected cells reflecting LC3 translocation during macroautophagy, and this was blocked by the macroautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. HAMLET also caused accumulation of LC3-II detected by Western blot when lysosomal degradation was inhibited suggesting that HAMLET caused an increase in autophagic flux. To determine if macroautophagy contributed to cell death, we used RNA interference against Beclin-1 and Atg5. Suppression of Beclin-1 and Atg5 improved the survival of HAMLET-treated tumor cells and inhibited the increase in granular LC3-GFP staining. The results show that HAMLET triggers macroautophagy in tumor cells and suggest that macroautophagy contributes to HAMLET-induced tumor cell death.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25992463>Lipid hydrolysis products affect the composition of infant gut microbial communities in vitro.</a></h2><p>Some lipid hydrolysis products such as medium-chained NEFA (MC-NEFA), sphingosine and monoacylglycerols (MAG) possess antibacterial activity, while others, including , are essential for the optimal growth of Lactobacillus species. Thus, changes in the concentrations of NEFA and MAG in the distal ileum and colon can potentially selectively modulate the composition of the gut microbiota, especially in early life when lipid absorption efficacy is reduced. As medium-chained fatty acids are enriched in mothers' milk, such effects may be highly relevant during gut colonisation. In the present study, we examined the effect of selected NEFA, MAG and sphingosine on the composition of faecal microbial communities derived from infants aged 2-5 months during a 24 h anaerobic in vitro fermentation. We tested lipid mixtures in the concentration range of 0-200 μm, either based on MC-NEFA (10 : 0 to 14 : 0 and MAG 12 : 0) or long-chained NEFA (LC-NEFA; 16 : 0 to 18 : 1 and MAG 16 : 0) with and without sphingosine, representing lipid hydrolysis products characteristic for intestinal hydrolysis of breast milk lipids. Ion Torrent sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene revealed that the relative abundance of lactic -producing genera, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was generally increased in the presence of 50 μm or higher concentrations of MC-NEFA. For Bifidobacterium, the same effect was also observed in the presence of a mixture containing LC-NEFA with sphingosine. On the contrary, the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was significantly decreased in the presence of both lipid mixtures.

Although, compared with young kidneys, aged kidneys show significantly increased fibrosis with impaired kidney function, the mechanisms underlying the effects of aging on renal fibrosis have not been investigated. In this study, we investigated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) and the FAO pathway as regulators of age-associated renal fibrosis. The expression of PPAR and the FAO pathway-associated proteins significantly decreased with the accumulation of lipids in the renal tubular epithelial region during aging in rats. In particular, decreased PPAR protein expression associated with increased expression of PPAR-targeting microRNAs. Among the microRNAs with increased expression during aging, miR-21 efficiently decreased PPAR expression and impaired FAO when ectopically expressed in renal epithelial cells. In cells pretreated with  to induce lipid stress, miR-21 treatment further enhanced lipid accumulation. Furthermore, treatment with miR-21 significantly exacerbated the TGF--induced fibroblast phenotype of epithelial cells. We verified the physiologic importance of our findings in a calorie restriction model. Calorie restriction rescued the impaired FAO pathway during aging and slowed fibrosis development. Finally, compared with kidneys of aged littermate controls, kidneys of aged PPAR mice showed exaggerated lipid accumulation, with decreased activity of the FAO pathway and a severe fibrosis phenotype. Our results suggest that impaired renal PPAR signaling during aging aggravates renal fibrosis development, and targeting PPAR is useful for preventing age-associated CKD.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484112>Association between Serum Elaidic  Concentration and  in Two Japanese Cohorts with Different Lifestyles.</a></h2><p>Many cohort studies have shown that increased trans fatty  (TFA) intake increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease.

This study examined the effects of omega-3 alpha-linolenic  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive  species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

Here we report the use of droplet reactors for the continuous and scalable production of Pt-Ni octahedra with high activities toward ORR. In a typical synthesis, Pt(acac)2, Ni(acac)2, and W(CO)6 were dissolved in a mixture of oleylamine, , and benzyl ether, and then pumped into a polytetrafluoroethylene tube. When the solution entered the reaction zone at a temperature held in the range of 170-230 °C, W(CO)6 quickly decomposed to generate CO gas, naturally separating the reaction solution into discrete, uniform droplets.

Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular thiol, protects cellular components from oxidation and is maintained in a reduced state by glutathione reductase (GR). Nitro  (NO-OA) is an electrophilic fatty  formed under digestive and inflammatory conditions that both reacts with GSH and induces its synthesis upon activation of Nrf2 signaling. The effects of NO-OA on intracellular GSH homeostasis were evaluated. In addition to upregulation of GSH biosynthesis, we observed that NO-OA increased intracellular GSSG in an oxidative stress-independent manner. NO-OA directly inhibited GR in vitro by covalent modification of the catalytic Cys61, with k of (3.45 ± 0.04) × 10 M s, k of (4.4 ± 0.4) × 10 s, and K of (1.3 ± 0.1) × 10 M. Akin to NO-OA, the electrophilic Nrf2 activators bardoxolone-imidazole (CDDO-Im), bardoxolone-methyl (CDDO-Me) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) also upregulated GSH biosynthesis while promoting GSSG accumulation, but without directly inhibiting GR activity. In vitro assays in which GR was treated with increasing GSH concentrations and GSH depletion experiments in cells revealed that GR activity is finely regulated via product inhibition, an observation further supported by theoretical (kinetic modeling of cellular GSSG:GSH levels) approaches. Together, these results describe two independent mechanisms by which electrophiles modulate the GSH/GSSG couple, and provide a novel conceptual framework to interpret experimentally determined values of GSH and GSSG.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

FA were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography in visceral AT samples. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor FA/product FA ratio. Desaturase gene expressions were evaluated by RT-qPCR.Lean and obese CRC subjects showed inadequate dietary habits. In particular, lean CRC subjects showed increase in the intake of saturated FA, specifically palmitic (p = 0.0042) and stearic  (p = 0.0091), and a corresponding reduction of monounsaturated FA consumption, in particular  (p = 0.002) with respect to lean without CRC. Estimated SCD-1 activity in AT was increased in all the groups vs lean without CRC (pANOVA = 0.029).Unhealthy eating habits, characterizing obese and CRC subjects, may influence the visceral AT profile and contribute to the alteration of the metabolic pathways. The quality of the diet, other than the quantity, can have a main role in the establishment of inflammatory microenvironment and in metabolic changes favouring CRC.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058170>PAM, OLA, and LNA are Differentially Taken Up and Trafficked Via Different Metabolic Pathways in Porcine Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids have different effects on fat deposition in pigs. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of this difference, we compared the metabolism of palmitic (PAM, saturated),  (OLA, monounsaturated) and linoleic  (LNA, polyunsaturated) in porcine adipocytes treated with 100 μM PAM, OLA or LNA. We observed that the adipocytes incubated with LNA accumulated more lipids compared with those treated with PAM and OLA. We then probed the metabolism of these fatty acids in porcine adipocytes by using isotope-labelled fatty acids. The results showed that 42% of the [1-C] LNA, 34% of the [1-C] PAM and 28% of the [1-C] OLA were recovered in the cellular lipids. The gene expression analyses showed that LNA significantly increased the expression of adipogenesis- and oxidation-related genes including PPARγ, C/EBPα, ap2 and NRF1. In addition, the cells incubated with LNA showed a decreased Ser phosphorylation in PPARγ compared to those incubated with PAM and OLA. Furthermore, when PPARγ Ser phosphorylation was inhibited, no significant difference in the triacylglycerol contents in the adipocytes was observed. These results showed the dietary fatty acids had different metabolism pathways in porcine adipocytes, and LNA significantly promoted lipid accumulation, probably by regulating PPARγ phosphorylation in adipocytes.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603449>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of lipo-alkaloids and fatty acids in Aconitum carmichaelii using LC-MS and GC-MS.</a></h2><p>Lipo-alkaloid (LA) is a kind of C -norditerpenoid alkaloid in Aconitum species, which usually contains an aconitane skeleton and one or two fatty  residues.To qualify and quantify the fatty acids and lipo-alkaloids in Aconitum carmichaelii.An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QQQ-MS) method was established to quantify LAs, while the free fatty acids were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS).Six major LAs (1-6) containing linoleic, palmitic, and  residues as side chains were quantified.

Fat and salt are a common and appetitive combination in food; however, the effect of either on food intake is unclear. Fat taste sensitivity has been negatively associated with dietary fat intake, but how fat taste sensitivity influences the intake of fat within a meal has, to our knowledge, not yet been investigated.Our objectives were, first, to investigate the effects of both fat and salt on ad libitum food intake and, second, to investigate the effects of fat taste sensitivity on satiation responses to fat and whether this was affected by salt.Forty-eight healthy adults [16 men and 32 women, aged 18-54 y, body mass index (kg/m(2)): 17.8-34.4] were recruited and their fat taste sensitivity was measured by determination of the detection threshold of  (18:1n-6). In a randomized 2 × 2 crossover design, participants attended 4 lunchtime sessions after a standardized breakfast. Meals consisted of elbow macaroni (56%) with sauce (44%); sauces were manipulated to be1) low-fat (0.02% fat, wt:wt)/low-salt (0.06% NaCl, wt:wt),2) low-fat/high-salt (0.5% NaCl, wt:wt),3) high-fat (34% fat, wt:/wt)/low-salt, or4) high-fat/high-salt. Ad libitum intake (primary outcome) and eating rate, pleasantness, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness (secondary outcomes) were measured.Salt increased food and energy intakes by 11%, independent of fat concentration (P= 0.022). There was no effect of fat on food intake (P= 0.6), but high-fat meals increased energy intake by 60% (P< 0.001). A sex × fat interaction was found (P= 0.006), with women consuming 15% less by weight of the high-fat meals than the low-fat meals. Fat taste sensitivity was negatively associated with the intake of high-fat meals but only in the presence of low salt (fat taste × salt interaction on delta intake of high-fat - low-fat meals;P= 0.012).The results suggest that salt promotes passive overconsumption of energy in adults and that salt may override fat-mediated satiation in individuals who are sensitive to the taste of fat.

Hence, the identification and exploration of microorganisms with the rare natural ability for de novo biosynthesis of lactones will contribute to the long-term sustainability of microbial production. In this study, the innate ability of Ashbya gossypii for de novo production of γ-lactones from glucose was evaluated and improved.Characterization of the volatile organic compounds produced by nine strains of this industrial filamentous fungus in glucose-based medium revealed the noteworthy presence of seven chemically different γ-lactones.

Thus, we investigated the effects of DF on obesity and NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms.DF was extracted with water (DF-FW), 30% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA30), or 70% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA70). The chemical profile of DF was monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet analysis. The effects of DF on indices of obesity and NAFLD in high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Oil red O staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry.The presence of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, aloe-emodin, and emodin in DF was determined by 3D chromatography using HPLC. Administration of DF-GA70 to HFD-fed obese mice decreased , epididymal adipose tissue mass, and epididymal adipocyte size. DF-GA70 reduced serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All three DF extracts lowered serum alanine transaminase levels, hepatic lipid accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages, with the largest effects observed for DF-GA70. DF-GA70 increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation genes and decreased mRNA levels of genes for lipogenesis and inflammation in the liver of obese mice. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, whereas all three DF extracts inhibited lipid accumulation. DF-GA70 also altered the expression of lipolytic and lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells.These results indicate that DF inhibits obesity and obesity-induced severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation without any adverse effects and that these effects may be mediated by regulation of the hepatic expression of lipid metabolism and inflammatory genes.

Eleven healthy males (age: 29 ± 4.5 year; BMI: 26.3 ± 2.1 kg/m ) completed two 7-day study phases during which hormone levels were altered pharmacologically to produce a low sex hormone condition (gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist, aromatase inhibitor, and placebo gel) or a testosterone add-back condition (testosterone gel). Following 7 days of therapy, subjects were administered an inpatient test meal containing 50 μCi of [1- C] . Plasma samples were collected hourly for 5 h to assess postprandial responses.  metabolism (indirect calorimetry) and dietary fat oxidation ( CO in breath) were assessed at 1, 3, 5, 13.5, and 24 h following the test meal. Abdominal and femoral adipose biopsies were taken 24 h after the test meal to determine uptake of the labeled lipid. Postprandial glucose, insulin, free-fatty , and triglyceride responses were not different between conditions (P > 0.05). Whole-body  metabolism was also not different between conditions at any time point (P > 0.05). Dietary fat oxidation trended lower (P = 0.12) and the relative uptake of  C labeled lipid into femoral adipose tissue was greater (P = 0.03) in the low hormone condition. Short-term hormone suppression did not affect  expenditure or postprandial metabolism, but contributed to greater relative storage of dietary fat in the femoral depot.

It is well known that, in beef, the main FAs associated with these biological processes are  (C18:1 cis9, OA) and conjugated linoleic  (CLA-c9t11), which may have beneficial effects on metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and . Here, we performed differential expression and co-expression analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and partial correlation with information theory (PCIT), to uncover the complex interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in skeletal muscle associated with FA content. miRNA and mRNA expression data were obtained from skeletal muscle of Nelore cattle that had extreme genomic breeding values for OA and CLA. Insulin and MAPK signaling pathways were identified by WGCNA as central pathways associated with both of these fatty acids.

However, the lagging quantum yields of blue-emitting perovskite NCs have resulted in low efficiency compared to green or red perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs); moreover, the long insulating ligands (such as oleylamine and ) inhibit charge carrier injection. In this study, we demonstrated a facile ligand-mediated post-treatment (LMPT) method for high-quality perovskite NCs with changing optical properties to allow fine-tuning of the target emission wavelength. This method involves the use of a mixed halide ion-pair ligand, di-dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide, and chloride, which can induce a reconstruction through a self-anion exchange. Using the LMPT method, the PLQY of the surface-passivated blue-emitting NCs was dramatically enhanced to over 70% within the 485 nm blue emission region and 50% within the 467 nm deep-blue emission region. Through this treatment, we achieved highly efficient blue-PeLED maximum external quantum efficiencies of 0.44 and 0.86% within the 470 and 480 ± 2 nm electroluminescence emission regions, respectively.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25760987>Preventive effects of a fermented dairy product against Alzheimer's disease and identification of a novel oleamide with enhanced microglial phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity.</a></h2><p>Despite the ever-increasing number of patients with dementia worldwide, fundamental therapeutic approaches to this condition have not been established. Epidemiological studies suggest that intake of fermented dairy products prevents cognitive decline in the elderly. However, the active compounds responsible for the effect remain to be elucidated. The present study aims to elucidate the preventive effects of dairy products on Alzheimer's disease and to identify the responsible component. Here, in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD), intake of a dairy product fermented with Penicillium candidum had preventive effects on the disease by reducing the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and hippocampal inflammation (TNF-α and MIP-1α production), and enhancing hippocampal neurotrophic factors (BDNF and GDNF). A search for preventive substances in the fermented dairy product identified oleamide as a novel dual-active component that enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity towards LPS stimulation in vitro and in vivo. During the fermentation, oleamide was synthesized from , which is an abundant component of general dairy products owing to lipase enzymatic amidation. The present study has demonstrated the preventive effect of dairy products on Alzheimer's disease, which was previously reported only epidemiologically. Moreover, oleamide has been identified as an active component of dairy products that is considered to reduce Aβ accumulation via enhanced microglial phagocytosis, and to suppress microglial inflammation after Aβ deposition. Because fermented dairy products such as camembert cheese are easy to ingest safely as a daily meal, their consumption might represent a preventive strategy for dementia.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151418>[VEGF165 transfected endothelial progenitor cells mediated by lentivirus alleviated ALI in rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effects of vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF165) transfected the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mediated by lentivirus on acute lung injury (ALI) in rats.The mononuclear cells from the male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were isolated and cultured to get the EPCs for study. The lentivirus vector carrying the human VEGF165 gene was constructed. According to the random number table method, 90 male SD rats were divided into ALI model group, phosphate buffer solution (PBS) group, EPCs treatment group, none transfected EPCs treatment group and VEGF165 transfected EPCs treatment group, and the rats in each group were subdivided into 4, 12 and 48 hours subgroups, with 6 rats in each subgroup. The rat model of ALI was reproduced by intravenous injection of  (0.15 μL/g). Then each treatment group was given PBS, EPCs, none transfected EPCs and VEGF165 transfected EPCs respectively with the same volume of 0.2 mL. For the groups with cells, about 1×10 cells were contained. Abdominal aortic blood and lung tissue were harvested at 4, 12 and 48 hours. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed.

The combination of obesity and type 2 diabetes, characterized as 'diabesity', is associated with elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFAs). Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FFA-induced β-cell dysfunction. However, molecular mechanisms linking between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and FFA-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis are less clear. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that NOX2-derived ROS may play a critical role in dysfunction and apoptosis of β-cells induced by FFA. Our results show that palmitate and oleate (0.5 mmol/L, 48 h) induced JNK activation and AKT inhibition which resulted in decreased phosphorylation of FOXO1 following nuclear localization and the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1, leading to the reducing of insulin and ultimately dysfunction of pancreatic NIT-1 cells. We also found that palmitate and oleate stimulated apoptosis of NIT-1 cells through p38MAPK, p53 and NF-κB pathway. More interestingly, our data suggest that suppression of NOX2 may restore FFA-induced dysfunction and apoptosis of NIT-1 cells. Our findings provide a new insight of the NOX2 as a potential new therapeutic target for preservation of β-cell mass and function.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27780978>Maternal  modulates intracellular lipid turnover in the human term placenta.</a></h2><p> before pregnancy is associated with impaired metabolic status of the mother and the offspring later in life. These adverse effects have been attributed to epigenetic changes in utero, but little is known about the role of placental metabolism and its contribution to fetal development.We examined the impact of maternal pre-pregnancy  on the expression of genes involved in placental lipid metabolism in lean and obese women.Seventy-three lean and obese women with healthy pregnancy were recruited at term elective cesarean delivery. Metabolic parameters were measured on maternal venous blood samples. Expression of 88 genes involved in lipid metabolism was measured in whole placenta tissue. Proteins of genes differently expressed in response to maternal  were quantified, correlated with maternal parameters and immunolocalized in placenta sections. Isolated primary trophoblasts were used for in vitro assays.Triglyceride (TG) content was increased in placental tissue of obese (1.10, CI 1.04-1.24 mg g, P<0.05) vs lean (0.84, CI 0.72-1.02 mg g) women. Among target genes examined, six showed positive correlation (P<0.05) with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, namely ATGL (PNPLA2), FATP1 (SLC27A1), FATP3 (SLC27A3), PLIN2, PPARG and CGI-58 (ABHD5). CGI-58 protein abundance was twofold higher (P<0.001) in placentas of obese vs lean women. CGI-58 protein levels correlated positively with maternal insulin levels and pre-pregnancy body mass index (R=0.63, P<0.001 and R=0.64, P<0.001, respectively). CGI-58 and PLIN2 were primarily located in the syncytiotrophoblast and, were upregulated (1.38- and 500-fold, respectively) upon  and insulin treatment of cultured trophoblast cells.Pre-gravid  significantly modifies the expression of placental genes related to transport and storage of neutral lipids. We propose that the upregulation of CGI-58, a master regulator of TG hydrolysis, contributes to the turnover of intracellular lipids in placenta of obese women, and is tightly regulated by metabolic factors of the mother.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486510> and linoleic fatty acids downregulate Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression via NFKB and SREBP1 in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p> (OA) and linoleic (LA) fatty acids may be important regulators of Slc2a4 gene (GLUT4 protein) in skeletal muscle, thus participating in .

Oral administration of this drug presents many drawbacks, resulting in treatment non-adherence among patients. Thus, the development of transdermal formulations for donepezil delivery is important. The aim of this study was to prepare and to evaluate nanostructured lipid carrier-based gels (NLC gel) able to improve the skin delivery of donepezil free base (DPB). The components of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were selected after evaluating their enhancing effects using in vitro DPB skin delivery assays. DPB-loaded NLC were prepared by a microemulsion technique, by employing stearic  as a solid lipid,  as a liquid lipid, lecithin as a surfactant, and sodium taurodeoxycholate as a co-surfactant. The DPB-NLC dispersions were characterized morphologically using atomic force microscopy and physicochemically using dynamic light scattering and surface charge measurements. These data along, with the encapsulation studies, indicated that uniformly nano-sized particles with high drug encapsulation were fabricated. In vitro skin permeation assays were performed, and the results indicated that drug skin permeation from DPB-NLC gel was increased, not only by the enhancing effect of their components, but the lipid nanocarriers also presented an additional enhancing effect to increase drug flux across the skin.

MUFA-HFD-fed mice displayed improved  sensitivity coincident with reduced pro-IL-1β priming, attenuated adipose IL-1β secretion, and sustained adipose AMPK activation compared with SFA-HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, MUFA-HFD-fed mice displayed hyperplastic adipose tissue, with enhanced adipogenic potential of the stromal vascular fraction and improved  sensitivity. In vitro, we demonstrated that the MUFA  can impede ATP-induced IL-1β secretion from lipopolysaccharide- and SFA-primed cells in an AMPK-dependent manner.

Here, we investigated the restrictive effects of GRIM-19 on the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that GRIM-19 protein levels were reduced in HCV-infected Huh7 cells and Huh7 cells harboring HCV replicons. Moreover, ectopically expressed GRIM-19 caused a reduction in both intracellular viral RNA levels and secreted viruses in HCVcc-infected cell cultures. The restrictive effect on HCV replication was restored by treatment with siRNA against GRIM-19. Interestingly, GRIM-19 overexpression did not alter the level of phosphorylated STAT3 or its subcellular distribution. Strikingly, forced expression of GRIM-19 attenuated an increase in intracellular lipid droplets after  (OA) treatment or HCVcc infection. GRIM-19 overexpression abrogated fatty -induced upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1c), resulting in attenuated expression of its target genes such as fatty  synthase (FAS) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Treatment with OA or overexpression of SREBP-1c in GRIM-19-expressing, HCVcc-infected cells restored HCV replication.

Transmission electron microscopy revealed formation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets after DHA treatment. In SW620 cells an eightfold increase in total cholesteryl esters and a 190-fold increase in DHA-containing cholesteryl esters were observed after DHA treatment. In contrast, SW480 cells accumulated DHA-enriched triglycerides. Arachidonic  accumulated in a similar manner, whereas the nontoxic  was mainly incorporated in triglycerides in both cell lines. Interestingly, nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (nSREBP1), recently associated with cell growth regulation, was downregulated after DHA treatment in both cell lines. Our results demonstrate cell-specific mechanisms for the processing and storage of cytotoxic PUFAs in closely related cell lines, and suggest downregulation of nSREBP1 as a possible contributor to the growth inhibitory effect of DHA.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10100756>Enhanced levels of oleate-dependent and Arf-dependent phospholipase D isoforms in experimental .</a></h2><p>Phospholipase D (PLD) (EC 3.1.4.4) is one of the intracellar signal transduction enzymes and plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions.

The possible mechanisms underlying the effect on liver injury enzymes, histopathological parameters, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant and detoxification defense systems, as well as inflammatory parameters, were determined. Rats treated with PAO (3 or 6 mL/kg) for 21 days before CCl induction (3 mL/kg, 70%) showed significantly decreased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, milder hepatic lesions and higher levels of serum high-density lipoprotein compared to CCl group. Moreover, PAO enhanced antioxidant capacity by increasing hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzyme activities, as well as reducing circulating concentrations of leptin and inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6, leukotrienes -4 and -5 and the tumor necrosis factor receptor.

The uniformity of biologic effect of exogenous nicotinic  and endogenous insulin permits to become aware that a) the hypo-lipidemic activity of insulin, inhibition of lipolysis in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent adipocytes and decreasing of content of unesterified fatty acids in blood plasma are considered as a basis of hypoglycemic effect of insulin; b) nicotinic  similar to insulin blocks lipolysis too but in hormoneindependent visceral fatty cells. The counter-insular effect is manifested in vivo by exogenous and endogenous palmitic saturated fatty  by force of physical chemical characteristics. The biological role of insulin consists in regulation of metabolism of fatty acids mainly unesterified fatty acids and in absorption of glucose by all insulin-dependent cells. It is supposed that contractile cells (myocytes and cardiomyocytes) cumulate glycogen for implementing glucose as a substrate in synthesis in situ de novo of ῲ-9  mono-saturated fatty . The insulin initiates synthesis because  process this mono-saturated fatty to β-oxidation with the highest constant of reaction velocity. This is conditioned by physical chemical characteristics of  mono-saturated fatty , positioning of double bond in the chain of fatty ; this ensures maximal efficiency of ATP gaining. In phylogenesis, the low efficient palmitic alternative of metabolism of fatty acids is formed the earliest. At the later stages of phylogenesis the cells, under becoming of motion function, worked out more efficient alternative of ATP synthesis from exogenous ῲ-9  monosaturated fatty . At the late stages of phylogenesis, under becoming of biological function of locomotion (motion at the expense of contraction of cross-striated skeletal myocytes) insulin began to activate absorption of glucose by cells with subsequent synthesis of endogenous ῲ-9  mono-saturated fatty  out of it. The aphysiological effect of environment factors in the form of derangement of biological function of trophology (feeding), surplus of palmitic unesterified fatty acids in food serve as a main cause of such a high rate of functional derangement - insulin resistance syndrome in populations.

Palmitic,  and linoleic  are the most abundant FA in Prunus persica cultivars. A genetic effect on FA composition was observed throughout the two sampling periods. Peel was rich in  with the highest content (31.3% on total FA) in 'O'Henry' cultivar at the commercial ripening date; flesh was rich in linoleic  with the highest content (44.7% on total FA) in 'Sweet Cap' cultivar at the full ripening date. The monounsaturated/polyunsaturated   ratios were higher in the commercial ripe than in the full ripe fruits. The analysis of the composition of the VC led to the characterization of 98 different compounds, showing a very high variability among the cultivars. The full ripe fruit (peel and flesh) exhibited the highest total number of terpenoids. Commercial ripe peels were richest in the percentage of hydrocarbons. Comparing cultivars, 'Sweet Cap' cultivar showed the lowest contents of alcohols in peel and flesh of full ripe fruit but highest in peel of commercial ripe fruit, and lowest content of aldehydes in peel and flesh of commercial ripe fruit but highest in peel of ripe ones and the highest ones of lactones. Among PC, the highest contents were observed for o-diphenols and the values showed varietal influence. Total phenols contents decreased during ripening process (p < 0.05) in both peel and flesh tissues, except found for 'Sweet Cap' cultivar. In conclusion, to achieve better FA composition and greater VC and PC production of the peach fruit, P. persica cultivars should be harvested at the commercial ripening date.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

On the 31st day of experiment, animals were exposed to forced swim test for evaluation of their physical endurance and capacity in the conditions of high stress.The introduction into the animal diet of lipid module, enriched with PG and/or ASTA had pronounced hypolipidemic effect, lowered total serum cholesterol against a background of decrease in low-density lypoproteins (LDL) level. The concentration of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) - docosahexaenoic  in liver cells of animals treated with lipid module enriched with PG and/or ASTA increased more the 3 times, while ω-6 linoleic  decreased twice. The consumption of enriched with ASTA lipid module inhibited the increase in blood corticosterone level after stress (exhausting physical exercise) and lowered it to the control animals values, thus showing adaptogenic effect.

Despite treatment advances over the last decades, ARDS patients still suffer mortality rates between 35 and 40%. There is still a need for further research to improve the outcome of patients suffering from ARDS. One problem is that no single animal model can mimic the complex pathomechanism of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, but several models exist to study different parts of it.  injection (OAI)-induced lung injury is a well-established model for studying ventilation strategies, lung mechanics and ventilation/perfusion distribution in animals.

We investigated the ability of novel dihydropyridines (DHPs) to improve the effect of protecting against the injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in cardioblasts when compared to nifedipine. Forty three DHPs were created varying the fatty chains derived from palmitic , stearic  and  acids and aromatic moiety in addition to the addition of chemical elements such as chlorine, nitrogen dioxide, furfural, hydroxyl and methoxy. Cytotoxicity and inhibition of linoleic oxidation were evaluated for all new DHPs and also for nifedipine. The alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were used as antioxidants controls. The compounds with the best antioxidant potential were used in the ischemia and reperfusion (I / R) induction test in cardioblasts (H9c2). Cardioblasts were treated 24 h after assembly of plates and submitted to the ischemia simulation (30 min), after which, normoxia and cellular nutrition conditions were reestablished, simulating reperfusion (additional 30 min).

Taken together, these results indicate that those new DHPs have a greater cardioprotective antioxidant capacity to face the damages of ischemia and reperfusion.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We approached the pathophysiology of DN with systems biology, and a comprehensive profile of renal transcripts was obtained with RNA-Seq in ZS (F1 hybrids of Zucker and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure) rats, a model of diabetic nephropathy. We included sham-operated lean control rats (LS), sham-operated diabetic (DS), and diabetic rats with induced renal ischemia (DI). Diabetic nephropathy in DI was accelerated by the single episode of renal ischemia. This progressive renal decline was associated with renal iron accumulation, although serum and urinary iron levels were far lower in DI than in LS. Furthermore, obese/diabetic ZS rats have severe dyslipidemia, a condition that has been linked to hepatic iron overload. Hence, we tested and found that the fatty acids  and palmitate stimulated iron accumulation in renal tubular cells in vitro. Renal mRNAs encoding several key proteins that promote iron accumulation were increased in DI. Moreover, renal mRNAs encoding the antioxidant proteins superoxide dismutase, catalase, and most of the glutathione synthetic system were suppressed, which would magnify the prooxidant effects of renal iron loads. Substantial renal iron loads occur in obese/diabetic rats. We propose that in , specific renal gene activation is partly responsible for iron accumulation. This state might be further aggravated by lipid-stimulated iron uptake. We suggest that progressive renal iron overload may further advance renal injury in obese/diabetic ZS rats.© 2015 The Authors.

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient  variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient palmitic variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome and . We believe that the food of herbivores should contain palmitic  in the amounts that hepatocytes can esterify into  very low density lipoproteins and cells can internalize as ligand  by apoЕ/В-100 endocytosis without formation of low density lipoproteins.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy', 'fat metabolism', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28873098>The impact of using chickpea flour and dried carp fish powder on pizza quality.</a></h2><p>Pizza being the most popular food worldwide, quality and sensory appeal are important considerations during its modification effort.

Analysis indicated nutrients richness specificity of chickpea flour (higher fiber, , iron, zinc, linoleic  and total nonessential amino acids) and dried carp fish powder (higher contents of protein, fats, ash,  and total essential amino acids) complementing wheat flour to enhance nutritional value of pizza. Total plate count and thiobarbituric  were increased (P<0.05) in dried carp fish powder after 45 days of storage, but no Coliform were detected. Wheat flour was substituted with 5, 7.5 and 10% chickpea flour or dried carp fish powder and chemical, textural, sensory and storage evaluation parameters of in pizza were investigated. Dried carp fish powder increased (P<0.05) contents of protein, ash, fats, zinc and protein digestibility of pizza. Chickpea flour increased iron and zinc contents of the pizza. Water activity (aw) was decreased in fish powder and chickpea pizza. Pizza firmness and gumminess were significantly (p<0.05) increased at every level of protein source, but cohesiveness was decreased with 10% chickpea flour. Pizza chewiness was the same (P>0.05) across the levels of two protein sources. Springiness was decreased (P<0.05) with high level (10%) dried fish powder and low/intermediate level of chickpea flour. Chickpea and dried carp fish incorporation up to 7.50% in pizza at the expense of wheat flour had no effect (P>0.05) on all sensorial parameters except for odor values. The results could be useful in utilization of chickpea flour and carp fish powder in designing nutritious pizza for consumers.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29467759>Magnolol Alleviates Inflammatory Responses and Lipid Accumulation by AMP-Activated Protein Kinase-Dependent Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α Activation.</a></h2><p>Magnolol (MG) is a kind of lignin isolated from , which serves several different biological functions, such as antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective functions. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of MG against  (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammatory damage in HepG2 cells and in a tyloxapol (Ty)-induced hyperlipidemia mouse model. Our findings indicated that MG can effectively inhibit OA-stimulated tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion, reactive  species generation, and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Further study manifested that MG significantly suppressed OA-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways and that these inflammatory responses can be negated by pretreatment with inhibitors of extracellular regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (U0126 and SP600125, respectively). In addition, MG dramatically upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) translocation and reduced sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) protein synthesis and excretion, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and AKT kinase (AKT). However, MG suspended the activation of PPARα expression and was thus blocked by pretreatment with LY294002 and compound c (specific inhibitors of AKT and AMPK). Furthermore, MG clearly alleviated serum TG and total cholesterol release; upregulated AKT, AMPK, and PPARα expression; suppressed SREBP-1c generation; and alleviated hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia in Ty-induced hyperlipidemia mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MG exerts protective effects against steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and the underlying mechanism, which may be closely associated with AKT/AMPK/PPARα activation and MAPK/NF-κB/SREBP-1c inhibition.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'hyperlipedemia', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567058>A fatty gut feeling.</a></h2><p>The absorptive epithelium of the proximal small intestine converts  released during fat digestion into oleoylethanolamide (OEA), an endogenous high-affinity agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). OEA interacts with this receptor to cause a state of satiety characterized by prolonged inter-meal intervals and reduced feeding frequency. The two main branches of the autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic, contribute to this effect: the former by enabling OEA mobilization in the gut and the latter by relaying the OEA signal to brain structures, such as the hypothalamus, that are involved in feeding regulation.

At 6 weeks old, no differences in fat mass were found between SAT and VAT in WT mice, while O-SAT showed significantly higher  than that of O-VAT. The average adipocyte size of SAT (~ 4133.47 μm2) was smaller than that of VAT (~ 7438.91 μm2) in OB mice. O-SAT preadipocytes gained higher triglyceride contents and higher levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα than did O-VAT preadipocytes upon in vitro differentiation. W-SAT and W-VAT displayed no significant differences in fatty  uptake, while 1.36 fold significantly higher fatty  uptake was found in O-SAT compared to O-VAT. Approximately 52% of the radioactivity recovered in cellular lipids was found in TAG in O-SAT, which was significantly higher than the other three adipocyte types. Significantly more radiolabelled  was β-oxidized to CO2 in adipocytes from O-VAT than that from O-SAT. ATP production was significantly lower in W-SAT compared with W-VAT, whereas no significantly ATP level was observed between O-SAT and O-VAT. Expression of UCP-1 in SAT from either WT or OB mice was significantly higher than the counterpart of VAT, which demonstrated higher uncoupled respiration and lower oxidative phosphorylation in SAT.

Ultimately,  combined with insulin resistance increases the dysfunctional demand of β-cells and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes.

The present study examined the effects of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)-metabolized precursors and products, notably , on the compensatory capacity of β-cells and their relationship with regulation of the FoxO1 and Wnt pathways. The trioleate-induced compromise of insulin sensitivity blunted the compensatory response of pancreatic β-cells in primary rat islets. These events were associated with increases in the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of FoxO1. Such effects were also observed in INS-1E cells that were subjected to oleate treatment. The overexpression of human SCD1 that was accompanied by endogenously generated  also led to an increase in the nuclear abundance of FoxO1. The mechanism of the oleate-mediated subcellular localization of FoxO1 was independent of the fatty  receptor GPR40. Instead, the mechanism involved diversion of the active β-catenin pool from an interaction with transcription factor 7-like 2 toward FoxO1-mediated transcription in β-cells.

Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu).

Consistent with these results, HPLC-MS/MS analysis of skin from  patients displayed a 56% increase in nitro-conjugated linoleic  (CLA-NO) levels in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin. These results suggest that nitro-fatty acids in the skin microenvironment are products of cutaneous inflammatory responses and, in high local concentrations, may exacerbate inflammatory skin diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study was aimed to further elucidate the cellular mechanisms leading to this apoptosis in these cells. Fatty  compositions of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in pemt2 over-expressed cells and control cells, and the location of PC synthesized by PEMT2 pathway were analyzed with lipid extraction, high-performance thin layer chromatography, high-performance gas chromatography (HPGC), and [(3)H]-ethanolamine tracing. The effects of pemt2 over-expression on the mitochondrial membrane fluidity, the release of cytochrome C from , and the activity of caspases were determined by Western blot. Newly synthesized PC by PEMT2 contained more acyl groups of  (P < 0.01) and was mainly located in ; pemt2 over-expression increased the mitochondrial membrane fluidity and the release of cytochrome C from the  into the cytoplasma, which in turn activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, the key molecules in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

The relative sensitivity of cells to the antiproliferative effect of ET-18-OCH3 has been postulated to be due to the degree of inhibition of cellular acylation processes. We therefore investigated the effect of 5 micrograms/ml ET-18-OCH3 on the incorporation of fatty acids for up to 12 h, into A427 and A549 phospholipids. Significant changes observed in the incorporation of fatty acids into A427 phospholipids by the ALP were a decreased incorporation of  into PC after 8 h, an increased incorporation of linoleic  into PE after 12 h, decreased incorporation of arachidonate into PE after 3 h, and increased incorporation into PA after 5 h. Although the above changes affected the distribution of newly esterified fatty acids in the phospholipids, there was no effect on the total quantity of label incorporated in the phospholipid fraction between the experimental and control cells after 12 h. Incubation of A549 cells with ET-18-OCH3 resulted in decreased esterification of  into PC, SM, and LPC after 5 h; decreased incorporation of linoleic into PE after 12 h; and a decreased incorporation of arachidonate into SM after 1.5 h. After 12 h incubation with ET-18-OCH3, changes in the distribution of radiolabeled fatty acids were observed in the quantitatively minor phospholipids, SM and LPC. A 20% decrease in the quantity of  incorporated into the phospholipids was observed in cells incubated with the ALP; however, no differences were observed in the quantity of linoleic or arachidonic  incorporated into the phospholipids. The lack of common effects of the ALP on the incorporation of fatty acids into A427 and A549 phospholipids, coupled with the absence of changes that were more severe or manifested earlier in the more sensitive A427 cell line, suggests that the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on the acylation processes depends on the cell type and the fatty  species and is unlikely to be responsible for the relative sensitivities of the cells to the compound. Radiolabeled ET-18-OCH3 was used to examine the correlation between the amount of the compound accumulated in A427, A549, MCF7, T84, and LS174T cells and the relative susceptibilities of the cells to the ALP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863413>Elaidic  (EA) generates dysfunctional high-density lipoproteins and consumption of EA exacerbates  and fatty liver change in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>It is well known that trans-fatty acids have proatherogenic properties while HDL has antiatherogenic activities in plasma.

However, the unknown CL properties, relatively weak emission, and instability of some of them in water (e.g., black phosphorus QDs) often seriously hinder their further practical applications. Chemical modification trends have offered new properties for materials and have been proved to be desirable ways to establish sensing platforms with improved sensitivity and stability. Herein,  capped black phosphorus QDs (OA-BP QDs) with improved stability and optical properties were successfully synthesized. More importantly, an extraordinary CL emission when OA-BP QDs reacted with SO was first observed. In the CL process, OA-BP QDs acted as the catalyst to trigger singlet  (O) generation in NaHSO, and then a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) between (O)* (O dimeric aggregate) and OA-BP QDs was produced. On this basis, a new CL system for directly monitoring SO in airborne fine particulate matter (PM) was fabricated.

Longyan females (1080) with similar BW at 17 wk of age were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups, each consisting of 6 replicates of 30 birds. The basal diet (I) was a typical corn-soybean ration while the experimental diets (II to VI) substituted corn DDGS for soybean meal and wheat bran and a small reduction of corn. The level of substitution in diets (II to VI) was 6%, 12%, 18%, 24% and 30%. The experiment lasted for 18 wk. Average egg  decreased linearly as the level of corn DDGS inclusion increased (P < 0.001). Haugh unit, albumen , and proportion declined as linear responses to corn DDGS substitution (P < 0.05), but yolk color linearly increased (P < 0.001); the proportions of  (C18:1) and total monounsaturated fatty acids in egg yolk linearly decreased with increasing corn DDGS and many of the key polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like linoleic (C18:2n-6), arachidonic (C20:4n-6) and α-linolenic (C18:3n-3) acids linearly increased (P < 0.001), but not those of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3) and docoshexaenoic (C22:6n-3) acids. The PUFAs n-6/n-3 ratio linearly increased with increasing corn DDGS level (P < 0.001). Increasing corn DDGS linearly increased hepatic expression of GPX1, HO-1, and Nrf2 and hepatic activity of GSH-Px and the liver content of MDA (P < 0.001). There were no treatment effects on egg production, egg mass, feed conversion ratio, eggshell thickness, strength, and yolk cholesterol content (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the current study indicates that the use of corn DDGS is possible as a replacement, primarily for soybean meal at levels up to 18% in the diets of laying ducks without affecting laying performance, egg quality, and antioxidant status. Increasing amounts of corn DDGS linearly increased egg yolk concentrations of key fatty acids like like C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 and the antioxidant enzyme activity of GSH-Px through the Nrf2 pathway to avoid oxidative stress.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712532>Influence of different intravenous lipid emulsions on growth, development and laboratory and clinical outcomes in hospitalised paediatric patients: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Fats in the form of lipid emulsions (LEs) are an integral part of intravenous nutrition. The fatty  composition of different LEs varies. The exact composition of a LE may influence cell and tissue function and clinical outcome. Currently, it is not clear which LE might be best for paediatric patients. We conducted a systematic review of the effects of different intravenous LEs in hospitalised paediatric patients.Randomised controlled trials published in a peer reviewed journal, written in the English language, and comparing two or more different intravenous LEs in hospitalised paediatric patients were included. Data on outcomes of relevance (growth, development, laboratory and clinical outcomes) were extracted, collated and interpreted.Thirty-one articles involving 1522 infants or children were included. Most outcomes were not affected by the nature of the LE used. LEs containing fish oil, a source of omega-3 fatty acids, improved outcome of retinopathy of prematurity, decreased liver cholestasis and increased blood omega-3 fatty  levels. LEs containing olive oil increased blood  level and had a cholesterol lowering effect.Blood fatty acids are influenced by the nature of the intravenous LE used in hospitalised paediatric patients. Most studies suggest limited differences in relevant laboratory or clinical outcomes or in growth in paediatric patients receiving different LEs, although several studies do find benefits from including fish oil or olive oil.

Lenalidomide was covalently bound to FePt-NH by pH sensitive hydrazone bonding. Hyaluronic  was conjugated to amino groups of APTES while lactoferrin (Lf) was directly conjugated to excess carboxylic group present on hyaluronic  (HA) to form surface modified pH sensitive alloy-drug nanoconjugates (SPANs). The multifunctional nanoconjugates were characterized and evaluated using extensive in vitro and in vivo techniques. The nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent heating ability on exposure to alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation. The acidic microenvironment of lysozome triggered release of LND from SPANs. Owing to leaching of Fe and Pt contents, SPANs demonstrated ability to generate reactive  species (ROS) in U87MG cell line which further enhanced therapeutic effect of SPANs. Significant difference in cell viability suppression was observed in in vitro photothermal, chemo-photothermal and chemo-magnetophotothermal killing of cancer cells using SPANs in U87MG cell lines. Significant difference in heating ability and cell cytotoxicity of SPANs in comparison to alternative magnetic field and NIR irradiation was observed for DUAL-mode exposure of SPANs. The results of cellular internalization study showed efficient internalization of SPANs inside U87MG cells. The in vivo results (both qualitative and quantitative) confirmed enhanced uptake of SPANs in brain after intranasal administration with enhanced nasal and mucus penetration owing to presence of Lf.

We did this using four types of size-calibrated (10 μm diameter) and metastable (3 days) emulsions with 20% of an -rich sunflower oil and 1% of either synthetic emulsifiers (Tween 80 or sodium 2-stearoyl-lactylate) or two proteins (β-lactoglobulin or sodium caseinate). An oral fat tolerance test was performed in fasted rats by oral administration of each of these formulations in continuous or emulsified forms. Kinetic parameters (AUC, AUC, C, T, and T) for the description of the plasma triacylglycerol responses were calculated. AUC and AUC calculated for the protein groups were significantly lower than those of the control and the synthetic groups. These lower values were associated with significant decreases in the C, exacerbated by the emulsion form and with marked decreases in the T as compared to the control group. T values were differentially affected by the lipid administration forms and by the nature of the emulsifiers. As compared with the control group, T was largely increased in the sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate group, but on the contrary, largely lowered in the casein group. We concluded that the use of proteins as natural emulsifiers in lipid emulsions decreased the magnitude of post-prandial triacylglycerolemia for the same amount of ingested lipids, when the emulsion size is controlled for.

Eighty-four gestating ewes (28 pens, three per pen) were blocked by lambing day and assigned to a diet with an addition of fat at 0.39% of the DM during the last 50 d of gestation using Ca salts of a palm fatty  distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and  acids or EPA + DHA. Blood samples were taken from ewes on days 20, 1 (parturition), and 30 and from lambs on days 1 and 30 for plasma fatty  analysis. Fatty analysis of lamb RBC was performed on day 1. Colostrum samples were taken at lambing and milk samples on day 30 for fatty  analysis. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were taken from one ewe per pen on day 20 for fatty  analysis and gene expression analysis of 27 genes. Treatment × day interactions (P < 0.10) were observed for several isomers of C18:1, with concentrations that were greater in plasma of EPA + DHA ewes on day 20, but were not different on day 1 or 30. Plasma concentrations of EPA tended to be greater (P = 0.07), whereas DHA was greater (P < 0.001) in EPA + DHA ewes compared with PFAD ewes. There was no difference in EPA or DHA in adipose tissue with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation (P > 0.10). Concentrations of fatty acids with 6 to 10 carbons were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in colostrum and milk of EPA + DHA ewes. There was a treatment × day interaction with EPA + DHA ewes yielding greater EPA (P = 0.03) and DHA (P = 0.04) concentrations than PFAD in colostrum, but not in milk. Treatment × day interactions (P < 0.05) were observed for several C18:1 isomers with concentrations that were greater in EPA + DHA ewe colostrum, but were not different between treatments in milk. In lamb plasma and RBC, EPA and DHA were not different between treatments (P > 0.10). The expression of fatty  synthase and leptin was significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 tended to be increased (P = 0.08) by supplementation of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD.

First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD.

Testosterone treatment ameliorates these effects, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We compared the influence of testosterone on the expression of regulatory targets of glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism in muscle, liver, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Testicular feminised mice displayed significantly reduced GLUT4 in muscle and glycolytic enzymes in muscle, liver and abdominal subcutaneous but not visceral adipose tissue. Lipoprotein lipase required for fatty  uptake was only reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue; enzymes of fatty  synthesis were increased in liver and subcutaneous tissue.

The treatment oils (60 g/12 552 kJ per d (60 g/3000 kcal per d)) provided for 30 d were as follows: conventional canola oil, high  canola oil, high  canola oil enriched with DHA, flax/safflower oil blend and corn/safflower oil blend. Two SNP associated with FAE degradation and synthesis were studied. Post-treatment results showed overall that plasma FAE levels were modulated by dietary FA and were positively correlated with corresponding plasma FA levels; minor allele (A) carriers of SNP rs324420 in gene fatty  amide hydrolase produced higher circulating oleoylethanolamide (OEA) (P=0·0209) and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels (P=0·0002).

This study investigates the effects of FA and OZ on alleviating high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced  parameters.Male SD rats were fed with a regular rodent diet, HFFD, or HFFD supplemented with 0.05% FA or 0.16% OZ (equimolar concentrations) for 13 weeks. Food intake, organ indices, serum lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) index and cytokine levels were analyzed. The mechanisms were further investigated in -stimulated HepG2 cells by analyzing triglyceride (TG) content and lipogenesis-related gene expressions.In the in vivo study, FA and OZ exhibited similar effects in alleviating HFFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and IR. However, only OZ treatment significantly decreased liver index and hepatic TG content, lowered serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and increased serum concentration of adiponectin. In the in vitro assay, only OZ administration significantly inhibited intracellular TG accumulation and down-regulated expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1, which might facilitate OZ to enhance its hepatoprotective effect.OZ is more effective than FA in inhibiting hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Thus, FA and OZ could be used as dietary supplements to alleviate the deleterious effects of HFFD.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159640>Insight into Arthrospira platensis Δ9 desaturase: a key enzyme in poly-unsaturated fatty  synthesis.</a></h2><p>Membrane-bound Δ9 desaturase perform oxygenated desaturation reactions to insert the first double bonds within fatty acyl chains between C9 and C10 positions of most saturated substrates.

In this paper, we report homology modeling and docking studies of a Δ9 desaturase from Arthrospira platensis strain. The protein model showed high topology resemblance compared to membrane-bound desaturases with a cytoplasmic core displaying the catalytic site and a transmembrane domain created by four α-helices. The cytoplasmic cap contained the three conserved-histidine boxes typical for all membrane bound desaturases. The protein model was used to perform protein-protein docking and the dimer structure was generated. The two monomers are tightly related with hydrophobic interactions between the transmembrane domain helices.

Endotoxin increased the plasma levels of prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxane B2 and cortisol, and decreased progesterone. The severity of the clinical signs and the magnitude of the increases in plasma PGs, thromboxane B2 and cortisol tended to depend on the dose of endotoxin, but were independent of the gestation period. There was hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia and lactic acidemia. Hyperglycemia and lactic acidemia were significant only at the high dose of endotoxin. Endotoxin infusion at both doses caused a preferential mobilization of  from adipose tissue, and also had some effects on the mobilization of palmitic and stearic acids during the post-infusion period. The cows in the first trimester of gestation were more sensitive to the abortifacient effect of endotoxin than cows in the second and third trimester of gestation. The results of this study indicate that the mechanism of endotoxin-induced abortion in cows initially involves a prolonged release of PGF2 alpha and its subsequent stimulant effect on uterine smooth muscle contraction and luteolytic effect leading to a gradual decline in the plasma levels of progesterone. It was concluded that pregnancy terminates in the absence of an adequate level of progesterone, especially during the first trimester of gestation, when progesterone of extraluteal origin is not yet available, coupled with the PGF2 alpha-induced propulsive contraction of the uterus. In addition, the metabolic and circulatory failures in severe cases of , especially at the high dose of endotoxin, resulting either directly or indirectly via the release of various autacoids, catecholamines and cortisol, may also contribute to the termination of pregnancy at any stage of gestation.</p><p>Keyword:['endotoximia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609924>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and phytocomponent investigation of Basella alba leaf extract as a treatment for hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is the key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway that produces cholesterol.

It plays an important role in protein synthesis and carbohydrate and lipid . Chromium is found in trivalent Cr(III) and hexavalent Cr(VI) form; Cr(III) is relatively stable and intimately participates with many phenomena of metabolisms. Whereas, Cr(VI) is toxic, which results in growth inhibition and leading to changes in components of antioxidant systems as well as secondary metabolites. However, the molecular mechanism that is involved in Cr (VI)-induced hepatotoxicity is still unclear. For this purpose, 40 chickens were randomly assigned into two groups: the normal group (feeding the basic diet and clear water), the chromium group (16%LD, 74.24 mg/kg/day KCrO ). The samples were subjected to pathological examination and UHPLC-QE-MS non-target metabolomics method for metabolomics analysis of broiler liver using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The central venous cells of the broiler liver in the chromium poisoning group showed turbidity and flaky necrosis, nuclear condensation, nuclear rupture, and even nuclear dissolution. The differential metabolite analysis between the chromium poisoning and the control group showed that 32 differential metabolites were upregulated and 15 were downregulated in positive ion mode. Whereas,17 differential metabolites were downregulated, and 35 were downregulated in negative ion mode (P ≤ 0.05).

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure. In this study, APAP (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were employed on mice fed with a high-fat diet, and APAP (2, 4, 8 mM) were cultured with L02 cells in the presence of alcohol and . APAP treatment significantly aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation, increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in H&E and Oil red O staining results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found fewer number of autophagosomes in APAP (100 mg/kg) treated group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the intensity of hepatic mTOR was increased and AMPK was decreased in 200 mg/kg APAP treated group. Western blot analysis showed APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, while increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, respectively. In vitro study showed APAP treatment obviously increased TG activities in cell supernatant, and Oil red O staining had the same results. Western blot analysis demonstrated APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, but rapamycin treatment significantly reversed these effects of APAP. In conclusion, therapeutic dosages of APAP aggravates fat accumulation in NAFLD, the potential mechanism might be involved in inhibiting autophagy associated with the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and patients with NAFLD should use a lower dose of APAP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Colonic damage was assessed, and the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and major regulators of T cell differentiation were measured. The TFA diet reduced survival and exacerbated histological damage in mice administered DSS compared with those fed a TFA-free diet. The TFA diet significantly elevated interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12p40, IL-23p19 and retinoic -related orphan receptor (ROR)γt mRNA levels in the colons of DSS-treated animals. Moreover, IL-17A mRNA levels were elevated significantly by the TFA diet, with or without DSS treatment. We also examined the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. These cells were exposed to TFAs (linoelaidic  or elaidic ) with or without LPS and the mRNA levels of various cytokines were measured. IL-23p19 mRNA levels were increased significantly by TFAs in the absence of LPS. Cytokine expression was also higher in LPS-stimulated cells exposed to TFAs than in unexposed LPS-stimulated cells.

Here we exposed bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells and human platelets to variable glucose and fatty  concentrations. We then examined oxygen consumption and acidification rates using recently available technology in the form of an extracellular oxygen and proton flux analyzer. Acute or overnight exposure of confluent BAE cells to glucose concentrations from 5.5 to 25 mM did not enhance or change the rate of oxygen consumption (OCR) under basal conditions, during ATP synthesis, or under uncoupled conditions. Glucose also did not alter OCR in sub-confluent cells, in cells exposed to low serum, or in cells treated with added pyruvate. Likewise, overnight exposure to fatty acids of varying saturation had no such effects. Overnight exposure of BAE cells to low glucose concentration decreased maximal uncoupled respiration, but not basal or ATP related oxygen consumption. Labeled glucose oxidation to CO(2) increased, but only marginally after high glucose exposure while oleate oxidation to CO(2) decreased. Overnight exposure to linolenic , but not  or linoleic  increased extracellular acidification consistent with enhanced glycolytic metabolism.

This single-blinded 3-way cross-over pilot study aimed to investigate the ability of the two most abundant dietary plant-derived fats,  (OA) and linoleic (LA) acids, to modulate postprandial appetite and levels of circulating appetite and metabolic regulators in overweight/obese individuals. Meals were a high-carbohydrate control, a high-OA or a high-LA meal, and provided 30% of participants' estimated energy requirements. Meals were consumed after an overnight fast, with blood samples collected over 3¼ h. Appetite parameters were assessed via a validated visual analogue scale questionnaire. Hormones and other circulating factors were quantified using multiplex immunoassays. Eight participants (age 45.8 ± 3.6 (years),  mass index 32.0 ± 1.3 (kg/m²)) completed the study. All meals significantly increased fullness and reduced desire to eat. The control and high-OA meals significantly decreased prospective food intake. The high-LA meal increased ghrelin levels ( < 0.05), a hormone which encourages food intake. This was coupled with a significant acute increase in resistin levels, which impairs insulin signaling. Taken together, this study indicates that in overweight/obese individuals, high-LA meals may promote excess energy intake and alter glucose handling, though a larger cohort may be required to strengthen results.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26640323>Acute Respiratory Distress : Role of -Triggered Lung Injury and Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Lung injury especially acute respiratory distress  (ARDS) can be triggered by diverse stimuli, including fatty acids and microbes.

To determine whether any shifts in fuel use were due solely to increases in energy expenditure, we also studied a condition consisting of a single isoenergetic 45-min bout of moderate-intensity exercise (ONE). Twenty sedentary overweight or obese adults (10 men/10 women; 32.4 ± 6.3 yr; BMI, 30.6 ± 2.9 kg/m) completed all three conditions (MICRO, SED, and ONE) in a randomized order. Each condition consisted of a 3-day free-living run-in followed by a 24-h stay in a whole-room calorimeter to measure total energy expenditure (TEE) and substrate utilization. Dietary  oxidation was also assessed during the chamber stay by administering a [1-C]  tracer at breakfast. Energy intake was matched across conditions. Both MICRO and ONE increased TEE relative to SED, resulting in a negative energy balance. HOMA-IR improved in both activity conditions. MICRO increased 24-h carbohydrate oxidation compared with both ONE and SED ( P < 0.01 for both). ONE was associated with higher 24-h total  oxidation compared with SED, and higher 24-h dietary  oxidation compared with both SED and MICRO. Differences in substrate oxidation remained significant after adjusting for energy balance. In overweight and obese men and women, breaking up sitting time increased reliance upon carbohydrate as fuel over 24 h, while a single energy-matched continuous bout of exercise preferentially relies upon  over 24 h. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Insulin sensitivity, as assessed by HOMA-IR, was improved after 4 days of physical activity, independent of frequency and duration of activity bouts. Temporal patterns of activity across the day differentially affect substrate oxidation. Frequent interruptions of sedentary time with short bouts of walking primarily increase 24-h carbohydrate oxidation, whereas an energy-matched single continuous bout of moderate intensity walking primarily increased 24-h  oxidation.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'energy', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276903>Effects of algae supplementation in high-energy dietary on fatty  composition and the expression of genes involved in lipid  in Hu sheep managed under intensive finishing system.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the effect of algae supplementation in high-energy diet (HE diet) on lipid  of intensive feeding sheep.

The method is based on the reduction processes occurring at a platinum microdisk electrode involving the free fatty acids present in the matrices. To overcome problems related to the low conductivity of the samples investigated, olive oils were mixed with suitable amounts of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), tri-hexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([P][NTf]), which acted as a supporting electrolyte. Conditions for a reliable quantification of the acids were preliminarily investigated by performing voltammetric and chronoamperometric measurements in RTIL solutions containing  at different concentrations.  (OA) was chosen as a model compound as it is the main component of the FFA content in olive oils. In order to establish the effect of  on the electroanalytical responses, the reduction process of OA was investigated under both deoxygenated and oxygenated conditions. It was found that, in both situations, the current arising from the electrode process of OA depended linearly on the OA concentration over a wide range varying from 0.1% to 8% OA (w/w). This range includes FFA values which can be found on all categories of commercially available oil samples, including extra-virgin, virgin and lampante oils. Voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments were also performed in oil/RTIL samples artificially acidified (extra-virgin olive oils with known addition of ) and in natural olive oils from some commercial categories. The results obtained indicated that the electrochemical procedure developed was satisfactory in terms of both sensitivity and detection limits. The reliability of the proposed approach for the detection of FFA was finally assessed by comparison of the voltammetric/chronoamperometric values with those obtained by the official method for quantification of olive oil acidity, which is an /base volumetric titration.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The expression of genes was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Lipid droplets in the cells and tissues were stained with Oil Red O.PJ34 treatment aggravated -induced lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells and induced SREBP1 expression by modulating the modification of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). The high-fat diet-mice exhibited hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and lipid accumulation after 3 months of feeding. Although the serum level of lipid was not altered after PJ34 treatment, the expression level of lipogenic gene was up-regulated and the lipid accumulation was increased in the liver tissues of high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice. In the high-fat diet + PJ34-treated mice, the insulin sensitivity was slightly changed and the levels of blood glucose and serum insulin were decreased compared with the mice fed with a high-fat diet alone.Taken together, PARP inhibition up-regulated the expression level of lipogenic gene and significantly induced lipid accumulation in the liver, which might worsen lipid metabolism disorders.

The cause for this cognitive impairment is still not clear. One possible mechanism could be cerebral inflammation as result of a "lung-brain-crosstalk". Even mechanical ventilation itself can induce cerebral inflammation. We hypothesized, that an acute lung injury aggravates the cerebral inflammation induced by mechanical ventilation itself and leads to neuronal damage.After approval of the institutional and state animal care committee 20 pigs were randomized to one of three groups: lung injury by central venous injection of  (n = 8), lung injury by bronchoalveolar lavage in combination with one hour of injurious ventilation (n = 8) or control (n = 6). Brain tissue of four native animals from a different study served as native group. For six hours all animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 7 ml kg-1 and a scheme for positive end-expiratory pressure and inspired  fraction, which was adapted from the ARDS network tables. Afterwards the animals were killed and the brains were harvested for histological (number of neurons and microglia) and molecular biologic (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) examinations.There was no difference in the number of neurons or microglia cells between the groups. TNFalpha was significantly higher in all groups compared to native (p < 0.05), IL-6 was only increased in the lavage group compared to native (p < 0.05), IL-1beta showed no difference between the groups.With our data we can confirm earlier results, that mechanical ventilation itself seems to trigger cerebral inflammation. This is not aggravated by acute lung injury, at least not within the first 6 hours after onset. Nevertheless, it seems too early to dismiss the idea of lung-injury induced cerebral inflammation, as 6 hours might be just not enough time to see any profound effect.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822659>Hydrophobic silver nanoparticles interacting with phospholipids and stratum corneum mimic membranes in Langmuir monolayers.</a></h2><p>The interaction of hydrophobic silver nanoparticles with different phospholipids and stratum corneum mimic (SCM) membranes is studied in Langmuir monolayers. Thus, silver nanoparticles coated with  (AgNP-OA) were synthesized, characterized and incorporated in Langmuir monolayers of single phospholipids -having different chain length, saturation degree and phase state- or of a SCM mixture. The incorporation of AgNP-OA to the lipid monolayers generated an expansion of the monolayers and a decrease of the surface compressional modulus compared to the pure lipid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested that the zwitterionic choline-phospholipids can be adsorbed onto the nanoparticles' surface, which is relevant considering that phospholipids are the major constituents of the cell membrane. We also studied the changes in the topography at the mesoscale level using Brewster angle microscopy. We found the most prominent changes in the lipids with liquid-condensed phase, such as SCM, showing segregation of their components.

Challenges and opportunities.</a></h2><p>Growth in demand for foods with potentially beneficial effects on consumer health has motivated increased interest in developing strategies for improving the nutritional quality of ruminant-derived products. Manipulation of the rumen environment offers the opportunity to modify the lipid composition of milk and meat by changing the availability of fatty acids (FA) for mammary and intramuscular lipid uptake. Dietary supplementation with marine lipids, plant secondary compounds and direct-fed microbials has shown promising results. In this review, we have compiled information about their effects on the concentration of putative desirable FA (e.g. c9t11-CLA and vaccenic, , linoleic and linolenic acids) in ruminal digesta, milk and intramuscular fat. Marine lipids rich in very long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) efficiently inhibit the last step of C18 FA biohydrogenation (BH) in the bovine, ovine and caprine, increasing the outflow of t11-18:1 from the rumen and improving the concentration of c9t11-CLA in the final products, but increments in t10-18:1 are also often found due to shifts toward alternative BH pathways. Direct-fed microbials appear to favourably modify rumen lipid metabolism but information is still very limited, whereas a wide variety of plant secondary compounds, including tannins, polyphenol oxidase, essential oils, oxygenated FA and saponins, has been examined with varying success. For example, the effectiveness of tannins and essential oils is as yet controversial, with some studies showing no effects and others a positive impact on inhibiting the first step of BH of PUFA or, less commonly, the final step. Further investigation is required to unravel the causes of inconsistent results, which may be due to the diversity in active components, ruminant species, dosage, basal diet composition and time on treatments. Likewise, research must continue to address ways to mitigate negative side-effects of some supplements on animal performance (particularly, milk fat depression) and product quality (e.g. altered oxidative stability and shelf-life).</p><p>Keyword:['probiotics']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29400110>Scutellarin ameliorates nonalcoholic  disease through the PPARγ/PGC-1α-Nrf2 pathway.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is characterised by excessive accumulation of hepatic lipids and oxidative injury of hepatocytes.

This severe GRMD phenotype includes moderate atrophy of the biceps femoris (BF) as compared to unaffected normal dogs, while the long digital extensor (LDE), which functions to flex the tibiotarsal joint and serves as a digital extensor, undergoes the most pronounced atrophy. A recent microarray analysis of GRMD identified alterations in genes associated with lipid metabolism and  production.We, therefore, undertook a non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the milder/earlier stage disease GRMD BF muscle versus the more severe/chronic LDE using GC-MS to identify underlying metabolic defects specific for affected GRMD skeletal muscle.Untargeted metabolomics analysis of moderately-affected GRMD muscle (BF) identified eight significantly altered metabolites, including significantly decreased stearamide (0.23-fold of controls, p = 2.89 × 10), carnosine (0.40-fold of controls, p = 1.88 × 10), fumaric  (0.40-fold of controls, p = 7.40 × 10), lactamide (0.33-fold of controls, p = 4.84 × 10), myoinositol-2-phosphate (0.45-fold of controls, p = 3.66 × 10), and significantly increased  (1.77-fold of controls, p = 9.27 × 10), glutamic  (2.48-fold of controls, p = 2.63 × 10), and proline (1.73-fold of controls, p = 3.01 × 10). Pathway enrichment analysis identified significant enrichment for arginine/proline metabolism (p = 5.88 × 10, FDR 4.7 × 10), where alterations in L-glutamic , proline, and carnosine were found. Additionally, multiple Krebs cycle intermediates were significantly decreased (e.g., malic , fumaric , citric/isocitric , and succinic ), suggesting that altered  metabolism may be underlying the observed GRMD BF muscle dysfunction. In contrast, two pathways, inosine-5'-monophosphate (VIP Score 3.91) and 3-phosphoglyceric  (VIP Score 3.08) mainly contributed to the LDE signature, with two metabolites (phosphoglyceric  and inosine-5'-monophosphate) being significantly decreased. When the BF and LDE were compared,  the most significant metabolite was phosphoric , which was significantly less in the GRMD BF compared to control and GRMD LDE groups.The identification of elevated BF  (a long-chain fatty ) is consistent with recent microarray studies identifying altered lipid metabolism genes, while alterations in arginine and proline metabolism are consistent with recent studies identifying elevated L-arginine in DMD patient sera as a biomarker of disease.

Obese women exhibit elevated levels of the two most common dietary fatty acids, palmitate and oleate, and the maternal blood containing these nutrients bathes the surface of trophoblasts of placental villi in vivo We test the hypothesis that the composition and concentration of free fatty acids modulate viability and function of primary human villous trophoblasts in culture. We found that palmitate increases syncytiotrophoblast death, specifically by caspase-mediated apoptosis, whereas oleate does not cause enhanced cell death. Importantly, exposure to both fatty acids in equimolar amounts yielded no increase in death or apoptosis, suggesting that oleate can protect syncytiotrophoblasts from palmitate-induced death. We further found that palmitate, but not oleate or oleate with palmitate, increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, signaling through the unfolded protein response, and yielding CHOP-mediated induction of apoptosis. Finally, we show that oleate or oleate plus palmitate both lead to increased lipid droplets in syncytiotrophoblasts, whereas palmitate does not. The data show palmitate is toxic to human syncytiotrophoblasts, through the induction of ER stress and apoptosis mediated by CHOP, whereas oleate is not toxic, abrogates palmitate toxicity and induces fat accumulation. We speculate that our in vitro results offer pathways by which the metabolic milieu of the obese pregnant woman can yield villous trophoblast dysfunction and sub-optimal placental function.© 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468958> Activation of Elemicin Leads to the Inhibition of Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1.</a></h2><p>Elemicin is a constituent of natural aromatic phenylpropanoids present in many herbs and spices. However, its potential to cause toxicity remains unclear. To examine the potential toxicity and associated mechanism, elemicin was administered to mice for 3 weeks and serum metabolites were examined. Enlarged livers were observed in elemicin-treated mice, which were accompanied by lower ratios of unsaturated- and saturated-lysophosphatidylcholines in plasma, and inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 () mRNA expression in liver. Administration of the unsaturated fatty   reduced the toxicity of 1'-hydroxylelemicin, the primary oxidative metabolite of elemicin, while treatment with the SCD1 inhibitor A939572 potentiated its toxicity. Furthermore, the in vitro use of recombinant human CYPs and chemical inhibition of CYPs in human liver microsomes revealed that CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were the primary CYPs responsible for elemicin bioactivation. Notably, the CYP1A2 inhibitor α-naphthoflavone could attenuate the susceptibility of mice to elemicin-induced hepatomegaly.

A consistent neuropathological feature of ALS is the extensive  around motor neurons and axonal degeneration, evidenced by accumulation of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. Final products of inflammatory processes may be detected as a screening tool to identify treatment response. Herein, we focus on (a) detection of arachidonic  (AA) metabolization products by lipoxygenase (LOX) and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase in SOD1 mice and (b) evaluate its response to the electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA). Regarding LOX-derived products, a significant increase in 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12-HETE) levels was detected in SOD1 mice both in plasma and brain whereas no changes were observed in age-matched non-Tg mice at the onset of motor symptoms (90 days-old). In addition, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE) levels were greater in SOD1 brains compared to non-Tg. Prostaglandin levels were also increased at day 90 in plasma from SOD1 compared to non-Tg being similar in both types of animals at later stages of the disease. Administration of NO-OA 16 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s/c) three times a week to SOD1 female mice, lowered the observed increase in brain 12-HETE levels compared to the non-nitrated fatty  condition, and modified many others inflammatory markers. In addition, NO-OA significantly improved grip strength and rotarod performance compared to vehicle or OA treated animals. These beneficial effects were associated with increased hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression in the spinal cord of treated mice co-localized with reactive astrocytes. Furthermore, significant levels of NO-OA were detected in brain and spinal cord from NO-OA -treated mice indicating that nitro-fatty acids (NFA) cross brain-blood barrier and reach the central nervous system to induce neuroprotective actions. In summary, we demonstrate that LOX-derived oxidation products correlate with disease progression. Overall, we are proposing that key inflammatory mediators of AA-derived pathways may be useful as novel footprints of ALS onset and progression as well as NO-OA as a promising therapeutic compound.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528561>Palmitoleic  (n-7) increases white adipocytes GLUT4 content and glucose uptake in association with AMPK activation.</a></h2><p>Palmitoleic  was previously shown to improve glucose homeostasis by reducing hepatic glucose production and by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.

Along with uptake, palmitoleic  enhanced glucose oxidation (aerobic ), conversion to lactate (anaerobic ) and incorporation into glycerol-TAG, but reduced de novo fatty  synthesis from glucose and acetate and the activity of lipogenic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate lyase. Importantly, palmitoleic  induction of adipocyte glucose uptake and metabolism were associated with AMPK activation as evidenced by the increased protein content of phospho(p)Thr172AMPKα, but no changes in pSer473Akt and pThr308Akt.

Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy .CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy  and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major  suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis , with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

This study aims to explore whether HSS could protect carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), an essential enzyme responsible for β-oxidation of free fatty acids in , from lipotoxicity, thus alleviating hepatic lipid deposition. To test this, the HSS gene was delivered into C57BL/6J mice and efficiently expressed in the liver. NASH mice were prepared with high-fat diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet. The results showed that hepatic inflammation and liver functions were alleviated in the HSS-transfected mice; meanwhile, the activity of CPT-1 was obviously protected. Moreover,  (OA) treatment resulted in remarkable lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells; this deposition was improved by HSS transfection. Simultaneously, the CPT-1 activity, which was impaired by OA treatment, was profoundly rescued in the HSS-expressing cells. CPT-1 activity was more severely impaired if the OA treatment was combined with S15176, a CPT-1 inhibitor. However, this impairment was effectively reduced by the HSS transfection, and the effect was enhanced by C75, a CPT-1 activator. Interestingly, if the cells were transfected with HSS-siRNA, the preservation of CPT-1 provided by HSS was again diminished.

The results showed that, besides concentration, UFAs types could also influence fermentation process and volatiles in final wine. Low concentrations of UFAs (12 and 60 mg/L), especially LA and OA, significantly promoted fermentation activity and most volatiles when compared to the control, however, the effect became the inhibition with increasing concentrations of UFAs (120 and 240 mg/L). It was interesting to find that OA addition (12 and 60 mg/L) could generate more acetate esters (especially isoamyl acetate) in wine, while 12 mg/L LA facilitated more fatty acids formation (octanoic  and decanoic ). In comparison, 120 and 240 mg/L ALA produced more amount of C6 alcohols (1-hexanol) and higher alcohols (isobutyl alcohol and 2,3-butanediol). UFAs additions were unfavorable for ethyl esters formation, except for an increment of ethyl hexanoate in 12 mg/L OA wine. As a result, different aromatic profiles of wines were generated by variations of UFAs types and levels, as shown by PCA. The transcriptional data revealed that the expressions of aroma-related genes, such as , , , , , , , ,  and  were correlated with aroma compounds productions in different treatments. Our data suggested that the three UFAs have different enological functions and they could generate different aromatic profiles.

However, it is not known whether FAs are sensed by ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons to control food-motivated behavior and DA neurotransmission. We investigated the impact of the monounsaturated FA oleate in the VTA on feeding, locomotion, food reward, and DA neuronal activity and DA neuron expression of FA-handling proteins and FA uptake. A single intra-VTA injection of oleate, but not of the saturated FA palmitate, decreased food intake and increased locomotor activity. Furthermore, intra-VTA oleate blunted the rewarding effects of high-fat/sugar food in an operant task and inhibited DA neuronal firing. Using sorted DA neuron preparations from TH-eGFP mice we found that DA neurons express FA transporter and binding proteins, and are capable of intracellular transport of long-chain FA. Finally, we demonstrate that a transporter blocker attenuates FA uptake into DA neurons and blocks the effects of intra-VTA oleate to decrease food-seeking and DA neuronal activity. Together, these results suggest that DA neurons detect FA and that oleate has actions in the VTA to suppress DA neuronal activity and food seeking following cellular incorporation.

Co-expression of PPARgamma2 repressed GLUT4 promoter activity, and the addition of AA further enhanced this effect. 5'-Deletion analysis revealed three GLUT4 promoter regions that accounted for AA-mediated effects: two repression-mediating sequences at -443/-423 bp and -222/-197 bp, the deletion of either or both of which led to a partial derepression of promoter activity, and a third derepression-mediating sequence at -612/-587 bp that was required for sustaining this derepression effect.

Components studied included cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2); the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55; transient potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) and the endocannabinoid modulating enzymes N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), and their N-acylethanolamine (NAE) ligands: N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA), N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), and N-palmityolethanaolamine (PEA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Transcript levels of CB1, CB2, TRPV1, GPR55, NAPE-PLD, and FAAH were measured using RT-PCR and correlated with the tissue levels of the 3 NAEs in myometrial tissues. The tissues studied were: 1) fibroids, 2) myometrium adjacent/juxtaposed to the fibroid lesions, and 3) normal myometrium. Thirty-seven samples were processed for NAE measurements and 28 samples were used for RT-PCR analyses. RESULTS FAAH expression was significantly lower in fibroids, resulting in a NAPE-PLD: FAAH ratio that favors higher AEA levels in pre-menopausal tissues, whilst PEA levels were significantly lower, particularly in post-menopausal women, suggesting PEA protects against fibroid pathogenesis. The CB1: CB2 ratio was lower in fibroids, suggesting that loss of CB1 expression affects the fibroid cell phenotype. Significant correlations between reduced FAAH, CB1, and GPR55 expression and PEA in fibroids indicate that the loss of these endocannabinoid system components are biomarkers of leiomyomata. CONCLUSIONS Loss of expression of CB1, FAAH, GPR55, and PEA production are linked to the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids and further understanding of this might eventually lead to better disease indicators or the development of therapeutic potentials that might eventually be used in the management of uterine fibroids.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7216545>A case-control study of diet and colo-rectal .</a></h2><p>A case-control study of  of the  and rectum has been conducted in Calgary, Alberta and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Data on a number of potential non-nutrient risk factors for bowel  and on the consumption of 9 nutrients in the 2-month period up to 6 months before interview were analysed. The dietary data thus refer to recent diet consumed in a period antedating the diagnosis of, and in most cases symptoms from, large-bowel  in the cases, and a corresponding time period in the controls. The major findings were an elevated risk for those with a history of bowel polyps, and for those with an elevated intake of calories, total fat, total protein, saturated fat,  and cholesterol. No association was seen with an elevated intake of crude fibre, Vitamin C and linoleic . The nutrients for which an increased risk was demonstrated were highly correlated, though multivariate analysis using logistic regression indicated highest risk for saturated fat, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. The findings in both  sites, both sexes and with both sets of controls were quantitatively very similar.

The objective of the present project was to examine the effect of supplementation with 18:1 isomers, both positional and geometrical, as compared to 18:0 on the growth, membrane fatty  composition and the phosphoinositide cycle of HT-29 human  cells. Cells were supplemented with 30 microM stearic  (18:0), elaidic  (18:1, n9, trans),  (18:1, n9, cis), vaccenic  (18:1, n7, cis) or trans-vaccenic  (18:1, n7, trans) as sodium salts complexed to fatty -free bovine serum. Cells were grown in these media for 9 days. Cell growth was examined by counting the number of cells and expressed as percentage of control (18:0 supplemented cells). The phosphoinositide (PI) cycle was examined by measuring the inositol phosphate (IP) released from phosphoinositides in the absence (basal) or presence of stimuli (0.1 mM carbachol, 0.1 mM A23187 or 20 mM NaF). The results obtained indicated that cis and trans n7 fatty acids inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells by 11% and 23%, respectively, as compared to 18:0 supplementation. 18:1, n9 had no effect on tumor growth. Supplementation with all forms of 18:1 resulted in an increase in IP and IP2 production as compared to 18:0 supplemented cells without influencing IP3. The presence of the double bond at the 9 position in the supplemented fatty  increases total IP production by 59% and in the cis form by 37% above the control. The breakdown of phosphoinositides in the absence and presence of several stimuli supports the observed finding on IP. Trans fatty  supplementation resulted in lower hydrolysis of PI as compared to cis fatty acids. It is concluded that the observed inhibition of tumor growth by the vaccenic acids may be mediated by their effect(s) on the PI cycle which may be associated with their incorporation into membrane lipids.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923704>Erythrocyte linoleic , but not , is associated with improvements in body composition in men and women.</a></h2><p>Supplementation with linoleic  (LA; 18:2Ω6)-rich oils increases lean mass and decreases trunk adipose mass in people.

Additionally, we tested for relationships of  (OA) and the sum of long chain omega-three fatty acids (LC-Ω3-SUM), on the same outcomes.Men and women (N = 139) were evaluated for body composition, insulin resistance, and serum inflammatory markers, IL-6, and c-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte fatty  composition after an overnight fast. LA was positively related to appendicular lean mass/body mass index and inversely related to trunk adipose mass. Additionally, LA was inversely related to insulin resistance and IL-6. While there was an inverse relationship between OA or LC-Ω3-SUM with markers of inflammation, there were no relationships between OA or LC-Ω3-SUM with body composition or HOMA-IR.Higher erythrocyte LA was associated with improved body composition, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Erythrocyte OA or LC-Ω3-SUM was unrelated to body composition and insulin resistance. There is much controversy about whether all unsaturated fats have the same benefits for  and weight gain.

Although the extensive efforts have been made in overcoming chemoresistance, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Cancer cells reprogram cellular metabolism to satisfy the demands of malignant phenotype. To reveal roles of cancer metabolism in regulating chemoresistance, we profiled the metabolic characteristics in paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells by flux assay. Glucose and oleate metabolism were significantly different between resistant and non-resistant cells. In addition, targeting metabolism as a strategy to overcome drug resistance was investigated using specific metabolic inhibitors. Inhibition of  and oxidative phosphorylation by 2-deoxyglucose and malonate, respectively, potentiated the effects of paclitaxel on nonresistant lung adenocarcinoma cells but not paclitaxel-resistant cells.

Thus, the aim of our study was (i) to evaluate the effects of three dietary free fatty acids (FFA) (elaidic (EA),  (OA) and palmitic  (PA)) on U937 human monocytes, and (ii) to study the eventual benefits of bezafibrate (BZF), a pan-agonist for PPAR isoforms (α, γ and δ) in U937 cells treated with FFA. Morphologic and functional changes were investigated by microscopic and flow cytometric methods. Cellular lipid content, lipid droplets and FA composition were identified and studied. All analyses were also realized in association with or without BZF. Contrary to OA and PA, EA slightly induced both propidium iodide-positive cells and mitochondrial depolarization. In addition, in contrast to OA and PA, EA induced only a slight increase in superoxide anion production. However, EA and OA promoted cytoplasmic lipid droplets accumulation. Only EA and OA significantly increased CD36 expression. It is noteworthy that BZF had a more or less pronounced protective effect against EA-, OA- and PA-induced side effects: BZF attenuated the impaired cell viability and inflammatory response, decreased superoxide anion production and prevented the accumulation of neutral and polar lipids. The effects were less pronounced with OA and PA than with EA. Altogether, our data revealed a benefit of BZF on the side effects induced especially with EA. It may thus be of interest in preventing the early stages of atherosclerotic plaque formation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, a major limitation to their widespread use is represented by neurotoxicity that leads to peripheral neuropathy. In this study we evaluated the roles of a proven immunotherapeutic agent [Gc-protein-derived macrophage activating factor (GcMAF)] in preventing or decreasing oxaliplatin-induced neuronal damage and in modulating microglia activation following oxaliplatin-induced damage. The effects of oxaliplatin and of a commercially available formula of GcMAF [-GcMAF (OA-GcMAF)] were studied in human neurons (SH-SY5Y cells) and in human microglial cells (C13NJ). Cell density, morphology and viability, as well as production of cAMP and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), markers of neuron regeneration [neuromodulin or growth associated protein-43 (Gap-43)] and markers of microglia activation [ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and B7-2], were determined. OA-GcMAF reverted the damage inflicted by oxaliplatin on human neurons and preserved their viability. The neuroprotective effect was accompanied by increased intracellular cAMP production, as well as by increased expression of VEGF and neuromodulin. OA-GcMAF did not revert the effects of oxaliplatin on microglial cell viability. However, it increased microglial activation following oxaliplatin-induced damage, resulting in an increased expression of the markers Iba1 and B7-2 without any concomitant increase in cell number. When neurons and microglial cells were co-cultured, the presence of OA-GcMAF significantly counteracted the toxic effects of oxaliplatin. Our results demonstrate that OA-GcMAF, already used in the  of advanced cancers, may significantly contribute to neutralizing the neurotoxicity induced by oxaliplatin, at the same time possibly concurring to an integrated anticancer effect. The association between these two powerful anticancer molecules would probably produce the dual effect of reduction of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, together with possible synergism in the overall anticancer effect.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27073470>Low simvastatin concentrations reduce -induced steatosis in HepG cells: An  model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an inflammatory condition caused by hepatic lipid accumulation that is associated with insulin resistance, diabetes and . Although statins should be used with caution in liver diseases, they are increasingly investigated as a possible treatment for NAFLD. The present study recreated an  model of NAFLD using HepG cells exposed to  (OA), which was used to quantify OA-induced lipid accumulation in HepG cells treated with various concentrations of simvastatin. In addition, the effect of simvastatin on HepG cell morphology and microparticle generation as a marker of cell apoptosis was assessed. OA-induced lipid accumulation was quantified by Oil Red O staining and extraction for optical density determination. Stained lipid droplets were visualized using phase contrast microscopy. Furthermore, HepG cell-derived microparticles were counted by flow cytometry subsequent to staining for Annexin V. HepG cells treated with 0-1 mM OA showed dose-dependent lipid accumulation. Treatment of HepG cells with increasing concentrations of simvastatin followed by treatment with 1 mM OA showed that low simvastatin concentrations (4-10 µM) were able to reduce lipid accumulation by ~40%, whereas high simvastatin concentrations (20 and 30 µM) induced apoptotic changes in cell morphology and increased the production of Annexin V microparticles. This suggests that low simvastatin doses may have a role in preventing NAFLD. However, further investigations are required to confirm this action  and to determine the underlying mechanism by which simvastatin reduces hepatic steatosis.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14697232>Increased expression and activity of 11beta-HSD-1 in diabetic islets and prevention with troglitazone.</a></h2><p>To determine if increased local production of glucocorticoids by the pancreatic islets might play a role in the spontaneous noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of obesity, we compared islet 11beta-HSD-1 mRNA and activity in islets of obese prediabetic and diabetic Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) (fa/fa) rats and lean wild-type (+/+) controls.

Exogenous phospholipase C inhibited ketogenesis in the presence of 0.5 mM oleate. Experiments employing [1-14C]oleate, however, indicated that the mechanism involved in the anti-ketogenic action of exogenous phospholipase C is distinct from that of vasopressin. The decreased rate of the production of -soluble products from [1-14C]oleate in response to vasopressin could be explained by the sum of the increased rates of 14CO2 formation and [1-14C]oleate esterification. By contrast, exogenous phospholipase C suppressed not only the formation of -soluble products but also 14CO2 production and [1-14C]oleate esterification. Indeed, phospholipase C greatly inhibited [1-14C]oleate uptake into hepatocytes. It is suggested that the alteration of the architecture of plasma membrane by exogenous phospholipase C may lead to the disturbance of oleate uptake and consequent general suppression of oleate metabolism. Exogenous phospholipase A2, arachidonic  and OAG increased ketogenesis regardless of the presence of oleate.

After 24 h treatment of the studying compounds, cellular AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) protein levels and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1 activities, intracellular lipid contents, mRNA expression levels of target genes, glucose consumption, and glucose production amounts were determined. Compound C (CC) was used in the blocking experiments. Our results showed that MB salt increased p-AMPKα (Thr172)/p-ACC (Ser79) levels and CPT1 activity and suppressed - (OA-) induced lipid accumulation and upregulation of lipogenic genes potently in HepG2 cells. The above activities of MB salt were AMPK dependent and were superior to those of M or B when administered at an equal molar concentration. MB salt enhanced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and suppressed gluconeogenesis more potently than M or B alone. The inhibiting activity of MB salt on cellular gluconeogenesis was AMPK dependent. Our results may support MB salt as a new kind of agent for the development of novel lipid or glucose-lowering drugs in the future.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926950>Effects of imidazoline-like drugs on liver and adipose tissues, and their role in preventing obesity and associated cardio-metabolic disorders.</a></h2><p>We previously observed that selective agonists of the sympatho-inhibitory I imidazoline receptors (LNP ligands) have favorable effects on several cardiovascular and metabolic disorders defining the metabolic syndrome, including . The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of LNPs on adiposity and the mechanisms involved, and to evaluate their impact on metabolic homeostasis.Young Zucker fa/fa rats were treated with LNP599 (10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Effects on , adiposity (regional re-distribution, morphology, and function of adipose tissues), cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis, and liver function were evaluated. Direct effects on insulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling were studied in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.LNP599 treatment limited the age-dependent remodeling and inflammation of subcutaneous, epididymal, and visceral adipose tissues, and prevented total fat deposits and the development of obesity.  stabilization was not related to reduced food intake but rather to enhanced energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were also improved and were significantly correlated with  but not with plasma norepinephrine. Insulin and AMPK signaling were enhanced in hepatic tissues of treated animals, whereas blood markers of hepatic disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced. In cultured HepG2 cells, LNP ligands phosphorylated AMPK and the downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevented -induced intracellular lipid accumulation. They also significantly potentiated insulin-mediated AKT activation and this was independent from AMPK.Selective I imidazoline receptor agonists protect against the development of adiposity and obesity, and the associated cardio-metabolic disorders. Activation of I receptors in the liver, leading to stimulation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK and insulin sensitization, and in adipose tissues, leading to improvement of morphology and function, are identified as peripheral mechanisms involved in the beneficial actions of these ligands.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'inflammation', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3778417>The role of fatty acids in ischemic tissue injury: difference between  and palmitic .</a></h2><p>Guinea pig hearts were subjected to low-flow perfusion (0.3 ml/g fresh weight/min) with an oxygen depleted perfusate.

Here we report stable CsPbI perovskite NCs and their use in hybrid light emitting diodes (LEDs), which combine in one system the NCs and a blue GaN-based LED. Nanocrystals with improved morphological and optical properties are obtained by optimizing the post-synthesis replacement of  ligands with iminodibenzoic : the NCs have a long shelf-life (>2 months), stability under different environmental conditions, and a high QY, of up to 90%, in the visible spectral range. Ligand replacement enables the engineering of the morphological and optical properties of the NCs. Furthermore, the NCs can be used to coat the surface of a GaN-LED to realize a stable diode where they are excited by blue light from the LED under low current injection conditions, resulting in emissions at distinct wavelengths in the visible range.

The inflammation is evoked directly by , which is hydrolyzed from sebum by lipases secreted by skin microorganisms. Although the skin fungal genus, Malassezia, is thought to be the causative agent of SD, analysis of the bacterial  of skin samples of patients with SD is necessary to clarify any association with Malassezia because the skin  comprises diverse bacterial and fungal genera. In the present study, bacterial microbiotas were analyzed at non-lesional and lesional sites of 24 patients with SD by pyrosequencing and qPCR. Principal coordinate analysis revealed clear separation between the  of non-lesional and lesional sites. Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Propionibacterium were abundant at both sites. Propionibacterium was abundant at non-lesional sites, whereas Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus predominated at lesional sites; however, the extent of Propionibacterium colonization did not differ significantly between lesional and non-lesional sites according to qPCR. Given that these abundant bacteria hydrolyze sebum, they may also contribute to SD development. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial microbiotas of the skin of SD patients.© 2016 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization', 'microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29180108>Palmitate induces neuroinflammation, ER stress, and Pomc mRNA expression in hypothalamic mHypoA-POMC/GFP neurons through novel mechanisms that are prevented by oleate.</a></h2><p>Dietary fats can modulate brain function. How free fatty acids (FFAs) alter hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons remain undefined. The saturated FFA, palmitate, increased neuroinflammatory and ER stress markers, as well as Pomc mRNA levels, but did not affect insulin signaling, in mHypoA-POMC/GFP-2 neurons. This effect was mediated through the MAP kinases JNK and ERK. Further, the increase in Pomc was dependent on palmitoyl-coA synthesis, but not de novo ceramide synthesis, as inhibition of SPT enhanced palmitate-induced Pomc expression, while methylpalmitate had no effect. While palmitate concomitantly induces neuroinflammation and ER stress, these effects were independent of changes in Pomc expression. Palmitate thus has direct acute effects on Pomc, which appears to be important for negative feedback, but not directly related to neuroinflammation. The monounsaturated FFA oleate completely blocked the palmitate-mediated increase in neuroinflammation, ER stress, and Pomc mRNAs.

Owing to its advantageous agronomic properties, C. myconis might have industrial applications. However, this species needs to be comprehensively characterized before any potential use. In a previous study, the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of different C. myconis tissues were characterized. This investigation was extended to examine the cytotoxic potential of selected plant tissues (flowers and green parts) using a HepG2 cell line by utilizing the lysosomal neutral red uptake assay or mitochondrial (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In addition, the macronutrients content, lipophilic compounds (fatty acids, tocopherols), and amino acids were also determined. C. myconis flowers were used in the senescence stage, which was previously identified as the stage that presented maximal phenolic content and highest antioxidant activity. In contrast, stems and leaves were employed due to their high biomass proportion. Regarding cytotoxicity, mitochondrial and lysosomal damage was only significant when HepG2 cells were exposed to the highest extract concentrations (stems and leaves, 0.9 mg/ml; senescent flowers, 0.3 mg/ml). Chemically, the senescent flowers were mostly characterized by their high levels of fat, amino acids (especially threonine), , β-, and γ-tocopherol, while stems and leaves contained high concentrations of carbohydrates, linolenic , and α-tocopherol.

In this study, we investigated the cellular response following accumulation of  (OA), a monounsaturated fatty , in human Chang liver cells. OA droplets were distributed freely in the cytoplasm and/or degraded within lysosomes. OA exposure increased ATP production and concomitantly dilated . At 24h after OA exposure, cell viability decreased slightly and was coupled with a reduction in mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration, the alteration in cell viability was also associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the cell cycle. Moreover, OA treatment increased the expression of autophagy- and apoptotic cell death-related proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we investigated the role of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, in the cellular response elicited by OA accumulation. OA-induced changes in cell viability and ATP production were rescued to control levels when cells were pretreated with pifithrin-alpha (PTA), a p53 inhibitor. By contrast, the expressions of LC3-II and perilipin, proteins required for lipophagy, were down-regulated by PTA pretreatment. Taken together, our results suggest that p53 plays a key role in the cellular response elicited by OA accumulation in Chang liver cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of these fatty acids on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory processes in mouse microglial cells (BV-2 cells).

NO changes in these inhibitory effects were observed with AH7614, a G-protein coupled receptor 120 antagonist, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors antagonists, GW6471 and GW9662. In addition, KetoC and HYA did not inhibit translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, or IκB degradation. Similarly, no effect on p38 or JNK phosphorylation was observed.

Treatment did not significantly affect the concentration of LDL with apoCIII, a subspecies highly associated with CVD risk. OM3-CA increased selectively the concentration of LDL that does not contain apoCIII, a subspecies with a weak relation to coronary heart disease.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and linolenic  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and energy metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and  acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'probiotics']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791711>Bioremediation and lipid synthesis through mixotrophic algal consortia in municipal wastewater.</a></h2><p>Algae grown in outdoor reactors (volume: 10 L and depth: 20 cm) were fed directly with filtered and sterilised municipal wastewater.

In this work, cDNA microarray technology was applied to analyze the transcriptional discrepancies of wine yeast (commercial wine yeast Lalvin EC1118) fermenting in synthetic grape must supplemented with different concentrations of a mixture of UFAs (including linoleic , , and α-linolenic ). The results showed that the initial addition of a high level of UFAs can significantly enrich the intracellular UFAs when compared to a low addition of UFAs and further increase the cell population and most volatiles, including higher alcohols and esters, except for several fatty acids. Microarray analyses identified that 63 genes were upregulated, and 91 genes were downregulated during the different fermentation stages. The up-regulated genes were involved in yeast growth and proliferation, stress responses and amino  transportation, while the repressed genes were associated with lipid and sterol biosynthesis, amino  , TCA cycle regulation, mitochondrial respiration, and stress responses. Unexpectedly, the genes directly related to the biosynthesis of volatile compounds did not vary substantially between the fermentations with the high and low UFA additions. The beneficial aromatic function of the UFAs was ascribed to the increased biomass and amino  transportation, considering that the incorporation of the additional UFAs in yeast cells maintains high membrane fluidity and increases the ability of the cells to resist deleterious conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of UFAs in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis during wine fermentation and suggested that the improvement of the resistance of yeast to extreme stresses during alcoholic fermentation is essential to effectively modulate and improve the production of aroma compounds. A potential way to achieve this goal could be the rational increase of the UFA contents in grape must.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26506509>CD73 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell functions and facilitates atherosclerotic plaque formation.</a></h2><p>Extracellular adenosine, generated by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) via enzymatic catalyzation, has been found to facilitate atherosclerosis (AS). Thus, suppressing CD73 may attenuate AS. In this study, we evaluated the role of CD73 during AS development and further explored cellular and molecular mechanism in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In a mouse model of carotid artery ligation, inactivation of CD73 inhibited migration and proliferation of vascular SMCs. In in vitro experiments, RNA interference of CD73 inhibited migration, proliferation, and foam cell transformation of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells. Further, we established an atherosclerotic model using ApoE-/- mice fed with a western diet for 16 weeks. Inactivation of CD73-attenuated AS and  in ApoE-/- mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD73 facilitates AS by promoting migration, proliferation, and foam cell transformation of vascular SMCs and elevating serum lipid levels.

However, the introgression of some beneficial wild traits may be paralleled by negative effects on some other important agronomic and quality traits. From the quality point of view, virgin olive oil (VOO) from olive cultivars is highly appreciated for its fatty  composition (high monounsaturated  content) and the presence of several minor components. However, the composition of VOO from wild origin and its comparison with VOO from olive cultivars has been scarcely studied. In this work, the variability for fruit characters (fruit  and oil content, OC), fatty  composition, and minor quality components (squalene, sterols and tocopherols content and composition) was studied in a set of plant materials involving three different origins: wild genotypes ( = 32), cultivars ( = 62) and genotypes belonging to cultivar × wild progenies ( = 62). As expected, values for fruit size and OC in wild olives were lower than those obtained in cultivated materials, with intermediate values for cultivar × wild progenies. Wild olives showed a remarkably higher C16:0 percentage and tocopherol content in comparison to the cultivars. Contrarily, lower C18:1 percentage, squalene and sterol content were found in the wild genotypes, while no clear differences were found among the different plant materials regarding composition of the tocopherol and phytosterol fractions. Some common highly significant correlations among components of the same chemical family were found in all groups of plant materials. However, some other correlations were specific for one of the groups. The results of the study suggested that the use of wild germplasm in olive breeding programs will not have a negative impact on fatty  composition, tocopherol content, and tocopherol and phytosterol profiles provided that selection for these compounds is conducted from early generations. Important traits such as tocopherol content could be even improved by using wild parents.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899878>Comparative Proteomic Study of Fatty -treated Myoblasts Reveals Role of Cox-2 in Palmitate-induced .</a></h2><p>Accumulated studies demonstrate that saturated fatty acids (FAs) such as palmitic  (PA) inhibit  signaling in skeletal muscle cells and monounsaturated fatty acids such as  (OA) reverse the effect of PA on  signaling. The detailed molecular mechanism of these opposite effects remains elusive. Here we provide a comparative proteomic study of skeletal myoblast cell line C2C12 that were untreated or treated with PA, and PA plus OA. A total of 3437 proteins were quantified using SILAC in this study and 29 proteins fall into the pattern that OA reverses PA effect. Expression of some these proteins were verified using qRT-PCR and Western blot. The most significant change was cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). In addition to whole cell comparative proteomic study, we also compared lipid droplet (LD)-associated proteins and identified that Cox-2 was one of three major altered proteins under the FA treatment. This finding was then confirmed using immunofluorescence. Finally, Cox-2 selective inhibitor, celecoxib protected cells from PA-reduced  signaling Akt phosphorylation. Together, these results not only provide a dataset of protein expression change in FA treatment but also suggest that Cox-2 and lipid droplets (LDs) are potential players in PA- and OA-mediated cellular processes.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429218>Acyl-chain selectivity and physiological roles of  fatty -binding proteins.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) kinase produces acyl-phosphate for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.

Here, we report the structures of FakB1 bound to four saturated FAs at 1.6-1.93 Å resolution. We observed that the different FA structures are accommodated within a slightly curved hydrophobic cavity whose length is governed by the conformation of an isoleucine side chain at the end of the tunnel. The hydrophobic tunnel in FakB1 prevents the binding of -unsaturated FAs, which are instead accommodated by the kinked tunnel within the FakB2 protein. The differences in the FakB interiors are not propagated to the proteins' surfaces, preserving the protein-protein interactions with their three common partners, FakA, PlsX, and PlsY. Using cellular thermal shift analyses, we found that FakB1 binds FA , whereas a significant proportion of FakB2 does not. Incorporation of exogenous FA into phospholipid in Δ and Δ knockout strains revealed that FakB1 does not efficiently activate unsaturated FAs. FakB2 preferred unsaturated FAs, but also allowed the incorporation of saturated FAs. These results are consistent with a model in which FakB1 primarily functions in the recycling of the saturated FAs produced by  , whereas FakB2 activates host-derived oleate, which  does not produce but is abundant at infection sites.© 2019 Cuypers et al.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26497211>Identification of cytochrome CYP2E1 as critical mediator of synergistic effects of alcohol and cellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in vitro.</a></h2><p>Clinical studies propose a causative link between the consumption of alcohol and the development and progression of liver disease in obese individuals. However, it is incompletely understood how alcohol and obesity interact and whether the combined effects are additive or synergistic. In this study, we developed an in vitro model to address this question. Lipid accumulation in primary human hepatocytes was induced by incubation with . Subsequently, steatotic and control hepatocytes were incubated with up to 50 mM alcohol. This alcohol concentration on its own revealed only minimal effects but significantly enhanced oleate-induced  and cellular triglyceride content compared to control cells. Similarly, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory gene expression as well as CYP2E1 levels and activity were synergistically induced by alcohol and steatosis. CYP2E1 inhibition blunted these synergistic pathological effects. Notably, alcohol and cellular steatosis also induced autophagy in a synergistic manner, and also this was mediated via CYP2E1. Further induction of autophagy ameliorated the joint effects of alcohol and  on hepatocellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory gene expression while inhibition of autophagy further enhanced the dual pathological effects. Further analyses revealed that the joint synergistic effect of alcohol and steatosis on autophagy was mediated via activation of the JNK-pathway. In summary, our data indicate that alcohol induces not only pathological but also protective mechanisms in steatotic hepatocytes via CYP2E1. These findings may have important implications on the prognosis and treatment of alcoholic liver disease particularly in obese individuals.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30532639>Ginkgolide C reduced -induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Ginkgolide C, isolated from , is a diterpene lactone that has multiple biological functions and can improve Alzheimer disease and platelet aggregation. Ginkgolide C also inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The present study evaluated whether ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and regulated the molecular mechanism of lipogenesis in -induced HepG2 hepatocytes. HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM  for 48 h to induce a fatty liver cell model. Then, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of ginkgolide C for 24 h. Staining with Oil Red O and the fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 revealed that ginkgolide C significantly reduced excessive lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Ginkgolide C decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c to block the expression of fatty  synthase. Ginkgolide C treatment also promoted the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation level of hormone-sensitive lipase to enhance the decomposition of triglycerides. In addition, ginkgolide C stimulated CPT-1 to activate fatty  β-oxidation, significantly increased sirt1 and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for suppressed fatty  synthesis in hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis through the sirt1/AMPK pathway in -induced fatty liver cells.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214798>Mucoadhesive In Situ Gelling Liquid Crystalline Precursor System to Improve the Vaginal Administration of Drugs.</a></h2><p>The vaginal mucosa is a very promising route for drug administration due to its high permeability and the possibility to bypass first pass ; however, current vaginal dosage forms present low retention times due to their dilution in vaginal fluids, which hampers the efficacy of many pharmacological treatments. In order to overcome these problems, this study proposes to develop a mucoadhesive in situ gelling liquid crystalline precursor system composed of 30% of  and cholesterol (7:1), 40% of ethoxylated and propoxylated cetyl alcohol, and 30% of a dispersion of 16% Poloxamer 407. The effect of the dilution with simulated vaginal fluid (SVF) on this system was evaluated by polarized light microscopy (PLM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), rheological studies, texture profile analysis (TPA), mucoadhesion study, in vitro drug release test using hypericin (HYP) as drug model, and cytotoxicity assay. PLM and SAXS confirmed the formation of an isotropic system. After the addition of three different concentrations of SVF (30, 50, and 100%), the resultant formulations presented anisotropy and characteristics of viscous lamellar phases. Rheology shows that formulations with SVF behaved as a non-Newtonian fluid with suitable shear thinning for vaginal application. TPA and mucoadhesion assays indicated the formation of long-range ordered systems as the amount of SVF increases which may assist in the fixation of the formulation on the vaginal mucosa. The formulations were able to control about 75% of the released HYP demonstrating a sustained release profile.

HEE were mainly composed of chlorogenic , hyperoside, isoquercitrin, rutin, vitexin, quercetin, and apigenin by HPLC analysis. HEE administration significantly lowered levels of the total cholesterols, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as compared to the high-fat diet model. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify adipose metabolite profiles. Numerous endogenous molecules were altered by high-fat diet and restored following intervention of HEE. Metabolites elevated in adipose, including l-threonine, aspartic , glutamine, mannose, inositol and , were detected after HEE consumption. Fifteen metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of hyperlipidemia.

Palmitate and oleate, but not long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, caused a pronounced accumulation of c-fos and nur-77 mRNAs in beta-cells (INS cells) to an extent similar to that produced by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The effect was dose dependent and occurred at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 mmol/l in the presence of 0.5% albumin. The action of the fatty  occurred at the transcriptional level, and the mRNA accumulation displayed a bell-shaped kinetics with a maximal effect at 1 h. 2-Bromopalmitate was ineffective, indicating that fatty acids must be metabolized to cause their effect. Neither fatty  was able to induce c-fos and nur-77 in PKC-downregulated cells or cells incubated in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, suggesting involvement of the PKC and Ca2+ signaling pathways. Palmitate and oleate also increased c-fos protein expression and DNA binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1. Oleate, but not palmitate, increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in INS cells. Finally, both palmitate and oleate caused c-fos and nur-77 mRNA accumulation in isolated rat islets.

However, few data are available regarding the effects of α-LA-OA on energy metabolism. In this study, we measured glycolysis and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to α-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that α-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to α-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the glycolysis process and the tricarboxylic  cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein β subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that α-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the energy demand.

An association between risk of acquiring infectious diseases and increased levels of free fatty acids postpartum has been suggested, and the use of omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA) has been proposed as a beneficial strategy to improve immunity and fertility. The goal of our study was to demonstrate the presence of free fatty  (FFA)-1 and 4 receptors in endometrial cells and to investigate their role on DHA interference in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory endometrial activation. We demonstrated that the bovine endometrial (BEND) cells line and bovine endometrium express both FFA1 and FFA4 receptors. FFA1 and FFA4 receptors were localized in the epithelium lining the endometrial cavity and in endometrial glands whereas in BEND cells a characteristic cell membrane localization of both receptors was observed. DHA, a FFA4 natural agonist, increased intracellular calcium mobilization in BEND cells, but the FFA1 agonists  and linoleic acids did not increase this response. DHA-induced intracellular calcium mobilization was inhibited by the FFA4 and FFA1 antagonists AH7614 and GW1100, respectively. DHA significantly reduced LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, but none of the antagonists reduced the effect produced by DHA. On the contrary, linoleic  increased LPS-induced PGE2 production. In conclusion, endometrial cells express FFA4 and FFA1 receptors, and DHA induces intracellular calcium release via FFA4 and FFA1 receptors. DHA reduces PGE2, but this response was not mediated by FFA4 or FFA1 receptors.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28258156>Maternal metabolic stress may affect oviduct gatekeeper .</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that elevated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) modify  bovine oviduct epithelial cell (BOEC) metabolism and  .

FITC-albumin was used for monolayer permeability assessment and related to transepithelial electric resistance (TER). Fatty  (FA), glucose, lactate and pyruvate concentrations were measured in spent medium. Intracellular lipid droplets (LD) and FA uptake were studied using Bodipy 493/503 and immunolabelling of FA transporters (FAT/CD36, FABP3 and CAV1). BOEC-mRNA was retrieved for qRT-PCR. Results revealed that apical NEFA reduced relative TER increase (46.85%) during treatment and increased FITC-albumin flux (27.59%) compared to other treatments. In basal NEFA, FAs were transferred to the apical compartment as free FAs: mostly palmitic and  increased respectively 56.0 and 33.5% of initial FA concentrations. Apical NEFA allowed no FA transfer, but induced LD accumulation and upregulated FA transporter expression (↑CD36, ↑FABP3 and ↑CAV1). Gene expression in apical NEFA indicated increased anti-apoptotic (↑) and anti-oxidative (↑) capacity, upregulated lipid metabolism (↑ ↑ and ↓) and FA uptake (↑).

The aim of this study was to assess the individual relationship between dietary saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids with postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides. We assessed postprandial β-cell function (by the insulinogenic index and the ratio of the insulin to glucose areas under the time-concentration curve) and insulin sensitivity (by the oral glucose and the minimal model insulin sensitivity indices) over four nonconsecutive, randomly assigned, high-fat meals containing a panel of SFA (palmitic and stearic acids), MUFA (palmitoleic and  acids) and PUFA (linoleic and α-linolenic acids) in 14 subjects with normal and in 14 subjects with high fasting triglycerides. The proportions of each fatty  in the meals and the values for surrogate measures of postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity were subjected to a Pearson correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis, which revealed two classes of dietary fatty acids for regulating postprandial glucose homeostasis. We successfully discriminated the adverse effects of SFA palmitic  from the beneficial effects of MUFA  on postprandial β-cell function (r ≥ 0.84 for SFA palmitic  and r ≥ -0.71 for MUFA ; P < 0.05) and insulin sensitivity (r ≥ -0.92 for SFA palmitic  and r ≥ 0.89 for MUFA ; P < 0.001) both in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides.

These applications require surface engineering of as-prepared nanocrystals, commonly coated with hydrophobic ligand of , to enable an aqueous dispersion. However, literature-reported approaches often require a long time and/or multiple step treatment, along with several fold upconversion luminescence (UCL) intensity decrease. Here, we describe a strategy allowing oleate-capped UCNPs to become water-soluble and open-modified, with almost undiminished UCL, through ultrasonication of minutes. The prompt phase transfer was enabled by oleate-mediated supramolecular self-assembly of amino modified β-cyclodextrin (amino-β-CD) onto UCNPs surface. We showed that this method is valid for a wide range of UCNPs with quite different sizes (6-400 nm), various dopant types (Er, Tm, and Ho), and hierarchical structures (core, core-shell). Importantly, the amino group of amino-β-CD on the surface of treated UCNPs provide possibilities to introduce entities for biotargeting or functionalization, as exemplified here, a carboxylic-containing near infrared dye (Cy 7.5) that sensitizes UCNPs to enhance their UCL by ~4,820 fold when excited at ~808 nm.

However, it is largely unknown whether OFS affects taste preference and eating habits. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate (1) the association between body mass index (BMI) and OFS and (2) the relationship of OFS with four types of taste preference (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) and eating habits using serial concentrations of  (OA) homogenized in non-fat milk and a self-reported questionnaire. Participants were 25 healthy Japanese individuals (mean age: 27.0 ± 5.6 years), among whom the OA detection threshold was significantly associated with BMI. Participants were divided into two subgroups based on oral sensitivity to 2.8 mM OA: hypersensitive (able to detect 2.8 mM OA, n = 16) and hyposensitive (unable to detect 2.8 mM OA, n = 9). The degree of sweet taste preference of the hypersensitive group was significantly higher than that of the hyposensitive group. Furthermore, there was significantly higher degree of preference for high-fat sweet foods than low-fat sweet foods in the hypersensitive group. There was also a significant inverse correlation between the OA detection threshold and the degree of both spare eating and postprandial satiety. Thus, OFS is associated not only with BMI, but also with the preference for high-fat sweet foods and eating habits. The present study provides novel insights that measuring OFS may be useful for assessing the risk of  associated with overeating in countries, including Japan, where BMI is increasing in the population.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27897980>Protective Effects of α-Tocopherol, γ-Tocopherol and , Three Compounds of Olive Oils, and No Effect of Trolox, on 7-Ketocholesterol-Induced Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Dysfunction in Microglial BV-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Lipid peroxidation products, such as 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), may be increased in the body fluids and tissues of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and trigger microglial dysfunction involved in neurodegeneration. It is therefore important to identify synthetic and natural molecules able to impair the toxic effects of 7KC. We determined the impact of 7KC on murine microglial BV-2 cells, especially its ability to trigger mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction, and evaluated the protective effects of α- and γ-tocopherol, Trolox, and  (OA). Multiple complementary chemical assays, flow cytometric and biochemical methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant and cytoprotective properties of these molecules. According to various complementary assays to estimate antioxidant activity, only α-, and γ-tocopherol, and Trolox had antioxidant properties. However, only α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol and OA were able to impair 7KC-induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which is associated with increased permeability to propidium iodide, an indicator of cell death. In addition, α-and γ-tocopherol, and OA were able to prevent the decrease in Abcd3 protein levels, which allows the measurement of peroxisomal mass, and in mRNA levels of Abcd1 and Abcd2, which encode for two transporters involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation.

Plants use the sequential activities of FAD2 and FAD3 desaturases to convert 18:1Δ9 to the important PUFA 18:3Δ9,12,15, whereas the fungus  7600 uses the bifunctional desaturase Fm1 for both reactions. Here, we used a combination of sequence comparisons, structural modeling, and mutagenesis experiments to investigate Fm1's regioselectivity and identified two functionally relevant clusters of residues that contribute to Fm1 activity. We found that cluster I (Leu, Phe, and His), located near the catalytic iron ions, predominantly affects activity, whereas cluster II (Tyr, His, and Leu), located in a helix forming the entrance to the substrate-binding pocket, mainly specifies 15-desaturation. Individual or combined substitutions of cluster II residues substantially reduced 15-desaturation. The combination of F157W from cluster I with Y280L, H284V, and L287T from cluster II created an increased-activity variant that almost completely lost the ability to desaturate at C15 and acted almost exclusively as a 12-desaturase. No variants were identified in which 15-desaturation occurred in the absence of 12-desaturation. Fm1 displayed only traces of activity with C16 substrate, but several cluster I variants exhibited increased activity with both 18:1 and 16:1 substrates, converting 16:1Δ9 to 16:3Δ9,12,15, consistent with Fm1 performing sequential  + 3 desaturation reactions at C12 and then C15.

The protein component of HAMLET is α-lactalbumin, which in its native state acts as a substrate specifier in the lactose synthase complex, thereby defining a function essential for the survival of lactating mammals. In addition, α-lactalbumin acquires tumoricidal activity after partial unfolding and binding to . The lipid cofactor serves the dual role as a stabilizer of the altered fold of the protein and a coactivator of specific steps in tumor cell death. HAMLET is broadly tumoricidal, suggesting that the complex identifies conserved death pathways suitable for targeting by novel therapies. Sensitivity to HAMLET is defined by oncogene expression including Ras and c-Myc and by glycolytic enzymes. Cellular targets are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, cytoskeleton, , proteasomes, lysosomes and nuclei, and specific signaling pathways are rapidly activated, first by interactions of HAMLET with the cell membrane and subsequently after HAMLET internalization. Therapeutic effects of HAMLET have been demonstrated in human skin papillomas and bladder cancers, and HAMLET limits the progression of human glioblastomas, with no evidence of toxicity for normal brain or bladder tissue.

Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil-Red-O staining, and the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), Fatty  synthase (FAS), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 and 2, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1(CPT-1) was analyzed by real time reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). And glucose consumption was measured with commercial kit. Furthermore, Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with HFD to induce NAFLD. Groups of mice were given plant extracts orally at 100 and 300 mg/kg at daily for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks of AE extract treatment, we performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Liver tissue was procured for histological examination, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity.In the present study, AE extract was shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and significantly downregulate the level of lipogenic genes and upregulate the expression of lipolysis genes in HepG2 cells. And also, AE extract significantly increased the glucose consumption, indicating that AE extract improved . Subsequently, we confirmed the inhibitory activity of AE extract on NAFLD, in vivo. Treatment with AE extract significantly decreased body weight and the fasting glucose level, alleviated hyperinsulinism and hyperlipidemia, and reduced glucose levels, as determined by OGTT. Additionally, AE extract decreased PI3K and Akt activity.Our results suggest that treatment with AE extract ameliorated NAFLD by inhibiting  through activation of the Akt/GLUT4 pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959940>Comparison of Fatty  Profiles in a Group of Female Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and  Syndrome (MetS)⁻Similar Trends of Changes, Different Pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) profiles in the plasma of patients with  syndrome and chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be identical despite their different etiology (dietary mistakes vs. cachexia). The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with  syndrome (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of arachidonic  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary   of  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of palmitic (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary   are activated for , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA. The higher increase of nervonic  (C24:1) in CKD suggests a higher degree of demyelination and loss of axons.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12716474>Free fatty  overload attenuates Ca2+ signaling and NO production in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p> represents a major risk factor for development of vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Although the unfortunate role of low-density lipoprotein has been clearly demonstrated, the mechanistic pathways through which triglyceride-derived free fatty acids (FFAs) contribute to vascular disorders are not completely understood. Thus, the present study was designed to elucidate the effects of FFAs on cultured endothelial cells. The Ca(2+) signaling, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and production of superoxide anions (.O(2)(-)) were monitored in cells treated with bovine serum albumin-conjugated FFA. FFA-loaded cells showed enhanced intracellular Ca(2+) release in response to ATP, histamine, or the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin. This effect corresponded to an overall increase in intracellularly stored Ca(2+). In contrast, autacoid-triggered elevation of cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration was blunted in FFA-loaded cells due to inhibition of capacitative Ca(2+) entry. In agreement with the reduced Ca(2+) signaling, the Ca(2+)-dependent activity of eNOS was reduced under basal conditions and if cells were stimulated with ATP, histamine, or thapsigargin. The attenuated eNOS activity was associated with.O(2)(-) release in FFA-loaded cells. These data indicate that FFAs significantly affect endothelial Ca(2+) signaling, eNOS activity, and.O(2)(-) release and, thus, might contribute to vascular dysfunction in atherogenesis.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927246>Sodium Orthovanadate Changes Fatty  Composition and Increased Expression of Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Vanadium compounds are promising antidiabetic agents. In addition to regulating glucose , they also alter lipid . Due to the clear association between diabetes and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)- and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA. This was associated with a lack of influence on the expression of FADS1 and FADS2.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690409>Oxidative metabolism in a rat hepatoma (N13) and isolated rat hepatocytes: a flow cytometric comparative study.</a></h2><p>Recently, we have developed a new and fast kinetic method for assessing mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry, based on the quantitation of the initial rate of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) uptake by living cells.

In normal mink, lymph chylomicrons from rats given [3H]retinol (incorporated into retinyl esters, providing a core label) and [14C] (incorporated mainly in triglycerides (TG)) were rapidly cleared from the circulation. In the homozygous mink, clearance was much retarded. The ratio of TG to core label in plasma did not decrease and much less [14C] appeared in plasma. Still, half of the labeled material disappeared from the circulating blood within 30;-40 min and the calculated total turnover of TG in the hypertriglyceridemic mink was almost as large as in normal mink. The core label was distributed to the same tissues in hypertriglyceridemic mink as in normal mink. Half to two-thirds of the cleared core label was in the liver. The large difference was that in the hypertriglyceridemic mink, TG label (about 40% of the total amount removed) followed the core label to the liver and there was no preferential uptake of TG over core label in adipose or muscle tissue. In normal mink, only small amounts of TG label (<10%) appeared in the liver, while most was in adipose and muscle tissues.

Thus, we compared krill oil supplementation with the intake of fish with similar amounts of -3 fatty acids on different cardiovascular risk markers. In an 8-week randomised parallel study, thirty-six healthy subjects aged 18-70 years with fasting serum TAG between 1·3 and 4·0 mmol/l were randomised to receive either fish, krill oil or control oil. In the fish group, subjects consumed lean and fatty fish, according to dietary guidelines. The krill and control group received eight capsules per d containing 4 g oil per d.

Selected NEs from O/W region on the phase diagrams with the drug concentration of 1 mg/mL, were prepared via the spontaneous emulsification technique, characterized for particle size and subjected to stability tests at various temperatures over 9-12 months. Cumulative drug release was determined for a period of 48 h using a dialysis sac. The assay of RAP was determined using HPLC technique. Cytotoxicity of NEs was evaluated by MTT assay on breast cancer cell line, namely SKBR-3. The permeability of RAP-loaded NEs across Caco-2 monolayers was assessed by measurement of TEER (transepithelial electrical resistance) value.

Pathologic consequences of obesity include non-esterified fatty -induced oxidative stress and consequent injury. Since the serine36-phosphorylated p66shc is a newly recognized mediator of oxidative stress and kidney injury, we studied its role in  (OA)-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial depolarization and injury in cultured renal proximal tubule cells.Renal proximal tubule cells were used and treated with OA: ROS production, mitochondrial depolarization as well as injury were determined. Transcriptional effects of OA on the p66shc gene were determined in a reporter luciferase assay. The role of p66shc in adverse effects of OA was determined using knockdown, p66shc serine36 phosphorylation and cytochrome c binding-deficient cells.We found that OA increased ROS production via the  - and to a less extent via the NADPH oxidase - resulting in ROS-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and consequent injury. Interestingly, OA also stimulated the promoter of p66shc. Hence, knockdown of p66shc, impairment its Ser36 phosphorylation (mutation of Ser36 residue to alanine) or cytochrome c binding (W134F mutation) significantly attenuated OA-dependent lipotoxicity.These results offer a novel mechanism by which obesity may lead to renal tubular injury and consequently development of CKD.

Dietary fat intake was found to be unrelated to the risk of breast  in cohort studies. In view of these conflicting findings it has been difficult to make nutritional recommendations for the prevention of breast . Studies in animal models and recent observations in humans, however, have provided evidence that a high intake of omega-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), stimulates several stages in the development of mammary and , from an increase in oxidative DNA damage to effects on cell proliferation, free estrogen levels to hormonal catabolism. In contrast, fish oil-derived omega-3 fatty acids seem to prevent  by influencing the activity of enzymes and proteins related to intracellular signalling and, ultimately, cell proliferation. In this commentary, current evidence from experimental and human studies is summarized that implicates a high intake of omega-6 PUFAs in  of the breast,  and, possibly, prostate and which indicates that omega-3 PUFAs and monounsaturated fatty acids such as  (omega-9) are protective.

Previous studies have suggested that 2OHOA's anticancer effect is mediated by SMS activation in cancer cells, including A549 and U118 cells. To confirm this phenomenon, in this study, we treated both A549 and U118 cells with 2OHOA and measured SMS activity. To our surprise, we found neither 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation nor sphingomyelin accumulation in the cells. However, we noted that 2OHOA significantly reduces phosphatidylcholine in these cells. We also did not observe 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation in mouse tissue homogenates. Importantly, 2OHOA inhibited rather than activated recombinant SMS1 (rSMS1) and rSMS2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Intra-gastric treatment of C57BL/6J mice with 2OHOA for 10 days had no effects on liver and small intestine SMS activities and plasma sphingomyelin levels. The treatment inhibited lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity, consistent with the aforementioned reduction in plasma phosphatidylcholine. Because total cellular phosphatidylcholine is used as a predictive biomarker for monitoring tumor responses, the previously reported 2OHOA-mediated cancer suppression could be related to this phosphatidylcholine reduction, which may influence cell membrane structure and properties. We conclude that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator and that its anticancer property may be related to an effect on phosphatidylcholine .</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26044490>Antagonism Between Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids in ROS Mediated Lipotoxicity in Rat Insulin-Producing Cells.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) are under suspicion to mediate β-cell dysfunction and β-cell loss in type 2 , a phenomenon known as lipotoxicity. Whereas saturated fatty acids show a strong cytotoxic effect upon insulin-producing cells, unsaturated fatty acids are not toxic and can even prevent toxicity. Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress mediates lipotoxicity and there is evidence that the subcellular site of ROS formation is the peroxisome. However, the interaction between unsaturated and saturated NEFAs in this process is unclear.Toxicity of rat insulin-producing cells after NEFA incubation was measured by MTT and caspase assays. NEFA induced H2O2 formation was quantified by organelle specific expression of the H2O2 specific fluorescence sensor protein HyPer.The saturated NEFA palmitic  had a significant toxic effect on the viability of rat insulin-producing cells. Unsaturated NEFAs with carbon chain lengths >14 showed, irrespective of the number of double bonds, a pronounced protection against palmitic  induced toxicity. Palmitic  induced H2O2 formation in the peroxisomes of insulin-producing cells.  incubation led to lipid droplet formation, but in contrast to palmitic  induced neither an ER stress response nor peroxisomal H2O2 generation. Furthermore,  prevented palmitic  induced H2O2 production in the peroxisomes.Thus unsaturated NEFAs prevent deleterious hydrogen peroxide generation during peroxisomal β-oxidation of long-chain saturated NEFAs in rat insulin-producing cells.© 2015 S.

Parameters of glucose metabolism, hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia and nephrotoxicity were measured with emphasis on elevated oxidative stress. ANL was chemically characterized using GC-MS. Further, docking studies were employed to predict molecular interactions.ANL lowered (65%, P< 0.001) systemic glucose load in diabetic mice, which was otherwise 398% higher than control. ANL lowered (35%) , without any significant effect on  sensitivity (P> 0.05). Anti-hyperglycemic properties of ANL was further supported by lowering of HbA1c (34%; P< 0.001) and improved glucose utilization (OGTT). Overall diabetic complications were mitigated as reflected by lowered hepatic (ALT, AST) and renal (creatinine, BUN) injury markers and normalization of dyslipidemia. Elevated systemic oxidative stress was lowered by increased catalase and peroxidase activities in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, resulting in 32% decrease of serum MDA levels.

DGs containing stearic, , palmitic, and myristic  side chains were found in fecal extracts from each of eight subjects. Synthetic 1,2-DGs, containing the fatty acids found in endogenous fecal DGs, induced mitogenesis in cultures of premalignant cells from each of 13 adenomas, covering all histological classes, and in cultures from two of four carcinomas. The potent adenoma mitogen, dimyristin, had no mitogenic activity on cultures of normal  epithelial cells from seven different subjects. These results suggest DGs may act as endogenous mitogens in the development of human . The extent of adenoma mitogenesis was correlated with the chain length of the saturated R-groups: 16 greater than 14 greater than 12 greater than 10 greater than 8 much greater than 18. DGs with  residues, C18:1, were among the most active, while substitution of even one fatty  residue with a stearic  residue, C18:0, reduced or eliminated mitogenic activity.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect and underlying mechanisms of GSO against NAFLD using  and  models. lipid accumulation was induced by free fatty  mixture in HepG2 cells and by 3 wk of high fat diet (HFD)-feeding in Sprague-Dawley rats prior to hepatocyte isolation. The effects of GSO against diet-induced hepatic steatosis were further examined in C57BL/6J mice fed a HFD for 12 wk.Oil Red O staining and intracellular triglyceride levels showed marked accumulation of lipid droplets in both HepG2 cells and rat hepatocytes, and these were attenuated by GSO treatment. In HFD-fed mice, GSO improved HFD-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic insulin resistance. Increased hepatic lipid contents were observed in HFD-fed mice and it was lowered in GSO (500 mg/kg)-treated mice by 26.4% which was evident in histological analysis. Pathway analysis of hepatic global gene expression indicated that GSO increased the expression of genes associated with β-oxidation (, , , and ) and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes ( and ), and these were confirmed with reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase-chain reaction.These findings suggest that GSO has a beneficial effect on NAFLD through the suppression of  and stimulation of fatty  degradation pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535092>Plasma fatty acids in de novo  pathway are associated with diabetogenic indicators among adults: NHANES 2003-2004.</a></h2><p>Insulin regulates fatty acids (FAs) in the blood; conversely, FAs may mediate insulin sensitivity and are potentially modifiable risk factors of the diabetogenic state.The objective of our study was to examine the associations between plasma concentrations of FAs, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) among individuals (n = 1433) in the NHANES (2003-2004).Plasma concentrations of 24 individual FAs were considered individually and in subgroups, per chemical structure.

The metabolic interactions between tissues and the heart illustrate a critical cross-talk we know little about.To better understand the metabolic changes induced by exercise, we investigated skeletal muscle (plantaris, soleus), liver, serum, and heart from exercise trained (or sedentary control) animals in an established rat model of exercise-induced aerobic training via non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics.Exercise-induced alterations in metabolites varied across tissues, with the soleus and serum affected the least. The alterations in the plantaris muscle and liver were most alike, with two metabolites increased in each (citric /isocitric  and linoleic ). Exercise training additionally altered nine other metabolites in the plantaris (C13 hydrocarbon, inosine/adenosine, fructose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, 2-aminoadipic , heptadecanoic , stearic , alpha-tocopherol, and ). In the serum, we identified significantly decreased alpha-tocopherol levels, paralleling the increases identified in plantaris muscle. Eleven unique metabolites were increased in the heart, which were not affected in the other compartments (malic , serine, aspartic , myoinositol, glutamine, gluconic -6-phosphate, glutamic , pyrophosphate, campesterol, phosphoric , creatinine). These findings complement prior studies using targeted metabolomics approaches to determine the metabolic changes in exercise-trained human skeletal muscle. Specifically, exercise trained vastus lateralus biopsies had significantly increased linoleic , , and stearic  compared to the inactive groups, which were significantly increased in plantaris muscle in the present study.While increases in alpha-tocopherol have not been identified in muscle after exercise to our knowledge, the benefits of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) supplementation in attenuating exercise-induced muscle damage has been studied extensively. Skeletal muscle, liver, and the heart have primarily different metabolic changes, with few similar alterations and rare complementary alterations (alpha-tocopherol), which may illustrate the complexity of understanding exercise at the organismal level.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28966553>Adipogenic Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Grown as Spheroids.</a></h2><p>Understanding the process of adipogenesis is critical if suitable therapeutics for  and related metabolic diseases are to be found. The current study presents proof of feasibility of creating a 3-D spheroid model using human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and their subsequent adipogenic differentiation. hASC spheroids were formed atop an elastin-like polypeptide-polyethyleneimine (ELP-PEI) surface and differentiated using an adipogenic cocktail. Spheroids were matured in the presence of dietary fatty acids (linoleic or ) and evaluated based on functional markers including intracellular protein, CD36 expression, triglyceride accumulation, and PPAR-γ gene expression. Spheroid size was found to increase as the hASCs matured in the adipocyte maintenance medium, though the fatty  treatment generally resulted in smaller spheroids compared to control. A stable protein content over the 10-day maturation period indicated contact-inhibited proliferation as well as minimal loss of spheroids during culture. Spheroids treated with fatty acids showed greater amounts of intracellular triglyceride content and greater expression of the key adipogenic gene, PPAR-γ. We also demonstrated that 3-D spheroids outperformed 2-D monolayer cultures in adipogenesis. We then compared the adipogenesis of hASC spheroids to that in 3T3-L1 spheroids and found that the triglyceride accumulation was less profound in hASC spheroids than that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, correlated with smaller average spheroids, suggesting a relatively slower differentiation process. Taken together, we have shown the feasibility of adipogenic differentiation of patient-derived hASC spheroids, which with further development, may help elucidate key features in the adipogenesis process.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27456850>Anti-lipoapoptotic effects of Alisma orientalis extract on non-esterified fatty -induced HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Liver steatosis was caused by lipid accumulation in the liver.

In a thermal decomposition synthesis,  (OAC) and oleylamine (OAM) are used as surfactants. The surfactants bind to the growth species, thereby controlling the reaction kinetics and hence playing a critical role in the final size and size distribution of the NPs. Finding an optimum molar ratio between the surfactants  OAC/OAM is therefore crucial. A systematic experimental and theoretical study, however, on the role of the surfactant ratio is still missing. Here, we present a detailed experimental study on the role of the surfactant ratio in size distribution. We found an optimum OAC/OAM ratio of 3 at which the synthesis yielded truly monodisperse (polydispersity less than 7%) iron oxide NPs without employing any post synthesis size-selective procedures. We performed molecular dynamics simulations and showed that the binding  of oleate to the NP is maximized at an OAC/OAM ratio of 3. The optimum OAC/OAM ratio of 3 is allowed for the control of the NP size with nanometer precision by simply changing the reaction heating rate. The optimum OAC/OAM ratio has no influence on the crystallinity and the superparamagnetic behavior of the FeO NPs and therefore can be adopted for the scaled-up production of size-controlled monodisperse FeO NPs.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15168866>Effects of dietary extra virgin olive oil on serum lipid resistance to oxidation and fatty  composition in elderly lipidemic patients.</a></h2><p>An inverse relation between high consumption of olive oil and low incidence of coronary heart disease among the people living in Mediterranean countries has been proposed.

Plasma lipids, total antioxidant capacity, indices of serum lipid oxidizability (lag time and maximal rate of oxidation) and the content of fatty acids in serum phospholipids were determined before and after dietary supplementation with olive oil. Plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decreased significantly after 6 weeks of dietary intervention. A significant increase in the lag time of conjugated diene formation (p = 0.026) and the decrease in the rate of lipid oxidation (p = 0.030) were observed after olive oil consumption. The changes in the fatty  profile were characterized by an increase in  content (p = 0.005) as well as by a decline in the content of linoleic  (p = 0.020) and arachidonic  (p = 0.022).

In experimental steatohepatitis induced by feeding mice a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, the degree of liver damage is related to dietary sugar content, which drives de novo  and promotes the hepatic accumulation of saturated fatty acids. The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary palmitate exerts the same toxicity as carbohydrate-derived palmitate in the MCD model of fatty liver disease.We fed mice custom MCS and MCD formulas containing 4 different carbohydrate-fat combinations: starch-oleate, starch-palmitate, sucrose-oleate and sucrose-palmitate.  After 3 wk, we compared their metabolic and disease outcomes.Mice fed the custom MCD formulas developed varying degrees of hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis, in the order starch-oleate < starch-palmitate < sucrose-oleate < sucrose-palmitate. Liver injury correlated positively with the degree of hepatic lipid accumulation. Liver injury also correlated positively with the amount of palmitate in the liver, but the relationship was weak. Importantly, mice fed MCD starch-palmitate accumulated as much hepatic palmitate as mice fed MCD sucrose-oleate, yet their degree of liver injury was much lower. By contrast, mice fed MCD sucrose-palmitate developed severe liver injury, worse than that predicted by an additive influence of the two nutrients.In the MCD model of steatohepatitis, carbohydrate-derived palmitate in the liver is more hepatotoxic than dietary palmitate.

Diffusion-controlled bimolecular triplet-triplet energy transfer quenching between PtTPBP and the acceptor/annihilator 9,10-bisphenylethynylanthracene (BPEA) was observed in all three PEG formulations investigated. Subsequent triplet-triplet annihilation, between triplet excited BPEA acceptors, achieves bright and stable upconverted singlet fluorescence from BPEA with no decrease in intensity over 20 h under ambient conditions. In the champion composition (PEG 200), the upconversion quantum efficiency reached 31% under conditions where triplet-triplet annihilation was maximized. This is in stark contrast for the same upconverting pair measured in toluene under ambient conditions, which rapidly decomposes upon exposure to visible light. To illustrate that these PEG compositions could be translated into a suitable solid-state format, these viscous solutions were embedded in a transparent polyurethane polymer shell yielding a flexible and long-term stable upconverting cell that can be manipulated for possible real-world applications. Although the current investigation focused on photochemical upconversion, the -depleted environments developed here can be utilized to study a plethora of -intolerant photochemical reactions.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206714>Comparative analysis of nutrient content and  of eggs from different chicken genotypes.</a></h2><p>Eggs are important foods in the daily diet of humans and have great biological activity and a high digestibility.

Subgroups of rats from these groups were treated with eicosapentaenoic -E (EPA) or docosahexaenoic -95E (DHA) for 5 weeks. Although plasma total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were higher in each group fed the HC diet versus each group fed the C diet, EPA administration with the HC diet (HC + EPA) significantly (P < .05) reduced these levels. An isolated working-heart preparation was used to determine cardiac function. Cardiac output (CO) was lower in rats fed the HC diet and HC + DHA versus any of the groups fed the C diet (P < .05). In addition, left ventricular (LV) maximum differentiation of pressure-time curve (dp/dt) was lower in the rats fed the HC diet versus any of the C diet groups (P < .05). After evaluation of cardiac function in each rat, the heart was stored in a histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution for 8 hours at 4 degrees C. The heart was then reperfused, and recovery of cardiac function was evaluated. No significant differences were observed for post-preservative cardiac function within the C diet groups. However, within the HC diet groups, HC + EPA significantly (P < .05) improved the recovery of cardiac function. In addition, HC + DHA also significantly (P < .05) improved the recovery of coronary flow (CF) and LV dp/dt. No significant differences were observed for plasma TC and TG concentrations in the C diet groups. EPA administration significantly decreased cardiac levels of palmitic, , and linoleic acids in the HC diet groups. No significant differences were observed for cardiac levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) within the C diet groups. Cardiac EPA and DHA levels were significantly (P < .05) elevated in EPA- or DHA-treated rats compared with the other diet-fed rats.

As  adults feed, mate, and oviposit on food, they perceive the pheromone as a blend against a background of food odors. Previous studies have reported that food odors enhance flies' behavioral response to cVA, specifically in virgin females. However, how and where the different olfactory inputs interact has so far remained unknown. In this study, we elucidated the neuronal mechanism underlying the response at an anatomical, functional, and behavioral level. Our data show that in virgin females cVA and the complex food odor vinegar evoke a synergistic response in the cVA-responsive glomerulus DA1. This synergism, however, does not appear at the input level of the glomerulus, but is restricted to the projection neuron level only. Notably, it is abolished by a mutation in gap junctions in projection neurons and is found to be mediated by electrical synapses between excitatory local interneurons and projection neurons. As a behavioral consequence, we demonstrate that virgin females in the presence of vinegar become receptive more rapidly to courting males, while male courtship is not affected. Altogether, our results suggest that lateral excitation via gap junctions modulates odor tuning in the antennal lobe and drives synergistic interactions between two ecologically relevant odors, representing food and sex.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22612451>Calpain 10 homology modeling with CYGAK and increased lipophilicity leads to greater potency and efficacy in cells.</a></h2><p>Calpain 10 is a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca(2+)-regulated cysteine protease in which overexpression or knockdown leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. We previously identified a potent and specific calpain 10 peptide inhibitor (CYGAK), but it was not efficacious in cells. Therefore, we created a homology model using the calpain 10 amino  sequence and calpain 1 3-D structure and docked CYGAK in the active site. Using this model we modified the inhibitor to improve potency 2-fold (CYGAbuK). To increase cellular efficacy, we created CYGAK-S-phenyl- heterodimers. Using renal mitochondrial matrix CYGAK, CYGAK-OC, and CYGAK-ON had IC(50)'s of 70, 90, and 875 nM, respectively. Using isolated whole renal  CYGAK, CYGAK-OC, and CYGAK-ON had IC(50)'s of 95, 196, and >10,000 nM, respectively. Using renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) in primary culture, 30 min exposures to CYGAK-OC and CYGAbuK-OC decreased cellular calpain activity approximately 20% at 1 μM, and concentrations up to 100 μM had no additional effect. RPTC treated with 10 μM CYGAK-OC for 24 h induced accumulation of ATP synthase β and NDUFB8, two calpain 10 substrates. In summary, we used molecular modeling to improve the potency of CYGAK, while creating CYGAK- heterodimers to improve efficacy in cells.

The potential impact of TF on skeletal muscle metabolism has yet to be fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether TF can promote insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in mammalian skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 murine skeletal myotubes were exposed to 1 ppm TF for 24 h. To examine the potential effect of cellular fatty  levels on TF-dependent regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and insulin signaling, we treated skeletal myotubes with 0.25 mM or 1.0 mM  (OA) during TF exposure trials. Tolylfluanid (1-10 ppm) reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 20% in 0.25 and 1.0 mM OA treated cells. The addition of 0.25 mM OA completely inhibited the TF-dependent reduction in maximal mitochondrial  consumption rate (OCR) while 1.0 mM OA exacerbated the TF-dependent reduction in mitochondrial OCR. Exposing skeletal myotubes to 1 ppm TF promoted an 80% reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was completely inhibited by 0.25 mM OA and partially inhibited by1.0 mM OA. The addition of 0.25 mM OA promoted a TF-dependent increase in insulin-dependent P-Akt (Ser473). In contrast, the addition of 1.0 mM OA promoted a significant reduction in insulin-dependent P-Akt (Ser473). Further, the addition of 1 ppm TF significantly reduced insulin-dependent mTORC1 activity regardless of OA concentration. Finally, TF significantly reduced insulin-dependent protein synthesis in the 1 mM OA treated cells only. Our results demonstrate that the effect of 1 ppm TF on mitochondrial function and insulin-dependent protein synthesis in skeletal myotubes was largely dependent upon cellular fatty  levels.Copyright © 2018.

Palmitic and  VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty acids (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA. It seems highly unlikely that the xeobiotics statins, fibrates and probucol produce pleiotropic biological effects in vivo. These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins. It is reasonable to suggest that all preparations which act according to the same algorithm activate TG hydrolysis in VLDL and normalize cellular uptake of PFA in linoleic and linolenic LDL via apoВ-100 endocytosis.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of diets containing mid- or high-linoleic oil versus the typical high-linoleic sunflower oil on LDL oxidation and the development of early atherosclerosis in a hypercholesterolemic hamster model. Animals were fed a hypercholesterolemic diet containing 10% mid- sunflower oil, high- olive oil, or high-linoleic sunflower oil (wt/wt) plus 0.4% cholesterol (wt/wt) for 10 weeks. After 10 weeks of dietary treatment, only the animals fed the mid- sunflower oil had significant reductions in plasma LDL-C levels (-17%) compared to the high-linoleic sunflower oil group. The high- olive oil-fed hamsters had significantly higher plasma triglyceride levels (+41%) compared to the high-linoleic sunflower oil-fed hamsters. The tocopherol levels in plasma LDL were significantly higher in hamsters fed the mid- sunflower oil (+77%) compared to hamsters fed either the high-linoleic sunflower or high- olive oil. Measurements of LDL oxidation parameters, indicated that hamsters fed the mid- sunflower oil and high- olive oil diets had significantly longer lag phase (+66% and +145%, respectively) and significantly lower propagation rates (-26% and -44%, respectively) and conjugated dienes formed (-17% and -25%, respectively) compared to the hamsters fed the high-linoleic sunflower oil. Relative to the high-linoleic sunflower oil, aortic cholesterol ester was reduced by -14% and -34% in the mid- sunflower oil and high- olive oil groups, respectively, with the latter reaching statistical significance.

The present study suggests that mid- sunflower oil reduces risk factors such as lipoprotein cholesterol and oxidative stress associated with early atherosclerosis greater than the typical high-linoleic sunflower oil in hypercholesterolemic hamsters.

Subsequently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was applied to image the spatial distribution of caffeine, mannitol and SDS in cross-sections of porcine buccal mucosa. The results revealed that none of the permeation enhancing strategies improved the permeability of caffeine or diazepam, despite impact on the tissue integrity by OA and SDS, as seen by an increased permeability of mannitol. Further studies are needed with OA since PG solvent may have concealed the possible impact of OA. SDS decreased the permeability of caffeine and diazepam, a decrease which can be explained by micellar  extraction and encapsulation in micelles. MALDI-MSI showed that SDS permeated into approximately one-third of the epithelium, and it therefore appears that the main permeability barrier for mannitol is located in the outer epithelium.

We hypothesized that STAMP2 is involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis.We examined our hypothesis using human NAFLD patient pathology samples and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. The molecular mechanism underlying hepatic STAMP2-mediated lipid imbalance was explored using an  (OA)-induced NAFLD in vitro model.Noticeably, the expression level of STAMP2 protein was reduced in the livers obtained from NAFLD patients and HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo knockdown of hepatic STAMP2 by siRNA accelerated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice fed a HFD. Conversely, the delivery of adenoviral STAMP2 (Ad-STAMP2) improved hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced NAFLD mice. The expression of lipogenic or adipogenic factors was increased in both in vitro and in vivo NAFLD models but was reversed by Ad-STAMP2. Adenoviral overexpression of STAMP2 improved insulin resistance in the HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that STAMP2 modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and that STAMP2 counteracts OA-induced insulin resistance by modulating insulin receptor substrate-1 stability.The present study revealed that hepatic STAMP2 plays a pivotal role in preventing HFD-induced NAFLD and that STAMP2 overexpression improves hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD.

DMY suppressed the expression of PPARγ and the phosphorylation of AKT, and promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK.Our study suggests that DMY ameliorates OA-induced hepatic steatosis by inhibiting cell apoptosis, lipid accumulation and oxide stress. Furthermore, the effect of DMY is likely associated with its role in the regulating of PPARγ, AMPK and AKT signaling pathways.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

After 3 days on chow or HE diet, DR and DIO rats were assessed for their ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) ketone bodies levels and neuronal ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) sensing using microdialysis coupled to continuous food intake monitoring and calcium imaging in dissociated neurons, respectively. DIO rats ate more than DR rats over 3 days of HE diet intake. On day 3 of HE diet intake, DR rats reduced their caloric intake while DIO rats remained hyperphagic. Local VMH astrocyte ketone bodies production was similar between DR and DIO rats during the first 6 h after dark onset feeding but inhibiting VMH ketone body production in DR rats on day 3 transiently returned their intake of HE diet to the level of DIO rats consuming HE diet. In addition, dissociated VMN neurons from DIO and DR rats were equally sensitive to the largely excitatory effects of β-hydroxybutyrate. Thus while DR rats respond to increased VMH ketone levels by decreasing their intake after 3 days of HE diet, this is not the case of DIO rats. These data suggest that DIO inherent leptin resistance prevents ketone bodies inhibitory action on food intake.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29807119>Antipsoriatic effect of fatty  enriched fraction of Vernonia anthelmintica Willd. fruits.</a></h2><p>Vernonia anthelmintica has been utilized conventionally as an ingredient in Ayurveda and traditional Uighur medicine for management of various skin ailments, and scientific data's have substantiated its use in treating vitiligo, dermatosis and leucoderma.

When breastfeeding is not possible, infant formulas are designed to mimic human milk as much as possible to fulfill infant's requirements. However, the composition of these dairy products is relatively constant, while human milk is not a uniform bio-fluid and changes according to the requirements of the baby. In this study, breast milk samples were donated by 24 Spanish mothers in different lactation stages and different infant formulas were purchased in supermarkets and pharmacies. Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection was used for the fatty  determination. Compared to breast milk, first-stage formulas are apparently very similar in composition; however, no major differences were observed in the fatty  profiles between formulas of different lactation stages. The Galician women breast milk has a fatty  profile rich in , linoleic , arachidonic , and docosahexaenoic . When comparing human milk with formulas, it becomes evident that the manufacturers tend to enrich the formulas with essential fatty acids (especially with α-linolenic ), but arachidonic and docosahexaenoic  levels are lower than in breast milk.

Our results indicate that palmitate inhibited  and lactate dehydrogenase fluxes while activating citric  cycle (CAC) flux and glutamine uptake. This decoupling of  and CAC fluxes occurred during the period following palmitate exposure but preceding the onset of apoptosis. Oleate co-treatment restored most fluxes to their control levels, resulting in steatotic lipid accumulation while preventing apoptosis. In addition, palmitate strongly increased the cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH ratio, whereas oleate co-treatment had the opposite effect on cellular redox. We next examined the influence of amino acids on these free fatty -induced phenotypic changes. Increased medium amino acids enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and apoptosis in PA-cells but not in PA/OA-cells. Overloading the medium with non-essential amino acids induced apoptosis, but essential amino  overloading partially ameliorated apoptosis. Glutamate was the most effective single amino  in promoting ROS. Amino  overloading also increased cellular palmitoyl-ceramide; however, ceramide synthesis inhibitors had no effect on measurable indicators of apoptosis. Our results indicate that free fatty -induced ROS generation and apoptosis are accompanied by the decoupling of  and CAC fluxes leading to abnormal cytosolic redox states.

Enrichment of serum or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) with  increased lipoprotein negative charge and stimulated lipid hydrolysis by HL. Similarly, enrichment of serum or isolated lipoproteins with the anionic phospholipids phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic , or phosphatidylserine also increased lipoprotein negative charge and stimulated hydrolysis by HL. Anionic lipids had a small effect on phospholipid hydrolysis, but significantly stimulated triacylglyceride (TG) hydrolysis. High density lipoprotein (HDL) charge appears to have a specific effect on lipolysis. Enrichment of HDL with PI significantly stimulated VLDL-TG hydrolysis by HL. To determine whether HDL charge affects the association of HL with HDL and VLDL, HL-lipoprotein interactions were probed immunochemically. Under normal circumstances, HL associates with HDL particles, and only small amounts bind to VLDL. PI enrichment of HDL blocked the binding of HL with HDL. These data indicate that increasing the negative charge of HDL stimulates VLDL-TG hydrolysis by reducing the association of HL with HDL. Therefore, HDL controls the hydrolysis of VLDL by affecting the interlipoprotein association of HL. Lipoprotein electrostatic properties regulate lipase association and are an important regulator of the binding and activity of lipolytic enzymes.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28540041>Effects of quantitative feed restriction and sex on carcass traits, meat quality and meat lipid profile of Morada Nova lambs.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of feed restriction (FR) and sex on the quantitative and qualitative carcass traits of Morada Nova lambs.

During the co-digestion period, methane yield and VS removal were significantly higher in comparison to digestion of sewage sludge alone.

Chronic exposure to either of the circulating fatty  oleate or palmitate has different effects on the beta-cell. Whereas palmitate causes functional impairment of the beta-cell and apoptosis, oleate has only minor negative effects on beta-cell function and mass.

After culture, cells were lysed and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins specifically regulated by palmitate were excised from the gel and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF MS. Proteins exclusively regulated by palmitate were classified into proteins of carbohydrate or protein metabolism and Ca(2+) or mRNA binding proteins.

Niacin potently regulates lipid metabolism. Replacement of saturated fatty acids by MUFAs or inclusion of omega-3 long-chain PUFAs in the diet improves plasma lipid levels. However, the potential benefits of niacin in combination with MUFAs or omega-3 long-chain PUFAs against white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction in the high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome are unknown.Male Lep LDLR mice are fed a chow diet or HFDs based on milk cream (21% kcal), olive oil (21% kcal), or olive oil (20% kcal) plus 1% kcal from eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, including immediate-release niacin (1% w/v) in drinking water, for 8 weeks. Mice are then phenotyped. Dietary MUFAs are identified as positive regulators of adipose NAD signaling pathways by triggering NAD biosynthesis via the salvage pathway. This coexists with overexpression of genes involved in recognition of NAD and fatty acids, a surrounding lipid environment dominated by exogenous  and an alternatively activated macrophage profile, which culminate in a healthy expansion of WAT and improvement of several hallmarks that typify the metabolic syndrome.Niacin in combination with dietary MUFAs can favor WAT homeostasis in the development of HFD-induced  and metabolic syndrome.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Thus, it is important to explore its underlying mechanisms.Total RNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood samples from 50 NAFLD patients and 50 healthy controls. In addition, human liver specimens were obtained through liver biopsies from NAFLD patients and healthy controls. The level of miRNA was studied using real-time PCR. The expression of lipogenic genes was analyzed using western blot, and a dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to identify the possible target gene. Adenovirus vectors were injected into the tail vein of the high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice to study the role of miR-155 on lipid accumulation in vivo.The level of miR-155 was markedly reduced in the livers and peripheral blood of NAFLD patients compared with healthy controls. Upregulation of miR-155 decreased intracellular lipid content and the SREBP1 and FAS protein levels, while inhibition of miR-155 enhanced the intracellular lipid content. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that Liver X receptor (LXR)α was the target gene of miR-155, and silencing miR-155 reduced the expression of SREBP1 and FAS. An in vivo study showed that upregulation of miR-155 decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation mainly by suppressing the LXRα-dependent lipogenic signaling pathway.In summary, decreased expression of miR-155 in the peripheral blood may be utilized as a potential novel biomarker for NAFLD screening mainly by targeting LXRα.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

However, transcriptional dynamic regulation of adipose differentiation driven by complex signal cascades remains largely unexplored in this model. This study aimed to explore adipogenic transcriptional dynamics before (proliferation) and after (differentiation) initial preadipocyte differentiation in ducks.Exogenous  alone successfully induced duck subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation. We explored 36 mRNA-seq libraries in order to study transcriptome dynamics during proliferation and differentiation processes at 6 time points. Using robust statistical analysis, we identified 845, 652, 359, 2401 and 1933 genes differentially expressed between -48 h and 0 h, 0 h and 12 h, 12 h and 24 h, 24 h and 48 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively (FDR < 0.05, FC > 1.5). At the proliferation stage, proliferation related pathways and basic cellular and metabolic processes were inhibited, while regulatory factors that initiate differentiation enter the ready-to-activate state, which provides a precondition for initiating adipose differentiation. According to weighted gene co-expression network analysis, pathways positively related to adipogenic differentiation are significantly activated at the differentiation stage, while WNT, FOXO and other pathways that inhibit preadipocyte differentiation are negatively regulated. Moreover, we identified and classified more than 100 transcription factors that showed significant changes during differentiation, and found novel transcription factors that were not reported to be related to preadipoctye differentiation. Finally, we manually assembled a proposed regulation network model of subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation base on the expression data, and suggested that E2F1 may serve as an important link between the processes of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.For the first time we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome dynamics of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. The current study provides a solid basis for understanding the synthesis and deposition of subcutaneous fat in ducks.

Fatty  desaturase 2 (FAD2) catalyzes  (OA) into linoleic  (LA) transformations, which are essential to the profile of FAs in seeds. To further understand the roles of FAD2s in the synthesis of oil, the evolution and biocatalysis of FAD2s were comprehensively analyzed. The evolution history of the  gene family showed that most of the  genes formed monophyletic clades except in eudicots. The  genes in some eudicots diverged into constitutive and seed-specific expression clades. Notably, the biocatalysis of seed-specific or -abundant expression s in soybean, perilla, rice, and spruce revealed that their catalytic activity was strongly correlated with the total oil content of their seeds in nature. Additionally, it was found that I and Y in site 143 of GmaFAD2-1 were strictly conserved in the seed-specific and constitutive expression clades of Fabaceae, respectively. Furthermore, the site-directed mutation demonstrated that I and Y are vital to improving and reducing the activity of GmaFAD2s. Therefore, the results indicate that the activity of FAD2s in seeds might be a reference to the total oil content of seeds, and site 143 might have been specifically evolved to be required for the activity of FAD2s in some expression-diverged eudicots, especially in legumes.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26318523>Diversity in the structures and ligand-binding sites of nematode fatty  and retinol-binding proteins revealed by Na-FAR-1 from Necator americanus.</a></h2><p>Fatty  and retinol-binding proteins (FARs) comprise a family of unusual α-helix rich lipid-binding proteins found exclusively in nematodes. They are secreted into host tissues by parasites of plants, animals and humans. The structure of a FAR protein from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is available, but this protein [C. elegans FAR-7 (Ce-FAR-7)] is from a subfamily of FARs that does not appear to be important at the host/parasite interface. We have therefore examined [Necator americanus FAR-1 (Na-FAR-1)] from the blood-feeding intestinal parasite of humans, N. americanus. The 3D structure of Na-FAR-1 in its ligand-free and ligand-bound forms, determined by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography respectively, reveals an α-helical fold similar to Ce-FAR-7, but Na-FAR-1 possesses a larger and more complex internal ligand-binding cavity and an additional C-terminal α-helix. Titration of apo-Na-FAR-1 with , analysed by NMR chemical shift perturbation, reveals that at least four distinct protein-ligand complexes can be formed. Na-FAR-1 and possibly other FARs may have a wider repertoire for hydrophobic ligand binding, as confirmed in the present study by our finding that a range of neutral and polar lipids co-purify with the bacterially expressed recombinant protein.

Dysfunction of tight junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced  impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , suppressed TNF-α and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin light chain kinase.

In addition, HYA suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against  gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Causes other than hypertension have not previously been investigated longitudinally. The aim of the present study was to determine hemodynamic, metabolic, and psychosocial predictors at 50 years of age for the prevalence of echocardiographic LVH and geometric subtypes at age 70 by use of a large sample of men from the general population followed up for 20 years. Methods and Results-In 1970 to 1973, all men born from 1920 to 1924 and residing in Uppsala County, Sweden, were invited to participate in a health survey aimed at identifying risk factors for cardiovascular disease. At a reinvestigation 20 years later, echocardiographic left ventricular mass index was determined in 475 subjects. A 1-SD increase in body mass index, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, fasting LDL/HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides, or the serum cholesterol ester proportion of several saturated fatty acids or  at age 50 significantly increased the odds of having LVH at age 70 by 27% to 41%, whereas an increase in linoleic  proportion was protective. Almost all metabolic predictors were independent of ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, and use of antihypertensive medication at age 70.-Dyslipidemia and indices of a low dietary intake of linoleic  and high intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats, as well as hypertension and obesity, at age 50 predicted the prevalence of LVH 20 years later in this prospective longitudinal cohort study, thereby suggesting that lipids may be important in the origin of LVH.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242553>Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals the High- Feedback Regulating the Homologous Gene Expression of Stearoyl-ACP Desaturase 2 () in Peanuts.</a></h2><p>Peanuts with high  content are usually considered to be beneficial for human health and edible oil storage.

Here we present a comprehensive template for the design and synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles with control over size, size distribution, phase, and resulting magnetic properties. We investigate critical parameters for synthesis of monodisperse SPIONs by organic thermal decomposition. Three different, commonly used, iron containing precursors (iron oleate, iron pentacarbonyl, and iron oxyhydroxide) are evaluated under a variety of synthetic conditions. We compare the suitability of these three kinetically controlled synthesis protocols, which have in common the use of iron oleate as a starting precursor or reaction intermediate, for producing nanoparticles with specific size and magnetic properties. Monodisperse particles were produced over a tunable range of sizes from approximately 2-30 nm. Reaction parameters such as precursor concentration, addition of surfactant, temperature, ramp rate, and time were adjusted to kinetically control size and size-distribution, phase, and magnetic properties. In particular, large quantities of excess surfactant (up to 25 : 1 molar ratio) alter reaction kinetics and result in larger particles with uniform size; however, there is often a trade-off between large particles and a narrow size distribution. Iron oxide phase, in addition to nanoparticle size and shape, is critical for establishing magnetic properties such as differential susceptibility (dm/dH) and anisotropy. As an example, we show the importance of obtaining the required size and iron oxide phase for application to Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI), and describe how phase purity can be controlled.

The experiment consisted of a 2 × 3 factorial design with two corn types (normal corn and ageing corn) and three concentrations of VE (0, 20 and 100 IU/kg). A total of 216 Lohmann laying hens (50-week-old) were randomly allocated into six treatment diets for 12 week. Each treatment had six replicates with six hens.

Asg1 is required for full activation of genes in several pathways, including β-oxidation (POX1, FOX2, and POT1),  (PCK1), glyoxylate cycle (ICL1), triacylglycerol breakdown (TGL3), and peroxisomal transport (PXA1). In addition, the transcriptional activator Asg1 is found to be enriched on promoters of genes in β-oxidation and  pathways, suggesting that Asg1 is directly involved in the control of fatty  utilizing genes. In agreement, impaired growth on non-fermentable carbons such as fatty acids and oils and increased sensitivity to some oxidative agents are found for the Δasg1 strain. The lipid class profile of the Δasg1 cells grown in oleate displays approximately 3-fold increase in free fatty  (FFA) content in comparison to glucose-grown cells, which correlates with decreased expression of β-oxidation genes. The ∆asg1 strain grown in glucose also exhibits higher accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) during log phase, reaching levels typically observed in stationary phase cells. Altered TAG accumulation is partly due to the inability of the Δasg1 cells to efficiently break down TAGs, which is consistent with lowered expression of TGL3 gene, encoding triglycerol lipase. Overall, these results highlight a new role of the transcriptional regulator Asg1 in coordinating expression of genes involved in fatty  utilization and its role in regulating cellular lipid accumulation, thereby providing an attractive approach to increase FFAs and TAGs content for the production of lipid-derived biofuels and chemicals in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30407633>Triacylglycerol-Lowering Effect of Docosahexaenoic  Is Not Influenced by Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Involved in Lipid Metabolism in Humans.</a></h2><p>The triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering effects of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, and in particular docosahexaenoic  (DHA), are well documented, although these effects manifest large interindividual variability. The objective of this secondary analysis is to investigate whether common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes involved in DHA synthesis and TAG metabolism are associated with the responsiveness of blood lipids, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein concentration to dietary treatment by DHA supplied in high- canola oil (HOCO). In a randomized, crossover-controlled feeding trial, 129 subjects with metabolic syndrome received high- canola oil (HOCO) and high- canola oil supplemented with DHA (HOCO-DHA), each for 4 weeks. During the HOCO-DHA phase, the intake of DHA ranged from 1 to 2.5 g/day.

In contrast, phospholipid FA content did not change between cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast except for OA, which decreased by -62% (p < 0.05). Decreasing PHT TG and NEFA lipid content at 90h in culture is likely due to processes related to differentiation such as alterations in lipase activity that occur as cytotrophoblast cells differentiate.

However, the role of HPS in NAFLD is still unknown.A total of 393 subjects with (n=194) or without (n=199) NAFLD were enrolled to evaluate the serum HPS concentration.

Hepatic overexpression or silencing of HPS was achieved by lentiviral vector delivery in mice and lipofectamine transfection in HepG2 cells.  related proteins were detected by Western blots. The expression of inflammatory factors was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.Subjects with NAFLD had a higher serum HPS concentration than those without it. Overexpression of HPS increased hepatic lipid accumulation and NAFLD activity scores (NAS), whereas deletion of HPS improved high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and decreased NAS in mice. Additionally, , a steatogenic reagent, increased HPS expression in hepatocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of HPS in HepG2 cells induced lipid accumulation through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent pathway, whereas deletion of HPS decreased -induced lipid accumulation.The present study provides evidence that HPS plays an important role in NAFLD and induces hepatic lipid accumulation through an ERK1/2-dependent pathway.Crown Copyright © 2013.

Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral lipid metabolic process" and "Regulation of lipid storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the MRI manifestation of POA@SPION in the inner ear.A total of 26 male Wister rats were selected for testing POA@SPION administered through intracochlear, intratympanic and intravenous routes. MRI was performed with a 4.7 T MR scanner.POA@SPION can be introduced into the perilymph space, after which it becomes widely distributed and can demonstrate the  of the perilymph-endolymph . Positive highlighting of the endolymph compartment against the darkened perilymph was visualized for the first time. POA@SPION passed through the middle-inner ear barriers in only small amounts, but stayed in the perilymph for 3 days. They did not traverse the blood-perilymph  or blood-endolymph .

Total LCFA oxidative capacity was measured in respiration chambers after gastric infusion (n = 5 per treatment) with isoenergetic amounts of [1-(14)C]triglycerides (TGs), either  (18:1n-9) TG [3.02 mmol/kg body weight (BW)(0.75)] or erucic  (22:1n-9) TG (2.46 mmol/kg BW(0.75)). Total expired (14)CO2 was collected and quantified at 20-min intervals over 24 h. Hepatic in vitro LCFA oxidation was determined simultaneously using [1-(14)C] and erucic  substrates.The in vivo 24-h accumulative [1-(14)C]TG oxidation (percentage of energy intake/kg BW(0.75)) tended to increase with clofibrate supplementation (P = 0.10), although there was no difference in the peak or mean utilization rate. The maximal extent of  TG oxidation was 1.6-fold that of erucic  TG (P < 0.006). Hepatic in vitro LCFA oxidation increased 61% with clofibrate (P < 0.0008).

Triamcinolone has half-life of 88min. Prolonged oral use is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects as peptic ulcer, abdominal distention and ulcerative esophagitis as described in various patents. Microemulgel offers advantage of better stability, better loading capacity and controlled release especially for drug with short half life.Objective of the present study was to optimize microemulgel based transdermal delivery of triamcinolone.Saturated solubility of triamcinolone in various oils, surfactants and co-surfactants is estimated. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to determine the region of transparent microemulsion. Microemulsion was evaluated for globule size (FE-SEM, zetasizer), % transmittance, pH, viscosity, conductivity etc. Design of experiment was used to optimize microemulsion based gel. Carbopol 971P and HPMC K100M were used as independent variables. Microemulsion based gel was evaluated for in-vitro as well as ex-vivo parameters.Microemulsion was formulated with , lauroglycol FCC and propylene glycol. PDI 0.197 indicated microemulsion is mono-disperse. 32 factorial design gave batch F8 as optimized. Design expert suggested drug release; gel viscosity and bio-adhesive strength were three significant dependant factors affecting the transdermal delivery. F8 showed drug release 92.62.16±1.22% through egg membrane, 95.23±1.44% through goat skin after 8hr and Korsmeyer-Peppas release model was followed.It can be concluded that a stable, effective controlled release transdermal microemulgel was optimised for triamcinolone.

These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total energy per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure.The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all).

Discrepancies between studies may be due to differences in study population, as subjects with increased baseline BP levels may be more responsive. Therefore, we examined specifically the effects of ALA on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in (pre-)hypertensive subjects.

We examined tissue lipid droplet distribution and used gut sac preparations to characterize uptake mechanisms of the monounsaturated fatty ,  (OA; 18:1 cis-9), in the Pacific hagfish. OA absorption was carrier-mediated and demonstrated saturable concentration-dependent uptake with an affinity constant of 55 ± 7 µM, and a maximal rate of uptake of 1311 ± 97 pmol cm h. Additionally, regulation of intestinal transport was demonstrated as feeding significantly increased uptake.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the volatile compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic  which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic  produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane fatty  showed that co-culture improved the content of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1). In order to further explore the interactions between the two strains, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the effect of co-culture with T. halophilus on the transcription profiling of Z. rouxii. By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation, energy , and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances , DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii.

Evidences have been shown that PA also decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in cultured macrophages. Although studies have shown that other fatty acids (FAs) modulate several lymphocyte functions, the specific effect of PA on these cells is unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of PA on activation and differentiation of human lymphocytes in comparison to  (OA).Human lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of health men and cultured in the presence of growing concentrations of PA or OA (5 to 200 μM), for 24 h. After that, cells were collected and cytotoxicity evaluated by flow cytometry. Then, we analyzed proliferative capacity in lymphocytes treated with non toxic concentrations of PA and OA (25 and 50 μM, respectively), in the presence or absence of concanavalin A (ConA). The Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production was determined by the Cytometric Bead Array. CD28 and CD95 surface expression and T regulatory cell percentage were determined by flow cytometry.We observed that PA is toxic to lymphocytes above 50 μM. PA promoted a decrease of lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by ConA in both concentrations. PA also decreased CD28 externalization and increased CD95. On the other hand, OA did not alter these parameters. In the same way, PA reduced IL6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL17A production in both concentration and IL2 only at 50 μM (in the presence of ConA). OA promoted IFN-gamma reduction in both concentrations and an increase of IL-2, IL4 and IL10 at 25 μM. Both fatty acids decreased the percentage of T regulatory cells.In conclusion, PA promoted a suppressive effect on lymphocyte proliferation characterized by a decrease of Th1 and Th17 response, and co-stimulatory molecule (CD28). However, OA increased lymphocyte proliferation through IL2 production and Th2 response. These results also show a more suppressive effect of PA on lymphocytes in comparison to OA.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030149>Additive regulation of adiponectin expression by the mediterranean diet olive oil components  and hydroxytyrosol in human adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory hormone, is suppressed in obesity through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Olive oil consumption is associated with beneficial cardiometabolic actions, with possible contributions from the antioxidant phenol hydroxytyrosol (HT) and the monounsaturated fatty   (OA, 18:1n-9 cis), both possessing anti-inflammatory and vasculo-protective properties. We determined the effects of HT and OA, alone and in combination, on adiponectin expression in human and murine adipocytes under pro-inflammatory conditions induced by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α. We used human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes and murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes as cell model systems, and pretreated them with 1-100 μmol/L OA, 0.1-20 μmol/L HT or OA plus HT combination before stimulation with 10 ng/mL TNF-α. OA or HT significantly (P<0.05) prevented TNF-α-induced suppression of total adiponectin secretion (by 42% compared with TNF-α alone) as well as mRNA levels (by 30% compared with TNF-α alone). HT and OA also prevented-by 35%-TNF-α-induced downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARγ. Co-treatment with HT and OA restored adiponectin and PPARγ expression in an additive manner compared with single treatments. Exploring the activation of JNK, which is crucial for both adiponectin and PPARγ suppression by TNF-α, we found that HT and OA additively attenuated TNF-α-stimulated JNK phosphorylation (up to 55% inhibition).

Here, we report blue emission from OA in its free molecular form and further demonstrate this by anchoring OA over the surfaces of Al2O3, ZnAl2O4(ZA), ZnAl2O4:Eu3+ (ZA:Eu3+), and Y2O3:Eu3+. White light emission was observed from OA-modified ZA:Eu3+ nanophosphor due to mixing of broad blue emission of OA and red emission of Eu3+ through  transfer from OA to Eu3+. A detailed study revealed the characteristic binding modes of OA and their dependence on Eu3+ concentration, structural inversion in ZA, and the optical properties and surface states in the pristine and OA-modified ZA:Eu3+. First principles density functional theory calculations were employed to provide an insight into the HOMO-LUMO levels of OA molecule and, electronic structure of pristine and OA-modified ZA surface. The binding of OA with the ZA:xEu3+ surface changes from bridging bidentate to chelating bidentate with increasing Eu3+ concentration in the lattice. The surface binding nature of the carboxylate group with the optimized surface of ZA and the creation of mid-gap states were deduced theoretically by using butanoic  instead of OA. The blue emission from OA and its mixing with Eu3+ emission was further confirmed experimentally by anchoring it over Y2O3:Eu3+ red phosphor.

Because we have already shown that dga1 disruption decreases the expression of ESA1, which encodes histone acetyltransferase, the present study was aimed at exploring how Esa1p was involved in lipid accumulation. We based our work on the previous observation that Esa1p acetylates and activates phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) encoded by PCK1, a rate-limiting enzyme in , and subsequently evaluated the activation of Pck1p by yeast growth with non-fermentable carbon sources, thus dependent on . This assay revealed that the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np had much lower growth in a glycerol-lactate (GL) medium than the wild-type strain overexpressing Dga1∆Np. Moreover, overexpression of Esa1p or Pck1p in mutants improved the growth, indicating that the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np had lower activities of Pck1p and  due to lower expression of ESA1. In vitro PEPCK assay showed the same trend in the culture of the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np with 10 % glucose medium, indicating that Pck1p-mediated  decreased in this oleaginous transformant under the lipid-accumulating conditions introduced by the glucose medium. The growth of the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np in the GL medium was also improved by overexpression of acetyl-CoA synthetase, Acs1p or Acs2p, indicating that supply of acetyl-CoA was crucial for Pck1p acetylation by Esa1p. In addition, the ∆dga1 mutant without Dga1∆Np also showed better growth in the GL medium, indicating that decreased lipid accumulation was enhancing Pck1p-mediated . Finally, we found that overexpression of Ole1p, a fatty  ∆9-desaturase, in the ∆dga1 mutant overexpressing Dga1∆Np improved its growth in the GL medium. Although the exact mechanisms leading to the effects of Ole1p were not clearly defined, changes of palmitoleic and  contents appeared to be critical.

In normoxia cells can generate unsaturated FA from saturated stearic and palmitic  by desaturation. However, since the desaturation step is -dependent hypoxic cancer cells display an increased dependence on the uptake of unsaturated FA. Up to now the mechanism of increased FA uptake in hypoxia is largely unknown. Here we aimed to study the role of human serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1) in the regulation of FA uptake in cancer cells exposed to acute or chronic cycling hypoxia and explore its use as target for the radiosensitization of hypoxic cancer cells.The effect of SGK1-inhibition (GSK650394) on NCI-H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to normoxia, acute or chronic cycling hypoxia was analyzed under standard and serum-deprived conditions by short-term proliferation, apoptosis and cell death assays. The impact of SGK1-inhibition on radiation sensitivity was determined by standard colony formation assays. The effect of GSK650394 on FA uptake was quantified by measuring intracellular accumulation of fluorescent FA (C1-BODIPY®-C12).Exposure to acute or chronic cycling hypoxia was associated with up-regulated expression of SGK1 in NCI-H460 cells, increased uptake of FA from the culture medium, and increased sensitivity to serum deprivation. Survival of serum-deprived hypoxic NCI-H460 cells was rescued by the addition of the unsaturated FA, , whereas the saturated FA, palmitic  was highly toxic to the hypoxic cancer cells. Interestingly, SGK1 inhibition abrogated the rescue effect of  in serum-deprived hypoxic cancer cells and this effect was associated with a reduction in FA uptake particularly in anoxia-tolerant cancer cells exposed to severe hypoxia. Finally, SKG1 inhibition decreased long-term survival and potently sensitized the parental and anoxia-tolerant NCI-H460 cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation in normoxia as well as the anoxia-tolerant cancer cells in severe hypoxia.Our data suggest that SGK1 plays a role in the regulation of FA uptake that becomes essential under conditions of acute or chronic cycling hypoxia.

Cholesterol crystals are metabolic signals that trigger sterile inflammation in atherosclerosis, presumably by activating inflammasomes for IL-1β production. We found here that atherogenesis was mediated by IL-1α and we identified fatty acids as potent inducers of IL-1α-driven vascular inflammation. Fatty acids selectively stimulated the release of IL-1α but not of IL-1β by uncoupling mitochondrial respiration. Fatty -induced mitochondrial uncoupling abrogated IL-1β secretion, which deviated the cholesterol crystal-elicited response toward selective production of IL-1α.

A transcription assay using LβT2 cells demonstrated that LCFAs, , α-linolenic , docosahexaenoic  and palmitate, repressed the expression of Cga, Lhb, and Fshb at concentrations between 50 and 100 µM. On the other hand, treatment with 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs, , α-linolenic  and docosahexaenoic , repressed only Fshb expression, while the same dose of a saturated LCFA, palmitate, had no effect on the expression of gonadotropin subunit genes. Furthermore, GW9508 did not affect promoter activity. Next, we examined deletion mutants of the upstream region of Fshb and found that the upstream regulatory region (-2824 to -2343 bp) of Fshb was responsible for the notable repression by 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs. Our results suggest that the upstream region of Fshb is susceptible to unsaturated LCFAs.

However, the mechanism by which long-chain saturated fatty acids trigger inflammation is still contentious. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of fatty acids on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα was investigated in the mHypoE-N42 hypothalamic cell line (N42). N42 cells were treated with lauric  (LA) and palmitic  (PA). PA challenge was carried out in the presence of either a TLR4 inhibitor, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor (L-cycloserine),  (OA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Intracellular ceramide accumulation was quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. PA but not LA upregulated IL-6 and TNFα. L-cycloserine, OA and EPA all counteracted PA-induced intracellular ceramide accumulation leading to a downregulation of IL-6 and TNFα. However, a TLR4 inhibitor failed to inhibit PA-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, PA induced the expression of IL-6 and TNFα in N42 neuronal cells independently of TLR4 but, partially, via ceramide synthesis with OA and EPA being anti-inflammatory by decreasing PA-induced intracellular ceramide build-up. Thus, ceramide accumulation represents one on the mechanisms by which PA induces inflammation in neurons.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15165614>Cardiovascular effects of milk enriched with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, , folic , and vitamins E and B6 in volunteers with mild .</a></h2><p>Results from epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have indicated that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, , and folic  have beneficial effects on health, including decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.

The antineoplastic properties of many PUFAs such as linoleic  and their metabolites are known. We tested the hypothesis that natural vegetable oils, such as sesame oil and its component linoleic , when added to human  adenocarcinoma cells growing in tissue culture would inhibit their growth and that normal  cells would not be similarly affected. Three human  cell lines and one normal human  cell line were exposed to the following: (1) pure linoleic ; (2) lipase-digested sesame oil; (3) undigested sesame oil; (4) five additional common vegetable oils; (5) mineral oil. Linoleic  inhibited the in vitro growth of all three malignant human  adenocarcinoma cell lines. The normal  cell line showed dramatically less inhibition of growth. Lipase-digested sesame oil (LDSO) and undigested sesame oil (UDSO) produced greater inhibition of growth of all three malignant  cell lines than of the normal  cells. Five other common vegetable oils containing various amounts of PUFAs such as corn, soybean, safflower, olive and coconut oils, all in their lipase-digested form, were found to dramatically inhibit the growth of the HT-29 malignant human  cell line. Undigested olive and safflower oils also inhibited the HT-29 cells although not as markedly as the lipase-digested oils. Mineral oil did not inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells. Both lauric and palmitic , which are saturated fatty acids found in abundance in coconut oil inhibits the HT-29 cells more strongly than linoleic , while  did not inhibit. We conclude that many vegetable oils including sesame contain in vitro antineoplastic properties and that this finding warrants further investigation both in vitro and in vivo to assess their possible chemotherapeutic potential.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[Insulin resistance is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by fatty acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h2><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors. Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type metabolism of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) , 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major metabolic disorders in diabetes mellitus.

A possibility is that parallel changes in both T cells and target cells provoke autoimmune attack. We previously documented greater Ca2+ transients in fibroblasts from T1D subjects than non-T1D after exposure to fatty acids (FA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). These data indicate that metabolic and signal transduction defects present in T1D can be elicited ex vivo in isolated cells. Changes that precede T1D, including inflammation, may activate atypical responses in people that are genetically predisposed to T1D. To identify such cellular differences in T1D, we quantified a panel of metabolic responses in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) from age-matched T1D and non-T1D subjects, as models for non-immune and immune cells, respectively. Fibroblasts from T1D subjects accumulated more lipid, had higher LC-CoA levels and converted more FA to CO2, with less mitochondrial proton leak in response to oleate alone or with TNFα, using the latter as a model of inflammation. T1D-PBMCs contained and also accumulated more lipid following FA exposure. In addition, they formed more peroxidized lipid than controls following FA exposure. We conclude that both immune and non-immune cells in T1D subjects differ from controls in terms of responses to FA and TNFα. Our results suggest a differential sensitivity to inflammatory insults and FA that may precede and contribute to T1D by priming both immune cells and their targets for autoimmune reactions.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation', 'obesity', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21903399>Inhibitory effect of novel 5-O-acyl juglones on mammalian DNA polymerase activity,  cell growth and inflammatory response.</a></h2><p>We previously found that vitamin K(3) (menadione, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) inhibits the activity of human mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (pol γ).

The juglone conjugated with  (C18:1-acyl juglone) showed the strongest inhibition of DNA replicative pol α activity and human  carcinoma (HCT116) cell growth in 10 synthesized 5-O-acyl juglones. C12:0-Acyl juglone was the strongest inhibitor of DNA repair-related pol λ, as well as the strongest suppression of the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the compounds tested. Moreover, this compound caused the greatest reduction in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced acute inflammation in mouse ears. C12:0- and C18:1-Acyl juglones selectively inhibited the activities of mammalian pol species, but did not influence the activities of other pols and DNA metabolic enzymes tested.

Therefore, the study was designed to explore the antioxidant and hypolipidemic activity of swertiamarin in ameliorating NAFLD caused due to hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and insulin resistance. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells by supplementing 1mM  (OA) for 24h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipid droplets. This was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining and triglyceride accumulation. Swertiamarin (25μg/ml) decreased triglyceride content by 2 folds and effectively reduced LDH release (50%) activity by protecting membrane integrity thus, preventing apoptosis evidenced by reduced cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP1. We observed that swertiamarin significantly increased the expressions of major insulin signaling proteins like Insulin receptor (IR), PI(3)K, pAkt with concomitant reduction in p307 IRS-1. AMPK was activated by swertiamarin action, thus restoring insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes. In addition, qPCR results confirmed OA up-regulated Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP)-1c and fatty  synthase (FAS), resulting in increased fatty  synthesis. Swertiamarin effectively modulated PPAR-α, a major potential regulator of carbohydrate metabolism which, in turn, decreased the levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK, further restricting hepatic glucose production and fatty  synthesis. Cumulatively, swertiamarin targets potential metabolic regulators AMPK and PPAR-α, through which it regulates hepatic glycemic burden, fat accumulation, insulin resistance and ROS in hepatic steatosis which emphasizes clinical significance of swertiamarin in regulating metabolism and as a suitable candidate for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We examined the anti-CSC effects of the antifungal polyketide soraphen A, a specific inhibitor of the first committed step of lipid biosynthesis catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA). The mammosphere formation capability of MCF-7 cells was reduced following treatment with soraphen A in a dose-dependent manner. MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress the oncogene HER2 (MCF-7/HER2 cells) were 5-fold more sensitive than MCF-7 parental cells to soraphen A-induced reductions in mammosphere-forming efficiency. Soraphen A treatment notably decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSC-like cells and impeded the HER2's ability to increase the ALDH+-stem cell population.

However, total fat consists of different fatty  families, e.g., saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Epidemiological evidence and experimental studies suggest that these fatty  families have different effects on breast and  carcinogenesis. Therefore the action of each fatty  on carcinogenesis should be evaluated separately. Although it is difficult to establish firm conclusions on the effect of each fatty  in human epidemiological studies, experimental studies on animals and cultured cells suggest that n-6 PUFAs (linoleic  and arachidonic ) may have a tumor promoting effect, while n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic  and alpha-linolenic ) and conjugated fatty acids (CFAs; a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of PUFAs with conjugated double bonds) exert an inhibitory effect on tumor growth. SFAs such as palmitic  and stearic  show little or no tumor promoting effect, and the action of , a MUFA, is inconclusive. In addition to regulation of abnormal cell growth seen in cancers, fatty acids also control cell loss seen in degenerative eye diseases, such as degeneration of lens material in cataract and degeneration of photoreceptor cells in retinitis pigmentosa. Experiments suggest that n-6 PUFAs cause deleterious effects, while n-3 PUFAs result in beneficial effects on the lens and retina. In particular, docosahexaenoic  is known to be effective in rescuing photoreceptor cells from damage.

CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular inflammation, cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury.

Compared to the control, feeding of VAD diet (alone or with HFr) resulted in pancreatic intra-islet vessel dilation and reduced plasma insulin, glucagon and C-peptide levels, however, glucose levels decreased only in VADHFr group. In line with plasma levels, VAD diet-fed animals displayed lower immunostaining for insulin and glucagon, which corroborated with increased apoptotic staining observed in the islet regions, possibly due to increased cellular stress, as indicated by high immunostaining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein homologues protein (CHOP). On the other hand, it significantly decreased the SCD1 protein, which corroborated with reduced MUFA levels, particularly,  (C18:1), when compared to the control and HFr groups. In conclusion, chronic vitamin A deficiency altered the structure and functions of pancreas by diminishing the islet cells, possibly by inducing cellular stress-mediated apoptosis and decreasing SCD1-mediated  (C18:1) synthesis.

Thus, we sought to determine whether OA-NO , an exemplary nitro-fatty , has the capacity to inhibit cutaneous .We evaluated the effect of OA-NO on allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) using an established model of contact hypersensitivity in C57Bl/6 mice utilizing 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene as the hapten.We found that subcutaneous (SC) OA-NO injections administered 18 h prior to sensitization and elicitation suppresses ACD in both preventative and therapeutic models. In vivo SC OA-NO significantly inhibits pathways that lead to inflammatory cell infiltration and the production of inflammatory cytokines in the skin. Moreover, OA-NO is capable of enhancing regulatory T-cell activity. Thus, OA-NO treatment results in anti-inflammatory effects capable of inhibiting ACD by inducing immunosuppressive responses.Overall, these results support the development of OA-NO as a promising therapeutic for ACD and provides new insights into the role of electrophilic fatty acids in the control of cutaneous immune responses potentially relevant to a broad range of allergic and inflammatory skin diseases.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of FAs and natural waxes on the  in 3T3-L1 cells. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated and treated with FAs and waxes.

Adipogenic gene expression including , , , , and  was determined. Results showed that increasing the concentration of FAs and waxes led to a decrease in the adipocyte cells viability and metabolic performance. SA showed the highest level of triglyceride accumulation (p<0.05), whereas ALA showed the lowest (p<0.05). Both BW and CW at 3.0 ppm showed significantly higher lipid accumulation than in the control and other groups (p<0.05). ALA had significantly downregulated adipogenic gene expression levels, excluding those of , compared to the other treatment groups (p<0.05).

The addition of extra glucose also increased the mRNA levels for these apos. Increased radioactivity was also found in these apolipoproteins by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine for 48 h. However, in a pulse-chase experiment (15 min labeling, 2 h chase), glucose was found to increase apoA-I synthesis but not apoB synthesis. More labeled apoB appeared in the medium during the chase because glucose inhibited its intracellular degradation. The effect of glucose on secretion of these apos could be mimicked by fructose and mannose but not by 6-deoxyglucose, showing that the hexoses must enter the cells and be phosphorylated. In contrast, the addition of 0.5 mM oleate had a weak inhibitory effect on secretion of apoA-I whereas it increased the secretion of apoB by more than twofold. The combination of 10 mM glucose and 0.5 mM oleate had no greater effect than glucose alone on apoA-I secretion but increased apoB secretion by fourfold. ii) Inhibiting  (by glucosamine) lowered secretion of both apoA-I and apoB, while inhibiting lipogenesis (using 8-Br-cyclic AMP or 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic  (TOFA)) did not affect apoA-I secretion but clearly decreased that of apoB. However, the inhibitory effect of TOFA on apoB secretion was much smaller in the presence of 0.5 mM oleate instead of extra glucose. Actinomycin-D and cycloheximide strongly suppressed the stimulatory effect of glucose on secretion of both apolipoproteins. Actinomycin-D also suppressed basal secretion of apoA-I but surprisingly stimulated that of apoB. These observations indicate that in HepG2 cells secretion of apoA-I is strongly dependent on ongoing protein synthesis and can be boosted by glucose, whereas that of apoB is primarily driven by internal (via lipogenesis from glucose) or external supply of fatty acyl-residues.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245360>Effect of Mn on Upconversion Emission, Thermal Sensing and Optical Heater Behavior of Yb - Er Codoped NaGdF Nanophosphors.</a></h2><p>In thiswork, we investigate the influence of Mn on the emission color, thermal sensing and optical heater behavior of NaGdF: Yb/Er nanophosphors, which the nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using  as both a stabilizing and a chelating agent.

Metabolomic profiling studies have identified a number of metabolites whose fasting levels are associated with dysglycemia and type 2 diabetes.

These metabolites were measured in fasting plasma samples taken just prior to an OGTT from 1623 nondiabetic subjects: 955 from the Relationship between  Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease Study (RISC Study; 11.7% IGT) and 668 subjects from the Diabetes Mellitus and Vascular Health Initiative (DMVhi) cohort from the DEXLIFE project (11.8% IGT). The associations between metabolites, anthropometric, and metabolic parameters and 2hPG values were assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients and Random Forest classification analysis to rank variables for their ability to distinguish IGT from normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Multivariate logistic regression models for estimating risk of IGT were developed and evaluated using AUCs calculated from the corresponding ROC curves.

We have previously demonstrated that berberine causes mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation, with simultaneous increase in oxidative stress. We also demonstrated that berberine causes an inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and a decrease on calcium loading capacity through induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The objective of the present work is to investigate a common target for both induction of the MPT and inhibition of respiration. The hypothesis is that berberine induces the MPT through interacting with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). By measuring induction of the MPT through increased mitochondrial swelling, membrane depolarization and loss of calcium retention, we observed that the effects of berberine were not inhibited by bongkrekic  although adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/oligomycin completely prevented the MPT. Also, we observed that berberine increased the depolarization effect of  on liver . The initial depolarization observed when berberine is added to  was not affected by ANT inhibitors. Taken together, we propose that berberine acts on the ANT, altering the binding of the protein to bongkrekic  but not to cyclosporin A or ADP. It is also clear that the membrane potential is required for berberine effects, most likely for allowing for its mitochondrial accumulation. Mitochondrial effects of berberine can be relevant not only for its proposed antitumor activity but also for the assessment of its organ toxicity, depending on factors such as tissue accumulation or delivery.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25792746>Opposite cross-talk by oleate and palmitate on  signaling in hepatocytes through macrophage activation.</a></h2><p>Chronic low grade inflammation in adipose tissue during obesity is associated with an impairment of the  signaling cascade. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of palmitate or oleate overload of macrophage/Kupffer cells in triggering stress-mediated signaling pathways, in lipoapoptosis, and in the cross-talk with  signaling in hepatocytes. RAW 264.7 macrophages or Kupffer cells were stimulated with oleate or palmitate, and levels of M1/M2 polarization markers and the lipidomic profile of eicosanoids were analyzed. Whereas proinflammatory cytokines and total eicosanoids were elevated in macrophages/Kupffer cells stimulated with palmitate, enhanced arginase 1 and lower leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were detected in macrophages stimulated with oleate. When hepatocytes were pretreated with conditioned medium (CM) from RAW 264.7 or Kupffer cells loaded with palmitate (CM-P), phosphorylation of stress kinases and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling was increased,  signaling was impaired, and lipoapoptosis was detected. Conversely, enhanced  receptor-mediated signaling and reduced levels of the phosphatases protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were found in hepatocytes treated with CM from macrophages stimulated with oleate (CM-O). Supplementation of CM-O with LTB4 suppressed  sensitization and increased PTP1B and PTEN. Furthermore, LTB4 decreased  receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in hepatocytes, activated the NFκB pathway, and up-regulated PTP1B and PTEN, these effects being mediated by LTB4 receptor BTL1. In conclusion, oleate and palmitate elicit an opposite cross-talk between macrophages/Kupffer cells and hepatocytes.

Exposure of HepG2 cells to LDL-cholesterol resulted in a high concentration of cholesterol and cholesterol crystallization in LDs.  Excess cholesterol is stored in the liver primarily within hepatocyte LDs where it can crystallize.

Placental lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is involved in the initial step in transplacental fatty  transport as it hydrolyzes maternal triglycerides (TG) to release free fatty acids (FFA). We investigated LPL activity and protein (Western blot) and mRNA expression (real-time RT-PCR) in the placenta of an LPL-deficient mother with marked hypertriglyceridemia. The LPL activity was fourfold lower, LPL protein expression 50% lower, and mRNA expression threefold higher than that of normal, healthy placentas at term (n = 4-7).

No major changes were observed in LPL protein or mRNA expression. We found no effect of insulin on LPL activity or protein expression in the cultured trophoblasts.

An intake of 40 to 50 g of fat in a meal results in significant lipemia in healthy adults, with consecutive fat-containing meals enhancing the lipemia. This would suggest that limiting fat intake to approximately 30 g on each eating occasion would minimize postprandial lipemia. Sedentary behavior and obesity independently impair the postprandial metabolism of lipids. Postprandial lipemia causes endothelial dysfunction and results in a transient increase in factor VII activated (FVIIa) concentration. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity is associated with fasting plasma triacylglycerol concentration, but is not influenced by postprandial lipemia. Trans-18:1  appears to increase cholesterol ester transfer activity acutely compared with oleate. Randomized stearic -rich fats result in less postprandial lipemia and a lower postprandial increase in FVIIa, whereas unrandomized cocoa butter results in similar postprandial lipemia and increases in FVIIa compared with oleate.

Since serum PLA2 levels correlate with mortality in both experimental  and clinical gram-negative septic shock, and chlorpromazine was previously shown to improve survival in these conditions, we postulate that its therapeutic efficacy resides at least in part in its PLA2-inhibitory activity.</p><p>Keyword:['endotoximia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24216567>Dietary arachidonic and  intake in ulcerative  etiology: a prospective cohort study using 7-day food diaries.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids may be involved in the etiology of ulcerative  (UC). Arachidonic  (AA), an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty , is a precursor of the proinflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4, and its metabolism is competitively inhibited by  (OA). This study aimed to prospectively investigate whether AA is positively and OA is negatively associated with incident UC development, using data from 7-day food diaries.A total of 25 639 men and women, aged between 40 and 79 years, from Norfolk, UK, were recruited into the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort between 1993 and 1997. At baseline, participants completed 7-day food diaries, checked by nutritionists using a database containing 11 000 foods and 55 000 portion sizes. The cohort was monitored until June 2004 to identify participants who developed UC. Each patient was matched for age and sex with four controls, and conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for AA and OA intakes, and UC association.Of the participants, 26 (58% men) developed incident UC (53% left sided) after a median follow-up time of 3.8 years (0.5-8.3 years). The highest AA tertile was positively associated with an odds ratio of 6.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-35.23], with a trend across tertiles [odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.06-5.61, P=0.04]. The highest tertile of OA intake was inversely associated with a 0.03 OR for UC (95% CI 0.002-0.56) and an inverse trend (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.90, P=0.03).Dietary AA was positively and OA was inversely associated with UC development, with large effect sizes in a dose-dependent manner. This supports roles for measuring these nutrients in future etiological studies and modifying intake in future interventional studies in patients with established disease.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammatory bowel disease']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146638>Inhibition of the antioxidant activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase from  exposed to a  antifungal fraction.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the  effect of an antifungal fraction obtained from  plant (JmAF) in the generation of reactive  species (ROS) and the activity of the catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes from , as well as their influence in the viability of the fungus spores.

After 12 hours of fasting, each subject was given one of the two test meals standardized, including 2 muffins and water (HSM, 42.1% of saturated fat , or HMM, 34.5% of monounsaturated fat ). Plasma fatty  profile and concentrations of apolipoproteins A1 and B100, complement C3, and triacylglycerols were analyzed during fasting and at 2, 3, and 5 postprandial hours.Among the markers studied, the triacylglycerol (TAG) and complement C3 were significantly higher in the OW group, compared to NW. The increment in the C3 concentration was higher after HSM intake, compared with HMM (iAUC = 4365.5 ± 5477.4 vs. 1215.2 ± 882.4; p = 0.006), with no differences between groups. After 5 hours postprandial, plasma  values remained high compared with the fasting value in the NW group, but not in the OW group (26.0 ± 4.2 vs 23.7 ± 3.9%; p < 0.001).

As the disease progresses, oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development of hepatic lipid peroxidation. Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), a subtype of the cytochrome P450 family, has been shown to be a vital modulator in production of reactive  species. However, the exact role of CYP1A1 in NAFLD is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CYP1A1 on lipid peroxidation in  (OA)-treated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). We found that the expression of CYP1A1 is elevated in OA-stimulated HepG2 cells. The results of siRNA transfection analysis indicated that CYP1A1-siRNA inhibited the lipid peroxidation in OA-treated HepG2 cells. Additionally, compared with siRNA-transfected and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-OA-induced HepG2 cells, overexpression of CYP1A1 by BaP further accelerated the lipid peroxidation in OA-treated HepG2 cells.

Millions of years in life consistently in the waters of several oceans, all the ancestors of man were carnivorous (Carnivores), fish-eating mammals. When the ocean retreated and the carnivorous (fish-eating) were on land, each individual privatized a "piece" of the ocean. Animals transformed it ito a pool of intercellular medium in vivo. The biological role of the late in the phylogeny of insulin is the formation of new biological functions in vivo. The action of insulin has transformed the carnivorous (fish-eating) ocean into herbivorous (Herbivores) species on land. There was it by synthesis in vivo from exogenous glucose of fatty acids (FA). Regulatory action of insulin was the directed conversion of exogenous glucose into ω-6 C18: 1 cis- FA. Insulin late in phylogeny expressed the synthesis of new, conjugated enzymes: it is palmitoyl-CoA-elongase and stearyl-CoAdesaturase. Two enzymes synthesized FAs along the way: synthesized in situ de novo, from exogenous glucose, C16: 0 palmitic  → C18: 0 stearic  → ω-6 C18: 1 cis- without accumulation of stearic FA. Insulin is not converted into an  FA exogenous palmitic  from carnivorous food. On land, the action of insulin transformed the species Homo sapiens, into a herbivore, but with carnivorous, fish-eating, past. The idea of a person as omnivorous (Omnivor) - nonsense; such forms of nature did not form.

The effect of amino acids and oleate was also examined. The following observations were made: (1) with glucose alone, net glycogen production was low. Inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate translocase increased intracellular glucose 6-phosphate (3-fold), glycogen accumulation (5-fold) without change in active (dephosphorylated) glycogen synthase (GSa) activity, and lactate production (4-fold). With both glucose 6-phosphate translocase and glycogen phosphorylase inhibited, glycogen deposition increased 8-fold and approached reported in vivo rates of glycogen deposition during the fasted-->fed transition. Addition of a physiological mixture of amino acids in the presence of glucose increased glycogen accumulation (4-fold) through activation of GS and inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase flux. Addition of oleate with glucose present decreased glycolytic flux and increased the flux through glucose 6-phosphatase with no change in glycogen deposition. With glucose 6-phosphate translocase inhibited by S4048, oleate increased intracellular glucose 6-phosphate (3-fold) and net glycogen production (1.5-fold), without a major change in GSa activity. It is concluded that glucose cycling in hepatocytes prevents the net accumulation of glycogen from glucose. Amino acids activate GS and inhibit flux through glucose-6-phosphatase, while oleate inhibits  and stimulates glucose-6-phosphatase flux. Variation in glucose 6-phosphate does not always result in activity changes of GSa.

The regulation of L-PK is complex involving both hormones and nutrients. We have found that feeding rats diets containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) significantly inhibits hepatic pyruvate kinase enzyme activity (> 60%) and suppresses mRNAPK abundance (> 70%). Studies with primary hepatocytes indicate that PUFA act directly on hepatocytes. Specifically, arachidonic (20:4, omega 6) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5, omega 3)  suppressed both mRNAPK llevels and the activity of a transfected PKCAT (-4300/+12) fusion gene by > 70%. This is due to an inhibition of the insulin/glucose-mediated transactivation of L-PKCAT. Deletion analysis localized PUFA-regulated cis-acting elements to a region within the L-PK proximal promoter, i.e. between -197 and -96 base pairs. This region binds two transcription factors involved in the hormone/nutrient regulation of L-PK gene transcription, i.e. a major late transcription factor-like factor and HNF-4.

Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used: N group (normal chow diet), M group (dyslipidemia induced by 4-week high-fat feeding, then normal chow diet), OL group and OH group (dyslipidemia induced, then normal chow diet supplemented with 10.8% or 43.4% naked oat bran). Intervention lasted for 12weeks. Gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify serum metabolite profiles. Results confirmed the effects of oat bran on improving lipidemic variables and showed distinct metabolomic profiles associated with diet intervention. A number of endogenous molecules were changed by high-fat diet and normalized following supplementation of naked oat bran. Elevated levels of serum unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic  (Log2Fold of change=0.70, P=.02 OH vs. M group), palmitoleic  (Log2Fold of change=1.24, P=.02 OH vs. M group) and  (Log2Fold of change=0.66, P=.04 OH vs. M group) were detected after oat bran consumption. Furthermore, consumption of oat bran was also characterized by higher levels of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. Pathway exploration found that most of the discriminant metabolites were involved in fatty  biosynthesis, biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, microbial metabolism in diverse environments and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites. These results point to potential biomarkers and underlying benefit of naked oat bran in the context of diet-induced dyslipidemia and offer some insights into the mechanism exploration.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, effective treatments for OXPHOS defects, with complex I deficiency being the most prevalent, are not available. Yet, clinical practice has shown that some complex I deficient patients benefit from a high-fat or ketogenic diet, but it is unclear how these therapeutic diets influence mitochondrial function and more importantly, which complex I patients could benefit from such treatment. Dietary studies in a complex I deficient patient with exercise intolerance showed increased muscle endurance on a high-fat diet compared to a high-carbohydrate diet. We performed whole-exome sequencing to characterize the genetic defect. A pathogenic homozygous p.G212V missense mutation was identified in the  gene, encoding an early assembly factor of complex I. A complementation study in fibroblasts confirmed that the p.G212V mutation caused the complex I deficiency. The mechanism turned out to be an incomplete assembly of the peripheral arm of complex I, leading to a decrease in the amount of mature complex I. The patient clinically improved on a high-fat diet, which was supported by the 25% increase in maximal OXPHOS capacity in TMEM126B defective fibroblast by the saturated fatty  palmitic , whereas  did not have any effect in those fibroblasts. Fibroblasts of other patients with a characterized complex I gene defect were tested in the same way. Patient fibroblasts with complex I defects in NDUFS7 and NDUFAF5 responded to palmitic , whereas ACAD9, NDUFA12, and NDUFV2 defects were non-responding. Although the data are too limited to draw a definite conclusion on the mechanism, there is a tendency that protein defects involved in early assembly complexes, improve with palmitic , whereas proteins defects involved in late assembly, do not. Our data show at a clinical and biochemical level that a high fat diet can be beneficial for complex I patients and that our cell line assay will be an easy tool for the selection of patients, who might potentially benefit from this therapeutic diet.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29320411>Inihibition of Glycolysis by Using a Micro/Nano-Lipid Bromopyruvic Chitosan Carrier as a Promising Tool to Improve Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Glucose consumption in many types of cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was followed completely by over-expression of type II hexokinase (HKII).

Infections with this parasite cause diverse clinical manifestations, and recent studies revealed that infections with P. vivax can result in severe and fatal disease. Despite these facts, biological traits of the host response and parasite metabolism during P. vivax malaria are still largely underexplored. Parasitemia is clearly related to progression and severity of malaria caused by P. falciparum, however the effects of parasitemia during infections with P. vivax are not well understood.We conducted an exploratory study using a high-resolution metabolomics platform that uncovered significant associations between parasitemia levels and plasma metabolites from 150 patients with P. vivax malaria. Most plasma metabolites were inversely associated with higher levels of parasitemia. Top predicted metabolites are implicated into pathways of heme and lipid metabolism, which include biliverdin, bilirubin, palmitoylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine,  and omega-carboxy-trinor-leukotriene B4.The abundance of several plasma metabolites varies according to the levels of parasitemia in patients with P. vivax malaria. Moreover, our data suggest that the host response and/or parasite survival might be affected by metabolites involved in the degradation of heme and metabolism of several lipids. Importantly, these data highlight metabolic pathways that may serve as targets for the development of new antimalarial compounds.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

A rabbit  (OA)-induced pulmonary edema model was used. Thirty-two New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: a control group and three pulmonary edema groups (mild, moderate and severe). Features of transthoracic B-line artifacts (BLA), blood pH, PaO and PaCO, serum inflammatory factors, lung coefficient (LC), lung wet-to-dry  ratio (W/D) and lung histopathology were assessed. BLA features and severity of pulmonary edema were semiquantitatively scored. Correlations between the number of BLA and PaO, PaCO, serum inflammatory factors, LC and W/D were analyzed. An additional 8 rabbits with severe pulmonary edema were used as the verified group, in which the lung was divided into ex vivo BLA (BLA-ev)-free (BLA-ev-free) and BLA-ev-clustered subregions depending on the features of BLA-ev recorded by ex vivo lung ultrasound. Lung specimens from each subregion were collected for histopathological examination. Relationships between features of BLA-ev and lung histopathological abnormalities were analyzed. With increasing doses of OA, number of BLA, W/D and levels of serum inflammatory factors decreased. Meanwhile, lung pathologic abnormalities were aggravated. In addition, time of appearance of BLA, blood pH and PaO and PaCO decreased dose dependently on OA (p < 0.05). Number of BLA was linear positively correlated with severity of pulmonary edema (r = 0.953, p < 0.05). Consistently, the features of BLA-ev reflected the severity of lung histopathological abnormalities (r = 0.936, p < 0.05). Thus, POCUS is useful in the early quantitative assessment of the severity of pulmonary edema.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the effects of both FA were similar in reducing the potential of lipid synthesis and oxidation, and in enhancing the potential of glucose synthesis and glycogenesis. Differences found between FO and single FA administration show that response to FA was dependent on the treatment (mixture vs. single FA) but also comply with the idea that an interaction between FA and glucose rather than FA alone are in the origin of the results reported. The administration of individual FA such as  and octanoic  failed in enhancing  and reducing plasma glucose levels and thus in explaining results obtained with FO.

Mucoadhesive olaminosomes were characterized for their particle size, in-vitro drug release and irritation potentiality in rabbit eyes. The reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) through 8 h in male New Zealand Albino rabbits was measured after administration of the selected formulations. Histopathological changes in rabbits' eye were also evaluated. Results revealed that increasing the amount of the added oleylamine decreased the particle size of the resulted vesicles and increased the drug release rate. Olaminosomes showed enhanced drug absorption, hence more reduction in IOP was observed. Moreover, using chitosan HCl might increase the residence time of the formulation in the eye and hence improved the absorption of the drug. No histopathological changes in rabbits' eye were detected after the application of mucoadhesive olaminosomes concluding their safety on the ocular tissues.

This mutation is associated with accelerated activation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ1) which contributes to the formation of aneurysms in the root of the aorta. There is an imbalance in the synthesis of thromboxane A (TXA) and prostacyclin, that is a consequence of a differential protein expression of the isoforms of cyclooxygenases (COXs), suggesting an alteration of arachidonic  (AA) metabolism. The aim of this study was to analyze the participation of AA metabolism associated with inflammatory factors in the dilation and dissection of the aortic aneurysm in patients with MFS. A decrease in AA ( = 0.02), an increase in  (OA), TGFβ1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), prostaglandin E (PGE) ( < 0.05), and COXs activity ( = 0.002) was found. The expressions of phospholipase A (PLA), cytochrome P450 (CYP450 4A), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), COX2 and TXA2R ( < 0.05) showed a significant increase in the aortic aneurysm of patients with MFS compared to control subjects. COX1, 6-keto-prostaglandin 1 alpha (6-keto-PG) and 8-isoprostane did not show significant changes. Histological examination of the aortas showed an increase of cystic necrosis, elastic fibers and collagen in MFS. The results suggest that there are inflammatory factors coupled to genetic factors that predispose to aortic endothelial dysfunction in the aortic tissue of patients with MFS. There is a decrease in the percentage of AA, associated with an increase of PLA, COX2/TXA2R, CYP450 4A, and 5-LOX which leads to a greater synthesis of PGE than of 6-keto-PGF, thus contributing to the formation of the aortic aneurysm. The evident loss of the homeostasis in these mechanisms confirms that there is a participation of the AA pathway in the aneurysm progression in MFS.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26914244>Postprandial dietary fatty acids exert divergent inflammatory responses in retinal-pigmented epithelium cells.</a></h2><p>Postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) lead to a complex series of events that are potentially oxidative and inflammatory.

In vitro fatty  oxidation was then measured in kidneys with and without mitochondria inhibitors (antimycin A and rotenone) using [1-C]-labeled  (C18:1) and erucic  (C22:1) as substrates. Clofibrate significantly stimulated C18:1 and C22:1 oxidation in mitochondria ( < 0.001) but not in peroxisomes. In addition, the oxidation rate of C18:1 was greater in mitochondria than peroxisomes, while the oxidation of C22:1 was higher in peroxisomes than mitochondria ( < 0.001).

Here, we investigated the molecular basis for the difference in sensitivity between cancer cells and healthy cells. Using a combination of small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibition, proteomic and metabolomic technology, we identified the c-Myc oncogene as one essential determinant of HAMLET sensitivity. Increased c-Myc expression levels promoted sensitivity to HAMLET and shRNA knockdown of c-Myc suppressed the lethal response, suggesting that oncogenic transformation with c-Myc creates a HAMLET-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, HAMLET sensitivity was modified by the glycolytic state of tumor cells.

However, the role of BAY60-6583 in OA-induced ALI was attenuated by a specific blocker of A2BAR, PSB1115. A2BAR activation decreased HO-induced cell apoptosis in vitro, as characterized by the translocation of apoptotic proteins, the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-3 and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). In addition, apoptosis was required for the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. Importantly, compared with cells transfected with the A2BAR-siRNA, an ERK inhibitor or p38 inhibitor exhibited decreased apoptotic ratios and cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP-1 levels, whereas the JNK inhibitor displayed increases in these parameters.

These effects rely, at least in part, on the elevated plasma adiponectin concentration and muscle AdipoR1 level to dually activate the AMPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Several functions and oxidative stress parameters of peritoneal leukocytes were evaluated.The groups of obese mice treated with 2-OHOA or with EPA and DHA showed a significant improvement in several functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, digestion capacity, Natural killer activity and lymphoproliferation in response to mitogens. All of these functions, which were decreased in obese mice, increased reaching similar levels to those found in non-obese controls. Both treatments also improved oxidative stress parameters such as xanthine oxidase activity, which decreased, catalase activity and glutathione levels, which increased.These data suggest that dietary supplementation with monounsaturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids could be an effective nutritional intervention to restore the immune response and oxidative stress state, which are impaired in obese mice.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity', 'inflammation', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651135>A model biorefinery for avocado (Persea americana mill.) processing.</a></h2><p>This research investigated and evaluated a biorefinery for processing avocado Hass variety into microencapsulated phenolic compounds extract, ethanol, oil and xylitol.

Based on a combined high-resolution photoemission and soft X-ray absorption study, we report that superlubricity can be realized for engineering applications in bearing steel coated with ultra-smooth tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) under  lubrication. The results show that tribochemical reactions promoted by the oil lubrication generate strong structural changes in the carbon hybridization of the ta-C hydrogen-free carbon, with initially high sp content. Interestingly, the macroscopic superlow friction regime of moving mechanical assemblies coated with ta-C can be attributed to a few partially oxidized graphene-like sheets, with a thickness of not more than 1 nm, formed at the surface inside the wear scar. The sp planar carbon and -derived species are the hallmark of these mesoscopic surface structures created on top of colliding asperities as a result of the tribochemical reactions induced by the  lubrication. Atomistic simulations elucidate the tribo-formation of such graphene-like structures, providing the link between the overall atomistic mechanism and the macroscopic experimental observations of green superlubricity in the investigated ta-C/ tribological systems.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465559>Probiotic administration modifies the milk fatty  profile, intestinal morphology, and intestinal fatty  profile of goats.</a></h2><p>The effect of a mixture of potentially probiotic bacteria (MPPB; Lactobacillus reuteri DDL 19, Lactobacillus alimentarius DDL 48, Enterococcus faecium DDE 39, and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains) on the milk fatty  (FA) profile, with emphasis on cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) in the middle stage of goat lactation, was determined. In addition, the effects of MPPB feeding on the FA profile in intestinal content and intestinal morphology in weaned goats were analyzed. The probiotic supplement was able to modify FA composition of milk and intestinal content. The unsaturated FA concentrations in milk (g of FA/L of milk) increased from 4.49 to 7.86 for  (18:1), from 0.70 to 1.39 for linoleic (18:2), from 0.063 to 0.187 for linolenic (18:3) , and from 0.093 to 0.232 for CLA. The atherogenicity index diminished 2-fold after MPPB ingestion. In the intestinal content of the weaned goats, no significant difference in saturated FA concentration compared with the control was observed. However, , linolenic , CLA, and docosahexaenoic  concentrations increased by 81, 23, 344, and 74%, respectively, after probiotic consumption. The ruminal production of CLA was increased by the MPPB. However, bacterial strains of MPPB were unable to produce CLA in culture media. By histological techniques, it was observed that the treated group had intestinally more conserved morphological structures than the control group. The results obtained in this study indicate that the MPPB administration in lactating and weaned goats allows for the production of milk with improved concentrations of beneficial compounds, and also produces a protective effect in the goat intestine.

However, coatings with stability against boiling in hot water have not been achieved yet. Long-chain perfluorinated materials, which are often used for liquid-repellent coatings owing to their low surface , hinder the potential application of antifouling coatings in food containers. Herein, we design a fluorine-free slippery surface that immobilizes a biocompatible lubricant layer on a phenyl-group-modified smooth solid surface through OH-π interactions. The smooth base layer was fabricated by modification of phenyltriethoxysilane through a sol-gel method. The π-electrons of the phenyl groups interact with the carboxyl group of the  used as a lubricant, which facilitates immobilization on the base layer. Water droplets slid off the surface in the temperature range from 20 to 80 °C at very low sliding angles (<2°). Furthermore, we increased the π-electron density in the base layer to strengthen the OH-π interactions, which improved long-term boiling stability under hot water.

Salubrinal inhibits eIF2alpha dephosphorylation and has been proposed as a novel therapy for diabetes.The objective of the study was to examine whether salubrinal modulates human islet susceptibility to lipotoxicity.Human islets were treated with oleate or palmitate, alone or in combination with salubrinal, and examined for apoptosis, ultrastructure, and gene expression.Salubrinal enhanced signaling downstream of eIF2alpha and markedly induced the proapoptotic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, but it did not induce the inositol requiring-1alpha or activating transcription factor 6 ER stress pathways. Salubrinal potentiated the deleterious effects of oleate and palmitate in human islets. This proapoptotic effect involved ER dilation and mitochondrial rounding and fragmentation.Excessive eIF2alpha phosphorylation is poorly tolerated by human islets and exacerbates fatty -induced apoptosis through ER and mitochondrial mechanisms.

Actually, traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis predispose to endothelial dysfunction, which is manifested as an increase in the expression of specific cytokines and adhesion molecules. There are firm evidence supporting the beneficial effects of olive oil, the most genuine component of the Mediterranean diet. Although the effects of olive oil and other -rich dietary oils on atherosclerosis and plasma lipids are well known, the roles of minor components have been less investigated. Minor components constitute only 1-2% of virgin olive oil (VOO) and are composed of hydrocarbons, polyphenols, tocopherols, sterols, triterpenoids and other components usually found in traces. Despite their low concentration, non-fatty  constituents may be of importance because studies comparing monounsaturated dietary oils have reported different effects on cardiovascular disease. Most of these compounds have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic properties. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the effects of these compounds contained in VOO on vascular dysfunction and the mechanisms by which they modulate endothelial activity.

In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated  prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and  consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane lipid composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in lipid droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic lipid remodelling,  signatures of energy deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study describes the development of organogels employing an oil phase composed of  (OA) and an aqueous phase consisting of the poloxamer PL, alone or in association with PL, together with 0.25-1% sodium alginate (SA), in order to obtain an intravaginal drug delivery system capable of modulating the release of voriconazole (VRC). VRC was solubilized in  homogenized with the PL-SA aqueous phase, at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. Physicochemical characterization was performed for evaluation of the influence of SA on organogel structural organization, biopharmaceutical properties, pharmacological efficacy, and cytotoxicity, envisaging use of the formulation for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis. The enthalpy variation values showed greater changes in the presence of PL and after the incorporation of SA or VRC in the organogels. Rheological analysis showed T values in the ranges 11-39 °C and 27-30 °C for the OA-PL and OA-PL formulations, respectively. Oscillatory analysis of OA-PL showed that G' was ~20-fold higher than G″, even after submitting the formulation to temperature variation. VRC-OA-PL showed fast drug release from 0.5 to 4 h, maintaining total release (~100%) up to 24 h. The incorporation of SA in the organogels enabled modulation of VRC release, with different release percentages for 0.25% SA (~75%), 0.5% SA (~55%), and 1% SA (~35%). The formulation was non-cytotoxic towards HeLa and Vero cell lines. In diffusion tests, it was able to prevent the growth of Candida albicans and Candida krusei.

With palmitate, TAC hearts contained 48% less TG versus SHAM (P=0.0003), whereas oleate maintained elevated TG in TAC, similar to SHAM. TG turnover in TAC was greatly reduced with palmitate (TAC, 46.7±12.2 nmol/g dry weight per min; SHAM, 84.3±4.9; P=0.0212), as was β-oxidation of TG. Oleate elevated TG turnover in both TAC (140.4±11.2) and SHAM (143.9±15.6), restoring TG oxidation in TAC. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α target gene transcripts were reduced by 70% in TAC with palmitate, whereas oleate induced normal transcript levels. Additionally, mRNA levels for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-coactivator-1α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-coactivator-1β in TAC hearts were maintained by oleate. With these metabolic effects, oleate also supported a 25% improvement in contractility over palmitate with TAC (P=0.0202).The findings link reduced intracellular lipid storage dynamics to impaired peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling and contractility in diseased hearts, consistent with a rate-dependent lipolytic activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α.

The expression of the LD-associated proteins adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), oxidative tissue-enriched PAT protein (OXPAT), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was increased in 'steatotic' cells and further up-regulated by T2. Moreover, T2 stimulated the mitochondrial oxidation by up-regulating carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase (CPT1), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD).T2 leads to mobilization of TAGs from LDs and stimulates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism of fatty acids, in particular of SFAs, and thus enriches of MUFAs the LDs.

In the present study we envisage a novel concept for obesity therapy, devoted to the development of innovative lipid nanostructured formulas with improved gastric tolerability and enhanced specificity in adipose cells targeting. For this purpose, an anti-obesity herbal active from red pepper extract - Capsaicin (Cap) and an endogenous lipid regulator of appetite - oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or a structural analogue of OEA - Phenylalaninol oleamide (PAO), are simultaneously integrated within the same delivery system - nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) prepared with linseed oil that has anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties. The NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap presented mean diameters under 200 nm, size that allow an efficient uptake of actives by enterocytes and lead to an extended biological action of all actives - Cap, OEA/PAO and linolenic . NLC revealed a polidispersity index ranging from 0.16 to 0.22, which represents a narrow dispersion around mean size and suggests an adequate unimodal behavior. The two types of NLC co-loaded with Cap and OEA/PAO were both negatively charged, with zeta potentials of -42.8 mV and -58.5 mV that offered a guarantee for an excellent stability of NLC in time. Despite to the competition between the accommodations of both actives into the lipid core of nanocarriers, the entrapment efficiency exceeds 92% for OEA/PAO and is ranged between 71 and 82% for Cap. In the presence of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap, ABTS inhibition proceeded in a Capsaicin concentration dependent manner and was dependent on the type of NLC formulation. A remarkable radical-scavenging activity against ABTS was determined for Cap and OEA based-NLC. The in vitro release demonstrated that NLC played an important role on the delay of Cap dissolution; the NLC have ensured a slow release of Cap, eg only 21% Cap was released after 24 h of in vitro experiments. The in vivo pharmacological evaluation has revealed that the NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap treatment resulted in a  decrease and improves the lipid and glucose profile, as compared to the obese mice batch. Obesity mice treated with NLC-OEA exhibited a  loss of ~15% and ~10%  loss for NLC-POA, after 10-days treatment. Administration of NLC-OEA/PAO-Cap to the Albino Swiss mice led to significant decrease of glucose level (e.g. 117.4 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap treated mice versus 213.9 mg/dL for obese mice batch) and exhibited a desired decrease effect of triglyceride (e.g. 71.1 mg/dL for NLC-OEA-Cap versus 129.5, for obese batch).

However, very little is known about the effects of the number and the position of double bonds in LCFA with the same length on brown fat-specific gene expression. To determine the specificity of LCFA in the regulation of these genes in different adipocyte models, fully differentiated 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, murine, or porcine primary adipocytes (obtained from the subcutaneous fat pad of C57BL/6 mice or Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc crossbred piglets) were treated with 50 μM of the following 18-carbon fatty acids: stearic  (STA; 18:0),  (OLA; 18:1, Δ9), linoleic  (LNA; 18:2, Δ9,12), α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3, Δ9,12,15), γ-linolenic  (GLA; 18:3, Δ6,9,12), or pinolenic  (PLA; 18:3, Δ5,9,12) for 24 h with or without 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty  effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty  and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation. These results indicate that different adipocyte cell types have different levels of sensitivity to both LCFA and beta agonists in regard to induction of brown fat-specific gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword:['browning', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25608533>Myotubes from lean and severely obese subjects with and without type 2 diabetes respond differently to an in vitro model of exercise.</a></h2><p>Exercise improves  sensitivity and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscles. However, the effect of exercise on substrate oxidation is less clear in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects than in lean subjects. We investigated glucose and lipid metabolism and gene expression after 48 h with low-frequency electrical pulse stimulation (EPS), as an in vitro model of exercise, in cultured myotubes established from lean nondiabetic subjects and severely obese subjects (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) with and without type 2 diabetes. EPS induced an increase in  sensitivity but did not improve lipid oxidation in myotubes from severely obese subjects. Thus, EPS-induced increases in  sensitivity and lipid oxidation were positively and negatively correlated to BMI of the subjects, respectively. EPS enhanced oxidative capacity of glucose in myotubes from all subjects. Furthermore, EPS reduced mRNA expression of slow fiber-type marker (MYH7) in myotubes from diabetic subjects; however, the protein expression of this marker was not significantly affected by EPS in either of the donor groups. On the contrary, mRNA levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were unaffected by EPS in myotubes from diabetic subjects, while IL-6 mRNA expression was increased in myotubes from nondiabetic subjects. EPS-stimulated mRNA expression levels of MYH7, IL-6, and IL-8 correlated negatively with subjects' HbA1c and/or fasting plasma glucose, suggesting an effect linked to the diabetic phenotype. Taken together, these data show that myotubes from different donor groups respond differently to EPS, suggesting that this effect may reflect the in vivo characteristics of the donor groups.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27748752>Identification and characterization of PPARα ligands in the hippocampus.</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) regulates hepatic   catabolism and mediates the metabolic response to starvation. Recently we found that PPARα is constitutively activated in nuclei of hippocampal neurons and controls plasticity via direct transcriptional activation of CREB. Here we report the discovery of three endogenous PPARα ligands-3-hydroxy-(2,2)-dimethyl butyrate, hexadecanamide, and 9-octadecenamide-in mouse brain hippocampus. Mass spectrometric detection of these compounds in mouse hippocampal nuclear extracts, in silico interaction studies, time-resolved FRET analyses, and thermal shift assay results clearly indicated that these three compounds served as ligands of PPARα. Site-directed mutagenesis studies further revealed that PPARα Y464 and Y314 are involved in binding these hippocampal ligands. Moreover, these ligands activated PPARα and upregulated the synaptic function of hippocampal neurons.

Ten mildly hypercholesterolemic men, ages 34-58 years old, were selected from the Texas A&M University faculty and staff. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two diets for a 6-week duration followed by a crossover after a 4-week habitual diet washout period. Diets were consumed daily for a 6-week study period. Participants substituted lean beef obtained from Wagyu bullocks or commercial beef for the meat typically consumed. Total cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and B, triacylglycerols, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were measured in serum samples collected weekly. Beef type had no effect on any measured variable. There were no significant differences between baseline HDL or LDL cholesterol concentrations after the consumption of the beef test diets. Apolipoprotein A-I, serum glucose, and uric  concentrations were elevated by the additional dietary beef. Analysis of records of customary diets indicated that one group consumed 160 g of beef daily, whereas the other group consumed only 26 g of beef daily. Therefore, post hoc analyses tested the habitual beef intake x treatment time interaction. LDL cholesterol concentration was markedly higher in the group with low habitual beef intake (180 vs 144 mg/dl), and HDL cholesterol was slightly higher (44 vs 40 mg/dl; post-test values) than for the group with high habitual beef intake, but there were no habitual intake x time interactions for LDL or HDL cholesterol. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations also were greater in the individuals habitually consuming less beef.

For the first time, the effect of DDAB as a function of the chain length of the double alkyl chain on the structural characteristics of NLCs was investigated. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and static light scattering (SLS) results showed that a small but systematic size increase occurs with increase in the chain length 'x' of the DDAB from 12 to 16, yet DDAB based NLCs exhibited the smallest size irrespective of its higher hydrophobicity. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) analysis revealed the structural make up of NLCs having spherical nanoparticles and triaxial ellipsoidal core-shell micelles in the system. In-vitro cytotoxicity evaluation indicated that toxicity is simply concentration-dependent phenomena and NLCs with less than 5 mg/mL are preferred for better in-vivo tolerance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Five isoenergetic (3,011.5 kcal AME/kg DM) and isonitrogenous (169 g CP/kg DM) diets were formulated using different lipid sources at a constant 30 g/kg inclusion level. The control, polyunsaturated omega-3 (PUFA n-3), polyunsaturated omega-6 (PUFA n-6), monounsaturated omega-9 (MUFA n-9), and saturated fatty  (SFA) diets consisted of linseed- and fish oil (50:50 blend), fish oil, sunflower oil, high  sunflower oil, and tallow, respectively. A total of 200 individually caged Hy-Line Silver-Brown hens (20 wk of age) were randomly allocated to the 5 treatments (n = 40 replicates/treatment) and received the experimental diets for 54 wk. During weeks 58, 62, 66, 70, and 74 of age (end-of-lay period), 20 eggs/treatment per day (n = 140 eggs/treatment per week) were selected for determining eggshell quality traits. At 74 wk of age, 10 birds per treatment (n = 10 birds/treatment) were randomly selected for the determination of bone quality characteristics. Data were statistically analyzed (P < 0.05) using a fully randomized 1-way ANOVA. Dietary treatment had no effect (P > 0.05) on eggshell quality traits. The MUFA n-9 treatment with the highest unsaturated to SFA ratio (UFA: SFA) resulted in a higher (P < 0.05) femur  (10.34 g) as well as femur- (52.99%) and tibia ash (51.07%) content than the SFA treatment.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, OA model, and OA + Alprostadil (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/kg, respectively) groups. The ARDS model was induced by femoral vein injection of OA, and alprostadil was administrated immediately. Lung injury was evaluated by lung wet-dry  ratio (W/D) and histological analyses. Expressions of ACE, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic-related proteins, and proteins in the MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways were determined by Western blot or immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the OA model group had significantly increased W/D, lung injury score, and collagen deposition at 3 h after OA injection. However, alprostadil (10 μg/kg) treatment significantly reduced OA-induced elevation of these indicators. Additionally, OA-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-1β were suppressed by alprostadil. The OA-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) κB p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. Furthermore, we found that Alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs. Alprostadil inhibited Bax but increased Bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. Remarkably increased expression of ACE in the OA model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil. CONCLUSIONS Alprostadil has a protective effect on ARDS induced by OA in rats, possibly through inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways, and decreasing ACE protein expression. Therefore, the use of alprostadil in clinical ARDS treatment is promising.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26255030>Protective Effect of Unsaturated Fatty Acids on Palmitic -Induced Toxicity in Skeletal Muscle Cells is not Mediated by PPARδ Activation.</a></h2><p>Unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) are able to prevent deleterious effects of saturated FFA in skeletal muscle cells although the mechanisms involved are still not completely understood. FFA act as endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), transcription factors regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether activation of PPARδ, the most common PPAR subtype in skeletal muscle, plays a role in mediating the protective effect of unsaturated FFA on saturated FFA-induced damage in skeletal muscle cells and to examine an impact on mitochondrial respiration. Mouse C2C12 myotubes were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of saturated FFA (palmitic ), unsaturated FFA (, linoleic and α-linolenic ), and their combinations. PPARδ agonist GW501516 and antagonist GSK0660 were also used. Both mono- and polyunsaturated FFA, but not GW501516, prevented palmitic -induced cell death. Mono- and polyunsaturated FFA proved to be effective activators of PPARδ compared to saturated palmitic ; however, in combination with palmitic  their effect on PPARδ activation was blocked and stayed at the levels observed for palmitic  alone. Unsaturated FFA at moderate physiological concentrations as well as GW501516, but not palmitic , mildly uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Our results indicate that although unsaturated FFA are effective activators of PPARδ, their protective effect on palmitic -induced toxicity is not mediated by PPARδ activation and subsequent induction of lipid regulatory genes in skeletal muscle cells. Other mechanisms, such as mitochondrial uncoupling, may underlie their effect.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28790345>Oleate but not stearate induces the regulatory phenotype of myeloid suppressor cells.</a></h2><p>Tumor infiltrating myeloid cells play contradictory roles in the tumor development. Dendritic cells and classical activated macrophages support anti-tumor immune activity via antigen presentation and induction of pro-inflammatory immune responses. Myeloid suppressor cells (MSCs), for instance myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) or tumor associated macrophages play a critical role in tumor growth. Here, treatment with sodium oleate, an unsaturated fatty , induced a regulatory phenotype in the myeloid suppressor cell line MSC-2 and resulted in an increased suppression of activated T cells, paralleled by increased intracellular lipid droplets formation. Furthermore, sodium oleate potentiated nitric oxide (NO) production in MSC-2, thereby increasing their suppressive capacity. In primary polarized bone marrow cells, sodium oleate (C18:1) and linoleate (C18:2), but not stearate (C18:0) were identified as potent FFA to induce a regulatory phenotype. This effect was abrogated in MSC-2 as well as primary cells by specific inhibition of droplets formation while the inhibition of de novo FFA synthesis proved ineffective, suggesting a critical role for exogenous FFA in the functional induction of MSCs. Taken together our data introduce a new unsaturated fatty -dependent pathway shaping the functional phenotype of MSCs, facilitating the tumor escape from the immune system.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929597>Efficient bioconversion of enzymatic corncob hydrolysate into biomass and lipids by oleaginous yeast  KM281510.</a></h2><p>This study aims to valorize of enzymatic corncob hydrolysate (ECH) for biomass and lipid productions via microbial bioconversion by the efficient oleaginous yeast  KM281510.

However, other effects of sulfide are less explored, given that sulfide is a potential sulfur source for microorganisms and its high reactivity triggers a suit of abiotic reactions. We demonstrated that sulfide interaction with Fe regulates the dynamics and activities of microbial community during anaerobic digestion. This was manifested by the S:Fe molar ratio, whose increase adversely influenced the acetoclastic methanogens, Methanosaeta, and turnover of acetate. Dynamics of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Methanoculleus and Methanobrevibacter, were presumably influenced by sulfide-induced changes in the partial pressure of hydrogen. Interestingly, conversion of the long-chain   (LCFA), oleate, to methane was enhanced together with the abundance of LCFA-degrading, β-oxidizing Syntrophomonas at an elevated S:Fe molar ratio.

We show here that Minerval also acts, selectively in cancer cell lines, as an ATP depleting uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). As a function of its exposure time, Minerval compromised the capacity of glioblastoma U87-MG cells to compensate for aberrant respiration by up-modulation of glycolysis. This effect was not exposure time-dependent in the lung carcinoma A549 cell line, which was more sensitive to Minerval. Compared with OxPhos inhibitors FCCP (uncoupler), rotenone (electron transfer inhibitor), and oligomycin (F1F0-ATPase inhibitor), Minerval action was similar only to that of FCCP. This similarity was manifested by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, facilitation of  consumption rate (OCR), restriction of mitochondrial and cellular reactive  species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, compared with other OxPhos inhibitors, Minerval uniquely induced ER stress in cancer cell lines. These new modes of action for Minerval, capitalizing on the high fatty  requirements of cancer cells, can potentially enhance its cancer-selective toxicity and improve its therapeutic capacity.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'fat metabolism', 'glycolysis', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800700>Antibacterial activity of the bioactive compounds identified in three woody plants against some pathogenic bacteria.</a></h2><p>Three bacterial isolates were identified from infected potato tubers showing soft and blackleg like symptoms as well as one isolate from infected pear tree showing crown gall symptom.

Here, we describe the role of an Axin family member, PRY-1, in . Axins are scaffolding proteins that play crucial roles in signal transduction pathways by physically interacting with multiple factors and coordinating the assembly of protein complexes. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of a pry-1 mutant revealed differentially regulated genes that are associated with  such as vitellogenins (yolk lipoproteins), fatty  desaturases, lipases, and fatty  transporters. Consistent with these categorizations, we found that pry-1 is crucial for the maintenance of  levels. Knockdowns of vit genes in a pry-1 mutant background restored  levels, suggesting that vitellogenins contribute to PRY-1 function in  metabolic processes. Additionally, lowered expression of desaturases and lipidomic analysis provided evidence that fatty  synthesis is reduced in pry-1 mutants. Accordingly, an exogenous supply of  restored depleted lipids in somatic tissues of worms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PRY-1/Axin signaling is essential for  and involves the regulation of yolk proteins.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30943799>Omega-3 fatty  decreases  by decreasing SCD-1 expression in the liver and kidney of a cyclosporine-induced nephropathy rat model.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1 and elongase-6 (Elovl-6) are associated with fatty  (FA) synthesis.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after palmitic / treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic . DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'gluconeogenesis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520777>Autophagy differentially regulates macrophage lipid handling depending on the lipid substrate ( vs. acetylated-LDL) and inflammatory activation state.</a></h2><p>The regulation of lipid droplet (LD) dynamics by autophagy in naïve macrophages is complex: Inhibiting autophagosome initiation steps attenuates  (OA) induced LD (OA-LD) biogenesis, whereas interfering with later-autophagosome maturation/lysosomal steps accelerates OA-LD biogenesis rate, but not OA-LD degradation. Here we hypothesized that regulation of macrophage lipid handling by autophagy may be lipid-substrate and activation-state-specific. Using automated quantitative live-cell imaging, initial LD biogenesis rate was ~30% slower when the lipid source was acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) compared to OA. Yet, both were similarly affected by triacsin-C, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, which inhibited, and etomoxir, an inhibitor of acylcarnitine palmitoyl transferase (fatty  oxidation), which augmented, LD biogenesis rates. An autophagy inducing peptide, Tat-Beclin1, enhanced the degradation, and inhibited (by 37%) the biogenesis of acLDL induced LD (acLDL-LD). Yet, Tat-Beclin1 increased OA-LD biogenesis rate by 70%. When macrophages were pre-activated with LPS + INFG they exhibited increased autophagosome number and area, and reduced BECN1 and ATG14 protein levels, which associated with a markedly attenuated autophagic flux. Concomitantly, OA-LD and acLDL-LD biogenesis rates increased 3 and 7.4-fold, respectively, but could not be further modulated by Tat-Beclin1, as observed in non-activated/naïve macrophages. We propose that macrophage autophagy, and/or components of its machinery, differentially regulate LD/foam-cell biogenesis depending on the lipid-source, and that inflammatory activation uncouples autophagy from LD biogenesis.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

NLCs were prepared via emulsification-solvent evaporation technique followed by ultrasonication, and the effect of composition of the nanocarriers on the particle size, size distribution, surface charge, entrapment efficiency, drug release kinetics and physical stability was extensively studied. NLCs exhibited nanosized (<200nm) spherical morphologies with narrow size distribution and high drug entrapment efficiency (>75%), sustained drug release pattern, and negative surface charge (zeta potential of -35-40mV) that imparts sufficient electrostatic physical stability. When tested in vivo, SIM-NLCs of the optimal composition demonstrated improved and prolonged reduction in the total cholesterol and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as compared to the drug suspension. After oral administration of a single dose of SIM-NLC, 4-fold increase in bioavailability was observed, as compared to the SIM suspension. Hence, NLCs might provide efficient nanodevices for the management of  and promising drug delivery systems to enhance SIM oral bioavailability.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Both smooth or rough LPS increased plasma cAMP immediately to its maximum at 1 h of infusion, whereas plasma cGMP levels rose slowly and peaked 12 h later. The increases in cAMP levels were more prolonged for smooth LPS than rough LPS. The maximum plasma cAMP rise coincided with increases of several plasma FFA. Rough LPS increased plasma  greater than palmitic greater than stearic greater than linoleic acids in the second hour and reached their steady state levels between 2 h of infusion and 5 h post-infusion. Thereafter,  remained maximally elevated, while stearic  decreased and other FFA returned to baseline. Smooth LPS had no effects on palmitic and stearic acids, but elevated  in an essentially similar manner to rough LPS and increased linoleic  initially at 5 h, followed by decreases throughout post-infusion. These results demonstrate that  produces early marked elevations in plasma cAMP, a gradual rise in plasma cGMP and disproportionate increases in several plasma FFA. The data also demonstrate that smooth and rough LPS differ in their abilities to increase plasma cAMP and FFA and these may be attributed to differences in their in vivo mechanisms of action.

Arachidonic  (ARA; 5,8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic ) is a conditionally essential polyunsaturated fatty  [20:4(n-6)] and is a major constituent of brain lipids. The current study examined the transport processes for ARA in confluent monolayers of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Addition of radioactive ARA to the apical compartment of HBMEC cultured on Transwell(®) inserts resulted in rapid incorporation of radioactivity into the basolateral medium. Knock down of fatty  transport proteins did not alter ARA passage into the basolateral medium as a result of the rapid generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ), an eicosanoid known to facilitate opening of the blood-brain . Permeability following ARA or PGE2 exposure was confirmed by an increased movement of fluorescein-labeled dextran from apical to basolateral medium. ARA-mediated permeability was attenuated by specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. EP3 and EP4 receptor antagonists attenuated the ARA-mediated permeability of HBMEC. The results indicate that ARA increases permeability of HBMEC monolayers likely via increased production of PGE2 which acts upon EP3 and EP4 receptors to mediate permeability. These observations may explain the rapid influx of ARA into the brain previously observed upon plasma infusion with ARA. The blood-brain , formed by microvessel endothelial cells, is a restrictive  between the brain parenchyma and the circulating blood. Radiolabeled arachidonic  (ARA) movement across, and monolayer permeability in the presence of ARA, was examined in confluent monolayers of primary human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) cultured on Transwell(®) plates. Incubation of HBMECs with ARA resulted in a rapid increase in HBMEC monolayer permeability. The mechanism was mediated, in part, through increased prostaglandin E2 production from ARA which acted upon EP3 and EP4 receptors to increase HBMEC monolayer permeability.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30555953>The delivery of mRNA to colon inflammatory lesions by lipid-nano-particles containing environmentally-sensitive lipid-like materials with  scaffolds.</a></h2><p>An mRNA gene therapy represents a potentially promising therapeutic for curing inflammatory diseases. The transient nature of the gene expression of mRNA would be expected to be beneficial for avoiding undesired side effects. Since the mRNA is a vulnerable molecule, a development of a carrier that can deliver the mRNA to the cytoplasm has a high priority. We report herein on the development of a system for delivering mRNA to the inflammatory lesion in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model.

Among the  acids investigated,  scaffolds (ssPalmO) appeared to be more biocompatible than either myristic  or linoleic  scaffolds with the colitis model. The structural modification of the hydrophilic head groups from linear tertiary amines to piperazine rings (ssPalmO-Paz4-C2) resulted in a more than 10-fold higher increasing in the transgene activity in inflammatory colon.

Fc-gamma receptor-IIb (FcγRIIb) and its ligand are reported to be associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As knowledge about FcγRIIb in the literature is mostly generated from studies on skeletal muscle tissue, the expression and function of FcγRIIb in the liver and hepatocytes are largely unknown. In this study, we identified the expression of FcγRIIb in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes: FcγRIIb was upregulated in response to  (OA) in a dose dependent manner. FcγRIIb knockdown using shRNA suppressed the lipid and triglyceride accumulation, and mRNA expression of , , , , and  in OA-treated HepG2 cells. FcγRIIb deficiency mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower liver  and liver to  ratio, as well as less triglyceride accumulation in the livers.

Measurements were made of the whole tissue concentrations of adenine nucleotides, hexose phosphates, triose phosphates, glycerol 1-phosphate, 3 phosphoglycerate, 6-phosphogluconate, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, -soluble CoA, citrate, isocitrate, malate and 2-oxoglutarate, and of the release into the incubation medium of lactate, pyruvate and glycerol after 1h of incubation. 3.

Measurements were also made of the whole-tissue concentrations of metabolites in tissues taken directly from Nembutal-anaesthetized rats. 5. Whole tissue mass-action ratios for phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase and the combined (aldolasextriose phosphate isomerase) reaction were similar in vivo and in vitro. The reactants of phosphofructokinase appeared to be far from mass-action equilibrium. In vitro, the reactants of hexokinase also appeared to be far from mass-action equilibrium. 6. Correlation of observed changes in glycolytic flux with changes in fructose 6-phosphate concentration suggested that phosphofructokinase may show regulatory behaviour. The enzyme appeared to be activated in the presence of oleate or adrenaline and to be inhibited in the presence of lactate or pyruvate. 7. Evidence is presented that the reactants of lactate dehydrogenase and glycerol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase may be near to mass-action equilibrium in the cytoplasm. 8. No satisfactory correlations could be drawn between the whole-tissue concentrations of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, citrate and glycerol 1-phosphate and the observed rates of triglyceride and fatty  synthesis. Under the conditions employed, the concentration of glycerol 1-phosphate appeared to depend mainly on the cytoplasmic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios. 9. Calculated hexose monophosphate pathway flux rates roughly correlated with fatty  synthesis rates and with whole tissue [6-phosphogluconate]/[glucose 6-phosphate] ratios. The relative rates of production of NADPH for fatty  synthesis by the hexose monophosphate pathway and by the ;malic enzyme' are discussed. It is suggested that all NADH produced in the cytoplasm may be used in that compartment for reductive synthesis of fatty acids, lactate or glycerol 1-phosphate.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28851448>Dietary arachidonic  increases deleterious effects of amyloid-β oligomers on learning abilities and expression of AMPA receptors: putative role of the ACSL4-cPLA balance.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated  acids play a crucial role in neuronal function, and the modification of these compounds in the brain could have an impact on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Despite the fact that arachidonic  is the second foremost polyunsaturated   besides docosahexaenoic , its role and the regulation of its transfer and mobilization in the brain are poorly known.Two groups of 39 adult male BALB/c mice were fed with an arachidonic -enriched diet or an -enriched diet, respectively, for 12 weeks. After 10 weeks on the diet, mice received intracerebroventricular injections of either NaCl solution or amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) oligomers. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests were used to evaluate short- and long-term memory. At 12 weeks on the diet, mice were killed, and blood, , and brain samples were collected for lipid and protein analyses.We found that the administration of an arachidonic -enriched diet for 12 weeks induced short-term memory impairment and increased deleterious effects of Aβ oligomers on learning abilities. These cognitive alterations were associated with modifications of expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  receptors, postsynaptic density protein 95, and glial fibrillary acidic protein in mouse cortex or hippocampus by the arachidonic -enriched diet and Aβ oligomer administration. This diet also led to an imbalance between the main ω-6  acids and the ω-3  acids in favor of the first one in erythrocytes and the  as well as in the hippocampal and cortical brain structures. In the cortex, the dietary arachidonic  also induced an increase of arachidonic -containing phospholipid species in phosphatidylserine class, whereas intracerebroventricular injections modified several arachidonic - and docosahexaenoic -containing species in the four phospholipid classes. Finally, we observed that dietary arachidonic  decreased the expression of the neuronal form of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 in the hippocampus and increased the cytosolic phospholipase A activation level in the cortices of the mice.Dietary arachidonic  could amplify Aβ oligomer neurotoxicity. Its consumption could constitute a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in humans and should be taken into account in future preventive strategies. Its deleterious effect on cognitive capacity could be linked to the balance between arachidonic -mobilizing enzymes.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182643>Dynamic label-free imaging of lipid droplets and their link to fatty  and pyruvate oxidation in mouse eggs.</a></h2><p>Mammalian eggs generate most of their ATP by mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate from the surrounding medium or from fatty acids that are stored as triacylglycerols within lipid droplets.

We have combined coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) imaging with deuterium labelling of  to monitor turnover of fatty acids within lipid droplets of living mouse eggs. We found that loss of labelled  is promoted by pyruvate removal but minimised when β-oxidation is inhibited. Pyruvate removal also causes a significant dispersion of lipid droplets, while inhibition of β-oxidation causes droplet clustering. Live imaging of luciferase or FAD autofluorescence from , suggest that inhibition of β-oxidation in mouse eggs only leads to a transient decrease in ATP because there is compensatory uptake of pyruvate into . Inhibition of pyruvate uptake followed by β-oxidation caused a similar and successive decline in ATP. Our data suggest that β-oxidation and pyruvate oxidation contribute almost equally to resting ATP production in resting mouse eggs and that reorganisation of lipid droplets occurs in response to metabolic demand.© 2019.

Hepatocytes isolated from fed rats released lactate and pyruvate. The addition of lactate shifted the lactate balance from net release to net utilization, with a threshold at approximately 2 mM. Lactate favored its own utilization by 1) increasing the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (L/P) and 2) inhibiting hepatic . The addition of oleate to the cells elicited 1) a net reduction of the release of lactate and pyruvate in basal conditions, 2) a marked decrease in the threshold of lactate utilization, down to values close to 0.5 mM, and 3) an important stimulation of the utilization of lactate, at physiological concentrations of 2-3 mM. These changes in lactate utilization induced by oleate were accompanied by a parallel increase of the L/P. Oleate acted by decreasing the cellular concentrations of pyruvate. Such an effect was mediated by 1) an inhibition of  and 2) a rise in pyruvate utilization toward glucose. Moreover, it seems that the capacity of various fatty acids to stimulate lactate utilization depends on their rate of oxidation by the liver. In liver cells isolated from 24-h starved rats, in keeping with the activation of gluconeogenesis, lactate was utilized by hepatocytes even at low concentrations. Because of the low  and of the high utilization of pyruvate in these cells, the presence of oleate only induced a moderate increase of lactate utilization (+32%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657403>The Equilibration of PCO2 in Pigs Is Independent of Lung Injury and Hemodynamics.</a></h2><p>In mechanical ventilation, normoventilation in terms of PCO2 can be achieved by titration of the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume.

Furthermore, exponential extrapolation allowed prediction of the new PetCO2 equilibrium and teq after 5.7 ± 5.6 min.The transition between PetCO2 equilibria after changes in respiratory rate might not be dependent on moderate lung injury or cardiac output but on the metabolic production or capacity of cO2 stores.

These experimental diets were designed to reduce blood cholesterol and failed to improve prognosis. By contrast, recent trials were not primarily designed to reduce cholesterol, were conducted in medium- and high-risk patients and used low fat diets supplemented by omega-3 fatty acids from various sources. In two of these trials, the consumption of natural antioxidants, oligoelements and vegetable proteins was increased. Recurrence rate was reduced in the range of 30 to 70%. One conclusion from these well-conducted recent experiments on more than 3000 patients is that new and more specific dietary recommendations are clearly warranted in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. They should be more specific and more clearly defined and therefore different from those generally provided in the U.S.A. and Europe at present. In a recent Consensus Panel statement, authors wrote less than one line to describe a cardioprotective diet in patients with coronary heart disease, summarized as < or = 30% fat, < 7% saturated fat, < 200 mg.day-1 cholesterol. This is both too much (too restrictive to hope that white European and American patients will adhere in the long-term) and insufficient because dietary counselling cannot be restricted to three factors. Ulbricht and Southgate recently emphasized that the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease is more complex than the current cholesterol hypothesis. They identified at least seven major dietary factors, including fibres, although the evidence of an effect on coronary heart disease is weak. However, they did not mention vegetable and fish proteins which are rich in arginine and L-glutamine, major regulators of cardiovascular function. Thus, new dietary advice should include: reduce intake of total (not more than 30% of energy) and saturated (less than 10%) fats maintain intake at least minimally, of the essential omega-6 fatty acids augment consumption of  and moderately increase consumption of omega-3 fatty acids augment intake of natural antioxidants and oligo-elements maintain sufficient intake of vegetable proteins As conceptualized in the 'Mediterranean' and 'Asian-vegetarian' types of diet, it is very important that a healthy diet should be thought of as a whole rather than as a recitation of good and bad components. Although these protective dietary modifications should probably all be used in each patient to obtain maximal efficacy, these scientifically quantitated principles should be adapted to the culture, ethnic origin and 'image of the world' of each patient in order to create an environment favourable to the perception of positive associations between various foods and healthy habits.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9065785>Unsaturated fatty acids enhance cell yields and perturb the energy metabolism of an antibody-secreting hybridoma.</a></h2><p>Growth of the murine B-lymphocyte cell line CC9C10 and the myeloma SP2/0 was enhanced significantly by the presence of the unsaturated fatty acids,  and linoleic acids in serum-free culture.

The endocannabinoid-like compounds oleoylethanolamine (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) play an important role in digestive regulation, and we hypothesized they would also modulate intestinal permeability. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured in human Caco-2 cells to assess permeability after application of OEA and PEA and relevant antagonists. Cells treated with OEA and PEA were stained for cytoskeletal F-actin changes and lysed for immunoassay. OEA and PEA were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. OEA (applied apically, logEC -5.4) and PEA (basolaterally, logEC -4.9; apically logEC -5.3) increased Caco-2 resistance by 20-30% via transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α.

A detailed description of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NO-FAs is complicated by the capability of electrophilic fatty acids to alkylate thiols reversibly and become esterified in various complex lipids, and the instability of the nitroalkene moiety during enzymatic and base hydrolysis. Herein, we report the mechanism and kinetics of absorption, , and distribution of the endogenously detectable and prototypical NO-FA, 10-nitro- (10-NO-OA), in dogs after oral administration. Supported by HPLC-high-resolution-MS/MS analysis of synthetic and plasma-derived 10-NO-OA-containing triacylglycerides (TAGs), we show that a key mechanism of NO-FA distribution is an initial esterification into complex lipids. Quantitative analysis of plasma free and esterified  fractions confirmed time-dependent preferential incorporation of 10-NO-OA into TAGs when compared with its principal metabolite, 10-nitro-stearic . Finally, new isomers of 10-NO-OA were identified in vivo, and their electrophilic reactivity and  characterized. Overall, we reveal that NO-FAs display unique PK, with the principal mechanism of tissue distribution involving complex  esterification, which serves to shield the electrophilic character of this mediator from plasma and hepatic inactivation and thus permits efficient distribution to target organs.Copyright © 2019 Fazzari et al.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354017>Results of fibre and toner flotation depending on  dosage.</a></h2><p>The literature was reviewed with respect to deinking flotation methods with toner samples, specifically emphasizing the speciation of copy machine and laser printing, which produce an increasing quantity of paper that is difficult to recycle.

Lipogenesis was not as sensitive to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) inhibition in hepatocytes from obese rats but glycogenolysis was stimulated to the same extent by this nucleotide in both preparations. Ketogenesis was less sensitive to stimulation by DBcAMP in hepatocytes from obese rats. A difference in sensitivity of lipogenesis to DBcAMP was not found when lactate plus pyruvate was added to the incubation medium, suggesting that a greater rate of  by hepatocytes from obese rats accounts for their relative insensitivity to DBcAMP. Citrate levels were elevated by DBcAMP to a greater extent in hepatocytes from obese rats. Hepatocytes prepared from lean rats starved for 48 hr were glycogen depleted and lacked significant capacity for lipogenesis and glycogen synthesis. In contrast, hepatocytes isolated from starved obese rats retained considerable amounts of liver glycogen and exhibited detectable rates of lipogenesis and glycogen synthesis. Hepatocytes prepared from starved lean rats gave faster apparent rates of lactate gluconeogenesis than hepatocytes prepared from starved obese rats.

After solvent fractionation, the liquid phase of acyl migrated PMF (APMF-L) was obtained and blended with hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO, 50:50, w/w) to produce a fat blend (namely, an alternative fat blend) which had reduced saturated fatty  content while having similar melting behavior to HCO. In an alternative fat blend, the major fatty acids were lauric (27.94), palmitic (26.93) and  (15.75 mol%) . The solid fat index was quite similar to that of HCO, especially at 28-44 °C. Nevertheless, an alternative fat blend had lower saturated fatty  content, by 18%, compared to HCO. The content of highly atherogenic myristic  was reduced by approximately 40%.

However, mammalian skeletal muscles are composed of mixed types of muscle fibers. In the current study, we analyzed and compared the distributions of titin, , phosphate ions, and fatty  levels in red and white muscles using a fish model (), which is rich in red and white muscles, and these are well separated. Oil-red O staining showed that red muscle had more-abundant lipids than did white muscle. A time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometric (TOF-SIMS) analysis revealed that red muscle possessed high levels of palmitic  and , but white muscle contained more phosphate ions. Moreover, elastica-van Gieson (EVG) and Mito-Tracker green FM staining showed that collagen and elastic fibers were highly, respectively, distributed in connective tissues and mitochondria in red muscle. An electron micrographic analysis indicated that red muscle had a relatively higher number of mitochondria and longer sarcomere lengths and Z-line widths, while myofibril diameters were thicker in white muscle. Myofibrillar proteins separated by SDS-PAGE showed that the major giant protein, titin, was highly expressed in white muscle than in red muscle. Furthermore, ratios of titin to myosin heavy chain (MHC) (titin/MHC) were about 1.3 times higher in white muscle than red muscle. We postulated that white muscle is fit for short and strong contractile performance due to high levels of titin and condensed sarcomeres, whereas red muscle is fit for low intensity and long-lasting activity due to high levels of lipids and mitochondria and long sarcomeres.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30184537>C.

Fatty  2-hydroxylation is catalyzed by Fatty  2-hydroxylase (FA2H) enzyme. However, the precise roles of FA2H and fatty  2-hydroxylation in whole cell homeostasis still remain unclear.Here we utilize Caenorhabditis elegans as the model and systemically investigate the physiological functions of FATH-1/C25A1.5, the highly conserved worm homolog for mammalian FA2H enzyme. Immunostaining, dye-staining and translational fusion reporters were used to visualize FATH-1 protein and a variety of subcellular structures. The "click chemistry" method was employed to label 2-OH fatty  in vivo. Global and tissue-specific RNAi knockdown experiments were performed to inactivate FATH-1 function. Lipid analysis of the fath-1 deficient mutants was achieved by mass spectrometry.C. elegans FATH-1 is expressed at most developmental stages and in most tissues. Loss of fath-1 expression results in severe growth retardation and shortened lifespan. FATH-1 function is crucially required in the intestine but not the epidermis with stereospecificity. The "click chemistry" labeling technique showed that the FATH-1 metabolites are mainly enriched in membrane structures preferable to the apical side of the intestinal cells. At the subcellular level, we found that loss of fath-1 expression inhibits lipid droplets formation, as well as selectively disrupts peroxisomes and apical endosomes. Lipid analysis of the fath-1 deficient animals revealed a significant reduction in the content of heptadecenoic , while other major FAs remain unaffected. Feeding of exogenous heptadecenoic  (C17: 1), but not  (C18: 1), rescues the global and subcellular defects of fath-1 knockdown worms.Our study revealed that FATH-1 and its catalytic products are highly specific in the context of chirality, C-chain length, spatial distribution, as well as the types of cellular organelles they affect. Such an unexpected degree of specificity for the synthesis and functions of hydroxylated FAs helps to regulate protein transport and fat metabolism, therefore maintaining the cellular homeostasis of the intestinal cells. These findings may help our understanding of FA2H functions across species, and offer potential therapeutical targets for treating FA2H-related diseases.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Proper adherence to a healthy diet may have a favorable impact on  management and its diabetic complications. Our aim was to assess differences in food and nutrient intake of type 1 diabetic patients with and without diabetic retinopathy (DR). This was a two-center, cross-sectional study in patients with T1DM, with and without DR. Subjects were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the two participating centers. A validated food frequency questionnaire was administered. A total of 103 T1DM patients with DR and 140 T1DM patient without DR were recruited. Subjects with DR showed a lower intake of total fat ( = 0.036) than that of their non-DR counterparts. DR was associated with increasing age ( = 0.004), hypertension ( < 0.001), and  duration ( < 0.001), however there was a negative association with high educational level ( = 0.018). The multivariate-adjusted analysis showed that the intake of complex carbohydrates was positively related to the presence of DR ( = 0.031).

The effects of stable overexpression of γ-synuclein (γ-syn), a neuronal protein recently recognized as a novel regulator of lipid handling in adipocytes, and transient overexpression of Parkinson's disease (PD) α-synuclein [α-syn; wild-type (wt) and its pathogenic mutants A53T, A30P and E46K] in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, were also evaluated. The effects of co-treatment of PA with paraquat (PQ), a Parkinsonian pesticide, and leptin, a hormone involved in the brain-adipose axis, were also assessed. Cell death mode and cell cycle were analyzed by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Reactive  species (ROS) level was determined using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescien diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay and lipid peroxidation level was determined using thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) assay.MTT assay revealed dose- and time-dependent PA cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, but not OA and LA. The cytotoxicity was significantly lower in SH-SY5Y-γ-syn cells, while transient overexpression of wt α-syn or its PD mutants (A30P and E46K, but not A53T) modestly (but still significantly) rescued the cytotoxicity of PA in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells. Co-treatment of increasing concentrations of PQ exacerbated PA's neurotoxicity. Pre-treatment of leptin, an anti-apoptotic adipokine, did not successfully rescue SH-SY5Y cells from PA-induced cytotoxicity-suggesting a mechanism of PA-induced leptin resistance. Annexin V/PI flow cytometry analysis revealed PA-induced increase in percentages of cells in annexin V-positive/PI-negative quadrant (early apoptosis) and subG-G fraction, accompanied by a decrease in G-M phase cells. The PA-induced ROS production and lipid peroxidation was at greater extent in T98G as compared to that in SH-SY5Y.In conclusion, PA induces apoptosis by increasing oxidative stress in neurons and astrocytes.

The concentrations of IL-8 were measured in the media and cellular oxidative stress was quantitated by measurement of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARSs).Spontaneous production of IL-8 was significantly higher in HISM cells isolated from Crohn's  compared to control . LA caused a marked, nine-fold, increase in IL-8 secretion by Crohn's cells, an effect that could be simulated in normal HISM cells by co-incubation of LA with an oxidizing solution (Ox) composed of hypoxanthine+xanthine oxidase+FeSO(4) (OxLA). These effects were inhibited by vitamins C and E. Treatment of Crohn's cells with OxLA did not further increase IL-8 over that of LA alone. The effect of LA alone was not associated with an increase in cellular oxidative stress as quantitated by TBARSs. In contrast to the results with LA, treatment with OA or OxOA did not increase IL-8 in either normal or Crohn's cells. In addition, OA protected Crohn's cells from the increase in TBARSs induced by Ox. In contrast to IL-8, spontaneous production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) was significantly lower in Crohn's HISM cells as compared to normal cells and exposure to OxLA did not increase its production.LA, but not OA, increased the production of IL-8 by HISM cells.

A 21-day T. suis infection in four pigs induced a significant change in the composition of the proximal colon  compared to that of three parasite-naive pigs. Among the 15 phyla identified, the abundances of Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres were changed in infected pigs. The abundances of approximately 13% of genera were significantly altered by infection. Changes in relative abundances of Succinivibrio and Mucispirillum, for example, may relate to alterations in carbohydrate metabolism and niche disruptions in mucosal interfaces induced by parasitic infection, respectively. Of note, infection by T. suis led to a significant shift in the metabolic potential of the proximal colon , where 26% of all metabolic pathways identified were affected. Besides carbohydrate metabolism, lysine biosynthesis was repressed as well.

Cotyledons from developing seeds were isolated and cultured in vitro for 96 h on Heller medium with 60 mM sucrose (+S) or without sucrose (-S). Each medium was additionally enriched with 35 mM asparagine or 35 mM NaNO3. Asparagine caused an increase in protein accumulation and simultaneously decreased the lipid content, but nitrate increased accumulation of both protein and lipid. Experiments with [1-14C]acetate and [2-14C]acetate showed that the decrease in lipid accumulation in developing lupine seeds resulted from exhaustion of lipid precursors rather than from degradation or modification of the enzymatic apparatus. The carbon atom from the C-1 position of acetate was liberated mainly as CO2, whereas the carbon atom from the C-2 position was preferentially used in anabolic pathways.

Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, but twin and familial studies indicate significant heritability, which is not fully explained by currently known genetic susceptibility loci. Notably, mutations in genes encoding nuclear lamina proteins, including lamins, cause lipodystrophy syndromes that include NAFLD. We hypothesized that variants in lamina-associated proteins predispose to NAFLD and used a candidate gene-sequencing approach to test for variants in 10 nuclear lamina-related genes in a cohort of 37 twin and sibling pairs: 21 individuals with and 53 without NAFLD. Twelve heterozygous sequence variants were identified in four lamina-related genes (ZMPSTE24, TMPO, SREBF1, SREBF2). The majority of NAFLD patients (>90%) had at least one variant compared to <40% of controls (P < 0.0001). When only insertions/deletions and changes in conserved residues were considered, the difference between the groups was similarly striking (>80% versus <25%; P < 0.0001). Presence of a lamina variant segregated with NAFLD independently of the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism. Several variants were found in TMPO, which encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide-2 (LAP2) that has not been associated with  disease. One of these, a frameshift insertion that generates truncated LAP2, abrogated lamin-LAP2 binding, caused LAP2 mislocalization, altered endogenous lamin distribution, increased lipid droplet accumulation after  treatment in transfected cells, and led to cytoplasmic association with the ubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1.Several variants in nuclear lamina-related genes were identified in a cohort of twins and siblings with NAFLD; one such variant, which results in a truncated LAP2 protein and a dramatic phenotype in cell culture, represents an association of TMPO/LAP2 variants with NAFLD and underscores the potential importance of the nuclear lamina in NAFLD.

However, the intestine is also an important cholesterogenic organ and the possibility that this class of drugs may alter lipoprotein secretion by the intestine has not been fully studied. The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible role of cholesterol in regulating apoB secretion by the intestine by testing if the suppression of cholesterol synthesis by the reductase inhibitor lovastatin affected the secretion of apoB by CaCo-2 human intestinal cells. Differentiated post-confluent CaCo-2 cells were incubated for 24-72 h in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 5 microM lovastatin, and the secretion rate of lipids, as well as apoB and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) into the medium, was measured. Lovastatin markedly inhibited the incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into cholesterol for at least 48 h, lowered the content of esterified cholesterol in cells, and reduced their rate of cholesterol secretion. However, under basal conditions lovastatin had no effect on the secretion rate of apoB. After stimulation of apoB secretion by addition of 0.8 mM  to the medium, lovastatin did not alter apoB secretion in the first 2 days of incubation, but reduced the content of apoB in media from the 3rd day by 30%. This could not be explained by an increase in the rate of LDL degradation. Furthermore, supplementation with mevalonic  only reversed about one-half of the effect of lovastatin, suggesting that this effect was at least parly nonspecific or unrelated to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. There was also no specific effect of lovastatin on apoAI secretion. When cells were cultured with [1-14C]acetate for 24 or 72 h, the specific activity of cholesterol in medium at the end of the incubation was the same as in cells, suggesting that cholesterol used for lipoprotein secretion was in equilibrium with bulk cellular cholesterol and was not from a segregated compartment derived from newly synthesized cholesterol. This may explain why apoB secretion by CaCo-2 cells was unaffected by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168311>A high-fat diet induces rapid changes in the mouse hypothalamic proteome.</a></h2><p>Prolonged over-consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) commonly leads to  and insulin resistance.

The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with palmitic  (PA) and  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation. Changes in N42 cells show an effect of PA but not OA on DRP-2 and on mitochondrial morphology indicating that long-chain saturated fatty acids damage neuronal function.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolism', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063536>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep.

Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty  synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty  2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

We tested whether Ang II alters the "metabolomic" profile. We harvested hearts from 8-week-old double transgenic rats harboring human renin and angiotensinogen genes (dTGRs) and controls (Sprague-Dawley), all with or without Ang II type 1 receptor (valsartan) blockade. We used gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry to detect 247 intermediary metabolites. We used a partial least-squares discriminate analysis and identified 112 metabolites that differed significantly after corrections (false discovery rate q <0.05). We found great differences in the use of fatty acids as an energy source, namely, decreased levels of octanoic, , and linoleic acids in dTGR (all P<0.01). The increase in cardiac hypoxanthine levels in dTGRs suggested an increase in purine degradation, whereas other changes supported an increased ketogenic amino  tyrosine level, causing energy production failure. The metabolomic profile of valsartan-treated dTGRs more closely resembled Sprague-Dawley rats than untreated dTGRs. Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity of cytochrome C oxidase was decreased in dTGRs, whereas complex I and complex II were unaltered.  from dTGR hearts showed morphological alterations suggesting increased mitochondrial fusion. Cardiac expression of the redox-sensitive and the cardioprotective metabolic sensor sirtuin 1 was increased in dTGRs. Interestingly, valsartan changed the level of 33 metabolites and induced mitochondrial biogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats. Thus, distinct patterns of cardiac substrate use in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The finding underscores the importance of Ang II in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cardiac metabolomics, even in healthy hearts.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28336375>Tumortropic adipose-derived stem cells carrying smart nanotherapeutics for targeted delivery and dual-modality therapy of orthotopic glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Chemotherapy is typically used to treat malignant brain tumors, especially for the tumors in surgically inaccessible areas. However, owing to the existence of blood-brain  (BBB), the tumor accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of clinical therapeutics is still of great concerns. To this end, we present herein a prominent therapeutic strategy adopting adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) capable of carrying nanotherapeutic payloads selectively toward brain tumors for thermo/chemotherapy. The nanoparticle (NP) payload was obtained from co-assembly of poly(γ-glutamic -co-distearyl γ-glutamate) with poly(lactic-co-glycolic ), paclitaxel (PTX), and -coated superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs in aqueous solution. The particle size and drug loading content were ca 110nm and 8.4wt%, respectively. After being engulfed by ADSCs, the nanotherapeutics was found rather harmless to cellular hosts at a PTX concentration of 30μM over 48h in the absence of pertinent stimulus. Nevertheless, the ADSC-based approach combined with high frequency magnetic field exhibits a sound therapeutic performance with a 4-fold increase in therapeutic index on brain astrocytoma (ALTS1C1)-bearing mice (C57BL/6J) as compared to the typical chemotherapy using a current first-line chemodrug, temozolomide. Immunohistochemical examination of brain tumor sections confirms the successful cellular transport and pronounced cytotoxic action of therapeutics against tumor cells in vivo.

Daming capsule (DMC), a medicine for lowering blood lipids, is marketed in China; however, its mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which DMC reduces blood lipids.A rat model of hyperlipidaemia was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet (HFD), and the serum lipid levels were detected with an automatic biochemical analyser. DMC (162 mg/kg) and atorvastatin calcium (10 mg/kg) were orally administered to the hyperlipidaemic rats for 4 weeks. HFD feeding markedly induced increases in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); however, DMC treatment significantly decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-c in rats serum. Meanwhile, the hepatic TC and TG levels, liver / ratio, and  were significantly lower in the DMC-treated rats than in the HFD rats. Moreover, DMC significantly alleviated hepatomegaly, hepatic lipid deposition, and hepatic steatosis. The protein expression level of phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) (Thr172) in HFD rat livers was lower than that in normal rat livers, whereas it increased in the liver of the DMC-treated rats; however, the protein expression level of total-AMPK in the liver was not different among the groups. The AMPK-activating effect of DMC was blocked by Compound C (a specific AMPK inhibitor) in HepG2 cells. Additionally, DMC considerably increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) transcription and concentration in the liver. This effect of DMC was also inhibited by Compound C in HepG2 cells. DMC also promoted LDL receptor (LDLR) protein expression by activating AMPK. We further found that DMC reduced the levels of TC and TG in -treated HepG2 cells, and it restored the expression levels of p-AMPK, PPARα, LPL, and LDLR compared to the decreased levels observed in -treated HepG2 cells.DMC lowered lipids in serum and the liver by activating AMPK. On the one hand, the activation of AMPK enhanced PPARα expression and LPL transcription to lead to the hydrolysis of TG; on the other hand, it increased LDLR protein expression to promote lipid metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, an understanding of the physiological mechanism of HS lactating dairy cows remains elusive. Here, a metabolomics study using LC-MS and (1)H NMR spectroscopy was performed to analyze the metabolomic differences in the milk between HS-free and HS dairy cows, and discover diagnostic biomarkers and changes in the metabolic pathway. A total of 53 discriminating metabolites were significantly up- or down-regulated in the HS group compared with the HS-free group (P < 0.05). These biomarkers were involved in pathways of carbohydrate, amino , lipid, and gut microbiome-derived metabolism. Comparing these potential biomarkers with previously identified HS candidate biomarkers in plasma, significant correlations between the levels of lactate, pyruvate, creatine, acetone, β-hydroxybutyrate, trimethylamine, , linoleic , lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, and phosphatidylcholine 42:2 in milk and plasma were found, indicating that the blood-milk barrier became leaky and the levels of these 10 biomarkers in milk can reflect HS-induced metabolomic alterations in blood.

We tested this hypothesis by assessing the chronic effect of  on glucose metabolism and its relationship with glucose-induced insulin release in beta HC9 cells in tissue culture. Our results show: (1) A 4-day treatment with  caused an enhancement of insulin release at 0-5 mmol/l glucose concentrations while a significant decrease in insulin release occurred when the glucose level was greater than 15 nmol/l; (2) Hexokinase activity was increased and a corresponding left shift of the dose-dependency curve of glucose usage was observed associated with inhibition of glucose oxidation in  treated beta HC9 cells, yet the presumed glucose-related ATP generation did not parallel the change in insulin release due to glucose; (3) The rate of cellular respiration was markedly increased in  treated beta HC9 cells both in the absence of glucose and at all glucose concentrations tested. This enhanced oxidative metabolism may explain the increased insulin release at a low glucose level but is clearly dissociated from the blunted insulin secretion at high glucose concentrations. We conclude that a reduction of oxidative metabolism in pancreatic beta cells is unlikely to be the cause of the dramatic effect that high levels of non-esterified fatty acids have on glucose-induced insulin release.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24045975>Increased lipid synthesis and decreased β-oxidation in the liver of SHR/NDmcr-cp (cp/cp) rats, an animal model of metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>SHR/NDmcr-cp (cp/cp) rats (SHR/NDcp) are an animal model of metabolic syndrome.

However, detailed information on the class of lipid accumulated and the mechanism responsible for the overproduction of the accumulated lipid in the liver was not obtained. This study aimed to characterize the class of lipid accumulated and to explore the mechanism underlying the lipid accumulation in the liver of SHR/NDcp, in comparison with SHR/NDmcr-cp (+/+) (lean hypertensive littermates of SHR/NDcp) and Wistar Kyoto rats. In the liver of SHR/NDcp, de novo synthesis of fatty acids (16:0, 18:1n-9 and 16:1n-7) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis were up-regulated and fatty  β-oxidation was down-regulated. These perturbations of lipid metabolism caused fat accumulation in hepatocytes and accumulation of TAG, which were enriched with 16:0, 18:1n-9 and 16:1n-7, in the liver of SHR/NDcp. On the other hand, no changes were found in hepatic contents of diacylglycerol and unesterified fatty  (FFA); among FFA, there were no differences in the hepatic concentrations of unesterified 16:0 and stearic  between SHR/NDcp and two other groups of rats. Moreover, little change was brought about in the expression of genes responsive to endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of SHR/NDcp.

It was hypothesized that delta-9 desaturation and lipogenic properties of t-18:1 isomers depend on the position of double bond. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 200 µM of t6-18:1, t9-18:1, t11-18:1, t13-18:1 or t16-18:1, cis (c)-9 18:1 or bovine serum albumin (BSA) vehicle control for 48 h. Cells were then harvested for fatty  and gene expression analyses using gas chromatography and quantitative PCR respectively. Among t-18:1 isomers, t13-18:1 and t11-8:1 had the greatest percent delta-9 desaturation (44 and 41 % respectively) followed by t16-18:1 and t6-18:1 (32 and 17 % respectively), while c9-18:1 and t9-18:1 did not undergo delta-9 desaturation. Trans9-18:1 up-regulated (P < 0.05) the expression of lipogenic genes including fatty  synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of these genes were not affected with other t-18:1 isomers (P > 0.05).

The new materials are based on ionic liquid monomers formed by cations containing the silver(I) ion coordinated with two 1-vinylimidazole ligands. Up to seven different silver-based PIL sorbent coatings were developed by polymerizing the silver-IL monomer in the presence of either silver bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, and/or a dicationic ionic liquid crosslinker. The obtained sorbent coatings were found to possess adequate thermal stability despite the presence of the silver(I) ions. Thermal desorption of the analytes at 175 °C was effectively used without any significant decrease in extraction efficiency. The developed sorbent coatings were used in two different applications: the determination of alkenes/alkynes via headspace SPME and the determination of unsaturated fatty acids using direct-immersion SPME. In the former approach, the silver-based PILs were particularly selective for the determination of unsaturated compounds with terminal double bonds such as 1,5-hexadiene, 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene, and 1,8-nonadiene. A study of the extraction mechanism of the analytes to the sorbent coating revealed a competitive partitioning of the analytes. In the second approach, the most selective silver-based PILs were applied for the determination of , linoleic , and linolenic . After proper optimization of the method, the coatings were found to be more or as sensitive as the commercial polydimethylsiloxane fiber. Limits of detection between 2.6 and 8.2 μg L in ultrapure water and from 12 to 14 μg L in tap water were obtained for the best silver-based PIL, with relative standard deviations lower than 13% in all cases at a spiked level of 160 μg L.

In oxalic lithiasis it is recommended to reduce the consumption of meat, moderate that of spinach, Swiss chard, asparagus, chocolate and avoid excessive sodium intake. The administration of oxalate-degrading probiotics (Lactobacillus) may reduce intestinal absorption, although further studies are necessary to corroborate these results. In calcium phosphate acidifying diet is recommended and limit the consumption of coffee and tea. The prevention of uric calculus is based on hydration with alkalizing drinks and vegetarian diet, decreasing foods rich in purines (liver, kidney, fish eggs, anchovies, sardines and seafood) and in calculus of cystine diet is recommended alkalizing. Since the formation of struvite calculi is due to urinary infections, pharmacological treatment and the consumption of acidifying diets, moderation of the intake of phosphate-rich foods and limiting the contribution of fats and citrus fruits are necessary.

The values of K for the organic particles (0.23 ± 0.13 m/μg for  and 0.11 ± 0.10 m/μg for squalane) are an order of magnitude higher than those for the inorganic particles (0.011 ± 0.004 m/μg), suggesting that the process by which the particles accumulate SVOCs is different. A mechanistic model based on the experimental design reveals that the presence of the particles increases the gas-phase concentration gradient in the boundary layer, resulting in enhanced mass transfer from the emission source into the air. This novel approach provides new insight into experimental designs for rapid K measurement and a sound basis for investigating particle-mediated mass transfer of SVOCs.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593651>Distinct Shift in Beta-Cell Glutaredoxin 5 Expression Is Mediated by Hypoxia and Lipotoxicity Both  and .</a></h2><p>Histomorphological and functional alterations in pancreatic islet composition directly correlate with hyperglycemia severity. Progressive deterioration of metabolic control in subjects suffering from type 2  is predominantly caused by impaired beta-cell functionality. The glutaredoxin system is supposed to wield protective properties for beta-cells. Therefore, we sought to identify a correlation between the structural changes observed in diabetic pancreatic islets with altered glutaredoxin 5 expression, in order to determine an underlying mechanism of beta-cell impairment. Islets of db/db mice presenting with uncontrolled  were assessed in terms of morphological structure and insulin, glucagon, and glutaredoxin 5 expression.

Islets of diabese mice were marked by typical remodeling and distinct reduction of, and shifts, in localization of glutaredoxin 5-positive cells. These islets featured decreased glutaredoxin 5 as well as insulin and glucagon content. In beta-cell culture, glutaredoxin 5 protein and mRNA expression were decreased by hypoxia and  but not by leptin treatment. Our study demonstrates that glutaredoxin 5 expression patterns are distinctively altered in islets of rodents presenting with uncontrolled diabesity. , reduction of islet-cell glutaredoxin 5 expression was mediated by hypoxia and .

Despite this striking histological feature, physiological accumulation of lipids in the kidney is poorly understood. We studied whether the accumulation of lipids in the fasted kidney are derived from lipoproteins or NEFAs. With overnight fasting, kidneys accumulated triglyceride, but had reduced levels of ceramide and glycosphingolipid species. Fasting led to a nearly 5-fold increase in kidney uptake of plasma [C]. Increasing circulating NEFAs using a β adrenergic receptor agonist caused a 15-fold greater accumulation of lipid in the kidney, while mice with reduced NEFAs due to adipose tissue deficiency of adipose triglyceride lipase had reduced triglycerides. Cluster of differentiation () mRNA increased 2-fold, and angiopoietin-like 4 (), an LPL inhibitor, increased 10-fold. Fasting-induced kidney lipid accumulation was not affected by inhibition of LPL with poloxamer 407 or by use of mice with induced genetic LPL deletion. Despite the increase in CD36 expression with fasting, genetic loss of CD36 did not alter fatty  uptake or triglyceride accumulation.

However, the cellular mechanisms linking OC compound exposure and  dysfunction remain elusive. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if direct exposure to three highly implicated OC compounds promoted hepatic steatosis, the hepatic ramification of the . First, the steatotic effect of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), oxychlordane, and trans-nonachlor was determined in freshly isolated rat primary hepatocytes. Exposure to trans-nonachlor significantly increased neutral lipid accumulation as opposed to DDE and oxychlordane. To determine possible mechanisms governing increased fatty  availability, the effects of trans-nonachlor exposure on fatty  uptake, de novo lipogenesis, triglyceride secretion, and fatty  oxidation were explored. Trans-nonachlor did not significantly alter fatty  uptake. However, insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis as well as basal expression of fatty  synthase, a major regulator of lipogenesis were significantly increased following trans-nonachlor exposure. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in fatty  oxidation following trans-nonachlor exposure. This decrease in fatty  oxidation was accompanied by a slight, but significant increase in -induced cellular triglyceride secretion. Therefore, taken together, the present data indicate direct exposure to trans-nonachlor has a more potent pro-steatotic effect than exposure to DDE or oxychlordane. This pro-steatotic effect of trans-nonachlor appears to be predominately mediated via increased de novo lipogenesis and decreased fatty  oxidation.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23486011>Nitro- protects against adriamycin-induced nephropathy in mice.</a></h2><p>Adriamycin (ADR) administration in susceptible rodents such as the BALB/c mouse strain produces injury to the glomerulus mimicking human focal glomerular sclerosis. The goal of the present study was to use this model to investigate antiproteinuric action of nitro- (OA-NO2), a nitric oxide-derived endogenous lipid product, which has exhibited multiple attractive signaling properties particularly in the kidney. BALB/c mice were pretreated for 2 days with OA-NO2 at 5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) via an osmotic minipump, followed by a single injection of vehicle or adriamycin (10 mg/kg) via the tail vein. Albuminuria and renal function were analyzed at 1 wk post-ADR treatment. ADR mice developed prominent albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, , and severe ascites. In contrast, the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome were greatly improved by OA-NO2 treatment. In parallel, plasma creatinine and plasma urea nitrogen were elevated in the ADR group, and the severity was less in the ADR+OA-NO2 group. OA-NO2 attenuates ADR-induced glomerulosclerosis, podocyte loss, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Indices of oxidative stress, including plasma and urinary thiobarbituric -reactive substances and renal expression of NAD(P)H oxidase p47(phox) and gp91(phox), and inflammation, including renal expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1 in response to ADR, were all similarly suppressed. Together, these findings suggest that OA-NO2 exerts renoprotective action against ADR nephropathy likely via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11227032>Eicosanoid production, thrombogenic ratio, and serum and LDL peroxides in normo- and hypercholesterolaemic post-menopausal women consuming two -rich diets with different content of minor components.</a></h2><p>The present paper compares the effects of two monounsaturated oils, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and high- sunflower oil (HOSO), on serum and LDL peroxides, eicosanoid production and the thrombogenic ratio (thromboxane (TX) B2:6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha) in fourteen non-obese post-menopausal women. The subjects, mean age 63 (SD 11) years, were assigned to two consecutive -rich 28 d dietary periods. EVOO and HOSO represented 62 % of the total lipid intake and were used as the only culinary fat during the first and second dietary periods respectively. Serum peroxides, plasma alpha-tocopherol and TXB2 levels in stimulated platelet-rich plasma (PRP-TXB2) were significantly higher (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively) after the HOSO diet than after the EVOO diet. The relationship between the serum cholesterol level (< 6.21 mmol/l or > or = 6.21 mmol/l) and the type of dietary oil on eicosanoids, peroxides and alpha-tocopherol were evaluated by two-way ANOVA. Dietary oil significantly affected (P < 0.05) the PRP-TXB2 level, whereas serum and LDL peroxides were significantly affected (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) by the serum cholesterol level. The plasma alpha-tocopherol level was significantly affected by the serum cholesterol level and the type of dietary oil (both P < 0.001). No significant relationships were found between serum cholesterol levels, serum peroxide or LDL peroxide levels, plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations or alpha-tocopherol intakes with eicosanoid production or the thrombogenic ratio due to dietary changes. However, in spite of their higher alpha-tocopherol levels, hypercholesterolaemic subjects showed increased peroxidation in serum and LDL in comparison with normocholesterolaemic subjects on the HOSO diet in comparison with the EVOO diet. These findings suggest that differences in the type of minor compounds, as well as in the concentration of linoleic , in both these monounsaturated oils may play an important role in modulating eicosanoid production and lipoprotein peroxidation when they constitute a large proportion of the diet of post-menopausal women.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358041>Metabolomic signature of mouse cerebral cortex following Toxoplasma gondii infection.</a></h2><p>The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects and alters the neurotransmission in cerebral cortex and other brain regions, leading to neurobehavioral and neuropathologic changes in humans and animals.

However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to high  accumulation in tea oil camellia. Herein, we measured the oil content and fatty  compositions of high- and low-oil tea oil camellia seeds and investigated the global gene expression profiles by RNA-seq. The results showed that at the early, second and third seed developmental stages, a total of 64, 253, and 124 genes, respectively, were significantly differentially expressed between the high- and low-oil cultivars. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the identified differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs; ABI3, FUS3, LEC1, WRI1, TTG2 and DOF4.6) revealed some critical GO terms associated with oil biosynthesis and fatty  accumulation, including , zinc ion binding, positive regulation of fatty  biosynthetic process, triglyceride biosynthetic process, seed coat development, abscisic -mediated signaling pathway and embryo development. Comprehensive comparisons of transcriptomic profiles and expression analysis of multigenes based on qRT-PCR showed that coordinated high expression of the upstream genes ,  and  directly increased the relative levels of C16:0-ACP, which provided enough precursor resources for  biosynthesis.

Venal blood was drawn at 0h (fasting) and at 2, 4, and 6h after lipid ingestion. Subjects were characterized by anthropometric and standard laboratory parameters. Serum concentrations of CCL2, IP-10, chemerin, and RANTES were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with free fatty acids (FA) and with sex steroids and concentrations of CCL2 and chemerin in cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA.A significant reduction of circulating CCL2, IP-10, and chemerin concentrations was observed as a consequence of triglyceride ingestion whereas RANTES levels were increased. CCL2 serum concentrations were positively correlated with resistin and visfatin levels and with LDL/HDL ratio and negatively with adiponectin. There were significant differences in chemerin and RANTES serum concentrations in female and male subjects. CCL2 secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited by treatment with linoleic (LA) and  (OA) whereas chemerin secretion was induced. Chemerin release from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was inhibited by testosterone.Oral lipid loading is linked to reduced circulating pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2, IP-10, and chemerin and to increased RANTES levels, suggesting that dietary lipids affect immune function.Copyright © 2016.

Algal biomass and lipid content were measured repeatedly. We compared the two solvent systems n-hexane and hexane/isopropanol (HIP) for extraction efficiency of lipids and applied three different extraction methods Soxhlet, soaking, and soaking followed by Soxhlet (soak-Sox). The combination of the HIP solvent and the soak-Sox provided the highest lipid yield (15.8 ± 0.174).

To clarify the physiologic roles of NAAs, we generated mice deficient in the circulating enzyme peptidase M20 domain-containing 1 (PM20D1). Global PM20D1-KO mice have dramatically reduced NAA hydrolase/synthase activities in tissues and blood with concomitant bidirectional dysregulation of endogenous NAAs. Compared with control animals, PM20D1-KO mice exhibit a variety of metabolic and pain phenotypes, including , altered body temperature in cold, and antinociceptive behaviors. Guided by these phenotypes, we identify -oleoyl-glutamine (C18:1-Gln) as a key PM20D1-regulated NAA. In addition to its mitochondrial uncoupling bioactivity, C18:1-Gln also antagonizes certain members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) calcium channels including TRPV1. Direct administration of C18:1-Gln to mice is sufficient to recapitulate a subset of phenotypes observed in PM20D1-KO animals.

In patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), intestinal TRL overproduction contributes to high systemic TRL levels, and recent studies suggest that systemic changes in MetS such as increases in plasma fatty acids and insulin resistance stimulate intestinal TRL production. The current study has examined whether increases in systemic TRL influence intestinal lipid transport and lipoprotein assembly pathways and evaluates the impact of these changes on the absorption and lymphatic transport of lipids and a model lipophilic drug (halofantrine). Mesenteric lymph-duct or bile-duct cannulated rats were administered IV saline or (14)C-labeled chylomicron (CM) (to increase systemic TRL) and intraduodenal (3)H lipids and drug. Changes to biliary lipid output and lymphatic lipid and drug transport were subsequently examined. Increasing systemic TRL concentrations stimulated a significant increase in lymphatic lipid and drug transport. The increased lipids in lymph were not derived from bile or the intestinal blood supply (fatty  or IV infused (14)C-CM). Rather, an increase in lymphatic transport of duodenally sourced lipids was evident. Increasing plasma levels of TRL therefore stimulated lipid absorption and lymphatic transport via a positive feedback process.

Diffusion studies showed that many of the vehicles were not inert and did interact with the membranes resulting in a modification of the permeants' flux when corrected for membrane thickness (e.g. normalized flux of MP increased from 1.25±0.13μgcm(-1)h(-1) in LP to 17.94±0.25μgcm(-1)h(-1)in IPM).

Membrane interaction was apparently dependent upon the physicochemical properties including; size, shape, flexibility and the Hansen solubility parameter values of both the membranes and oils. Sorbed oils resulted in modified permeant diffusion through the membranes.

Regardless of the mechanisms responsible for the impairment of the transfer, the finding has implications for the management of neonates of women with GDM because they are born with a reduced level of DHA and the condition is thought to be associated with a risk of neuro-developmental deficits. We suggest that babies of women with GDM, particularly those not suckling, similar to the babies born prematurely require formula milk fortified with a higher level of DHA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

This study aims to optimize the component proportion of the six-herb preparation and explore the serum metabolic signatures of type II  rats after treatment with Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet and its optimal combination. The component proportion of the preparation was optimized using uniform experimental design and machine learning techniques. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomic experiments were carried out with serum samples from model group and treatment groups. Data were normalized, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis performed and metabolites of interest putatively identified. 23 metabolites were significantly changed by Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet treatment and the majority of these were decreased, including various carbohydrates (glucose, mannose, fructose, allose and gluconic ), unsaturated fatty acids (palmitic , 9-octadecenoic , , arachidonic ), alanine, valine, propanoic , 3-hydroxybutyrate, along with pyrimidine and cholesterol. Increased concentrations of oxalic , leucine, glycine, serine, threonine, proline, lysine and citrate were observed. In the optimal combination-fed group, 21 metabolites were significantly affected and strikingly, the magnitudes of changes here were generally much greater than that of Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet treated rats. 18 metabolites affected in both groups included various carbohydrates (mannose, glucose, allose, fructose and gluconic ), unsaturated fatty acids (palmitic , 9-octadecenoic ,  and arachidonic ), short-chain fatty acids (oxalic , 3-hydroxybutyrate), and amino acids (alanine, valine, leucine, glycine, proline and lysine), as well as pyrimidine. Metabolites exclusively affected in optimal combination treated rat included succinic , cysteine and phenylalanine, whilst four metabolites (propanoic , citrate, serine and threonine) were only altered in Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet treated rat. Our investigation demonstrated Fu-Zhu-Jiang-Tang tablet and its optimal combination treatments were able to ameliorate impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, down- regulate the high level of glucose to a lower level and reverse abnormal levels of metabolites in serum of type II  rats. However, the optimal combination treatment was able to maximize the magnitudes of changes in some metabolites. These findings may be helpful in clarifying the anti-diabetic mechanism of FZJT tablet and its optimal combination.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We now show that in the presence of succinate: (i) the rates of uncoupled  respiration and heat production are five times slower than in the presence of pyruvate/malate; (ii) faf-BSA and GDP accelerate heat and respiration as a result and, in coupled , these two rates are accelerated compared with pyruvate/malate; (iii) in spite of the differences in respiration and heat production noted with the two substrates, the membrane potential and the ATP synthesized were the same; and (iv) oleate promoted a decrease in heat production and respiration in coupled , an effect different from that observed using pyruvate/malate.

We found that EPA supplementation significantly increased DHA percentage in retinal neurons, but not EPA percentage. Photoreceptors and glial cells expressed Δ6 desaturase (FADS2), which introduces the last double bond in DHA biosynthetic pathway. Pre-treatment of neuronal cultures with CP-24879 hydrochloride, a Δ5/Δ6 desaturase inhibitor, prevented EPA-induced increase in DHA percentage and completely blocked EPA protection and its effect on photoreceptor differentiation. These results suggest that EPA promoted photoreceptor differentiation and rescued photoreceptors from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through its elongation and desaturation to DHA. Our data show, for the first time, that isolated retinal neurons can synthesize DHA in culture. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the major polyunsaturated fatty  in retina photoreceptors, and its precursor, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) have multiple beneficial effects. Here, we show that retina neurons in vitro express the desaturase FADS2 and can synthesize DHA from EPA. Moreover, addition of EPA to these cultures protects photoreceptors from oxidative stress and promotes their differentiation through its metabolization to DHA.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27131391>The commonly used nonionic surfactant Span 80 has RXRα transactivation activity, which likely increases the obesogenic potential of oil dispersants and food emulsifiers.</a></h2><p> has reached pandemic proportions, and there is mounting evidence that environmental exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals known as "obesogens" may contribute to  and associated medical conditions. The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill resulted in a massive environmental release of crude oil and remediation efforts applied large quantities of Corexit dispersants to the oil spill. The Corexit-enhanced Water Accommodated Fraction (CWAF) of DWH crude oil contains PPARγ transactivation activity, which is attributed to dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), a probable obesogen. In addition to its use in oil dispersants, DOSS is commonly used as a stool softener and food additive. Because PPARγ functions as a heterodimer with RXRα to transcriptionally regulate adipogenesis we investigated the potential of CWAF to transactivate RXRα and herein demonstrated that the Corexit component Span 80 has RXRα transactivation activity. Span 80 bound to RXRα in the low micromolar range and promoted adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Further, the combination of DOSS and Span 80 increased 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation substantially more than treatment with either chemical individually, likely increasing the obesogenic potential of Corexit dispersants. From a public health standpoint, the use of DOSS and Span 80 as food additives heightens concerns regarding their use and mandates further investigations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Until in blood plasma the level of unesterified fatty acids is increased the cells phylogenetically justified stop absorption of glucose along with development of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia -  syndrome. Thew increasing of content of triglycerides (alcohol glycerin) always increases cholesterol - low density lipoproteins; the highest numbers of cholesterol result in no increasing of triglycerides concentration in blood. All triglycerides of milk positionally are palmitic ones and all triglycerides of palm oil are  ones. The surplus of palmitic unesterified fatty acids in small intestine under hydrolysis of  triglycerides decreases bio-availability and absorption of ions of Ca++ and Mg++ by enterocytes. This occurrence is absent in case of hydrolysis of palmitic triglycerides of maternal milk in intestine since all released unesterified fatty acids are  ones.

For this, both differentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated with either palmitoleic  (16:1n7, 200 μM) or palmitic  (16:0, 200 μM) for 24 h and primary adipocytes from wild-type or PPARα-deficient mice treated with 16:1n7 (300 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) or  (18:1n9, 300 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) by gavage for 10 days were evaluated for lipolysis, TAG, and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis and gene and protein expression profile. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with 16:1n7, but not 16:0, increased basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, mRNA levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and protein content of ATGL and pSer(660)-HSL. Such increase in lipolysis induced by 16:1n7, which can be prevented by pharmacological inhibition of PPARα, was associated with higher rates of PPARα binding to DNA. In contrast to lipolysis, both 16:1n7 and 16:0 increased fatty  incorporation into TAG and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis from glucose without affecting glyceroneogenesis and glycerokinase expression. Corroborating in vitro findings, treatment of wild-type but not PPARα-deficient mice with 16:1n7 increased primary adipocyte basal and stimulated lipolysis and ATGL and HSL mRNA levels. In contrast to lipolysis, however, 16:1n7 treatment increased fatty  incorporation into TAG and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis from glucose in both wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice.

N-3 PUFAs reduce  cell growth, but no unified mechanism has been identified. We show that docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6 n-3) causes extensive changes in gene expression patterns at mRNA level in the  cell line SW620. Early changes include unfolded protein response (UPR) and increased levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha as verified at protein level. The latter is considered a hallmark of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is abundantly present already after 3 h. It may coordinate many of the downstream changes observed, including signaling pathways for cell cycle arrest/apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, cholesterol metabolism, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Also, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), but not  (OA), induced key mediators of ER stress and UPR at protein level. Accumulation of esterified cholesterol was not compensated for by increased total levels of cholesterol, and mRNAs for cholesterol biosynthesis as well as de novo synthesis of cholesterol were reduced.

Moreover, substrates destined for degradation, like extracellular endocytosed cargoes that are transported by endosomes/multivesicular bodies as well as intracellular substrates that are transported via different forms of autophagosomes, have the vacuole as destination. We found that non-selective bulk autophagy of cytosolic proteins as well as the selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy) and ribosomes (ribophagy) was dependent on the armadillo repeat protein Vac8 in . Moreover, we showed that pexophagy and ribophagy depended on the palmitoylation of Vac8. In contrast, we described that Vac8 was not involved in the acidification of the vacuole nor in the targeting and maturation of certain biosynthetic cargoes, like the aspartyl-protease Pep4 (PrA) and the carboxy-peptidase Y (CPY), indicating a role of Vac8 in the uptake of selected cargoes. In addition, we found that the hallmark phenotype of the  strain, namely the characteristic appearance of fragmented and clustered vacuoles, depended on the growth conditions. This fusion defect observed in standard glucose medium can be complemented by the replacement with  or glycerol medium. This complementation of vacuolar morphology also partially restores the degradation of peroxisomes.

The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which low levels of estrogen induce fatty liver disease using an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model and an in vitro cell model. A total of 24 female C57/BL6 mice were divided into four groups: Sham operation, sham operation plus subcutaneous implantation of tamoxifen (TAM), bilateral OVX, and OVX plus subcutaneous implantation of 17β-estradiol (E2). Marked hepatic steatosis and increased expression of lipogenic genes (acetyl‑CoA carboxylase, fatty  synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) was observed in the estrogen‑depleted mice (TAM and OVX groups), as compared with in the sham operation group. Treatment with E2 significantly improved hepatic steatosis by decreasing the expression of the aforementioned lipogenic genes. Furthermore, hepatic aquaporin 7 (AQP7) expression was decreased in the estrogen‑depleted mice, but was increased in the OVX + E2 treatment group, as compared with in the sham operation group. These results suggested an association between AQP7 and low estrogen‑induced hepatic steatosis. Subsequently, the functions of AQP7 in hepatic steatosis were investigated using an ‑induced HepG2 cell model of steatosis. Treatment with E2 alleviated lipid accumulation and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes in vitro; however, such effects were attenuated following transfection with AQP7 small interfering RNA.

We previously reported that PA treatment induces the decoupling of  and tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA cycle) fluxes, but OA co-treatment restored most metabolic fluxes to their control levels. However, the mechanisms by which metabolites are linked to metabolic fluxes and subsequent lipoapoptotic or steatotic phenotypes remain unclear. To determine the link, we used GC-MS-based polar and non-polar metabolic profiling in lipoapoptosis- or steatosis-developing H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells, to examine the metabolome at different time points after treatment with either PA alone (PA cells) or both PA and OA (PA/OA cells). Metabolic profiles revealed various changes in metabolite levels for TCA cycle intermediates, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates, and energy storage metabolites between PA and PA/OA cells. For example, adenosine was markedly increased only in PA cells, whereas gluconate was increased in PA/OA cells. To assess the interaction among these metabolites, the metabolite-to-metabolite correlations were calculated and correlation networks were visualized. These correlation networks demonstrate that a dissociation among PPP metabolites was introduced in PA-treated cells, and this dissociation was restored in PA/OA-treated cells. Thus, our data suggest that abnormal PPP fluxes, in addition to increased adenosine levels, might be related to the decoupling of  and the resulting lipoapoptotic phenotype.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29207484>Tunisian Milk Thistle: An Investigation of the Chemical Composition and the Characterization of Its Cold-Pressed Seed Oils.</a></h2><p>In this study, milk thistle seeds growing in different areas in Tunisia were cold pressed and the extracted oils were examined for their chemical and antioxidant properties.

During fermentation, the dissolved  (DO) concentration was controlled at 5, 10, 20 and 30 of full O saturation and also uncontrolled by varying the stirring speed and aeration rate. Yarrowia lipolytica harbouring the VHb gene (VHb strain) displayed more pseudomycelium than the control strain (VHb strain), and VHb expression also enhanced the cell density. When DO level was controlled at 30%, the biomass of VHb strains reached about 19 g l and increased by 27% compared to VHb strains. Total fatty  contents, although, were higher in VHb strains than in VHb strains under all DO levels, and maximally increased by c. 40% (from 10·5 to 14·5% of the biomass) when the DO concentration was controlled at 30%.

However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery (also known as ulcerative , UC) has not been fully illuminated. Brucea javanica oil emulsion (BJOE) is the major active and most common application form of Brucea javanica oil (BJO), which has a variety of pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of BJOE and possible mechanism of action on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice.The components of BJOE were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Balb/C mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, 30mg/mL) induced  were treated with BJOE (0.5, 1 and 2g/kg) and two positive drugs (sulfasalazine, SASP, 200mg/kg; and azathioprine, AZA, 13mg/kg) once daily by gavage for 7 days. Mice in normal control group and DSS group were orally given the same volume of distilled water and soybean lecithin suspension (0.15g/kg) respectively. The effects of BJOE on DSS-induced UC were assessed by determination of body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological analysis, as well as levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 in colon tissues was detected by qRT-PCR. In addition, NF-κB p65, p-p65 and IκB-α, p-IκBα protein expression levels in colon tissues were investigated using Western blotting.The major components of BJOE were found to be  (62.68%) and linoleic  (19.53%) as detected by GC-MS. Our results indicated that BJOE, SASP and AZA showed beneficial effect on DSS-induced  in mice, and significantly reduced the body weight loss and DAI, restored the colon length, repaired colonic pathological variations, decreased histological scores, and decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IFN-γ) as compared with the DSS group. In addition, the mRNA expression of MPO, iNOS and COX-2 induced by DSS treatment was remarkably inhibited by BJOE, SASP or AZA treatments. Furthermore, when compared with DSS-treated mice, the activation of NF-κB was significantly inhibited by AZA and BJOE treatment.Our study shows that BJOE possessed appreciable anti-inflammatory effect against murine experimental UC induced by DSS. The protective mechanism of BJOE may involve inhibition of NF-κB signal transduction pathways and subsequent down-regulation of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that BJOE might be an efficacious and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of UC. Our investigation might also provide experimental evidence for the traditional application of Brucea javanica in the treatment of dysentery and might add new dimension to the clinical indications for BJOE.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Despite this established dual role of lipids, little is known about lipid storage and handling in β-cells. Here, we isolated lipid droplets from oleate-incubated INS-1 832/13 cells and characterized the lipid droplet proteome. In a total of four rounds of droplet isolation and proteomic analysis by HPLC-MS/MS, we identified 96 proteins that were specific to droplets. The proteins fall into six categories based on function or previously observed localization: metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum/ribosomes, , vesicle formation and transport, signaling, and miscellaneous. The protein profile reinforces the emerging picture of the lipid droplet as an active and dynamic organelle involved in lipid homeostasis and intracellular trafficking. Proteins belonging to the category  were highly represented, suggesting that the β-cell  and lipid droplets form a metabolic unit of potential relevance for insulin secretion.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29079451>2-OMe-lysophosphatidylcholine analogues are GPR119 ligands and activate insulin secretion from βTC-3 pancreatic cells: Evaluation of structure-dependent biological activity.</a></h2><p>GPR119 receptor has been proposed as a metabolic regulator playing a pivotal role in the modulation of glucose homeostasis in type 2 . GPR119 was identified on pancreatic β cells and its ligands have the ability to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was shown to potentiate GSIS and our present studies indicate that 2-methoxy-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-OMe-LPC) analogues, unable to undergo 1→2 acyl migration, stimulate GSIS from murine βTC-3 pancreatic cells even more efficiently. Moreover, biological assays in engineered Tango™ GPR119-bla U2OS cells were carried out to ascertain the agonist activity of 2-OMe-LPC at GPR119. 2-OMe-LPC possessing in sn-1 position the residues of myristic, palmitic, stearic and  were also evaluated as factors regulating [Ca] mobilization and cAMP levels. Extension of these studies to R- and S-enantiomers of 14:0 2-OMe-LPC revealed that the overall impact on GSIS does not depend on chirality, however, the intracellular calcium mobilization data show that the R enantiomer is significantly more active than S one. Taking into account differences in chemical structure between various native LPCs and their 2-methoxy counterparts the possible binding mode of 2-OMe-LPC to the GPR119 receptor was determined using molecular modeling approach.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Trans11-18:1 (vaccenic , VA), the most predominant ruminant TFA and a precursor to conjugated linoleic , has been shown to improve atherogenic dyslipidemia and symptoms of hepatic steatosis in animal models. The objective of this study was to assess the intestinal bioavailability of various VA sources including synthetic free fatty  (FFA) and natural ruminant triglyceride forms, as well as the mechanistic pathways that mediate VA's bioactivity.VA acts as a partial agonist to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ in vitro, with similar affinity compared to commonly known PPAR agonists. It was further confirmed that VA at 30 and 100 μM concentrations suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy vitro in a PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent manner. In vivo, feeding of VA (1%, w/w) resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of PPAR-γ in the mucosa of JCR:LA-cp rats, a model of the metabolic syndrome (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared to control. In addition, VA from a triglyceride source had greater intestinal bioavailability in vivo compared to VA provided in an FFA form (p < 0.01).The activation of PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent pathways provides a mechanistic explanation of how VA improves blood lipids and related metabolic disorders during conditions of .

Based on US patent, the yield of bioactive compounds (such as gamma-linolenic  GLA, C18:3) extracted from microalgae biomass, mainly depends on the extraction processes (1). GLA has much attention in respect of its therapeutic properties such as its ability to decrease blood cholesterol levels.The impact of the addition of N in cultures of S. platensis in terms of growth, biomasses and induced lipid compounds (total carotenoids and total lipid contents and its fatty  profile) as well as the sonication (SON) and microwave (MIC) process as aiding techniques for lipid extraction compared with a cold condition (COL) were examined. GC/MS method was used to determine the fatty  profile of lipid extract of SP cultures.In all S. platensis tested culture, the SP was growing successfully, with varied degrees. In N-rich media, the highest cell growth rate and biomass yield were obtained compared with that recorded in other cultures. Under an N-limited condition, SP had a higher total carotenoids (TCAR, 45.54 mg/g dw) and total lipid contents (TL, 29.51%± 1.92 g/100g dw) compared with that recorded either in N-rich (11.2 mg/g dw) or in N-optimal (6.23 mg/g dw) cultures. Thus, SP copes with the N -stress by altering the metabolic pathways toward inducing lipid biosynthesis. To maximize the TL and TCAR extraction yields, from N-limited cultures, a set of operating process was applied including the sonication (SON) and microwave (MIC), which were used as aiding techniques for lipid extraction compared with the cold condition (COL) techniques. The results showed that the extraction efficiency of the S. platensis TL increased in the following order: MIC (29.51%± 1.92) > SON (25.46% ± 1.65> COL (20.43% ±1.43). In comparative study for its fatty  profiles (FAPs) among all SP cultures, lipids were analyzed by GC/MS. The predominant fatty acids (>10%, of total FA) were found to be myristic  (C14:0, MA), palmitic  (C16:0, PA) and  (C18:1).The study concluded that N-limited condition was found to be a strong influence on biomass dry  and lipid contents and total carotenoids in SP cells compared to either N-rich or N-optimal conditions. The use of sonication and the microwave techniques lead to great increase in the extraction of lipid contents and in high amount polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in N-limited cultures, in particular the omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3 (ω3) of the essential C18 fatty acids. It seems that the SP rich in lipid content with a high amount of GLC produced under nitrogen limitation in PBR conditions can be used as a food additive or as a nutritional supplement.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546768>Assessing Validity of Self-Reported Dietary Intake within a Mediterranean Diet Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial among US Firefighters.</a></h2><p>Collecting dietary intake data is associated with challenges due to the subjective nature of self-administered instruments. Biomarkers may objectively estimate the consumption of specific dietary items or help assess compliance in dietary intervention studies. Our aim was to use a panel of plasma and urine biomarkers to assess the validity of self-reported dietary intake using a modified Mediterranean Diet Scale (mMDS) among firefighters participating in Feeding America's Bravest (FAB), an MD cluster-randomized controlled trial. In our nested biomarker pilot study, participants were randomly selected from both the MD intervention group ( = 24) and the control group ( = 24) after 12-months of dietary intervention. At baseline data collection for the pilot study (t = 12-months of FAB), participants in the control group crossed-over to receive the MD intervention (active intervention) for 6-months. Participants in the intervention group continued in a self-sustained continuation phase (SSP) of the intervention. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), 13-item-mMDS questionnaires, 40 plasma fatty acids, inflammatory biomarkers and urinary hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol were analyzed at both time points. Spearman's correlation, -tests and linear regression coefficients were calculated using SAS software. Overall, the mMDS derived from the FFQ was highly correlated with the specific 13-domain-mMDS (r = 0.74).

Genotype CC showed a higher binding (mean ± standard error of the mean) than genotype AA in 2 different conditions [Enzo buffer (EB), Enzo Life Science Inc., Farmingdale, NY: 201.77 ± 4.06 vs. 141.65 ± 3.77 band intensity values and Poletto buffer (PB): 95.90 ± 1.15 vs. 67.30 ± 2.14 band intensity values]. The subsequent quantitative PCR confirmed the upregulation of the CC genotype compared with the AA and AC genotypes. The association study with milk  traits revealed a favorable effect of allele C. The heterozygous genotype had the highest values for monounsaturated fatty acids,  (C18:1 cis-9), polyunsaturated fatty acids, and odd- and branched-chain fatty acids, and the lowest values for saturated fatty acids and atherogenic and thrombogenic indices; the heterozygous genotype differed significantly from the AA genotype. The AC genotype has previously been associated with higher milk yield. Therefore, the g.133A>C SNP is a marker with dual effects and is an interesting candidate for assisted selection programs in river buffalo. These data clarified the biological role of the SNP g.133A>C in the SCD promoter and how it affects gene function, providing important knowledge on the genetic background of , including the future possibility of selecting alleles with quantitatively or qualitatively favorable effects.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Few dietary or lifestyle interventions have been tested to prevent prostate cancer progression. Omega-3 fatty  supplementation represents a promising intervention for prostate cancer patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn3), more precisely eicosapentaenoic  monoacylglyceride (MAG-EPA) supplementation, on prostate cancer proliferation,  mediators and quality of life among men who will undergo radical prostatectomy.We propose a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of MAG-EPA supplementation for 130 men who will undergo radical prostatectomy as treatment for a prostate cancer of Gleason score ≥ 7 in an academic cancer center in Quebec City. Participants will be randomized to 6 capsules of 625 mg of fish oil (MAG-EPA) per capsule containing 500 mg of EPA daily or to identically looking capsules of high  sunflower oil (HOSO) as placebo. The intervention begins 4 to 10 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy (baseline) and continues for one year after surgery. The primary endpoint is the proliferative index (Ki-67) measured in prostate cancer cells at radical prostatectomy. A secondary endpoint includes prostate tissue levels of inflammatory mediators (cytokines and proteins) at time of radical prostatectomy. Changes in blood levels of inflammatory mediators, relative to baseline levels, at time of radical prostatectomy and 12 months after radical prostatectomy will also be evaluated. Secondary endpoints also include important aspects of psychosocial functioning and quality of life such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive complaints and prostate cancer-specific quality of life domains. The changes in these outcomes, relative to baseline levels, will be evaluated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after radical prostatectomy.The results from this trial will provide crucial information to clarify the role of omega-3 supplementation on prostate cancer proliferation,  and quality of life.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .

The literature suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may be a key player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and it can modulate the synthesis of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Previous studies have shown that CYP1A1 is a key enzyme of oxidative stress, TNF-α is involved in the formation of  (IR), oxidative stress and  are the key factors for the formation of NAFLD. Therefore, it can be said that AHR may participate in contributing to NAFLD by regulating CYP1A1 and TNF-α. Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) is an effective AHR inhibitor. The present study was designed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of ANF in high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and  (OA)-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. Mice were fed HFD to induce NAFLD, HepG2 cells were exposed to OA to induce hepatocyte injury, and ANF significantly reduced mouse and cellular liver damage compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD and OA-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. ANF treatment reduces liver damage by reducing ROS and IR, the data show that ANF inhibits the expression of AHR, CYP1A1 and TNF-α in NAFLD. Taken together, these findings show that ANF alleviate NAFLD via regulation of AHR/CYP1A1 and AHR/TNF-α pathways, which may have potential for further development as novel therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Cumulative lines of evidence suggest that olive oil, used as primary source of fat by Mediterranean populations, may play a key role in the observed health benefits on NAFLD. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of the knowledge on the protective role of both major and minor components of olive oil on lipid metabolism during NAFLD. In particular, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the increase or decrease in hepatic lipid content are critically analyzed, taking into account that several studies have often provided different and/or conflicting results in animal models fed on olive oil-enriched diet. In addition, new findings that highlight the hypolipidemic and the antisteatotic actions of olive oil phenols are presented. As mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the targeting of these organelles with olive oil phenols as a powerful therapeutic approach is also discussed.© 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'metabolic syndrome', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108268>A Mixture of Atropisomers Enhances Neutral Lipid Degradation in Mammalian Cells with Autophagy Induction.</a></h2><p>Atropisomers with a biaryl dihydronaphthopyranone structure, dinapinones A1 (DPA1) (M position) and A2 (DPA2) (P position), were isolated from the fungus culture broth of Talaromyces pinophilus FKI-3864 as inhibitors of [C]neutral lipid ([C]triacylglycerol (TG) and [C]cholesteryl ester (CE)) synthesis from [C] in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells.

A potential key player in this process is the protein myoglobin (Mb). Indeed, there is a catalogue of empirical evidence supporting direct interaction of globins with fatty  metabolites; however, the binding pocket and regulation of the interaction remains to be established. In this study, we employed a computational strategy to elucidate the structural determinants of fatty acids (palmitic & ) binding to Mb. Sequence analysis and docking simulations with a horse (Equus caballus) structural Mb reference reveals a fatty -binding site in the hydrophobic cleft near the heme region in Mb. Both palmitic  and  attain a "U" shaped structure similar to their conformation in pockets of other fatty -binding proteins. Specifically, we found that the carboxyl head group of palmitic  coordinates with the amino group of Lys45, whereas the carboxyl group of  coordinates with both the amino groups of Lys45 and Lys63. The alkyl tails of both fatty acids are supported by surrounding hydrophobic residues Leu29, Leu32, Phe33, Phe43, Phe46, Val67, Val68 and Ile107. In the saturated palmitic , the hydrophobic tail moves freely and occasionally penetrates deeper inside the hydrophobic cleft, making additional contacts with Val28, Leu69, Leu72 and Ile111. Our simulations reveal a dynamic and stable binding pocket in which the  molecule and heme group in Mb are required for additional hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, these findings support a mechanism in which Mb acts as a muscle transporter for fatty  when it is in the oxygenated state and releases fatty  when Mb converts to deoxygenated state.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899441>Discovery of lipid biomarkers correlated with disease progression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) often results in recurrence or metastasis, and there are only a few clinically effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and personalized therapy.  changes have been widely studied using mass spectrometry (MS) of tissue lysates to identify novel biomarkers.

Optimal phenotypic flexibility, i.e., the ability to respond to a physiological challenge, is an essential indicator of health status. Therefore, health can be measured by applying a challenge test and monitoring the response of relevant phenotypic processes. In this study, we assessed the correlation of three fat-soluble vitamins, (i.e., vitamin A or retinol, vitamin D, two homologues of vitamin E) and four carotenoids (i.e., α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene), with characteristics of metabolic and inflammatory parameters at baseline and in response to a nutritional challenge test (NCT) in a group of 36 overweight and obese male subjects, using proteomics and metabolomics platforms. The phenotypic flexibility concept implies that health can be measured by the ability to adapt to a NCT, which may offer a more sensitive way to assess changes in health status of healthy subjects.Correlation analyses of results after overnight fasting revealed a rather evenly distributed network in a number of relatively strong correlations per micronutrient, with minor overlap between correlation profiles of each compound. Correlation analyses of challenge response profiles for metabolite and protein parameters with micronutrient status revealed a network that is more skewed towards α-carotene and γ-tocopherol suggesting a more prominent role for these micronutrients in the maintenance of phenotypic flexibility. Comparison of the networks revealed that there is merely overlap of two parameters (inositol and  (C18:1)) affirming that there is a specific biomarker response profile upon NCT.Our study shows that applying the challenge test concept is able to reveal previously unidentified correlations between specific micronutrients and health-related processes, with potential relevance for maintenance of health that were not observed by correlating homeostatic measurements. This approach will contribute to insights on the influence of micronutrients on health and help to create efficient micronutrient intervention programs.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31019064>Functional characterisation of two Δ12-desaturases demonstrates targeted production of linoleic  as pheromone precursor in .</a></h2><p>Insect pheromones are often derived from fatty  .

We compared the effects of the saturated FFA palmitate, the unsaturated FFA oleate, and a mixture of each on the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, mitochondrial function, apoptosis, and insulin-signaling pathway in skeletal muscle cells. Only palmitate caused a significant increase of mtROS production, which correlated with concomitant mtDNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, induction of JNK, apoptosis, and inhibition of insulin signaling. Blocking de novo synthesis of ceramide abolished the effects of palmitate on mtROS production, viability, and insulin signaling. Oleate alone did not cause mtROS generation and mtDNA damage, and its addition to palmitate prevented palmitate-induced mtDNA damage, increased total ATP levels and cell viability, and prevented palmitate-induced apoptosis and inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt (Ser(473)) phosphorylation. The peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) protein level and promoter activity were decreased at concentrations of palmitate ≥0.5 mM, whereas addition of oleate increased both PGC-1α level and promoter activity. Expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) was significantly diminished after palmitate but not oleate treatment. Addition of the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcystein (NAC), to palmitate restored both the expression and promoter activity of PGC-1α as well as TFAM expression. We propose that 1) mtROS generation is the initial event in the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent apoptosis and the inhibition of insulin signaling and that 2) oleate ameliorates palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and thus may contribute to the prevention of palmitate-induced IR.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514066>Lactobacillus gasseri in the Upper Small Intestine Impacts an ACSL3-Dependent Fatty -Sensing Pathway Regulating Whole-Body Glucose Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-dependent upper small intestinal lipid metabolism activates pre-absorptive pathways to regulate metabolic homeostasis, but whether changes in the upper small intestinal  alter specific fatty -dependent pathways to impact glucose homeostasis remains unknown.

On the long term, this may result in massive hepatic TAG accumulation called steatosis hepatitis. In hepatocytes, the poor water-soluble TAG is packed in specialized organelles: Lipid droplets (LDs) serving as transient cellular deposit and lipoproteins (LPs) transporting TAG and cholesterol esters to extra-hepatic tissues. The dynamics of these organelles is controlled by a variety of regulatory surface proteins (RSPs). Assembly and export of VLDLs are mainly regulated by the microsomal transfer protein (MTP) and apoprotein B100. Formation and lipolysis of LDs are regulated by several RSPs. The best studied regulators belong to the PAT (Perilipin/Adipophilin/TIP47) and CIDE families. Knockdown or overexpression of SRPs may significantly affect the total number and size distribution of LDs. Intriguingly, a large cell-to-cell heterogeneity with respect to the number and size of LDs has been found in various cell types including hepatocytes. These findings suggest that the extent of cellular lipid accumulation is determined not only by the imbalance between lipid supply and utilization but also by variations in the expression of RSPs and metabolic enzymes. To better understand the relative regulatory impact of individual processes involved in the cellular TAG turnover, we developed a comprehensive kinetic model encompassing the pathways of the   and triglyceride metabolism and the main molecular processes governing the dynamics of LDs. The model was parametrized such that a large number of experimental in vitro and in vivo findings are correctly recapitulated. A control analysis of the model revealed that variations in the activity of FFA uptake, diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 2, and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) have the strongest influence on the cellular TAG level. We used the model to simulate LD size distributions in human hepatoma cells and hepatocytes exposed to a challenge with FFAs. A random fold change by a factor of about two in the activity of RSPs was sufficient to reproduce the large diversity of droplet size distributions observed in individual cells. Under the premise that the same extent of variability of RSPs holds for the intact organ, our model predicts variations in the TAG content of individual hepatocytes by a factor of about 3-6 depending on the nutritional regime. Taken together, our modeling approach integrates numerous experimental findings on individual processes in the cellular TAG metabolism and LD dynamics metabolism to a consistent state-of-the-art dynamic network model that can be used to study how changes in the external conditions or systemic parameters will affect the TAG content of hepatocytes.© 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410667>Comparative effects of high  vs high mixed saturated fatty  obesogenic diets upon PUFA metabolism in mice.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence indicates that the fatty  composition of obesogenic diets influences physiologic outcomes. There are scant data regarding how the content of non-essential fatty acids like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) impact the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In this work, we tested the hypothesis that obesogenic diets enriched in  (OA; 18:1n-9) reduce polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels vs an obesogenic diet enriched in SFAs. Adult male mice were fed for eight weeks either (1) a control 16% fat energy (en) diet with 5.7% en OA and 4.4% en SFA, (2) a 50% fat en diet with 33% en OA and 9.9% en SFA, or (3) a 50% en diet with a high SFA diet with 33% en SFA and 9.1% en OA. Dietary levels and intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) and α-linolenic  (ALA; 18:3n-3) were constant between the experimental groups. Several peripheral organs (liver, heart, kidney, and adipose) were analyzed for lipid composition and oxylipin analysis was performed for liver and adipose. Our data demonstrate that a high OA diet reduced tissue content of LA and ALA (≥30%) in phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions, reduced the content of some LA-derived and ALA-derived oxylipins in liver and adipose, and conversely, elevated hepatic content of PGF. In all tissues examined, except for adipose, levels of arachidonic  (ARA; 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) were either elevated or unaffected by the obesogenic diets. Our data indicate that the non-essential fatty content of obesogenic diets impacts PUFA content in peripheral tissues and influences the levels of bioactive oxylipins.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29178411>Increased plasma oleoylethanolamide and palmitoleoylethanolamide levels correlate with inflammatory changes in alcohol binge drinkers: the case of HMGB1 in women.</a></h2><p>Alcohol binge drinking is a heavy pattern of alcohol consumption increasingly used by young people.

In the present study, we measured several biolipids that are fatty  derivatives belonging to the acylethanolamide or 2-acylglycerol families in the plasma of the same subjects (n = 42; 20 men and 22 women). We found that during abstinence, alcohol binge drinkers had elevated plasma levels of oleoylethanolamide, palmitoleoylethanolamide, arachidonoylethanolamide, dihomo-γ-linolenoyl ethanolamide and linoleoyl ethanolamide, which positively correlated with changes in the mRNA expression of key inflammatory markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as toll-like receptors (TLR4), pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Additionally, plasma oleoylethanolamide positively correlated with plasma levels of high mobility group box-1, which is a danger-associated molecular pattern and an endogenous TLR4 agonist, specifically in female alcohol binge drinkers. No changes were observed in 2-acylglycerols in alcohol binge drinkers, although sex-related differences in these bioactive lipids as well as in palmitoleoylethanolamide and docosatetraenoylethanolamide levels were detected.

Because of its unique dimeric structure, cardiolipin plays an important role in mitochondrial function, stability, and membrane fluidity. As such, cardiolipin is subject to a high degree of remodeling by phospholipases, acyltransferases, and transacylases that create a fatty acyl profile that tends to be highly tissue-specific. Despite this overarching regulation, the molecular species of cardiolipin produced are also influenced by dietary lipid composition. A number of studies have characterized the tissue-specific profile of cardiolipin species and have investigated the specific nature of cardiolipin remodeling, including the role of both enzymes and diet. The aim of this review is to highlight tissue specific differences in cardiolipin composition and, collectively, the enzymatic and dietary factors that contribute to these differences. Consequences of aberrant cardiolipin fatty acyl remodeling are also discussed.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Several intracellular events leading to NAFLD and progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () have been identified, including lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Emerging evidence links both hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and cholesterol (FC) accumulation in NAFLD development; in particular oxysterols, the oxidative products of cholesterol, may contribute to liver injury. We performed a targeted lipidomic analysis of oxysterols in the liver of male Wistar rats fed a high-fat (HF), high-cholesterol (HC) or high-fat/high-cholesterol (HF/HC) diet. Both HF and HC diets caused liver steatosis, but the HF/HC diet resulted in steatohepatitis with associated mitochondrial dysfunction. Above all, the oxysterol cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (triol) was particularly increased in the liver of rats fed diets rich in cholesterol. To verify the molecular mechanism involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatocellular toxicity, Huh7 and primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to palmitic  (PA) and/or  (OA), with or without triol. This compound induced apoptosis in cells co-exposed to both PA and OA, and this was associated with impaired mitochondrial respiration as well as down-regulation of PGC1-alpha, mTFA and NRF1.In conclusion, our data show that hepatic free fatty  or oxysterols accumulation per se induce low hepatocellular toxicity. On the contrary, hepatic accumulation of both fatty acids and toxic oxysterols such as triol are determinant in the impairment of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, contributing to liver pathology in NAFLD.Copyright © 2014.

Twenty-seven Iberian male pigs of 28 kg live weight (LW) were divided in 2 groups and fed with 1 of 2 isocaloric diets: a standard diet with carbohydrates as energy source (CH) and a diet enriched with high- sunflower oil (HO). Ham adipose tissue was sampled by biopsy at 44 and 70 kg LW. At 110 kg LW pigs were slaughtered and backfat, loin, and liver tissues were sampled. Animals of the HO group showed higher MUFA content and lower SFA in all the analyzed tissues (P < 0.001). These main effects were established early during the treatment and increased only slightly along time. Small diet effects were also detected on PUFA, which showed differences according to sampling time, tissue, and lipid fraction. Effects of diet on gene expression were explored with a combined approach analyzing adipose tissue transcriptome and quantifying the expression of a panel of key genes implicated in  and lipid metabolism processes in backfat, muscle, and liver. Backfat transcriptome showed small effects of diet on gene expression, in number and magnitude. According to the posterior probabilities (PP) of the probe-specific expression differences between dietary groups (PP < 0.01), 37 genes were considered differentially expressed (DE). Gene ontology allowed relating them with several biological functions including lipid metabolic processes. Quantitative PCR confirmed several DE genes in adipose tissue (RXRG, LEP, and ME1; P < 0.0001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.0001, respectively), but no DE gene was found in loin or liver tissues.

AMPK phosphorylation inhibits SREBP-1, a major transcription factor of de novo , by inhibiting the liver X receptor (LXR) or by direct phosphorylation. Resveratrol, a polyphenol, has regulatory effects on hepatic lipid metabolism as a potent AMPK activator. In this study, we evaluated the anti-steatogenic effects of resveratrol and its derivatives and identified the molecular mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Resveratrol and its derivatives decreased lipid accumulation by free fatty acids (FFA mixture; 0.5 mM, :palmitic  = 2: 1) in H4IIEC3 cells. Synthesized derivatives of resveratrol had lower cytotoxicity than the parental molecule with similar potency. SY-102 suppressed SREBP-1 maturation by T0901317, an LXR agonist, and decreased SRE luciferase activity and the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes. Inhibition of AMPK by pre-treatment with compound C completely blocked the effects of SY-102. To evaluate their efficacy in vivo, mice were fed a high-fat diet for 5 days, and resveratrol or SY-102 was administered orally for the last 2 days.

Lipid metabolic disturbance and oxidative stress have strong links to the development of NAFLD, while autophagy was generally accepted as a key regulatory mechanism on these steps. Our previous studies indicated that cherry anthocyanins (CACN) protected against high fat diet-induced  and NALFD in C57BL/6 mice, while the underlying molecule mechanism is still unclear. Thus, in this study, we show that CACN protect against - (OA-) induced oxidative stress and attenuate lipid droplet accumulation in NAFLD cell models. According to the results of a transmission electron microscope (TEM), western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), and adenovirus transfection (Ad-mCherry-GFP-LC3B), autophagy is in accordance with the lipid-lowering effect induced by CACN. Further studies illustrate that CACN may activate autophagy via mTOR pathways. In addition, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), was applied and the result suggested that autophagy indeed participates in the lipid clearance process in OA-induced lipid accumulation. All these results indicate that the positive effects of CACN on OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation are mediated via activating autophagy, showing a potential target for the therapeutic strategy of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'metabolism', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754711>10-oxo-12()-octadecenoic , a linoleic  metabolite produced by gut lactic  bacteria, enhances energy metabolism by activation of TRPV1.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota can regulate the host energy metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms that could involve gut microbiota-derived compounds remain to be understood.

The mechanism of the formation of  compounds from sterol esters was related to oxidation of steryl and   moieties. In particular, 2-methyl-3-pentanone and 5-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hepten-2-one were identified as unique degradation products formed from degradation of the steryl moiety specifically, and a mechanism of their formation was suggested. Both volatiles could be a good indicator of thermo-oxidative degradation of functional food products enriched in phytosterols and their esters.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our previous studies showed that a high high-saturated -fat diet induced greater bone loss in mice than a high high-unsaturated-fat diet due to increased osteoclast numbers and activity. The impact of elevated FA levels on osteoblasts is not yet clear. We induced  in 4 week old male mice using a palmitic  (PA)- or  (OA)-enriched high fat high-fat diet (HFD) (20 % of calories from FA), and compared them to mice on a normal (R) caloric diet (10 % of calories from FA). We collected serum to determine FA and bone metabolism marker levels. Primary osteoblasts were isolated; cultured in PA, OA, or control (C) medium; and assessed for mineralization activity, gene expression, and ceramide levels. Obese animals in the PA and OA groups had significantly lower serum levels of bone formation markers P1NP and OC compared to normal weight animals (*p < 0.001), with the lowest marker levels in animals on an PA-enriched HFD (*p < 0.001). Accordingly, elevated levels of PA significantly reduced osteoblast mineralization activity in vitro (*p < 0.05). Elevated PA intake significantly increased C16 ceramide accumulation. This accumulation was preventable through inhibition of SPT2 (serine palmitoyl transferase 2) using myriocin. Elevated levels of PA reduce osteoblast function in vitro and bone formation markers in vivo. Our findings suggest that saturated PA can compromise bone health by affecting osteoblasts, and identify a potential mechanism through which  promotes bone loss.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116430>Bamboo Leaf Flavonoids Extracts Alleviate Oxidative Stress in HepG2 Cells via Naturally Modulating Reactive  Species Production and Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Defense Responses.</a></h2><p>In this study, bamboo leaf flavonoids extracts (BFE) were employed to alleviate oxidative stress induced by  in HepG2 cells. Biochemical indexes, intracellular reactive  species production, lipid droplets accumulation, antioxidant enzymes production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined to show the alleviation performance of BFE intervention (P < 0.05). Importantly, the results of qRT-PCR and western blot determination indicated that BFE intervention upregulated the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 to initiate the antioxidant defense response for counteracting oxidative stress (P < 0.05). Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential-mediated apoptosis and FOXO signaling pathway initiation caused by BFE intervention may together contribute to oxidative stress alleviation in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, these findings suggested that BFE intervention upregulated related antioxidant defense responses for preventing cells from oxidative damage.

Moreover,  patients have elevated colonic arachidonic  (AA) proportions. So far, effects of dietary AA v. FO on colitis have never been examined. We therefore designed three isoenergetic diets, which were fed to mice for 6 weeks preceding and during 7 d dextran sodium sulfate colitis induction. The control diet was rich in  (OA). For the other two diets, 1.0 % (w/w) OA was exchanged for EPA+DHA (FO group) or AA. At 7 d after colitis induction, the AA group had gained weight (0.46 (sem 0.54) g), whereas the FO and OA groups had lost weight (- 0.98 (SEM 0.81) g and - 0.79 (SEM 1.05) g, respectively; P < 0.01 v.

Myeloperoxidase concentrations in plasma and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration in colon were decreased in the FO group as compared with the OA group. We conclude that in this mice model an AA-enriched diet increased colonic AA content, but did not result in more colonic inflammation as compared with FO- and OA-enriched diets. As we only examined effects after 7 d and because the time point for evaluating effects seems to be important, the present results should be regarded as preliminary.

The best-studied AEs are the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), the anti- compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the potent anorexigenic molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). AEs are biosynthesized in the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels may change in response to noxious stimuli, food deprivation or diet-induced obesity. The biological actions of AEs within the gut are not limited to the modulation of food intake and energy balance. For example, AEs exert potential beneficial effects in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, inflammation and cellular proliferation. Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA).

Recent studies have shown that P. gingivalis is related to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a global major chronic liver disease, especially in developed countries. However, how P. gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of NAFLD has not been fully clarified. We aimed to conduct a preliminary exploration of the underlying mechanism of P. gingivalis infection in the development of NAFLD.Human hepatocellular cells HepG2 were incubated with/without  (OA) and tested for lipid accumulation upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from P. gingivalis or Escherichia coli. Intracellular lipid droplet formation was analyzed and quantified by Oil Red O staining. The involvement of signaling pathway molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines related to NF-κB and MAPKs were examined with Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses and further evaluated with inhibitor treatment and RNA interference.HepG2 cells accumulated more intracellular lipids when stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, as compared to cells treated with E. coli LPS or control. Further pathway analysis demonstrated that after stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS, cells displayed significantly upregulated MyD88 expression, increased phosphorylation of p65 and JNK, and more release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-α. In addition, suppression of phosphorylation of p65 and JNK by inhibitors and RNA interference resulted in a reduction in lipid accumulation upon P. gingivalis LPS treatment.These results suggest that P. gingivalis-derived LPS may contribute to intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory reaction of HepG2 cells via the activation of NF-κB and JNK signaling . This study offers a possible explanation to the functional involvement of P. gingivalis infection in the pathological progression of NAFLD.

We studied the gene expression regulation of UCP1, -2, and -3 in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) from control and MetS rats treated with two doses of a commercial mixture of resveratrol (RSV) and quercetin (QRC). We found that UCP2 was the predominantly expressed isoform, UCP3 was present at very low levels, and UCP1 was undetectable. The treatment with RSV + QRC did not modify UCP3 levels; however, it significantly increased UCP2 mRNA in control and MetS rats in association with an increase in  and linoleic fatty acids.

The AMP-activated protein kinase regulates this process in mammalian cells, and its homolog Snf1, together with the transcription factors Adr1, Oaf1, and Pip2, regulates peroxisome proliferation and beta-oxidation in yeast. A constitutive allele of Adr1 (Adr1(c)) lacking the glucose- and Snf1-regulated phosphorylation substrate Ser-230 was found to be Snf1-independent for regulation of peroxisomal genes. In addition, it could compensate for and even suppress the requirement for Oaf1 or Pip2 for gene induction. Peroxisomal genes were found to be regulated by oleate in the presence of glucose, as long as Adr1(c) was expressed, suggesting that the Oaf1/Pip2 heterodimer is Snf1-independent. Consistent with this observation, Oaf1 binding to promoters in the presence of oleate was not reduced in a snf1Delta strain. Exploring the mechanism by which Adr1(c) permits Snf1-independent peroxisomal gene induction, we found that strength of promoter binding did not correlate with transcription, suggesting that stable binding is not a prerequisite for enhanced transcription. Instead, enhanced transcriptional activation and suppression of Oaf1, Pip2, and Snf1 by Adr1(c) may be related to the ability of Adr1(c) to suppress the requirement for and enhance the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators in a promoter- and growth medium-dependent manner.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28721615>Phycoremediation potential of marine microalga Tetraselmis indica on secondary treated domestic sewage for nutrient removal and biodiesel production.</a></h2><p>Marine microalga Tetraselmis indica (T. indica) was cultivated in secondary treated domestic sewage (STDS) in batch mode.

Given the reported benefits of cGMP signaling on the myocardium, we investigated the impact of its chronic activation on cardiac energy metabolism using mice overexpressing a constitutively active cytoplasmic guanylate cyclase (GC(+/0)) in cardiomyocytes. Ex vivo working GC(+/0) heart perfusions with (13)C-labeled substrates revealed an altered pattern of exogenous substrate fuel selection compared to controls, namely a 38+/-9% lower contribution of exogenous fatty acids to acetyl-CoA formation, while that of carbohydrates remains unchanged despite a two-fold increase in . The lower contribution of exogenous fatty acids to energy production is not associated with changes in energy demand or supply (contractile function, oxygen consumption, tissue acetyl-CoA or CoA levels, citric  cycle flux rate) or in the regulation of beta-oxidation (acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, tissue malonyl-CoA levels). However, GC(+/0) hearts show a two-fold increase in the incorporation of exogenous oleate into triglycerides. Furthermore, the following molecular data are consistent with a concomitant increase in triglyceride hydrolysis: (i) increased abundance of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) protein (24+/-11%) and mRNA (22+/-4%) as well as (ii) several phosphorylation events related to HSL inhibitory (AMPK) and activation (ERK 1/2) sites, which should contribute to enhance its activity. These changes in exogenous fatty  trafficking in GC(+/0) hearts appear to be functionally relevant, as demonstrated by their resistance to fasting-induced triglyceride accumulation. While the documented metabolic profile of GC(+/0) mouse hearts is partly reminiscent of hypertrophied hearts, the observed changes in lipid trafficking have not been previously documented, and may be part of the molecular mechanism underlying the benefits of cGMP signaling on the myocardium.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108815>Pre-fermentative supplementation of fatty acids alters the  activity of wine yeasts.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids play important roles in the maintenance of cell membrane, viability and overall  of wine yeasts (particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae) during adverse winemaking conditions.

However, very little is known about how other commonly found fatty acids in grape juice modulate the growth and  of S. cerevisiae. We aimed to determine the individual effect of five fatty acids on fermentation patterns and  of two wine yeast strains (S. cerevisiae EC1118 and X5). Microvinification was performed at 15 °C by supplementing a grape juice (individually) with three different concentrations of saturated (palmitic ), unsaturated (, linoleic and γ-linolenic acids) and short-chain (hexanoic ) fatty acids. Metabolite profiles of the resulting wines were determined using Gas-chromatography coupled to Mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Our data show that the addition of γ-linolenic  to the juice caused the production of higher amounts of amino and organic acids (except isoleucine and 2-oxoglutaric ) in wines when fermented by EC1118, while palmitic  supplementation showed similar trends when fermented by X5. The effect of linoleic  was independent of yeast strains and we observed a global reduction of amino and organic acids (except pyruvic ) while increased production of most of the fatty acids other than the supplemented ones. Our data clearly suggest that pre-fermentative supplementation of different fatty acids indeed influenced the growth and  of wine yeasts in a different way. Thus, attention needs to be paid not only to the wine yeast strain used during the winemaking but also to the overall grape juice composition, including fatty acids, to obtain the desired wine characteristics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a key enzyme for , is overexpressed in various types of cancer and plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, it has been studied as a candidate target for cancer therapy. In this study, we demonstrate the pharmacological properties of T-3764518, a novel and orally available small molecule inhibitor of SCD1. T-3764518 inhibited stearoyl-CoA desaturase-catalyzed conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleoyl-CoA in colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells and their growth. Further, it slowed tumor growth in an HCT-116 and a mesothelioma MSTO-211H mouse xenograft model. Comprehensive lipidomic analyses revealed that T-3764518 increases the membrane ratio of saturated: unsaturated fatty acids in various lipid species such as phosphatidylcholines and diacylglycerols in both cultured cells and HCT-116 xenografts. Treatment-associated lipidomic changes were followed by activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses such as increased immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein expression in HCT-116 cells. These T-3764518-induced changes led to an increase in cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a marker of apoptosis.

Mice were fed non-obesogenic doses of palm or olive oil and hepatocytes were treated with palmitate and oleate. Mice fed non-obesogenic doses of palm oil showed increased signaling towards fatty  synthesis, while olive oil increased signaling towards fatty  oxidation. Low doses of palmitate and oleate were sufficient to alter circadian rhythms, due to changes in the expression and/or activity of key  proteins. Palmitate, but not oleate, counteracted the reduction in lipid accumulation and BMAL1-induced expression of mitochondrial genes involved in fatty  oxidation. Palmitate was also found to interfere with the transcriptional activity of CLOCK:BMAL1 by preventing BMAL1 deacetylation and activation. In addition, palmitate, but not oleate, reduced PER2-mediated transcriptional activation and increased REV-ERBα-mediated transcriptional inhibition of Bmal1. The inhibition of PER2-mediated transcriptional activation by palmitate was achieved by interfering with PER2 nuclear translocation. Indeed, PER2 reduced fat accumulation in hepatocytes and this reduction was prevented by palmitate. Herein, we show that the detrimental  alteration seen with high doses of palmitate manifests itself early on even with non-obesogenic levels. This is achieved by modulating BMAL1 at several levels abrogating its activity and expression.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29042439>A genome-wide screen in  reveals that ubiquinone is a key antioxidant for metabolism of long-chain fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are used as a rich source of metabolic energy by several bacteria including important pathogens. Because LCFAs also induce oxidative stress, which may be detrimental to bacterial growth, it is imperative to understand the strategies employed by bacteria to counteract such stresses. Here, we performed a genetic screen in  on the LCFA, oleate, and compared our results with published genome-wide screens of multiple non-fermentable carbon sources. This large-scale analysis revealed that among components of the aerobic electron transport chain (ETC), only genes involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, an electron carrier in the ETC, are highly required for growth in LCFAs when compared with other carbon sources. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that this increased requirement of ubiquinone is to mitigate elevated levels of reactive  species generated by LCFA degradation. Intriguingly, we find that unlike other ETC components whose requirement for growth is inversely correlated with the energy yield of non-fermentable carbon sources, the requirement of ubiquinone correlates with oxidative stress. Our results therefore suggest that a mechanism in addition to the known electron carrier function of ubiquinone is required to explain its antioxidant role in LCFA metabolism. Importantly, among the various oxidative stress combat players in , ubiquinone acts as the cell's first line of defense against LCFA-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, our results emphasize that ubiquinone is a key antioxidant during LCFA metabolism and therefore provides a rationale for investigating its role in LCFA-utilizing pathogenic bacteria.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9230925>Intake of olive oil can modulate the transbilayer movement of human erythrocyte membrane cholesterol.</a></h2><p>Transbilayer movement of erythrocyte membrane cholesterol is impaired in patients affected with essential hypertension. This is an inherited disorder, but environmental factors are also involved. Dietary fats might play a role in the prevention and/or treatment of such abnormality in the kinetic pools of membrane cholesterol. We tested this hypothesis by using a diet (in which 30% of the energy came from fat) rich in olive oil or in high- sunflower oil (as natural sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFAs) and determining their influence on the movement of cholesterol into the lipid bilayer of the erythrocyte membrane after a four-week period. We concluded that dietary olive oil is helpful in normalizing the impaired transbilayer movement of membrane cholesterol in erythrocytes of eight normocholesterolaemic and eight hypercholesterolaemic hypertensive patients. However, the effects cannot be attributed exclusively to the content of MUFAs (mainly ) in the diet, as high- sunflower oil was unable to induce favourable changes.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727313>Apolipoprotein E isoforms 3/3 and 3/4 differentially interact with circulating stearic, palmitic, and  fatty acids and lipid levels in Alaskan Natives.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes in Alaskan Natives have been related to the increase of cardiovascular disease and  in the last decades. Variation of the apolipoprotein E (Apo E) genotype may contribute to the diverse response to diet in lipid metabolism and influence the association between fatty acids in plasma and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the interaction between Apo E isoforms and plasma fatty acids, influencing phenotypes related to  diseases in Alaskan Natives. A sample of 427 adult Siberian Yupik Alaskan Natives was included. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, Apo A1, and Apo B plasma concentrations were measured using reference methods. Concentrations of 13 fatty acids in fasting plasma were analyzed by gas chromatography, and Apo E variants were identified. Analyses of covariance were conducted to identify Apo E isoform and fatty  main effects and multiplicative interactions. The means for body mass index and age were 26 ± 5.2 and 47 ± 1.5, respectively. Significant main effects were observed for variation in Apo E and different fatty acids influencing Apo B levels, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Significant interactions were found between Apo E isoform and selected fatty acids influencing total cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo B concentrations. In summary, Apo E3/3 and 3/4 isoforms had significant interactions with circulating levels of stearic, palmitic,  fatty acids, and phenotypes of lipid metabolism in Alaskan Natives.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This change in FA metabolism is associated with overexpression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which catalyses the transformation of SFAs into MUFAs (e.g., ). In this study, we provide new evidence that SCD1 inhibition leads to the anti-proliferation effect of breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and migration prevention. However, the antitumor effect of the SCD1 inhibitor can be reversed by exogenous . We hypothesize that, in addition to de novo synthesis, cancer cells may uptake exogenous FAs actively. CD36, also known as FA translocase (FAT), that functions as a transmembrane protein and mediates the uptake of FAs, is observed to be highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, the anti-proliferation effect caused by the SCD1 inhibitor can not be reversed by exogenous  supplementation in CD36 knockdown breast cancer cells. Our study revealed that the lipid metabolism of breast cancer is regulated not only by de novo  but also by the availability of lipids outside cancer cells.

In addition, the effect of lipid class (triolein (TRI) and l-3-phosphatidylcholine-1,2-di-oleoyl (PC)), carbon number and degree of saturation of the labelled NEFA, stearic  (SA),  (OA) and DHA) was tested. FA absorption was determined by tube feeding [1-14C]-labelled lipids and NEFA after a single meal of either non-enriched Artemia (NEA) or Artemia enriched on a soyabean oil emulsion (EA), or after feeding these diets over an extended period of time (18 d). The tested dietary protein:lipid ratios had no short-term influence but long-term feeding of a diet higher in neutral lipid (EA) increased lipid accumulation within the gut epithelium and resulted in lower FA absorption (higher label evacuation and lower retention of dietary FA), which may partially explain the trend for lower growth observed with this diet. The lipids and NEFA, showed different digestive and metabolic properties, independent of feeding regime. FA absorption increased with unsaturation, being lowest for SA, followed by OA, and highest for DHA. In addition, sole larvae had a lower capacity to digest and absorb FA esterified to TRI, compared with PC, with the order of decreasing absorption being NEFA>PC>>TRI. Moreover, larvae appeared to discriminate between the source of OA, as this FA in the free form or esterified to PC was catabolised less than TRI.</p><p>Keyword:['gut epithelium']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20832268>Sida rhomboidea.Roxb extract alleviates pathophysiological changes in experimental in vivo and in vitro models of high fat diet/fatty  induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>The present study was aim to evaluate protective role of Sida rhomboidea.Roxb (SR) extract against high fat diet/fatty  induced pathophysiological alterations in experimental model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Also, the effect of SR supplementation on lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, cytotoxicity and cell viability were evaluated in  treated HepG2 cells. Supplementation of NASH mice with SR extract prevented high fat diet induced elevation in plasma marker enzymes of liver damage, plasma and hepatic lipids, mitochondrial oxidative stress and compromised enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant status. Further, addition of SR extract to in vitro HepG2 cells minimized  induced lipid accumulation, higher lipid peroxidation, cytotoxicity and reduced cell viability.

The compositions of fatty acids (FAs) in the accumulated lipids in tissues of obese animals may have important roles in the process and mechanisms related to the onset of metabolic disorders. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a high fat (HF) diet, which contained a higher proportion of saturated FAs, on FA metabolism and distribution in obese cats. Cats (N = 12) were divided into control diet group (crude fat; 16.0 %) (n = 4) or a high fat (HF) diet group (crude fat; 23.9 %) (n = 8). The HF diet contained up to 60 % of calories from fat and was rich in stearic . Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the feeding. Adipose and liver tissues were collected at the 6(th) week after feeding. We performed analysis of histological findings and fatty  composition in serum and tissues.Body weights of the cats significantly increased in the HF group. The increased activities of hepatic enzymes and the accumulation of lipid droplets were found in hepatocytes in the HF group at the 6(th) week after feeding. In this study, the stearic  (C18:0)-rich HF diet contained less  (C18:1n-9) and more linoleic  (C18:2n-6) than the control. However, the composition of  in the liver was higher, and those of stearic  and linoleic  were lower in the HF group at the 6(th) week after feeding. The higher :stearic  ratio suggests an increase in the conversion from saturated FA to mono-unsaturated FAs, which may reflect the hepatic storage of FAs as a relatively harmless form.The stearic -rich HF diet increased hepatic lipid accumulation accompanied by the increased of hepatic , increased serum  and activation of hepatic enzymes. These findings could be an important sign of early stages of dyslipidemia and hepatic damage. Also, the higher :stearic  ratio might be related to the increased activity of SCD-1, which suggests that the stearic -rich HF diet evoked hepatic  in the feline liver.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20888904>Chronic hyperglycemia reduces substrate oxidation and impairs metabolic switching of human myotubes.</a></h2><p>Skeletal muscle of insulin resistant individuals is characterized by lower fasting lipid oxidation and reduced ability to switch between lipid and glucose oxidation. The purpose of the present study was to examine if chronic hyperglycemia would impair metabolic switching of myotubes. Human myotubes were treated with or without chronic hyperglycemia (20mmol/l glucose for 4 days), and metabolism of [(14)C] (OA) and [(14)C]glucose was studied. Myotubes exposed to chronic hyperglycemia showed a significantly reduced OA uptake and oxidation to CO(2), whereas -soluble metabolites were increased compared to normoglycemic cells (5.5mmol/l glucose). Glucose suppressibility, the ability of acute glucose (5mmol/l) to suppress lipid oxidation, was 50% in normoglycemic cells and reduced to 21% by hyperglycemia. Adaptability, the capacity to increase lipid oxidation with increasing fatty  availability, was not affected by hyperglycemia. Glucose uptake and oxidation were reduced by about 40% after hyperglycemia, and oxidation of glucose in presence of mitochondrial uncouplers showed that net and maximal oxidative capacities were significantly reduced. Hyperglycemia also abolished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, ATP concentration was reduced by 25% after hyperglycemia. However, none of the measured mitochondrial genes were downregulated nor was mitochondrial DNA content. Microarray and real-time RT-PCR showed that no genes were significantly regulated by chronic hyperglycemia. Addition of chronic lactate reduced both glucose and OA oxidation to the same extent as hyperglycemia. In conclusion, chronic hyperglycemia reduced substrate oxidation in skeletal muscle cells and impaired metabolic switching. The effect is most likely due to an induced mitochondrial dysfunction.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by a deficit in IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to tryptophan catabolites. The presence and correlates of IgM isotype antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), nitroso (NO), and nitro (NO) adducts in schizophrenia remain unknown. This study measured IgM antibodies to malondialdehyde (MDA), azelaic , phosphatidylinositol, , NO-tryptophan, NO-albumin, NO-cysteinyl, and NO-tyrosine in a sample of 80 schizophrenia patients, divided into those with and those without deficit schizophrenia, and 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly lower IgM antibody levels to all OSEs as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia and controls. Lowered IgM antibodies to MDA coupled with increased IgM levels to NO-cysteinyl and NO-tyrosine strongly predict deficit schizophrenia versus non-deficit schizophrenia with an area under the ROC curve of 0.913. A large part of the variance (21.2-42.2%) in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and excitation is explained by IgM antibody titers to MDA (inversely) and NO-cysteinyl and/or NO-tyrosine (both positively). Lower IgM antibodies to MDA are significantly associated with impairments in episodic memory including direct and delayed recall. These findings further indicate that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by lower natural IgM antibody levels to OSEs and relative increments in nitrosylation and nitration of proteins. It is concluded that deficits in natural IgM attenuate CIRS functions and that this impairment may drive negative symptoms and impairments in episodic memory and thus deficit schizophrenia.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363221>AMPK-dependent modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by nesfatin-1.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism by which peripheral nesfatin-1 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism. Continuous peripheral infusion of nesfatin-1 reduced adiposity and plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol. In mice fed high fat diet, peripheral nesfatin-1 significantly decreased hepatic steatosis measured by triglyceride content and oil red staining area and diameter. These alterations were associated with a significant reduction in -related transcriptional factors PPARγ and SREBP1, as well as rate-limited enzyme genes such as acaca, fasn, gpam, dgat1 and dgat2. In primary hepatocytes, nesfatin-1 inhibited both basal and  stimulated triglyceride accumulation, which was accompanied by a decrement in -related genes and an increase in β-oxidation-related genes. In cultured hepatocytes, nesfatin-1 increased levels of AMPK phosphorylation. Inhibition of AMPK by compound C blocked the reduction of triglyceride content elicited by nesfatin-1.

The glycolytic flux, estimated at 18 mM-glucose by [6-3H]-glucose detritiation and apparent production of lactate and pyruvate, is decreased by oleate. The measurement of glycolytic intermediates shows a cross-over at the phosphofructokinase level, which might result from an increased citrate concentration. All those effects are dependent on oleate oxidation in mitochondria, since they are suppressed by 1 microM-2-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)pentyl]oxiran-2-carboxylate (POCA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial entry of oleate, but not of its uptake by hepatocytes. The decrease of lactate and pyruvate also results from an oleate-induced enhancement of pyruvate utilization by hepatocytes, as shown by the increase of 14CO2 formation from [1-14C]- and [3-14C]-pyruvate, especially at low (0.4 mM) pyruvate concentration. Those oleate effects are also suppressed by POCA. They might be due to an enhanced flux through pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, as a result of an oleate-induced increase in the mitochondrial concentrations of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Thus oleate oxidation inhibits production of lactate and pyruvate in fed-rat hepatocytes, as it does in other tissues. But, in the liver, it also enhances the mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate.

This may be related to FFA-induced elevation of oxidative stress in endothelial cells. We hypothesized that, in addition to mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-mediated reactive oxygen species production contributes to  (OA)-induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells, due to eNOS uncoupling. We measured reactive oxygen species production and eNOS activity in cultured endothelial cells (bEnd.3) in the presence of OA bound to bovine serum albumin, using the CM-H2DCFDA assay and the L-arginine/citrulline conversion assay, respectively. OA induced a concentration-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species production, which was inhibited by the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA). OA had little effect on eNOS activity when stimulated by a calcium-ionophore, but decreased both basal and insulin-induced eNOS activity, which was restored by TTFA. Pretreatment of bEnd.3 cells with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) prevented OA-induced reactive oxygen species production and restored inhibition of eNOS activity by OA. Elevation of OA levels leads to both impairment in receptor-mediated stimulation of eNOS and to production of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species and hence endothelial dysfunction.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) plays key role in glucose metabolism via regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, we demonstrated a novel of PDK4 in NASH by regulating hepatic steatosis and insulin signaling pathway in methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH model. Hepatic PDK4 levels were highly induced in human patients with NASH and MCD diet fed mice, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . The glucose and lipid metabolism were impaired in Pdk4 mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis significantly in NASH mice. Pdk4-MCD mice had reduced liver weights and triglyceride (TG) levels.

Numerous genes participate in regulating the biosynthesis and accumulation of the storage lipids in seeds or other reservoir organs, among which several transcription factors, such as  (), , and  (), involved in embryo development also control the lipid reservoir in seeds. In this study, the  gene was transferred into the peanut genome and expressed in a seed-specific manner driven by the NapinA full-length promoter or its truncated 230-bp promoter. Four homozygous transgenic lines, two lines with the longer promoter and the other two with the truncated one, were selected for further analysis. The  mRNA level and the corresponding protein accumulation in different transgenic overexpression lines were altered, and the transgenic plants grew and developed normally without any detrimental effects on major agronomic traits. In the developing seeds of transgenic peanuts, the mRNA levels of a series of genes were upregulated. These genes are associated with fatty  (FA) biosynthesis and lipid accumulation. The former set of genes included the homomeric ACCase A (), the BC subunit of heteromeric ACCase (), ketoacyl-ACP synthetase (), and stearoyl-ACP desaturase (), while the latter ones were the diacylglycerol acyltransferases and oleosins (, and ). The oil content and seed  increased by 4.42-15.89% and 11.1-22.2%, respectively, and the levels of major FA components including stearic , , and linoleic  changed significantly in all different lines.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29372783>[Analysis on metabolites with small molecule of serum in bone marrow suppression model mice with metabolomics method].</a></h2><p>Bone marrow suppression is a common symptom in patients with malignant tumor after chemotherapy. Studying the changes of metabolites caused by bone marrow depression can provide insights for the diagnosis of bone marrow suppression disease and for the development of drug therapy. Male BalB/C mice were injected with cyclophosphamide to establish a bone marrow suppression model. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with fingerprinting was used to analyze the normal and model mice blood metabolites. Principal component analysis and orthogonal to partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on metabolomics for data multidimensional statistical analysis was also used. Compared to the normal group in terms of the metabolic profile of bone marrow suppression mice, there were 15 endogenous metabolites in mouse plasma, nine of which were statistically significantly different, including glucose-1-phosphate, 4-nitrophenol, acetanilide, cortisone, nicotinamide, loganin, caffeic , linoleic  and  (<0.05). These results indicate that metabolite can be used as an important marker in bone marrow suppression, which can help to reveal the pathogenesis of bone marrow suppression induced by chemotherapy and determine the disease development stage and the effectiveness of follow-up treatment.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247738>Fatty -Binding Protein 5 Mediates the Uptake of Fatty Acids, but not Drugs, Into Human Brain Endothelial Cells.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the involvement of fatty -binding protein 5 (FABP5), a lipid-binding protein expressed at the blood-brain  (BBB), in fatty  and drug uptake into human brain endothelial cells. Following transfection with siRNA against hFABP5, human brain endothelial cell (hCMEC/D3) uptake of lipophilic ligands with varying affinity to FABP5 was assessed with intracellular concentrations quantified by liquid scintillation counting, HPLC, or LCMS/MS. The in situ BBB transport of [H]-diazepam was also assessed in wild type and FABP5-deficient mice. hFABP5 siRNA reduced FABP5 expression in hCMEC/D3 cells by 39.9 ± 3.8% (mRNA) and 38.8 ± 6.6% (protein; mean ± SEM), leading to a reduction in uptake of [C]-lauric , [H]-, and [C]-stearic  by 37.5 ± 8.8%, 41.7 ± 11.6%, and 50.7 ± 13.6%, respectively, over 1 min. No significant changes in [C]-diazepam, pioglitazone, and troglitazone uptake were detected following FABP5 knockdown in hCMEC/D3 cells. Similarly, no difference in BBB transport of [H]-diazepam was observed between wild type and FABP5-deficient mice. Therefore, although FABP5 facilitates brain endothelial cell uptake of fatty acids, it has limited effects on brain endothelial cell uptake and BBB transport of drugs with lower affinity for FABP5.Crown Copyright © 2018.

Since impairment of neurogenesis and dendritic maturation are very likely key determinants of intellectual disability in DS, interventions targeted to these defects may translate into a behavioral benefit. While most of the neurogenesis enhancers tested so far in DS mouse models may pose some caveats due to possible side effects, substances naturally present in the human diet may be regarded as therapeutic tools with a high translational impact. Linoleic  and  are major constituents of corn oil that positively affect neurogenesis and neuron maturation. Based on these premises, the goal of the current study was to establish whether treatment with corn oil improves hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory in the Ts65Dn model of DS. Four-month-old Ts65Dn and euploid mice were treated with saline or corn oil for 30 days. Evaluation of behavior at the end of treatment showed that Ts65Dn mice treated with corn oil underwent a large improvement in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Evaluation of neurogenesis and dendritogenesis showed that in treated Ts65Dn mice the number of new granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and their dendritic pattern became similar to those of euploid mice. In addition, treated Ts65Dn mice underwent an increase in  and brain . This study shows for the first time that fatty acids have a positive impact on the brain of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. These results suggest that a diet that is rich in fatty acids may exert beneficial effects on cognitive performance in individuals with DS without causing adverse effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As the most abundant FFA in the bloodstream,  (OA) has the ability to induce adipogenic differentiation in human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs). Recently, p62, an autophagy mediator, has been shown to play a role in  and adipose tissue metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the roles of autophagy and mitochondrial function at different stages of OA (in combination with insulin and dexamethasone)-induced adipogenesis in hADSCs.The hADSCs were incubated with OA, insulin, and dexamethasone after pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors or knockdown of p62 with shRNA. The adiposeness level was then analyzed by oil red O staining in the cells. The related proteins or mRNA levels were detected by western blot analysis or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Treatment with 80 μM OA (substituted for isobutylmethylxantine; IBMX) for 10 days successfully induced hADSCs to adipocytes. During OA-induced adipogenesis, autophagy was induced, with an increased LC3II/I ratio on day 3 and a decreased protein level of p62 on and after day 3. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3MA) at the early stage (day 0 to day 3) of differentiation, but not at the middle or late stage, significantly decreased OA-induced adipogenesis; while knockdown of p62 with shRNA significantly promoted adipogenesis in hADSCs. Moreover, the copy number of mtDNA (the ND1 gene) and the protein level of TOM20, a mitochondrial membrane protein, were increased following OA treatment, which was related to the stability of mitochondria. Interestingly, knockdown of p62 increased the mito-LC3II/I and cyto-LC3II/I ratios by 110.1% and 73.3%, respectively. The increase in the ratio of mito-LC3II/I was higher than that of cyto-LC3II/I. Furthermore, p62 knockdown-enhanced adipogenesis in hADSCs was abolished by inhibiting mitophagy with cyclosporine A.These results suggested that p62 plays a protective role in adipogenesis of hADSCs through regulating mitophagy.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'mitochondria', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26810160>Conversion of Cn-Unsaturated into Cn-2-Saturated LCFA Can Occur Uncoupled from Methanogenesis in Anaerobic Bioreactors.</a></h2><p>Fat, oils, and grease present in complex wastewater can be readily converted to methane, but the energy potential of these compounds is not always recyclable, due to incomplete degradation of long chain fatty acids (LCFA) released during lipids hydrolysis. Oleate (C18:1) is generally the dominant LCFA in lipid-containing wastewater, and its conversion in anaerobic bioreactors results in palmitate (C16:0) accumulation. The reason why oleate is continuously converted to palmitate without further degradation via β-oxidation is still unknown. In this work, the influence of methanogenic activity in the initial conversion steps of unsaturated LCFA was studied in 10 bioreactors continuously operated with saturated or unsaturated C16- and C18-LCFA, in the presence or absence of the methanogenic inhibitor bromoethanesulfonate (BrES). Saturated Cn-2-LCFA accumulated both in the presence and absence of BrES during the degradation of unsaturated Cn-LCFA, and represented more than 50% of total LCFA. In the presence of BrES further conversion of saturated intermediates did not proceed, not even when prolonged batch incubation was applied. As the initial steps of unsaturated LCFA degradation proceed uncoupled from methanogenesis, accumulation of saturated LCFA can be expected. Analysis of the active microbial communities suggests a role for facultative anaerobic bacteria in the initial steps of unsaturated LCFA biodegradation. Understanding this role is now imperative to optimize methane production from LCFA.</p><p>Keyword:['microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085382>Variant Amino  Residues Alter the Enzyme Activity of Peanut Type 2 Diacylglycerol Acyltransferases.</a></h2><p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final step in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis via the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of diacylglycerol. This reaction is a major control point in the Kennedy pathway for biosynthesis of TAG, which is the most important form of stored metabolic  in most oil-producing plants. In this study, Arachis hypogaea type 2 DGAT (AhDGAT2) genes were cloned from the peanut cultivar 'Luhua 14.' Sequence analysis of 11 different peanut cultivars revealed a gene family of 8 peanut DGAT2 genes (designated AhDGAT2a-h). Sequence alignments revealed 21 nucleotide differences between the eight ORFs, but only six differences result in changes to the predicted amino  (AA) sequences. A representative full-length cDNA clone (AhDGAT2a) was characterized in detail. The biochemical effects of altering the AhDGAT2a sequence to include single variable AA residues were tested by mutagenesis and functional complementation assays in transgenic yeast systems. All six mutant variants retained enzyme activity and produced lipid droplets in vivo. The N6D and A26P mutants also displayed increased enzyme activity and/or total cellular fatty  (FA) content. N6D mutant mainly increased the content of palmitoleic , and A26P mutant mainly increased the content of palmitic . The A26P mutant grew well both in the presence of  and C18:2, but the other mutants grew better in the presence of C18:2. AhDGAT2 is expressed in all peanut organs analyzed, with high transcript levels in leaves and flowers. These levels are comparable to that found in immature seeds, where DGAT2 expression is most abundant in other plants. Over-expression of AhDGAT2a in tobacco substantially increased the FA content of transformed tobacco seeds. Expression of AhDGAT2a also altered transcription levels of endogenous tobacco lipid metabolic genes in transgenic tobacco, apparently creating a larger carbon 'sink' that supports increased FA levels.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340105>Asiatic  from Potentilla chinensis alleviates non-alcoholic fatty liver by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is induced by accumulation of misfolded proteins, playing a pivotal role during the processes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study was to investigate the effect of Asiatic  from Potentilla chinensis (AAPC) on liver cell lipid metabolism, exploring the underlying mechanism of AAPC against NAFLD. In vivo, the animal NAFLD model was induced by feeding rats with high fat diet (HFD) for 18 weeks, and meanwhile the rats were treated with AAPC from weeks 8 to 18; In vitro experiment, the effect of AAPC on dyslipidemia induced by  (OA) in hepatic cells (HepG2) was evaluated. The results showed that AAPC significantly decreased lipidosis in rats and in HepG2 cells; it notably alleviated hepatocyte damage and lipid disturbance in rats. Moreover, the cell experiments showed that AAPC strongly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation. It markedly decreased hepatocyte  by regulating the key lipid metabolism-related factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), encoding carboxylase, liver X Receptor Rα (LXRα), fatty  synthase (FAS), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The further study elucidated that AAPC treatment significantly alleviated inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, AAPC significantly alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis and lipid metabolism disorder through reducing the extent of ERS. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that AAPC significantly ameliorates NAFLD by inhibiting the ERS pathway and lipid deposition, which may be a potential natural medicine for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The anti-hyperlipidemia effect was studied in a rat model of acute hyperlipidemia, which was induced by triton WR-1339. A new compound, integrinol (), together with nine known compounds, namely chamazulene (), acetylenes (E)-2 (), acetylenes (E)-3 (), eugenol (), palmitic  (),  (), linoleic  (), linolenic  () and 12,13-epoxylinolenic  were isolated from the crude lipophilic extract of A. integrifolia. The LD50 value of the crude extract was more than 4g/kg. In Triton WR-1339-induced acute hyperlipidemia model, the crude lipophilic extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) by 70% ( ≤ 0.01) and triglycerides (TGs) by 94% ( ≤ 0.001). The fractioned compounds, such as chamazulene (1), acetylene-2 (2), and linolenic  (9), used at 4 mg/kg dose, also significantly decreased the concentrations of TC (32%, 33% and 64%, respectively) and TGs (48%, 33% and 93%, respectively).

However, a high fat diet has been shown to reduce the density of L-cells in the mouse intestine and a positive correlation has been indicated between L-cell number and GLP-1 secretion.

In the present study, we sought to determine how long-term exposure to saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids, by direct effects on GLP-1-producing cells, alter function and viability, and the underlying mechanisms.GLP-1-secreting GLUTag cells were cultured in the presence/absence of saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids (0.125 mM for 48 h, followed by analyses of viability and apoptosis, as well as involvement of fatty  oxidation, free fatty  receptors (FFAR1) and ceramide synthesis. In addition, effects on the expression of proglucagon, prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), free fatty  receptors (FFAR1, FFAR3), sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT) and subsequent secretory response were determined.Saturated (16:0) and unsaturated (18:1) fatty acids exerted opposing effects on the induction of apoptosis (1.4-fold increase in DNA fragmentation by palmitate and a 0.5-fold reduction by oleate; p<0.01). Palmitate-induced apoptosis was associated with increased ceramide content and co-incubation with Fumonisin B1 abolished this lipo apoptosis. Oleate, on the other hand, reduced ceramide content, and-unlike palmitate-upregulated FFAR1 and FFAR3, evoking a 2-fold increase in FFAR1-mediated GLP-1 secretion following acute exposure to 0.125 mmol/L palmitate; (p<0.05).Saturated (16:0), but not unsaturated (18:1), fatty acids induce ceramide-mediated apoptosis of GLP-1-producing cells.

These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it.

Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in  and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver , liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

Thirty-two Nellore bull male were distributed in a completely randomized design and fed diets with condensed tannin extract as follows: 0, 10, 30, and 50 g/kg total DM basis. The physicochemical composition of the meat, lipid oxidation, fatty  profile, flavor, tenderness, and overall acceptance were evaluated. There was a linear decrease (P ≤ 0.05) on lipid content, tenderness, cooking  loss, myristic, palmitic, and  acids in meat as tannin increased in the diets. The total saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the atherogenicity index decreased. However, a linear increase (P ≤ 0.05) was observed for linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acids. The physicochemical characteristic of the meat, such as moisture, ash, and protein contents, water retention capacity, final pH, Warner-Bratzler shear force, collagen, and color indexes (lightness, redness, yellowness, and chrome) did not change with dietary tannin. Also, CLA, n-6:n-3 ratio, Δ -desaturase, and elongase activity were not different among diets. In conclusion, condensed tannin linearly increases unsaturated fatty acids and decreases the atherogenicity index of meat; thus, it can be recommended at the highest level (50 g/kg DM) in the diet of Nellore steers.Agriculture byproducts plays an important part in the diet of ruminant animals and consequently on food chain and has implications for the composition and quality of the livestock products (milk, meat, and eggs) that people consume. Feeding tannin to steers increases the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and meat tenderness, with a concomitant reduction on saturated fatty acids and the atherogenicity index in meat. Thus, we recommend adding tannin to steer diets to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in red meat for human consumption.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27299526>Influence of  on Rumen Fermentation and   Formation In Vitro.</a></h2><p>A series of batch cultures were conducted to investigate the effects of  (OA) on in vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (IVDMD), gas production, methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) production, and proportion of  .

Isocaloric, isonitrogenous PN was administered continuously for 5 days. FO was provided at a dose of 0.09-0.22 g/kg . Measurements included biochemical parameters and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score daily and plasma total phospholipid fatty acids (FAs) and cytokine levels on days 1, 3, 6. Days on mechanical ventilation, length of stay and mortality were also recorded. ANOVA was used to compare response variables between the two groups over the time and Pearson correlation was used to measure relationships between continuous variables.68 patients completed the study (n = 35 SG, n = 33 CG), with male predominance (66% SG, 56% CG). Average age was 60.8 ± 13.9 years (SG) versus 55.7 ± 14.8 (CG) (p = 0.143). The majority were surgical admissions (85% SG versus 91% CG) followed by medical. Plasma phospholipid  (p = 0.022) and alpha-linolenic  (p<0.0005) increased in both groups. In the SG, plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA increased (both p<0.001), whereas the omega-6:omega-3 PUFA (n-6:n-3 PUFA) ratio decreased (p < 0.001). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin decreased in both treatment groups. Considering only the change from day 1 to day 6 there was a bigger decrease in AST, ALT and bilirubin levels in the SG. Concentrations of TNF-α decreased from day 1 to day 6 in the SG, whereas they increased in the CG, but the change was not statistically significant (p = 0.112). A significant negative correlation was found between EPA provision on day 3 and the SOFA score (r = -0.4047, p = 0.018). Days on mechanical ventilation (1.24 ± 0.83 days in SG versus 0.88 ± 1.63 days in CG, p = 0.385) and ICU LOS (9.5 ± 7.09 days in SG versus 10.7 ± 7.6 days in CG, p = 0.490) were not different between groups.PN containing a four-oil LE increased plasma EPA and DHA, decreased n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio, and was safe and well tolerated. The negative relationship between day 3 EPA and SOFA score seems promising, but EPA intake and effects may have been diluted by enteral nutrition which was started in more than half of patients on day 4. There was no significant difference in terms of other biochemical measurements, SOFA score, length of ICU stay and mortality. More research is needed in this patient population, particularly regarding dose, duration and timing of FO and the effects on clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2018.

In DSSCs, the triiodide reduction at the surface of TiO is one of the detrimental processes that limit the realization of high efficiencies of the device. To alleviate the active sites available on the semiconductor surface for this detrimental process, the interfacial modification of the dye-adsorbed TiO|electrolyte interface has been attempted by coadsorption of  (OA) over the TiO surface. Thus, the modified cell exhibited a higher efficiency (η) of 12.9% under one sun illumination when compared with that of the unmodified cell (η = 11.1%). To provide an insight into the OA anchoring and dynamics of electron transport at the photoanode|electrolyte interface, molecular spectroscopic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses were carried out. A red shift in the optical absorption spectrum was observed after the addition of OA to dye-adsorbed TiO. The binding of OA to TiO surface was found to be through bridging bidentate type. Mott-Schottky analyses of the DSSCs under dark conditions were made to probe the shift in the Fermi level of TiO upon OA modification. In addition, the Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) has been found between OA and N719 dye.

If the  of the SC is disrupted, the  to molecular transit may be greatly reduced. Cutaneous absorption can be increased by removal of the SC by tape-stripping or dermabrasion, by vehicle (solvent-carrier) optimization, or by the use of penetration enhancers like DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide), , and alcohols (2,3). An electric field can also be used to enhance delivery. Disruption of the SC can be achieved by electroporation, which is the creation of penetration sites by an electric pulse. Ions and molecules move through induced gaps of the SC by diffusion and electromotive or electroosmotic transport (4-6). Electroporation differs from iontophoresis, in which there is an increased migration of ions or charged molecules through the skin when an electrical potential gradient is applied.

Here, we investigated the potential mechanisms of cordycepin-induced AMPK activation in HepG2 cells. Treatment with cordycepin largely reduced  (OA)-elicited intracellular lipid accumulation and increased AMPK activity in a dose-dependent manner. Cordycepin-induced AMPK activation was not accompanied by changes in either the intracellular levels of AMP or the AMP/ATP ratio, nor was it influenced by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) inhibition; however, this activation was significantly suppressed by liver kinase B1 (LKB1) knockdown. Molecular docking, fluorescent and circular dichroism measurements showed that cordycepin interacted with the γ1 subunit of AMPK. Knockdown of AMPKγ1 by siRNA substantially abolished the effects of cordycepin on AMPK activation and lipid regulation. The modulating effects of cordycepin on the mRNA levels of key lipid regulatory genes were also largely reversed when AMPKγ1 expression was inhibited.

The further study showed that exposure to excess OLA led to an increase in the levels of reactive  species (ROS) and thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS), and a decline in the quantity of reduced glutathione (GSH) in both the wild type and mutant strains. However, the antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were increased in the wild type and elo1△ strains, while they were significantly decreased in the mutants of elo2△ and elo3△ after treated with excess OLA. Thus, oxidative damage mainly contributed to the cell death induced by OLA in ole2△ and ole3△. Taken together, although disruption of ELO2 or ELO3 did not affect the cellular lipid unsaturation, they altered the distribution and propotion of cellular VLCFAs, leading to the cell membrane impairment, which augmented the ability of OLA to permeabilize the plasma membrane. The data suggest that the very long-chain fatty acids elongases ELO2 and ELO3 play important roles in lipotoxic cell death induced by OLA through maintaining a balanced FA composition in plasma membrane.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The pathogenic fungi Fusarium and Colletotrichum and their formae speciales (f. spp.) infect many types of crops with severe consequences and Fusarium oxysporum can also induce keratitis and allergic conditions in humans. These fungi code for homologues of dioxygenase-cytochrome P450 (DOX-CYP) fusion proteins of the animal heme peroxidase (cyclooxygenase) superfamily.

The former oxidized  and linoleic acids in analogy with 7,8-linoleate diol synthases (LDSs), but with the additional biosynthesis of 8,11-dihydroxylinoleic . The latter metabolized fatty acids to hydroperoxides with broad substrate specificity. It oxidized 20:4n-6 and 18:2n-6 to hydroperoxides with an R configuration at the (n-10) positions, and other n-6 fatty acids in the same way. [11S-(2)H]18:2n-6 was oxidized with retention and [11R-(2)H]18:2n-6 with loss of deuterium, suggesting suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and  insertion. Fatty acids of the n-3 series were oxidized less efficiently and often to hydroperoxides with an R configuration at both (n-10) and (n-7) positions. The enzyme spans 1426 amino acids with about 825 residues in the N-terminal domain with DOX homology and 600 residues at the C-terminal domain without homology to other enzymes.

Ninety fish (average : 41.84 ± 0.07 g) were randomly fed a control diet (6% fat) or a high-fat diet (11% fat) for 9 weeks. The growth performance and feed utilization efficiency were evaluated at the end of the trial. The liver samples of both groups were harvested for molecular analysis and histological evaluation. Compared to the Control group, the high-fat diet group showed no effects on either growth performance or energy intake in blunt snout bream. However, high-fat diet resulted in a massive accumulation of lipid and pathological structural alternations, and disrupted expression of lipid transport-related genes and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of the fish. In vitro, after exposure of the isolated primary hepatocytes from blunt snout bream to , the cells showed increased intracellular TG accumulation, decreased VLDL secretion, which was attributed to altered expression levels of lipid transport-related genes through the activated IRE1/XBP1 signaling. The -induced detrimental effects were alleviated by co-incubating the cells with an IER1 inhibitor, 4μ8c. In conclusion, high-fat diet could lead to aberrant lipid secretion by activating the ER stress-associated IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Inhibiting the activity of IRE1 represents a promising target to rescue the side-effects of high-fat diet on the liver function of blunt snout bream.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results revealed that if celecoxib was administered in the early stage of AKT/c-Met-induced HCC, it resulted in disease stabilization. Moreover, celecoxib could alleviate lipid accumulation in the HCC mice and in an -induced in vitro hepatic steatosis model. Further evidence at the molecular level indicated that celecoxib down-regulated the expression of phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the HCC mice. In addition, celecoxib efficiently repressed the phosphor-Akt (Thr308)/  synthase (FASN) axis both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, this study suggests that celecoxib exerts its antilipogenic efficacy by targeting a COX-2/AKT/FASN cascade, which contributes to its ability to delay hepatocarcinogenesis.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404365>Effect of 12 Weeks High  Peanut Consumption on Cardio- Risk Factors and Body Composition.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological evidence indicates an inverse association between nut consumption and obesity, inflammation, hyperlipidaemia and glucose intolerance. We investigated effects of high  peanut consumption vs. a nut free diet on adiposity and cardio- risk markers. In a randomised cross-over design, 61 healthy subjects (65 ± 7 years, body mass index (BMI) 31 ± 4 kg/m²) alternated either high  peanuts (15%-20% of energy) or a nut free diet for 12 weeks. Body composition and mass, waist circumference, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipids, glucose and insulin were assessed at baseline and after each phase. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the two diets. Consistent with other nut studies, there were no differences in lipids, CRP, glucose and insulin with peanut consumption. In contrast, some reports have demonstrated benefits, likely due to differences in the study cohort. Energy intake was 10% higher (853 kJ, p < 0.05), following peanut consumption vs. control, attributed to a 30% increase in fat intake (p < 0.001), predominantly monounsaturated (increase 22 g, p < 0.05). Despite greater energy intake during the peanut phase, there were no differences in body composition, and less than predicted increase (0.5 kg) in body weight for this additional energy intake, possibly due to incomplete nutrient absorption and energy utilisation.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8710688>Effects of repeated boluses of sucrose on proliferation and on AOM-induced aberrant crypt foci in rat .</a></h2><p> mucosal proliferation, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) induction, and fecal bile acids, parameters connected to the risk of  development, were studied in female F344 rats treated with starch or sucrose boluses or with a sucrose diet. Cell proliferation was higher in animals treated with a single sucrose bolus than in those given a starch bolus (15 g/kg body wt), with 4.3 +/- 0.64 and 2.17 +/- 0.57 (SE) mitotic figures (MF) per crypt in the sucrose and starch bolus groups, respectively (p < 0.01). When azoxymethane (AOM, 20 mg/kg) was administered 24 hours after a single sucrose or starch bolus, the number of ACF per  after 30 days was higher in the sucrose bolus group [107.5 +/- 9.5 (SE)] than in the starch bolus group (67.8 +/- 0.9, p < 0.01). In additional experiments,  cell proliferation (MF/crypt) was higher in rats given boluses of sucrose three times per week for 40 days after AOM (20 mg/kg) [5.9 +/- 0.7 (SE)] than in rats given starch boluses (2.96 +/- 0.4) or fed sucrose continuously (3.6 +/- 0.5). On the contrary, after 40 days of dietary treatment, the number, dimension, and percentage of ACF secreting sulfomucins and sialomucins were not varied among these three groups. However, the percentage of "large ACF" (ACF with > or = 4 crypts) secreting sialomucins or predominantly sialomucins was higher (p < 0.05) in the sucrose bolus group than in the starch group. The concentration of fecal bile acids and long-chain fatty acids was the same in the sucrose and starch groups, but the concentrations of deoxycholic and  were significantly higher in the sucrose bolus group.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that acute inhibition of the oxPPP reduces oxidative stress and enhances function and metabolism of the failing heart, in vivo. In 10 chronically instrumented dogs, congestive heart failure (HF) was induced by high-frequency cardiac pacing. Myocardial glucose consumption was enhanced by raising arterial glycemia to levels mimicking postprandial peaks, before and after intravenous administration of the oxPPP inhibitor 6-aminonicotinamide (80 mg/kg). Myocardial energy substrate metabolism was measured with radiolabeled glucose and , and cardiac 8-isoprostane output was used as an index of oxidative stress. A group of five chronically instrumented, normal dogs served as control. In HF, raising glycemic levels from ∼ 80 to ∼ 170 mg/dL increased cardiac isoprostane output by approximately twofold, whereas oxPPP inhibition normalized oxidative stress and enhanced cardiac oxygen consumption, glucose oxidation, and stroke work. In normal hearts glucose infusion did not induce significant changes in cardiac oxidative stress. Myocardial tissue concentration of 6P-gluconate, an intermediate metabolite of the oxPPP, was significantly reduced by ∼ 50% in treated versus nontreated failing hearts, supporting the inhibitory effect of 6-aminonicotinamide. Our study indicates an important contribution of the oxPPP activity to cardiac oxidative stress in HF, which is particularly pronounced during common physiological changes such as postprandial glycemic peaks.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362303>Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with concentrations of four plasma phospholipid fatty acids in the de novo  pathway: results from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND- Palmitic  (16:0), stearic  (18:0), palmitoleic  (16:1n-7), and  (18:1n-9) are major saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids that affect cellular signaling and metabolic pathways. They are synthesized via de novo  and are the main saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet. Levels of these fatty acids have been linked to diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS- Genome-wide association studies were conducted in 5 population-based cohorts comprising 8961 participants of European ancestry to investigate the association of common genetic variation with plasma levels of these 4 fatty acids. We identified polymorphisms in 7 novel loci associated with circulating levels of ≥1 of these fatty acids. ALG14 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 14 homolog) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:0 (P=2.7×10(-11)) and lower 18:0 (P=2.2×10(-18)). FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7 (P=6.6×10(-13)) and 18:1n-9 (P=2.2×10(-32)) and lower 18:0 (P=1.3×10(-20)). LPGAT1 (lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase) polymorphisms were associated with lower 18:0 (P=2.8×10(-9)). GCKR (glucokinase regulator; P=9.8×10(-10)) and HIF1AN (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1; P=5.7×10(-9)) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7, whereas PKD2L1 (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1; P=5.7×10(-15)) and a locus on chromosome 2 (not near known genes) were associated with lower 16:1n-7 (P=4.1×10(-8)). CONCLUSIONS- Our findings provide novel evidence that common variations in genes with diverse functions, including protein-glycosylation, polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism, phospholipid modeling, and glucose- and oxygen-sensing pathways, are associated with circulating levels of 4 fatty acids in the de novo  pathway. These results expand our knowledge of genetic factors relevant to de novo  and fatty  biology.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28575756>Dietary fatty acids modulate adipocyte TNFa production via regulation of its DNA promoter methylation levels.</a></h2><p>The factors regulating TNF alpha (TNFa) levels could be considered therapeutic targets against  development. DNA methylation is a potent regulator of gene expression and may be associated with protein levels. In this study we investigate whether the effect of dietary fatty acids on TNFa released from adipocytes might be associated with modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation status. A group of rats was assigned to three diets with a different composition of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Samples of visceral adipose tissues were taken for adipocyte isolation, in which released TNFa levels were measured, and for methylation and expression studies. In addition, 3 T3-L1 cells were treated with palmitic,  and linoleic acids, with and without 5-Azacitydine (5-AZA). After treatments, cells and supernatants were included in the same analyses as rat samples. TNFa promoter methylation levels, gene expression and secretion were different according to the diets and fatty  treatments associated with them. Cells treated with 5-AZA displayed higher TNFa levels than in the absence of 5-AZA, without differences between fatty acids. According to our results, dietary fatty  regulation of adipocyte TNFa levels may be mediated by epigenetic modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as lipid sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study  induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal barrier using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal lipid absorption. This model was validated using  (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal barrier. Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to 5 μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers.  including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to  TG accumulation in adipocytes.

Here, we suggest that PLIN2 mediates Wnt signaling because PLIN2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppresses activation of Wnt/coreceptor pathways. The mediation in the Wnt/Frizzled pathway seems to occur from Dishevelleds to axin/glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK3)/β-catenin complexes (AGβC) as Wnt decreases Dishevelled/PLIN2 but increases AGβC/PLIN2 associations. Augmenting cellular LSDs that affect PLIN2 associations with these proteins,  (OA) treatment inhibits Wnt-increased AGβC/PLIN2 associations and β-catenin T-cell factor signaling (β-CTS). Revealing that PLIN2 is a GSK3-associated protein, the study explored PLIN2-mediated effects on GSK3/GSK3 substrates. PLIN2 siRNA reduces inhibitory GSK3 levels and lithium chloride (LiCl)-upregulated β-catenin or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (c/EBPα) expression. OA treatment decreases LiCl-increased c/EBPα via PLIN2-c/EBPα dissociation. In addition to PLIN2 overexpression increasing β-CTS, PLIN2 depletion or overexpression drops or adds expression of GSK3 substrates, such as β-catenin, c/EBPα,c-Myc, cyclin D1, and insulin receptor substrate 1, and cell growth/survival. PLIN2 N or C terminus overexpression that is associated with higher levels of the substrates suggests that those substrates bind to specific regions of PLIN2. Mimicking the possible high lipid concentrations in cells in the human body under conditions of /obesity, OA-treated cells gain or reduce GSK3 substrate expression in parallel with a decrease (a Wnt-like effect) or increase in GSK3 activity, likely regulated by GSK3/PLIN2/GSK3 substrate associations.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The aim of this study is to explore the effect of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) on serum cholesterol levels and their mechanism of action. Hyperlipemia, as a model of abnormal lipid hypermetabolism, was established by using a high fat diet in C57BL/6J mice. Forty eight mice with dyslipidemia were randomly divided into 4 groups, 12 mice per group, including the control group, the 2% caprylic  (C8:0)-treated group, 2% capric  (C10:0)-treated group, and 2%  (C18:1)-treated group. All mice were fed with a high fat diet. After 16 weeks, the mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The mouse portal vein blood, the liver and the start site of the ileum (1 cm) were collected. The body weight of the mice and blood lipid profiles were measured. Gene transcription and the expression level associated with bile  metabolism in the liver and small intestine were determined by real-time PCR and the western blotting method. The concentrations of bile  metabolites in bile and feces were analysed. After 16 weeks of treatment, the concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the caprylic  group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, CYP7A1, CYP27A1 and ABCG8 in the caprylic  and capric  groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the liver (P < 0.05), however the transcription and expression level of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the caprylic , capric  and  groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the small intestine (P < 0.05).

Although its toxicity has been thoroughly studied at high concentrations, there is still insufficient knowledge on possible alterations of cell function at subtoxic concentrations, which are in fact more representative concentrations of intoxication scenarios. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics approach was used to investigate the metabolic changes in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) exposed to two subtoxic concentrations of MDMA (LC and LC) for 24 h. Metabolomic profiling of both intracellular metabolites and volatile metabolites in the extracellular medium of PMH was performed. Multivariate analysis showed that the metabolic pattern of cells exposed to MDMA discriminates from the controls in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to LC MDMA induces a significant increase in some intracellular metabolites, including  and palmitic , and a decrease in glutamate, aspartate, 5-oxoproline, fumarate, malate, phosphoric , α-ketoglutarate and citrate. Extracellular metabolites such as acetophenone, formaldehyde, pivalic , glyoxal and 2-butanone were found significantly increased after exposure to MDMA, compared to controls, whereas 4-methylheptane, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, nonanal, among others, were found significantly decreased. The panel of discriminatory metabolites is mainly involved in tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle,   metabolism, glutamate metabolism, antioxidant defenses and possibly changes in the  enzyme machinery.

At Rest, DCM patients showed a reduced nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) myocardial uptake, while glucose utilization increased only in DCM-AGT. In response to Pacing, glucose uptake promptly rose in N-AGT (from 72 ± 21 to 234 ± 73 nmol/min/g, p < 0.05), did not change in DCM-AGT, and slowly increased in DCM-NGT. DCM-AGT sustained the extra workload by increasing NEFA oxidation (from 1.3 ± 0.2 to 2.9 ± 0.1 μmol/min/gO2 equivalents, p < 0.05), while DCM-NGT showed a delayed increase in glucose uptake.

In this work, we design, synthesize, and characterize mono-disperse, dumbbell-shaped lanthanide-doped NaYF@NaGdF core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs) with dual-mode fluorescence by coating the NaGdF:Ln' shell onto NaYF:Ln core nanospheres via a two-step  mediated thermal decomposition process. Different from the conventional synthesis method to produce spherical nanoparticles, the epitaxial growth of the NaGdF:Ln' shell onto the nanosphere cores and the lattice mismatch between β-NaGdF and β-NaYF nanocrystals enable the formation of dumbbell-shaped CSNPs, as evidenced by the morphological evolution of CSNPs and as explained by the Ostwald ripening growth mechanism. By tailoring different doped lanthanide ions in the core and the shell, the resultant CSNPs exhibit tunable but different up-/down-conversion luminescence under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser and 254 nm UV light, respectively. Finally, these hydrophilic CSNPs are further fabricated into environmentally benign luminescent inks for inkjet printing to create a variety of dual-mode fluorescent patterns (peacock, temple, and a logo of "Hunan University of Technology") on different paper-based substrates (A4 paper, envelope, and postcard).

Twenty-four mid-lactation multiparous Holstein cows were used in a split-plot Latin square design. Cows were allocated to a main plot receiving either a basal diet with soyhulls (SH, n = 12) or a basal diet with whole cottonseed (CS, n = 12) that was fed throughout the experiment. Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treatments was used in 4 consecutive 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) control (CON; no supplemental fat), (2) high C16:0 supplement [PA; fatty  (FA) supplement blend provided ∼80% C16:0], (3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; FA supplement blend provided ∼40% C16:0 + ∼40% C18:0), and (4) C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; FA supplement blend provided ∼45% C16:0 + ∼35% cis-9 C18:1). Interactions between basal diets and FA treatments were observed for dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield. Among the SH diets, PA and PA+SA increased DMI compared with CON and PA+OA treatments, whereas in the CS diets PA+OA decreased DMI compared with CON. The PA, PA+SA, and PA+OA treatments increased milk yield compared with CON in the SH diets. The CS diets increased milk fat yield compared with the SH diets due to the greater yield of de novo and preformed milk FA. The PA treatment increased milk fat yield compared with CON, PA+SA, and PA+OA due to the greater yield of mixed-source (16-carbon) milk FA. The PA treatment increased 3.5% fat-corrected milk compared with CON and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA and PA+OA. The CS diets increased  (BW) change compared with the SH diets. Additionally, PA+OA tended to increase BW change compared with CON and PA and increased it in comparison with PA+SA. The PA and PA+OA treatments increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with PA+SA and tended to increase them compared with CON. The PA+SA treatment reduced 16-carbon, 18-carbon, and total FA digestibility compared with the other treatments. The CS diets increased energy partitioning toward  reserves compared with the SH diets. The PA treatment increased energy partitioning toward milk compared with CON and PA+OA and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA. In contrast, PA+OA increased energy partitioned to  reserves compared with PA and PA+SA and tended to increase it compared with CON. In conclusion, milk yield responses to different combinations of FA were affected by the addition of whole cottonseed in the diet. Among the combinations of C16:0, C18:0, and cis-9 C18:1 evaluated, fat supplements with more C16:0 increased energy output in milk, whereas fat supplements with more cis-9 C18:1 increased energy storage in BW. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced nutrient digestibility, which most likely explains the lower performance observed compared with other treatments.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

OPA-induced increases in the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were down-regulated by C-646, a p300/CBP-specific inhibitor. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between HAT activity and lipid accumulation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.604) using 22 NExs.Our results suggest that NExs have novel applications as nutraceutical agents with HAT inhibitor activity for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26767323>Older adults have an altered chylomicron response to a high-fat meal.</a></h2><p>Ageing is associated with a prolonged and exaggerated postprandial lipaemia. This study aimed to examine the contribution of alterations in chylomicron synthesis, size and lipid composition to increased lipaemia. Healthy older (60-75 years; n 15) and younger (20-25 years; n 15) subjects consumed a high-fat breakfast. Chylomicron dynamics and fatty  composition were analysed for 5 h in the postprandial state. Plasma TAG levels were elevated following the meal in the older subjects, relative to younger subjects (P<0·01). For older subjects compared with younger subjects, circulating chylomicron particle size was smaller (P<0·05), with greater apoB content (P<0·05) at all postprandial time points. However, total chylomicron TAG concentration between the groups was unaltered post-meal. Compared with younger subjects, the older subjects exhibited a greater proportion of  in the TAG and phospholipid (PL) fraction (P<0·05), plus lower proportions of linoleic  in the TAG fraction of the chylomicrons (P<0·01). Thus, following the ingestion of a high-fat meal, older individuals demonstrate both smaller, more numerous chylomicrons, with a greater total MUFA and lower PUFA contents. These data suggest that the increased postprandial lipaemia of ageing cannot be attributed to increased chylomicron TAG. Rather, ageing is associated with changes in chylomicron particle size, apoB content and fatty  composition of the chylomicron TAG and PL fractions.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236740>Untargeted metabolomic analysis of coronary artery disease patients with diastolic dysfunction show disturbed oxidative pathway.</a></h2><p>Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with prevalence estimates of 34% and constitutes a predictor of all-cause mortality.

Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) can inhibit feeding and stimulate lipolysis by activating peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-α (PPARα) in white adipose tissue (WAT). Here we explore whether PPARα activation potentiates the effect of β3-adrenergic stimulation on energy balance mediated by the respective agonists OEA and CL316243. The effect of this pharmacological association on feeding, thermogenesis, β-oxidation, and lipid and cholesterol metabolism in epididymal (e)WAT was monitored. CL316243 (1 mg/kg) and OEA (5 mg/kg) co-administration over 6 days enhanced the reduction of both food intake and body weight gain, increased the energy expenditure and reduced the respiratory quotient (VCO2/VO2). This negative energy balance agreed with decreased fat mass and increased BAT weight and temperature, as well as with lowered plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, nonessential fatty acids (NEFAs), and the adipokines leptin and TNF-α. Regarding eWAT, CL316243 and OEA treatment elevated levels of the thermogenic factors PPARα and UCP1, reduced p38-MAPK phosphorylation, and promoted brown-like features in the white adipocytes: the mitochondrial (Cox4i1, Cox4i2) and BAT (Fgf21, Prdm16) genes were overexpressed in eWAT. The enhancement of the fatty- β-oxidation factors Cpt1b and Acox1 in eWAT was accompanied by an upregulation of de novo lipogenesis and reduced expression of the unsaturated-fatty--synthesis enzyme gene, Scd1. We propose that the combination of β-adrenergic and PPARα receptor agonists promotes therapeutic adipocyte remodelling in eWAT, and therefore has a potential clinical utility in the treatment of obesity.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987128>Capsaicin Targets Lipogenesis in HepG2 Cells Through AMPK Activation, AKT Inhibition and PPARs Regulation.</a></h2><p>, a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), represents a serious primary health problem worldwide.

In contrast, monounsaturated free fatty acids (e.g. oleate) prevent the toxic effect of SFFAs in various types of cells. The mechanism is poorly understood and involvement of the mTOR complex is untested. In the present study, we demonstrate that oleate preconditioning, as well as coincubation, completely prevented palmitate-induced markers of inflammatory signaling,  and cytotoxicity in C2C12 myotubes. We then examined the effect of palmitate and/or oleate on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal path and whether their link is mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Palmitate decreased the phosphorylation of raptor and 4E-BP1 while increasing the phosphorylation of p70S6K. Palmitate also inhibited phosphorylation of AMPK, but did not change the phosphorylated levels of mTOR or rictor. Oleate completely prevented the palmitate-induced dysregulation of mTOR components and restored pAMPK whereas alone it produced no signaling changes. To understand this more, we show activation of AMPK by metformin also prevented palmitate-induced changes in the phosphorylations of raptor and p70S6K, confirming that the mTORC1/p70S6K signaling pathway is responsive to AMPK activity. By contrast, inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation by Compound C worsened palmitate-induced changes and correspondingly blocked the protective effect of oleate. Finally, metformin modestly attenuated palmitate-induced  and cytotoxicity, as did oleate. Our findings indicate that palmitate activates mTORC1/p70S6K signaling by AMPK inhibition and phosphorylation of raptor. Oleate reverses these effects through a metformin-like facilitation of AMPK.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Indeed, NMR experiments have shown that the saturated fatty  (FA) palmitate (PA) can interact with myoglobin (Mb) in its ligated state (MbCO and MbCN) but does not interact with Mb in its deoxygenated state. The observation has led to the hypothesis that Mb can also serve as a fatty  transporter. The present study further investigates fatty  interaction with the physiological states of Mb using the more soluble but unsaturated fatty ,  (OA). OA binds to MbCO but does not bind to deoxy Mb. OA binding to Mb, however, does not alter its O affinity. Without any Mb, muscle has a significantly lower level of triglyceride (TG). In Mb knock-out (MbKO) mice, both heart and skeletal muscles have lower level of TG relative to the control mice. Training further decreases the relative TG in the MbKO skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, the absence of Mb and lower TG level in muscle does not impair the MbKO mouse performance as evidenced by voluntary wheel running measurements.

Mitochondrial content and function were measured by live imaging and determination of citrate synthase activity, respectively. Protein expression was assessed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting.High-frequency, acute EPS increased deoxyglucose uptake and lactate production, while cell contents of both ATP and PCr decreased. Chronic, low-frequency EPS increased oxidative capacity of cultured myotubes by increasing glucose metabolism (uptake and oxidation) and complete fatty  oxidation. mRNA expression level of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 4 (PDK4) was significantly increased in EPS-treated cells, while mRNA expressions of interleukin 6 (IL-6), cytochrome C and carnitin palmitoyl transferase b (CPT1b) also tended to increase.

Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2L mice) have increased circulating free fatty acids (FAs), dramatically increased hepatic CD36 expression and profound fatty liver. To investigate the role of elevated CD36 in the development of fatty liver, we studied two models of hepatic steatosis, a genetic model (JAK2L mice) and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis model. We deleted Cd36 specifically in hepatocytes of JAK2L mice to generate double knockouts and from wild-type mice to generate CD36L single-knockout mice. Hepatic Cd36 disruption in JAK2L livers significantly improved steatosis by lowering triglyceride, diacylglycerol, and cholesterol ester content. The largest differences in liver triglycerides were in species comprised of  (C18:1). Reduction in liver lipids correlated with an improvement in the inflammatory markers that were elevated in JAK2L mice, namely aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase.

However, the role of CD38 in HFD-induced heart injury remains unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the effects and mechanisms of CD38 deficiency on HFD-induced heart injury.The metabolites in heart from wild type (WT) and CD38 knockout (CD38-/-) mice were examined using metabolomics analysis. Cell viability, lactate hydrogenase (LDH) release, super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reactive  species (ROS) production, triglyceride concentration and gene expression were examined by biochemical analysis and QPCR.Our results revealed that CD38 deficiency significantly elevated the intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration and GSH/GSSG ratio, decreased the contents of free fatty acids and increased intracellular NAD+ level in heart from CD38-/- mice fed with HFD. In addition, in vitro knockdown of CD38 significantly attenuated OA-induced cellular injury, ROS production and lipid synthesis. Furthermore, the expression of mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3 as well as its target genes FOXO3 and SOD2 were markedly upregulated in the H9C2 cell lines after OA stimulation. In contrast, the expressions of NOX2 and NOX4 were significantly decreased in the cells after OA stimulation.Our results demonstrated that CD38 deficiency protected heart from HFD-induced oxidative stress via activating Sirt3/FOXO3-mediated anti-oxidative stress pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg ) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , , linoleic , squalene, and arachidonic , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><p>Keyword:['NASH', 'barrier function', 'dysbiosis', 'inflammation', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002411>Mulberry extract inhibits -induced lipid accumulation via reduction of lipogenesis and promotion of hepatic lipid clearance.</a></h2><p>Mulberries are a traditional edible food used to treat hepatic disease. The anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effects of mulberry water extracts (MWE) have attracted increasing interest. In the present study, MWE were assessed for their hepatic lipid-lowering potential when administered in fatty  overload conditions in HepG2 cells.We found that MWE significantly reduced lipid accumulation, suppressed fatty  synthesis, and stimulated fatty  oxidation. Furthermore, MWE also inhibited acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase activities by stimulating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). MWE attenuated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its target molecules, such as fatty  synthase. Similar results were also measured in the expressions of enzymes involved in triglyceride and cholesterol biosyntheses including glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and SREBP-2. In contrast, the lipolytic enzyme expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 were increased.Our study suggests that the hypolipidemic effects of MWE occur via phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition of lipid biosynthesis.

Explants were treated with stable isotope-labeled palmitic  (13C-PA),  (13C-OA), or docosahexaenoic  (13C-DHA) for 3, 24, or 48 hours. Stable isotope-labeled lipids synthesized by placental explants from labeled FA were quantified, alongside endogenous unlabeled placental lipids, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Labeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and phosphatidylethanolamines were detected in explants, whereas labeled lysophosphatidylcholines were found in both explants and conditioned media. 13C-PA was primarily directed into PC synthesis (74% of 13C-PA-labeled lipids), whereas 13C-OA was directed almost equally into PC and TAG synthesis (45% and 53%, respectively, of 13C-OA-labeled lipids). 13C-DHA was only detectable in TAGs. TAGs demonstrated the highest isotopic enrichment for all 13C-FAs with 13C-OA-TAGs comprising >50% of total OA-TAGs (unlabeled and labeled), consistent with TAGs being a labile and accessible reservoir for FA storage. Variations in lipid incorporation were correlated to maternal glycemia and body mass index, suggesting that this experimental model could be used to investigate the effect of maternal factors on placental lipid . We conclude that lipid  partitioning of freshly imported FAs into labile and less labile lipid reservoirs in placenta is FA dependent.

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether almond consumption would alter the serum FA profile and risk of CHD, as calculated using Framingham's 10-year risk score, in a dose-dependent manner in hyperlipidaemic individuals when compared with a higher-carbohydrate control group using dietary interventions incorporating almonds. A total of twenty-seven hyperlipidaemic individuals consumed three isoenergetic (mean 1770 kJ/d) supplements during three 1-month dietary phases: (1) full-dose almonds (50-100 g/d); (2) half-dose almonds with half-dose muffins; (3) full-dose muffins. Fasting blood samples were obtained at weeks 0 and 4 for the determination of FA concentrations. Almond intake (g/d) was found to be inversely associated with the estimated Framingham 10-year CHD risk score (P= 0·026).

In filamentous fungi, glyoxylate metabolism is coupled with β-oxidation of fatty acids, and both are localized to ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles called peroxisomes. Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) produced during β-oxidation is transported via the cytosol into  for further metabolism. A peroxisomal-specific pathway for acetyl-CoA transport requiring peroxisomal carnitine acetyl transferase (CAT) activity has been identified in Magnaporthe grisea peroxisomes. Here, we report that a Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ortholog of the M. grisea peroxisomal CAT-encoding gene Pth2 (herein designated Ss-pth2) is required for virulence-associated host colonization. Null (ss-pth2) mutants, obtained by in vitro transposon mutagenesis, failed to utilize fatty acids, acetate, or glycerol as sole carbon sources for growth. Gene expression analysis of these mutants showed altered levels of transcript accumulation for glyoxylate cycle enzymes. Ss-pth2 disruption also affected sclerotial, apothecial, and appressorial development and morphology, as well as oxalic  accumulation when cultured with acetate or  as sole carbon nutrient sources. Although mutants were able to penetrate and initially colonize host tissue, subsequent colonization was impaired. Genetic complementation with the wild-type Ss-pth2 restored wild-type virulence phenotypes.

This study aimed to examine the role of mitochondrial long-chain fatty  (LCFA) oxidation in mediating oleate's protective effect against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity. CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1), which is the key regulatory enzyme of mitochondrial LCFA oxidation, is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, an intermediate of lipogenesis. We showed that expression of a mutant form of CPT1 (CPT1mt), which is active but insensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition, in C2C12 myotubes led to increased LCFA oxidation flux even in the presence of high concentrations of glucose and insulin. Furthermore, similar to preincubation with oleate, CPT1mt expression protected muscle cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis and insulin resistance by decreasing the content of deleterious palmitate derivates (i.e. diacylglycerols and ceramides). Oleate preincubation exerted its protective effect by two mechanisms: (i) in contrast to CPT1mt expression, oleate preincubation increased the channeling of palmitate toward triglycerides, as a result of enhanced diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression, and (ii) oleate preincubation promoted palmitate oxidation through increasing CPT1 expression and modulating the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and AMP-activated protein kinase. In conclusion, we demonstrated that targeting mitochondrial LCFA oxidation via CPT1mt expression leads to the same protective effect as oleate preincubation, providing strong evidence that redirecting palmitate metabolism toward oxidation is sufficient to protect against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27919046>Oleate promotes differentiation of chicken primary preadipocytes in vitro.</a></h2><p>In addition to providing energy and constituting cell membrane, fatty acids also play an important role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. As an important member of monounsaturated fatty acids, oleate, together with other components, is widely used to induce chicken preadipocyte differentiation. However, it is not clear whether oleate alone can induce chicken preadipocyte differentiation. In the present study, four different treatments were designed to test this question: basal medium, IDX [insulin, dexamethasone and IBMX (isobutylmethylxanthine)], oleate and IDX plus oleate. Cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation and mRNA expression for -related genes were monitored. After treatment of oleate on chicken preadipocytes, apparent lipid droplet formation and lipid accumulation were observed, accompanied by increasing expression of PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ) and AFABP (adipocyte fatty -binding protein), but decreasing level of GATA2 (GATA-binding protein 2). In contrast, for cells cultured in the basal medium with or without IDX supplementation, lipid droplet barely occurred.

Enhanced release of non-esterified fatty acids from adipose tissue accounts for a remarkable fraction of accumulated lipids. However, the de novo  (DNL) is also implicated in the etiology of the NAFLD. Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a transcription factor modulating the expression of several lipogenic enzymes. In the present study, in order to investigate the effect of lipid droplet accumulation on DNL, we used a cellular model of steatosis represented by HepG2 cells cultured in a medium supplemented with free  and palmitic fatty acids (FFAs). We report that FFA supplementation induces the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in the DNL as well as for the transcription factor SREBP-1a. The SREBP-1a mRNA translation, dependent on an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and the SREBP-1a proteolytic cleavage are activated by FFAs. Furthermore, FFA treatment enhances the expression and the nucleus-cytosolic shuttling of hnRNP A1, a trans-activating factor of SREBP-1a IRES. The binding of hnRNP A1 to the SREBP-1a IRES is also increased upon FFA supplementation. The relocation of hnRNP A1 and the consequent increase of SREBP-1a translation are dependent on the p38 MAPK signal pathway, which is activated by FFAs. By RNA interference approach, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 is implicated in the FFA-induced expression of SREBP-1a and of its target genes as well as in the lipid accumulation in cells.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Lipid droplets (LDs) are storehouses of FAs in host cells and have been proposed to be a source of FAs for the parasitophorous vacuole, termed inclusion, in which Ct replicates. Previously, cells devoid of LDs were shown to produce reduced infectious progeny at 24 hr postinfection (hpi). Here, although we also found reduced progeny at 24 hpi, there were significantly more progeny at 48 hpi in the absence of LDs compared to the control wild-type (WT) cells. These findings were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy where cells without LDs were shown to have significantly more metabolically active reticulate bodies at 24 hpi and significantly more infectious but metabolically inert elementary bodies at 48 hpi than WT cells. Furthermore, by measuring basal  consumption rates (OCR) using extracellular flux analysis, Ct infected cells without LDs had higher OCRs at 24 hpi than cells with LDs, confirming ongoing metabolic activity in the absence of LDs. Although the FA  is a major source of phospholipids for Ct and stimulates LD synthesis, treatment with , but not other FAs, enhanced growth and led to an increase in basal OCR in both LD depleted and WT cells, indicating that FA transport to the inclusion is not affected by the loss of LDs.

SD rats were fed with high fat diet (HFD) to induce NASH. From the 16th w, the HFD was full or half replaced by olive oil to observe the protective effects.In vitro, OA substantially alleviated PA induced cellular apoptosis, oxidative stress, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as  in hepatocytes. In vivo, only olive oil supplementation had no detrimental effects, while HFD developed NASH in normal rats. Full replacement of HFD with olive oil had profoundly reversed NASH. Noteworthily, half replacement of HFD with olive oil (a mixed diet) has ameliorated NASH injury as well. It strikingly changed the hepatic histology from macrovesicular-steatosis into entire microvesicular-steatosis, and significantly reduced , ballooning and fibrosis.Our study has demonstrated in both hepatocytes and NASH rats that  acids had great potential to combat the saturated fatty acids induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Only half replacement of HFD by monounsaturated fatty acids rich diet still had significant therapeutic outcome in NASH rats. Redirecting the toxic saturated fatty acids into triglyceride storage and reduction of cholesterol accumulation might be the possible explanation of OA driven protection in this scenario.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Hepatic fibrosis can also develop from metabolic liver disease, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (). We investigated the role of MIF in high-fat or methionine- and choline-deficient diet mouse models of . Mif(-/-) mice showed elevated liver triglyceride levels (WT, 53±14 mg/g liver; Mif(-/-), 103±7 mg/g liver; P<0.05) and a 2-3-fold increased expression of lipogenic genes. Increased fatty degeneration in the livers of Mif(-/-) mice was associated with increased hepatic inflammatory cells (1.6-fold increase in F4/80(+) macrophages) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., 2.3-fold increase in Tnf-α and 2-fold increase in Il-6 expression). However, inflammatory cells and cytokines were decreased by 50-90% in white adipose tissue (WAT) of Mif(-/-) mice. Subset analysis showed that macrophage phenotypes in livers of Mif(-/-) mice were skewed toward M2 (e.g., 1.7-fold and 2.5-fold increase in Arg1 and Il-13, respectively, and 2.5-fold decrease in iNos), whereas macrophages were generally reduced in WAT of these mice (70% reduction in mRNA expression of F4/80(+) macrophages). The protective MIF effect was scrutinized in isolated hepatocytes. MIF reversed inflammation-induced triglyceride accumulation in Hepa1-6 cells and primary hepatocytes and also attenuated -elicited triglyceride increase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Protection from fatty hepatocyte degeneration was paralleled by a 2- to 3-fold reduction by MIF of hepatocyte proinflammatory cytokine production. Blockade of MIF receptor cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) but not of CXCR2 or CXCR4 fully reverted the protective effect of MIF, comparable to AMPK inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that MIF mediates hepatoprotection through the CD74/AMPK pathway in hepatocytes in metabolic models of liver injury.© FASEB.</p><p>Keyword:['NASH']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473024>ApoA-1 accelerates regeneration of small-for-size  graft after transplantation.</a></h2><p>Apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1) is involved in regulating both lipid and energy metabolism, which may play important roles in  regeneration, especially for the  with steatosis.

Aquacultured turbot are commonly fed a high-lipid diet; however, this diet causes excessive lipid deposition and the overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies in mammals have indicated that a relationship exists between pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression and altered lipid metabolism through the activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). In this study, we investigated the relationship between SOCS3 and triglyceride (TG) deposition and mechanism of SOCS3 activation in farmed turbot fed high-lipid diet (HLD). TG content increased with SOCS3 production, mediated by toll-like receptor-nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (TLR-NFκB) signaling in the liver of turbot fed a HLD and in turbot primary liver cells incubated with  (OA). Overexpression of SOCS3 increased TG deposition via the increased production of mature sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (m-SREBP-1). Knockdown of SOCS3 in turbot primary liver cells resulted in normalized TG deposition and decreased m-SREBP-1 production. These results suggest that the HLD and OA can induce cytokine expression by activating the TLR-NFκB signaling pathways, resulting in increased SOCS3 expression. It is proposed that SOCS3 enhances m-SREBP-1 production, leading to TG deposition. These findings provide important new insights into the relationship between cytokine expression and TG deposition and mechanism of HLD-induced pro-inflammatory response, which could help to improve the health of farmed turbot and a better understanding of fish .Copyright © 2017.

The function of miR-291b-3p is unknown. The potential role of miR-291b-3p in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism was explored in this study. High-fat diet (HFD)- and chow-fed mice were injected with an adenovirus expressing a miR-291b-3p inhibitor and a miR-291b-3p mimic through the tail vein. Hepatic lipids and lipogenic gene expression were analyzed. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies were performed in vitro to identify direct targets of miR-291b-3p.

The opposite was observed when miR-291b-3p was overexpressed in the livers of chow-fed C57BL/6J wild-type mice. In vitro studies revealed that silencing of miR-291b-3p in NCTC1469 hepatic cells ameliorated /palmitic  mixture-induced elevation of cellular triglycerides. Importantly, we identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-291b-3p. Using metformin, an activator of AMPK, we showed that AMPK activation-induced inhibition of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by reduced expression of miR-291b-3p in the liver. Liver miR-291b-3p promoted hepatic  and lipid accumulation in mice. AMPKα1 is a direct target of miR-291b-3p.

The plant-derived wax esters with long-chain monounsaturated acyl moieties, like oleyl oleate, have favorite properties for lubrication. For biosynthesis of wax esters using acyl-CoA substrates, expressions of a fatty acyl reductase (FAR) and a wax synthase (WS) in seeds are sufficient.For optimization of the enzymatic activity and subcellular localization of wax ester synthesis enzymes, two fusion proteins were created, which showed wax ester-forming activities in . To promote the formation of oleyl oleate in seed oil, WSs from  (WSD1) and  (WS2), as well as the two created fusion proteins were tested in Arabidopsis to evaluate their abilities and substrate preference for wax ester production. The tested seven enzyme combinations resulted in different yields and compositions of wax esters. Expression of a FAR of  (FAR) with WSD1 or WS2 led to a high incorporation of C substrates in wax esters. The FAR/TMAWAT2-WSD1 combination resulted in the incorporation of more C alcohol and C acyl moieties into wax esters compared with FAR/WSD1. The fusion protein of a WS from  (WS) with MaFAR exhibited higher specificity toward C substrates in preference to C substrates. Expression of FAR/WSD1 in the Arabidopsis  double mutant resulted in the accumulation of oleyl oleate (18:1/18:1) in up to 62 mol% of total wax esters in seed oil, which was much higher than the 15 mol% reached by FAR/WSD1 in Arabidopsis Col-0 background. In order to increase the level of oleyl oleate in seed oil of , lines expressing FAR/WS were crossed with a transgenic high oleate line. The resulting plants accumulated up to >40 mg g seed of wax esters, containing 27-34 mol% oleyl oleate.The overall yields and the compositions of wax esters can be strongly affected by the availability of acyl-CoA substrates and to a lesser extent, by the characteristics of wax ester synthesis enzymes.

Two isomers predominate in the synthetic preparation, c9,t11 and t10,c12. CLA has been shown to inhibit chemically-induced skin, stomach, mammary or  tumours in mice and rats. The inhibition of mammary tumours in rats is effective regardless of type of carcinogen or type or amount of dietary fat. CLA has also been shown to inhibit cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits. When young animals (mice, pigs) are placed on CLA-containing diets after weaning they accumulate more body protein and less fat. Since CLA is derived from the milk of ruminant animals and is found primarily in their meat and in products derived from their milk there is a concerted world-wide effort to increase CLA content of milk by dietary means. Its effect on growth (less fat, more protein) is also a subject of active research. The mechanisms underlying the effects of CLA are still moot.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215805>Effect of body position on ventilation distribution during PEEP titration in a porcine model of acute lung injury using advanced respiratory monitoring and electrical impedance tomography.</a></h2><p>Lung failure after acute lung injury remains a challenge in different clinical settings. Various interventions for restoration of gas exchange have been investigated. Recruitment of collapsed alveoli by positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration and optimization of ventilation-perfusion ratio by prone positioning have been extensively described in animal and clinical trials. This animal study was conducted to investigate the effects of PEEP and positioning by means of advanced respiratory monitoring including gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, volumetric capnography and electrical impedance tomography.After induction of acute lung injury by  and lung lavage, 12 domestic pigs were studied in randomly assigned supine or prone position during a PEEP titration trial with maximal PEEP of 30 mbar.Induction of lung injury resulted in significant deterioration of oxygenation [partial pressure of arterial /inspiratory fraction of  (PaO2/FiO2): p = 0.002] and ventilation [partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2): p = 0.002] and elevated alveolar dead-space ratios (Valv/Vte: p = 0.003) in both groups. Differences in the prone and the supine group were significant for PaCO2 at incremental PEEP 10 and 20 and at decremental PEEP 20 (20d) and 10 (10d), for PaO2/FiO2 at PEEP 10 and 10d and for alveolar dead space at PEEP 10d. Electrical impedance tomography revealed homogenous ventilation distribution in prone position during PEEP 20, 30 and 20d.Prone position leads to improved oxygenation and ventilation parameters in a lung injury model.

Therefore, the as-fabricated Nb-doped TiO film exhibits efficient photocatalytic oxidation performance for acetaldehyde and  decomposition under simulated solar light irradiation.

Cytoglobin has been shown to exert protective effects under oxidative stress conditions. The aim of this study was to determine whether recombinant human cytoglobin (rhCYGB) has protective effects against atherosclerosis. We intraperitoneally injected rhCYGB (0, 4, or 7 mg/kg BW) into the atherosclerotic rats daily for 60 days. The rhCYGB injections reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in a dose-dependent manner, rhCYGB (7 mg/kg) significantly attenuated atherosclerosis. Blood proteins were separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis and analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the majority of the proteins in question were participated in oxidative stress pathways and cardiovascular diseases. Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) cells were treated with  (0.3 mmol/L), and Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells were incubated with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL; 50 µg/mL) to induce foam cell (FC) formation in vitro. Treatment with different concentrations of rhCYGB (0, 5, 10, and 15 μg/mL) significantly decreased the lipid droplet levels in HepG2 cells and cholesterol ester levels in FCs. Moreover, rhCYGB significantly increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity and decreased malondialdehyde and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity in cells. In addition, rhCYGB decreased NO and Reactive  species (ROS) levels in FCs by functioning as an NO dioxygenase enzyme and ROS scavenger. Taken together, our findings indicate that rhCYGB prevented atherosclerosis by regulating lipid metabolism and oxidative stress.

Nitro-oxidative stress seems to be involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether fatty acids are implicated in the pathogenesis of this mitochondrial defect. In HepG2 cells, we analyzed the effect of saturated (palmitic and stearic acids) and monounsaturated () fatty acids on: OXPHOS activity; levels of protein expression of OXPHOS complexes and their subunits; gene expression and half-life of OXPHOS complexes; nitro-oxidative stress; and NADPH oxidase gene expression and activity. We also studied the effects of inhibiting or silencing NADPH oxidase on the palmitic--induced nitro-oxidative stress and subsequent OXPHOS inhibition. Exposure of cultured HepG2 cells to saturated fatty acids resulted in a significant decrease in the OXPHOS activity. This effect was prevented in the presence of a mimic of manganese superoxide dismutase. Palmitic  reduced the amount of both fully-assembled OXPHOS complexes and of complex subunits. This reduction was due mainly to an accelerated degradation of these subunits, which was associated with a 3-tyrosine nitration of mitochondrial proteins. Pretreatment of cells with uric , an antiperoxynitrite agent, prevented protein degradation induced by palmitic . A reduced gene expression also contributed to decrease mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits. Saturated fatty acids induced oxidative stress and caused mtDNA oxidative damage. This effect was prevented by inhibiting NADPH oxidase. These acids activated NADPH oxidase gene expression and increased NADPH oxidase activity. Silencing this oxidase abrogated totally the inhibitory effect of palmitic  on OXPHOS complex activity. We conclude that saturated fatty acids caused nitro-oxidative stress, reduced OXPHOS complex half-life and activity, and decreased gene expression of mtDNA-encoded subunits. These effects were mediated by activation of NADPH oxidase. That is, these acids reproduced mitochondrial dysfunction found in humans and animals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.© 2015.

This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and inflammation was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with palmitic  (PA), a combination of palmitate and , or high glucose, and insulin (HG) mimicking insulin resistance in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders. Decreased miR-122-5p in liver was associated with impaired FA usage. Expression of inflammatory and macrophage-related genes was opposite to decreased miR-30b-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-422a, whereas increased miR-146b-5p was associated with FABP4 and decreased glucose metabolism and FA mobilization. In partial agreement, PA (but not HG) led to decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-422a and miR-146a in vitro, in parallel with increased lipogenesis and FA transport, decreased glucose metabolism and diminished FA oxidation.This study confirms decreased liver glucose and lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis coupled with changes in five unique miRNAs in obese patients with NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784489>Impact of multi-functional fermented goat milk beverage on gut microbiota in a dynamic colon model.</a></h2><p>The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of grape probiotic fermented beverages made of goat milk, with or without added grape pomace on gut microbiota in a Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®).

Such knowledge, particularly the impact of ligand dynamics on physical behavior of NPSLs, is still in its infancy. Here, we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and small angle X-ray scattering experiments in a diamond anvil cell to demonstrate that coverage density of capping ligands (i.e., number of ligands per unit area of a nanoparticle's surface), strongly influences the structure, elasticity, and high-pressure behavior of NPSLs using face-centered cubic PbS-NPSLs as a representative example. We demonstrate that ligand coverage density dictates (a) the extent of diffusion of ligands over NP surfaces, (b) spatial distribution of the ligands in the interstitial spaces between neighboring NPs, and (c) the fraction of ligands that interdigitate across different nanoparticles. We find that below a critical coverage density (1.8 nm-2 for 7 nm PbS NPs capped with ), NPSLs collapse to form disordered aggregates via sintering, even under ambient conditions. Above the threshold ligand coverage density, NPSLs surprisingly preserve their crystalline order even under high applied pressures (∼40-55 GPa), and show a completely reversible pressure behavior.

The aim of this study was preparing pH-sensitive and plasma stable liposomes in order to enhance the selectivity and antiproliferative effect of Rapamycin. In the present study we used PEG-poly (monomethylitaconate)-CholC6 (PEG-PMMI-CholC6) copolymer and  (OA) to induce pH-sensitive property in Rapamycin liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomal formulations bearing copolymer PEG-PMMI-CholC6 and OA were characterized in regard to physicochemical stability, pH-responsiveness and stability in human plasma. The ability of pH-sensitive liposomes in enhancing the cytotoxicity of Rapamycin was evaluated in vitro by using  cell line (HT-29) and compared with its cytotoxicity on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line. Both formulations were found to release their contents under mild acidic conditions rapidly. However, unlike OA-based liposomes, the PEG-PMMI-CholC6 bearing liposomes preserved their pH-sensitivity in plasma. Both types of pH-sensitive Rapamycin-loaded liposomes exhibited high physicochemical stability and could deliver antiproliferative agent into HT-29 cells much more efficiently in comparison with conventional liposomes. Conversely, the antiproliferative effect of pH-sensitive liposomes on HUVEC cell line was less than conventional liposomes. This study showed that both OA and PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based vesicles could submit pH-sensitive property, however, only PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based liposomes could preserve pH-sensitive property after incubation in plasma. As a result pH-sensitive PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based liposomal formulation can improve the selectivity, stability and antiproliferative effect of Rapamycin.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Hexadecane-based PCM is loaded with six different nanoinclusions: carbon black nanopowder (CBNP), nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs), copper nanoparticles, silver nanowires (AgNWs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The nanoinclusions CBNP, NiNP, AgNW, and GNP are surface-functionalized with . Nanoinclusion-loaded PCM showed a large enhancement in thermal conductivity, which was more prominent in the solid state. Interestingly, a maximum thermal conductivity enhancement of ∼122% was observed in the solid state for the PCM loaded with 0.01 wt % CBNP. Higher thermal conductivity enhancement in the solid state is attributed to the formation of a nanocrystalline network structure during freezing of the PCM, consisting of a needlelike microstructure, which is confirmed by optical phase contrast microscopy. During solidification, the nanoinclusions are driven toward the grain boundaries, thereby forming a quasi-two-dimensional network of percolating structures with high thermal transport efficiency due to the enhancement of phonon-mediated heat transfer and near-field radiative heat transfer. Thermal conductivity increases with the increased loading of the nanoinclusions due to the formation of more interconnecting aggregates. Among the carbon-based nanoinclusions, the highest thermal conductivity enhancement is obtained for the PCM loaded with CBNP, which is attributed to the low fractal dimensions and volume-filling capability of CBNP aggregates. In the case of metallic nanoinclusions, the highest thermal conductivity enhancement is obtained for the PCM loaded with AgNW, which is due to the large aspect ratio of AgNW. The carboxylic group of  attached to the nanoinclusions is found to provide better steric stability with insignificant aggregation and improved thermal stability, which are beneficial for practical applications. Our results indicate that the initial thermal conductivity of carbon-based nanoinclusions has an insignificant role in the thermal conductivity enhancement of the PCM but the volume-filling capability of the nanoinclusion has a prominent role. The findings from the present study will be beneficial for tailoring the properties of nanoinclusion-loaded organic PCM for thermal  storage and reversible thermal switching applications at room temperature.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3598325>Increased erythrocyte stearic  desaturation in rats with chemically induced colorectal carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies have demonstrated a desaturation of stearic  related to  in the lipid layer of erythrocytes in patients with malignancies.

The effects of dietary long-chain fatty acids (FA) on adipogenesis and lipogenesis of dairy cows are often confounded by other nutritional and physiological factors in vivo. Therefore, this study used an in vitro approach to study the effect of dose and type of long-chain FA on adipogenesis and lipogenesis of bovine adipocytes. Stromal vascular cells were isolated from adipose tissue of dairy cows and induced into mature adipocytes in the presence of various long-chain FA including myristic, palmitic, stearic, , or linoleic . When concentrations of myristic, palmitic, and  acids in adipogenic mediums were 150 and 200 μM, the induced mature adipocytes had greater lipid content compared with other concentrations of FA. In addition, mature adipocytes induced at 100 μM stearic  and 300 μM linoleic  had the greatest content of lipid than at other concentrations. High concentrations of saturated FA were more toxic for cells than the same concentration of unsaturated FA during the induction. When commitment stage was solely treated with FA, the number of differentiated mature adipocytes was greater for  and linoleic acids than other FA. When the maturation stage was treated with FA, the number of mature adipocytes was not affected, but the lipid content in adipocytes was affected and ranked  > linoleic > myristic > stearic > palmitic.

Proteomic analysis coupled with a bioinformatics-driven approach revealed that these mice express greater amounts of hepatic cathepsin B and lower amounts of   -binding protein (LFABP) than their wildtype littermates. siRNA-mediated knockdown of cathepsin B in McA-RH7777 cells resulted in a 39% increase in [H]TAG associated with VLDL secretion. Cathepsin B knockdown was accompanied by a 74% increase in cellular LFABP protein levels, but only when cells were exposed to 0.4 mm  (OA) complexed to BSA. The cathepsin B knockdown and 24-h treatment with OA resulted in increased CD36 expression alone and additively. Co-localization of LFABP and cathepsin B was observed in a distinct Golgi apparatus-like pattern, which required a 1-h OA treatment. Moreover, we observed co-localization of LFABP and apoB, independent of the OA treatment. Overexpression of cathepsin B resulted in decreased OA uptake and VLDL secretion.

This includes basic research on the pathways of solar energy conversion and on lipid biosynthesis and catabolism, and applied research dealing with the various biological and technical bottlenecks of the lipid production process. In here, we review the current knowledge in microalgal lipids with respect to their metabolism and various biotechnological applications, and we discuss potential future perspectives. The committing step in fatty  biosynthesis is the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA that is then introduced in the fatty  synthesis cycle leading to the formation of palmitic and stearic acids.  may also be synthesized after stearic  desaturation while further conversions of the fatty acids (i.e. desaturations, elongations) occur after their esterification with structural lipids of both plastids and the endoplasmic reticulum. The aliphatic chains are also used as building blocks for structuring storage acylglycerols via the Kennedy pathway. Current research, aiming to enhance  in the microalgal cell, is focusing on over-expressing key-enzymes involved in the earlier steps of the pathway of fatty  synthesis. A complementary plan would be the repression of lipid catabolism by down-regulating acylglycerol hydrolysis and/or β-oxidation. The tendency of oleaginous microalgae to synthesize, apart from lipids, significant amounts of other energy-rich compounds such as sugars, in processes competitive to , deserves attention since the lipid yield may be considerably increased by blocking competitive metabolic pathways. The majority of microalgal production occurs in outdoor cultivation and for this reason biotechnological applications face some difficulties. Therefore, algal production systems need to be improved and harvesting systems need to be more effective in order for their industrial applications to become more competitive and economically viable. Besides, a reduction of the production cost of microalgal lipids can be achieved by combining lipid production with other commercial applications. The combined production of bioactive products and lipids, when possible, can support the commercial viability of both processes. Hydrophobic compounds can be extracted simultaneously with lipids and then purified, while hydrophilic compounds such as proteins and sugars may be extracted from the defatted biomass. The microalgae also have applications in environmental biotechnology since they can be used for bioremediation of wastewater and to monitor environmental toxicants. Algal biomass produced during wastewater treatment may be further valorized in the biofuel manufacture. It is anticipated that the high microalgal lipid potential will force research towards finding effective ways to manipulate biochemical pathways involved in lipid biosynthesis and towards cost effective algal cultivation and harvesting systems, as well.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

At present, the mortality remains high in ARDS. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) using perfluorocarbon (PFC) has been proven to improve gas exchange and respiratory dynamics of the lungs during ARDS. However, PLV has not been shown to reduce the mortality of ARDS. Some studies have shown that mild hypothermia therapy can reduce lung injuries in animal models of ARDS by reducing inflammatory cytokine levels in lung tissues. However, hypothermia cannot produce a lung protection effect alone, and it may have a synergistic effect with other protective . To explore the possible role of PLV combined with mild hypothermia in the treatment of ARDS, in this study, we used PFC liquid ventilation to induce mild hypothermia in dogs suffering from ARDS and analyzed the effects of PFC liquid ventilation-induced mild hypothermia on the levels of inflammatory factors and lung histopathology in dogs with ARDS. The experimental dogs were randomly divided into conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), normal temperature PFC liquid ventilation (NPLV), hypothermic PFC liquid ventilation (HPLV), and mechanical ventilation (MV) groups. After induction of ARDS, the CMV group was treated with CMV for respiratory support, the HPLV group was treated with PLV-induced mild hypothermia using 15 °C PFC and maintained the rectal temperature at 34-36 °C, the NPLV group was treated with PLV using 36 °C PFC and maintained the rectal temperature at 36-38 °C. The MV group served as the control group. Analyses of the pulmonary pathology, partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, and lung wet-dry  ratio (W/T) of each dog revealed that PLV-induced mild hypothermia significantly increased the PaO values and attenuated lung injury, and there were no adverse effects on hemodynamics. Furthermore, treatment with PLV-induced mild hypothermia significantly increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and attenuated the expression of interleukin (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in peripheral blood and in lung BALF.

This, combined with a high metastatic rate and a lower 5-year survival rate than for other breast cancer phenotypes, means there is significant unmet need for new therapeutic strategies. Herein, the anti-neoplastic effects of the electrophilic fatty  nitroalkene derivative, 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic  (nitro-, NO-OA), were investigated in multiple preclinical models of TNBC. NO-OA reduced TNBC cell growth and viability , attenuated TNFα-induced TNBC cell migration and invasion, and inhibited the tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell xenografts in the mammary fat pads of female nude mice. The up-regulation of these aggressive tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion phenotypes is mediated in part by the constitutive activation of pro-inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in TNBC. NO-OA inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in human TNBC cells and suppressed downstream NF-κB target gene expression, including the metastasis-related proteins intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The mechanisms accounting for NF-κB signaling inhibition by NO-OA in TNBC cells were multifaceted, as NO-OA () inhibited the inhibitor of NF-κB subunit kinase β phosphorylation and downstream inhibitor of NF-κB degradation, () alkylated the NF-κB RelA protein to prevent DNA binding, and () promoted RelA polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Comparisons with non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial MCF-10A and MCF7 cells revealed that NO-OA more selectively inhibited TNBC function. This was attributed to more facile mechanisms for maintaining redox homeostasis in normal breast epithelium, including a more favorable thiol/disulfide balance, greater extents of multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1) expression, and greater MRP1-mediated efflux of NO-OA-glutathione conjugates. These observations reveal that electrophilic fatty  nitroalkenes react with more alkylation-sensitive targets in TNBC cells to inhibit growth and viability.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23096013>Novel soybean oils differing in fatty  composition alter immune functions of moderately hypercholesterolemic older adults.</a></h2><p>Linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) are essential fatty acids that play an important role in modulation of T cell proliferation. The effects of consuming novel soybean oils varying in LA:ALA ratios on T cell proliferation and inflammatory responses were assessed in older adults. Eighteen participants (>50 y old) with elevated cholesterol concentrations (3.37-4.14 mmol/L LDL cholesterol) consumed 5 experimental diets in random order for periods of 35 d. Each diet contained 30% of energy as fat, two-thirds of which was high- soybean oil (HiOleic-SO), soybean oil (SO), low-SFA soybean oil (LoSFA-SO), hydrogenated soybean oil (Hydrog-SO), or low-ALA soybean oil (LoALA-SO), resulting in LA:ALA ratios of 2.98, 8.70, 9.69, 15.2, and 18.3, respectively. Participants had higher proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with baseline following consumption of SO (26%; P < 0.05), LoSFA-SO (22%; P < 0.05), or HiOleic-SO (24%; P < 0.05) diets. Proliferative response was similar to the baseline after participants consumed diets with an LA:ALA ratio >10 (Hydrog-SO and LoALA-SO). Post-diet intervention, LA:ALA ratios correlated with proliferative responses to PHA (r = -0.87; P = 0.05). An optimal proliferative response was observed at an LA:ALA ratio of 8.70, with an inverse correlation between proliferative response and LA:ALA ratios >8.70. These effects were independent of changes in the production of PGE(2), inflammatory cytokines, or cytokines involved in growth of lymphocytes. These data suggest that the LA:ALA ratio modulates the proliferative ability of T lymphocytes, which may be due to subtle changes in fatty  composition of the phospholipids in immune cells.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652184>Irsogladine maleate regulates gap junctional intercellular communication-dependent epithelial  in human nasal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The airway epithelium of the human nasal mucosa acts as the first physical  that protects against inhaled substances and pathogens. Irsogladine maleate (IM) is an enhancer of gastric mucosal protective factors via upregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). GJIC is thought to participate in the formation of functional tight junctions. However, the effects of IM on GJIC and the epithelial  in human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) remain unknown. To investigate the effects of IM on GJIC and the tight junctional  in HNECs, primary cultures of HNECs transfected with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT-HNECs) were treated with IM and the GJIC inhibitors oleamide and 18β-GA. Some cells were pretreated with IM before treatment with TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) to examine whether IM prevented the changes via TLR3-mediated signal pathways. In hTERT-HNECs, GJIC blockers reduced the expression of tight junction molecules claudin-1, -4, -7, occludin, tricellulin, and JAM-A. IM induced GJIC activity and enhanced the expression of claudin-1, -4, and JAM-A at the protein and mRNA levels with an increase of  . GJIC blockers prevented the increase of the tight junction proteins induced by IM. Furthermore, IM prevented the reduction of JAM-A but not induction of IL-8 and TNF-α induced by poly(I:C). In conclusion, IM can maintain the GJIC-dependent tight junctional  via regulation of GJIC in upper airway nasal epithelium. Therefore, it is possible that IM may be useful as a nasal spray to prevent the disruption of the epithelial  by viral infections and exposure to allergens in human nasal mucosa.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30255682>[Seed-specific expression of heterologous gene DGAT1 increase soybean seed oil content and nutritional quality].</a></h2><p>Enhancing soybean (Glycine max) oil production is crucial to meet the market demand of vegetable oil. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final acylation reaction of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, acting as one of the rate-limiting enzymes for oil biosynthesis in plant seeds. Here, a cDNA clone VgDGAT1A encoding the DGAT1 protein was isolated from the high oil plant Vernonia galamensis. VgDGAT1A was specifically overexpressed in soybean seeds, and several high-generation transgenic lines (T7) were obtained by continuous selection. qPCR analysis showed that VgDGAT1A was highly expressed in the mid-development stage (30-45 DAF) of the transgenic seeds. Accordingly, the DGAT enzyme activity in the transgenic seeds was increased by 7.8 folds in comparison with the wild-type controls. Seed oil and starch contents were, respectively, increased by 5.1% (Dry ) and reduced by 2%-3% in the transgenic soybeans. Importantly, protein content was not significantly different between transgenic and control seeds. Seed  and germination rate of the transgenic lines exhibited no negative effect. Fatty  profiling demonstrated that antioxidant  (C18:1Δ9) content in the transgenic seed oil was elevated by 8.2% compared to the control, and correspondingly, easily-oxidized linoleic  (C18:2Δ9,12) and linolenic  (C18:3Δ9,12,15) were decreased by 6% and 2% respectively. Taken together, seed-specific overexpression of an exogenous VgDGAT1A gene can break the negative linkage of oil and protein contents in soybean seeds, indicating that engineering of this highly-active DGAT enzyme is an effective strategy to improve oil yield and nutritional value in oilseeds.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206695>Comparison of Furans Formation and Volatile Aldehydes Profiles of Four Different Vegetable Oils During Thermal Oxidation.</a></h2><p>The evolution of volatile aldehydes and the conversion of oxygenated ityβ-unsaturated aldehydes (OαβUAs) into furans were compared in four vegetable oils (soybean oil, olive oil [OVO], peanut oil [PO], and perilla oil [PAO]) thermally oxidized at temperatures of 150, 180, and 210 °C for 10 hr/day over a 3-day period. Results showed that 2 alkyl furans and 23 volatile aldehydes including 4 toxic OdβUAs were detected by GC-MS. The original fatty  compositions of the oils played a key role in the type and concentration of those volatile compounds. 4-Hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE) and ethyl furan were only detected in PAO with a high content of linolenic , while the greatest level of pentyl furan was detected in PO with abundant linoleic . Greater amounts of 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-(E)-2-nonenal (ONE) were formed in the OVO with abundant . The close relativity of HHE and ethyl furan was also demonstrated. With principal component analysis, these vegetable oils could be discriminated based on their fatty acids and volatile compounds. The loading plot confirmed that HHE and ethyl furan were derived from the linolenic  oxidation and degradation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The chemometric results showed that the formation of the volatile components during heating in different vegetable oils has close correlation with the original fatty acids composition of vegetable oils. Our research has also confirmed the presence of toxic OɑβUAs in oils after heating.

This condition also is associated with altered renal vascular tone due to enhanced constriction by Ang-II. Thus, approaches ameliorating these events are desirable to alleviate kidney damage. Avocado oil, a source of antioxidants and , is known to improve mitochondrial function, while  has antihypertensive effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether avocado oil counteracts, to a similar degree as the Ang-II blocker losartan, the deleterious effects of hypertension on blood pressure, renal vascular performance, kidney mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress.Hypertensive rats induced with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were supplemented during 45 d with avocado oil or losartan. Vascular responses were analyzed in perfused kidney. Membrane potential, reactive  species levels, and glutathione were analyzed in isolated kidney mitochondria.In hypertensive rats, avocado oil decreased 21.2% and 15.5% diastolic and systolic blood pressures, respectively, and alleviated impaired renal vasodilation. Hypertension decreased membrane potential by 83.7% and augmented reactive  species levels by 51% in mitochondria fueled with a complex I substrate, whereas it augmented the levels of oxidized glutathione in 48%. These alterations were normalized by avocado oil at a comparable degree to losartan.Because avocado oil mimicked the effects of losartan, we propose that the effects of avocado oil might be mediated by decreasing the actions of Ang-II on mitochondria. These results suggest that avocado oil intake might be a nutritional approach to attenuate the deleterious effects of hypertension on kidney.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Lipids are abundant in host tissues, and fungal pathogens in the phylum basidiomycota possess both peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways to utilize this potential carbon source. In addition, lipids are important signaling molecules in both fungi and mammals. In this report, we demonstrate that defects in the peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways influence the growth of C. neoformans on fatty acids as well as the virulence of the fungus in a mouse inhalation model of cryptococcosis. Disease attenuation may be due to the cumulative influence of altered carbon source acquisition or processing, interference with secretion, changes in cell wall integrity, and an observed defect in capsule production for the peroxisomal mutant. Altered capsule elaboration in the context of a β-oxidation defect was unexpected but is particularly important because this trait is a major virulence factor for C. neoformans. Additionally, analysis of mutants in the peroxisomal pathway revealed a growth-promoting activity for C. neoformans, and subsequent work identified  and biotin as candidates for such factors. Overall, this study reveals that β-oxidation influences virulence in C. neoformans by multiple mechanisms that likely include contributions to carbon source acquisition and virulence factor elaboration.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3170718>Progress in culture and subculture of spheroplasts and fastidious -fast bacilli isolated from intestinal tissues.</a></h2><p>The efficiency of culture media was compared for the culture and subculture of very slowly growing -fast bacilli and spheroplast forms obtained from intestinal tissues of patients with Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis and from controls without .

The bile  phospholipid conjugate Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a novel anti-inflammatory agent with hepatoprotective effects in murine high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High fat diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic lipid extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species palmitic  and . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of arachidonic  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of fatty  oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective fatty  metabolism during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered lipid profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects.

Briefly, NRK52E renal proximal tubule cells were treated with 200 µM NIC, 100 µM  (OA), or a combination of NIC and OA. The expression levels of p66shc and MnSOD were modulated according to genetic methods. ROS production and cell injury, in the form of lactate dehydrogenase release, were subsequently detected. Promoter activity of p66shc and MnSOD, as well as forkhead box (FOXO)‑dependent transcription, was investigated using reporter luciferase assays. The results demonstrated that NIC exacerbated OA‑mediated intracellular ROS production and cell injury through the transcriptional activation of p66shc. NIC also suppressed OA‑mediated induction of the antioxidant MnSOD promoter activity through p66shc‑dependent inactivation of FOXO activity. Overexpression of p66shc and knockdown of MnSOD had the same effect as treatment with NIC on OA‑mediated lipotoxicity.

In the present study, we utilized Candida parapsilosis fatty  desaturase (OLE1) and fatty  synthase (FAS2) gene deletion mutants and wild-type (WT) yeast cells to unravel the relationship to glucose and lipid induced cell death in eukaryotic cells. Incubation of WT yeast cells with glucose led to the rapid accumulation of lipid droplets, whereas lipid droplet formation was severely impaired in yeast cells with deletion of OLE1 (ole1Δ/Δ) or FAS2 (fas2Δ/Δ). Interestingly, ole1Δ/Δ yeast cells died within hours in a 1% glucose medium without fatty  supplementation, whereas the WT or fas2Δ/Δ yeast cells did not. In glucose medium, ole1Δ/Δ yeast cells accumulated saturated fatty acids, while fas2Δ/Δ did not. Addition of saturated fatty acids (e.g., palmitic ) enhanced ole1Δ/Δ yeast cell death, whereas the addition of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g.,  or palmitoleic ) rescued cell death. Furthermore, palmitic  and glucose medium induced apopotic cell death in ole1Δ/Δ yeast cells, which was dependent on mitochondrial function.

By contrast, mono- or poly-unsaturated FFAs are protective against sFFAs. An excess of sFFAs in the brain circulation may also trigger neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, however the underlying signaling changes have not been clarified in neuronal cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of palmitate on mitochondrial function and viability as well as on intracellular insulin and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in Neuro-2a and primary rat cortical neurons. We next tested whether oleate preconditioning has a protective effect against palmitate-induced toxicity. Palmitate induced both mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance while promoting the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Oleate pre-exposure and then removal was sufficient to completely block subsequent palmitate-induced intracellular signaling and metabolic derangements. Oleate also prevented ceramide-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, oleate stimulated ATP while decreasing mitochondrial superoxide productions. The latter were associated with increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) attenuated the protective effect of oleate against palmitate, implicating PKA in the mechanism of oleate action. Oleate increased triglyceride and blocked palmitate-induced diacylglycerol accumulations. Oleate preconditioning was superior to docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or linoleate in the protection of neuronal cells against palmitate- or ceramide-induced cytotoxicity.

Further, TFA ingestion increased adipose tissue retinol-binding protein 4 mRNA as compared to PUFAs (n-6 or n-3). The effects of MUFA () on all these parameters were comparable to those observed for TFAs.Compared to PUFA-rich diets, chronic consumption of a TFA-rich diet did not lead to steatosis or hypertriglyceridemia; however, it significantly impaired muscle insulin sensitivity, while no changes were found in the oral glucose tolerance test.Copyright © 2011 S.

However, the effect of fatty acids on NETosis has not been clearly established. In this study, we focused on the NETosis-inducing ability of several lipid molecules. We extracted the lipid molecules present in Arabian Gulf catfish (, Val) skin gel, which has multiple therapeutic activities. Gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the lipid fraction-3 from the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid F- (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic ) and common long-chain fatty acids such as palmitic  (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic  (PO; C16:1), stearic  (SA; C18:0), and  (OA; C18:1). Using pure molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis that is rapid and induces reactive  species (ROS) production by both NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for long-chain fatty -induced NETosis, whereas, in F--induced NETosis, Akt is additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing. These findings are useful for understanding F-- and other fatty -induced NETosis and to establish the active ingredients with therapeutic potential for regulating diseases involving NET formation.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28391879>Individual omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids and mortality-The Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h2><p>The association of polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids with mortality has been extensively studied. Far less is known about the association of omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids (omega-9 MUFA) with mortality.We aimed to study the association of individual omega-MUFA with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.Omega-9 MUFA concentrations were measured in erythrocytes in 3259 patients participating in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study using the HS-Omega-3 index method. Associations with mortality were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for conventional risk factors separately for men and women.During a median follow-up of 10.0 years, 975 patients (29.9%) died. Partial correlation analysis adjusted for age and gender showed inverse correlations of  (OA), gondoic  (GA), and nervonic  (NA) with LDL-C, HDL-C, and eGFR but direct correlations with markers of  and endothelial activation as well as heart failure. A 1-SD increase in OA, GA, and NA was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality with HRs (95% CI) of 1.08 (1.01-1.16), 1.07 (1.01-1.13), and 1.12 (1.05-1.20), respectively. NA was the only omega-9 MUFA being associated with increased risk in men, whereas in women also GA was associated with risk.

However, there is very little knowledge about the contribution of oxidized linoleic  metabolites in inflammatory pain and peripheral sensitization. Here, we identify 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-DiHOME), a cytochrome P450-derived linoleic  metabolite, as crucial mediator of thermal hyperalgesia during inflammatory pain. We found 12,13-DiHOME in increased concentrations in peripheral nervous tissue during acute zymosan- and complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain. 12,13-DiHOME causes calcium transients in sensory neurons and sensitizes the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated intracellular calcium increases via protein kinase C, subsequently leading to enhanced TRPV1-dependent CGRP-release from sensory neurons. Peripheral injection of 12,13-DiHOME in vivo causes TRPV1-dependent thermal pain hypersensitivity. Finally, application of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-inhibitor TPPU reduces 12,13-DiHOME concentrations in nervous tissue and reduces zymosan- and CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia in vivo. In conclusion, we identify a novel role for the lipid mediator 12,13-DiHOME in mediating thermal hyperalgesia during inflammatory pain and propose a novel mechanism that may explain the antihyperalgesic effects of sEH inhibitors in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We developed a novel ASBT inhibitor, an N-(3,4-o-dichlorophenyl)-2-(3-trifluoromethoxy) benzamide derivative referred to as IMB17-15, and investigated its therapeutic effects and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects. Syrian golden hamsters were challenged with high-fat diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD and were subsequently administered 400 mg/kg IMB17-15 by gavage daily for 21 days. Serum, , and fecal samples were collected for further analysis. Plasma concentration-time profiles of IMB17-15 were also constructed. The human hepatocyte cell line HL-7702 was treated with  (OA) with or without IMB17-15. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to study the molecular mechanisms of IMB17-15. We found that IMB17-15 inhibited ASBT and subsequently suppressed ileal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and FXR-activated fibroblast growth factor15/19 (FGF15/19) expression, which reduced the hepatic phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) levels and upregulated the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) activity. Additionally, IMB17-15 stimulated adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) phosphorylation and enhanced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) expression and thus promoted triglyceride (TG) oxidation and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) metabolism through an ASBT-independent mechanism. In conclusion, a novel ASBT inhibitor known as IMB17-15 protected hamsters against HFD-induced NFALD by manipulating BA and lipid homeostasis. IMB17-15 also reduced lipid deposition in human hepatic cell lines, indicating that it may be useful as a therapy for NAFLD patients.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453902>Lipid analysis of follicular casts from cyanoacrylate strips as a new method for studying therapeutic effects of antiacne agents.</a></h2><p>The cyanoacrylate follicular biopsy is an established method for the examination of the horny layer and quantitative assessment of microcomedones.

OLEA-coated TiO2 NRs, presynthesized by a colloidal chemistry route, have been surface-modified by a treatment with the methacrylic-based silane coupling agent MEMO. The resulting OLEA/MEMO-capped TiO2 NRs have been dispersed in MEMO; that is a monomer precursor of the organic formulation, used as a "common solvent" for transferring the NRs in prepolymer components of the formulation. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy have allowed investigation of the effects of the incorporation of the OLEA/MEMO-capped TiO2 NRs on reactivity and photopolymerization kinetics of the nanocomposite, demonstrating that the embedded NRs significantly increase curing reactivity of the neat organic formulation both in air and inert atmosphere. Such a result has been explained on the basis of the photoactivity of the nanocrystalline TiO2 which behaves as a free-radical donor photocatalyst in the curing reaction, finally turning out more effective than the commonly used commercial photoinitiator. Namely, the NRs have been found to accelerate the cure rate and increase cross-linking density, promoting multiple covalent bonds between the resin prepolymers and the NR ligand molecules, and, moreover, they limit inhibition effect of  on photopolymerization.

The correlations between transcripts and proteins for the comparative group 16 h vs 14 h accounted for only 4.20% quantified proteins and 3.23% differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), respectively, much higher percentages of correlations (30.56%-59.11%) were found for other comparative groups (i.e., 18 h vs 14 h, 20 h vs 14 h, and 22 h vs 14 h). According to Spearman correlation tests between transcriptome and proteome (the absolute value of a correlation coefficient between 0.5 and 1 indicates a strong correlation), poor correlations were found for all quantified proteins ( = - 0.0355 to 0.0138), DEPs ( = - 0.0079 to 0.0233) and the DEPs with opposite expression trends to corresponding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ( = - 0.0478 to 0.0636), whereas stronger correlations were observed in terms of the DEPs with the same expression trends as the correlated DEGs ( = 0.5593 to 0.7080).

We verified the effect of differences in culture conditions on  OLL2712 functionality; this strain exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and preventive effects against metabolic disorders. We measured interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12 production in murine immune cells treated with OLL2712 cells prepared under various culture conditions. The results showed that the IL-10-inducing activities of OLL2712 cells on murine immune cells differed dramatically between OLL2712 groups at different culture phases and using different culture medium components, temperatures, and neutralizing pHs. In particular, exponential-phase cells had much more IL-10-inducing activity than stationary-phase cells. We confirmed that the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation activity of OLL2712 cells depended on culture conditions in conjunction with IL-10-inducing activity. We also demonstrated functional differences by culture phases ; OLL2712 cells at exponential phase had more anti-inflammatory activity and anti-metabolic-disorder effects on obese and diabetic mice than those by their stationary-phase counterparts. These results suggest that culture conditions affect the functionality of anti-inflammatory LAB. While previous studies demonstrated that culture conditions affected the immunomodulatory properties of lactic  bacteria (LAB), few have comprehensively investigated the relationship between culture conditions and LAB functionality. In this study, we demonstrated several culture conditions of  OLL2712 for higher anti-inflammatory activity. We also showed that culture conditions concretely influenced the health-promoting functions of OLL2712 , particularly against metabolic disorders. Further, we characterized a novel mechanism by which changing LAB culture conditions affected immunomodulatory properties.

Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty , , but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty , palmitic . Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic  (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic , trans-vaccenic  and palmitelaidic , were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitic, but not by . Elaidic  also inhibited autophagy induction by palmitic  in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts.

However, DHA increased the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), but not of other mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p38 and JNK. The increase in HO-1 expression was significantly inhibited by U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and its binding to the HO-1 promoter significantly increased upon DHA treatment.

JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty  amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'hyperlipedemia', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31110927>Transcriptome analysis of  elaiosomes and seeds provide insights into fatty  biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Elaiosomes are specialized fleshy and edible seed appendages dispersed by ants.

In this study, we investigated the impact of overnutrition during the suckling period on body weight, serum biochemistry and serum fatty  metabolomics in male rats.Rats raised in small litters (SL, 3 pups/dam) and normal litters (NL, 10 pups/dam) were used to model early postnatal overnutrition and control, respectively. Serum glucose, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, free fatty ,  and leptin concentrations were assayed using standard biochemical techniques. Serum fatty acids were identified and quantified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach. mRNA and protein levels of key components of the  receptor signaling pathway were measured in epididymal fat and gastrocnemius muscle by quantitative PCR and western blotting.SL rats were 37.3 % and 15.1 % heavier than NL rats at weaning and 16-weeks-old, respectively. They had increased visceral fat mass, adult-onset  and glucose intolerance as well as elevated serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All detectable fatty acids were elevated in the serum of SL pups at weaning compared to NL controls, and significant increases in the levels of four fatty acids (palmitic , palmitoleic ,  and arachidonic ) persisted into adulthood. Moreover, a significantly positive correlation was identified between an  index (HOMA-IR) and concentrations of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and  in serum at postnatal 16 weeks. Early postnatal overnutrition also resulted in a significant downregulation of  receptor substrate-1 (Irs-1), protein kinase B (Akt2) and glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) at the protein level in epididymal fat of SL rats at 16 weeks, accompanied by decreased mRNA levels for Irs-1 and Glut4. In gastrocnemius muscle, Akt2 and Glut4 mRNA and Glut4 protein levels were significantly decreased in SL rats.This study demonstrates that early postnatal overnutrition can have long-lasting effects on body weight and serum fatty  profiles and can lead to impaired  signaling pathway in visceral white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, which may play a major role in IR.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22449545>Further insights into chemical characterization through GC-MS and evaluation for anticancer potential of Dracaena draco leaf and fruit extracts.</a></h2><p>The present study reports for the first time the amino  and fatty  compositions and the antitumoral activity of aqueous extracts obtained from Dracaena draco L. leaf and fruit.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of theacrine, a rare purine alkaloid isolated from Camellia assamica var. kucha, against acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in NAFLD.The pharmacological activities of theacrine were studied using high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-/- and C57BL/6J mice models. Oleate-treated HepG2 and L-02 cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of theacrine on acylcarnitine metabolism. The target of theacrine was confirmed in vitro as the blockade of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and protein kinase A.Theacrine inhibits hepatic steatosis and liver  and improves energy expenditure in HFD-fed mice. Theacrine ameliorates acylcarnitine metabolism disorder in HFD-fed mice and oleate-treated hepatocytes by improving fatty  oxidation. The underlying mechanism involves theacrine's activation of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 and consequently, the increased activity of long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) through deacetylation.Theacrine promotes acylcarnitine metabolism in NAFLD through the SIRT3/LCAD signaling pathway.

In addition, rat pups underwent oral administration of oil (palm, rapeseed, or sunflower oil) or water (10 μL/g body weight, postnatal days 10-15). Subsequently, colon goblet cells were studied by Western blotting, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry and colonic transmucosal electrical resistance was measured by using Ussing chambers.In vitro, palmitic  enhanced MUC2 production (140% of control) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α expression, whereas , linoleic, γ-linolenic, α-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic acids reduced MUC2 expression (at least -50% of control). All unsaturated LCFAs decreased the expression of human atonal homolog 1, a transcription factor controlling goblet cell differentiation (at least -31% vs. control). In vivo, rats fed palm oil had higher palmitic  concentrations (3-fold) in their colonic contents and increased mucus granule surfaces in their goblet cells (>2-fold) than did all other groups. Palm oil also increased colonic transmucosal electrical resistance (245% of control), yet had no effect on occludin and zonula occludens-1 expression. In contrast, sunflower and rapeseed oils decreased goblet cell number when compared with control (at least -10%) and palm oil (at least -14%) groups.Palm oil in rat pups and palmitic  in HT29-MTX cells increase the production of MUC2 and strengthen the intestinal .

However, these diets may have undesirable effects on high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and triglycerides, whereas diets high in monounsaturated fats do not. Twenty postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women previously consuming high-fat diets (34% energy) were placed on a low fat-monounsaturated rich diet (LFMR: 26%, 14% energy, respectively) for 6 men. Sixteen women already eating LF diets (24% energy) were also followed to monitor variations in serum lipids due to seasonal variations. Twenty-five women successfully completed the study (LFMR = 12, LF = 13).

High fat diet and alcohol are major components of the western diet. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ethanol and fatty acids on beta-cell survival and metabolism. We treated the rat beta-cell line RINm5F with ethanol, a mixture of palmitic and  acids, or both. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by (5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) (CM-H2DCFDA) fluorescence assay, and mitochondrial activity was assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay and by determining ATP production. Cell viability was assessed with a cell counter and trypan blue exclusion, and the mode of cell death by Hoechst33342 and propidium iodide staining. With both ethanol and fatty  treatments, MTT reduction and ATP production decreased, whereas ROS production increased. Ethanol treatment had no effect on cell number, whereas fatty  treatment reduced the cell number. Cell incubation with ethanol, fatty acids, or both increased the number of Hoechst 33342-positive nuclei. However, the majority of nuclei from fatty -treated cells were stained with propidium iodide, indicating a loss of plasma membrane integrity. We conclude that both ethanol and fatty acids generate cellular oxidative stress, and affect mitochondrial function in RINm5F beta-cells. However, ethanol causes beta-cell death by apoptosis, whereas fatty acids cause cell death predominantly by necrosis.

Na accumulation increased in each MG under salinity, reaching the highest values in MG fruits (2654 mg kg DW). Salinity caused an acceleration of the ripening process, increased fruit number and decreased total fatty acids content in MG. An increase in  at MG (53%) was detected, with consequent increase in the /linoleic (41%) and decrease in the polyunsaturated/monounsaturated ratios (30%).

It is characterized by reduced response to insulin, central obesity, and dyslipidemia. Intake of plant sterols (PS) has been shown to confer a healthier lipid profile and ameliorate cardiovascular disease risk factors in experimental animals and humans. In this study we used an animal model of type 2 diabetes to assess the effects of a preparation of PS esterified to high  sunflower oil fatty acids mixed with dietary diacylglycerol (PS-HOSO) on diabetic related metabolic parameters. Psammomys obesus (P. obesus) were fed high energy (HE) diet supplemented by either PS-HOSO or control oil. Following 4.5 weeks of intervention, animals were divided into fasting and non-fasting modes prior to outcome measurements. Glucose and insulin levels as well as blood lipid profile, body weight, and fat accumulation were evaluated in fasting and non-fasting modes.P. obesus fed with a HE diet displayed a characteristic heterogeneity in their blood glucose and insulin levels with a subset group displaying type 2 diabetes symptoms. PS-HOSO treatment significantly reduced total cholesterol (24%, P < 0.001) and non-HDL cholesterol (34%, P < 0.01) compared to the control diet. Among fasting animals, body weight at end point and epididymal fat-to-liver weight ratio were significantly (P < 0.05 each) reduced (7% and 16%, respectively) compared to controls. Interestingly, fasting blood glucose levels were similar between groups, whereas plasma insulin level at end point was 44% lower in the PS-HOSO group compared to control group (P < 0.0001)PS-HOSO supplementation to diabetes-prone gerbils counteracts the increase in body weight and epididymal fat accumulation, and also results in a drop in circulating insulin levels.

Lipoxygenase products can be metabolized further in the oxylipin pathway by several groups of CYP74 enzymes. One prominent oxylipin is jasmonic  (JA), a product of the 13-allene oxide synthase branch of the pathway and known as signaling substance that plays a role in vegetative and propagative plant development as well as in plant responses to wounding and pathogen attack. In barley roots, JA level increases upon  by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Apart from this first result regarding JA, no information is available on the relevance of lipidperoxide metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Thus we analyzed fatty  and lipidperoxide patterns in roots of Medicago truncatula during mycorrhizal . Levels of fungus-specific fatty acids as well as palmitic  (16:0) and  (18:1 n - 9) were increased in mycorrhizal roots. Thus the degree of arbuscular mycorrhizal  of roots can be estimated via analysis of fungal specific esterified fatty acids. Otherwise, no significant changes were found in the profiles of esterified and free fatty acids. The 9- and 13-LOX products of linoleic and alpha-linolenic  were present in all root samples, but did not show significant differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots, except JA which showed elevated levels in mycorrhizal roots.

The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in lipid metabolism during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of palmitic and  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing palmitic and  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin metabolism. We further demonstrated the impact of cellular lipid metabolism, and particularly cardiolipin metabolism, during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis. Thus, cardiolipin may represent a new therapeutic target for axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injuries or when axon sprouting is required to compensate for motor neuron loss in response to aging and/or disease.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

GW7647 is a potent PPARα agonist that must reach the nucleus to activate this receptor. In cells expressing human fatty -binding protein 1 (FABP1), GW7647 treatment increases FABP1's nuclear localization and potentiates GW7647-mediated PPARα activation; GW7647 is less effective in cells that do not express FABP1. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, here we substituted residues in FABP1 known to dictate  signaling by other intracellular -binding proteins. Substitutions of Lys-20 and Lys-31 to Ala in the FABP1 helical cap affected neither its nuclear localization nor PPARα activation. In contrast, Ala substitution of Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96, located in the loops adjacent to the ligand-binding portal region, abolished both FABP1 nuclear localization and GW7647-induced PPARα activation but had little effect on GW7647-FABP1 binding affinity. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we determined the WT FABP1 structure and analyzed the dynamics in the apo and GW7647-bound structures of both the WT and the K57A/E77A/K96A triple mutant. We found that GW7647 binding causes little change in the FABP1 backbone, but solvent exposes several residues in the loops around the portal region, including Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96. These residues also become more solvent-exposed upon binding of FABP1 with the endogenous PPARα agonist . Together with previous observations, our findings suggest that GW7647 binding stabilizes a FABP1 conformation that promotes its interaction with PPARα. We conclude that full PPARα agonist activity of GW7647 requires FABP1-dependent transport and nuclear localization processes.© 2019 Patil et al.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11880241>Reduction in hepatic non-esterified fatty  concentration after long-term treatment with atorvastatin lowers hepatic triglyceride synthesis and its secretion in sucrose-fed rats.</a></h2><p>The mechanism by which atorvastatin lowers plasma triglyceride (TG) levels is mainly through a decrease in hepatic TG secretion. However, it is not clear why atorvastatin, which does not inhibit TG synthesis in vitro, decreases hepatic TG secretion without a prospective increase in hepatic TG concentration. For the investigation of the mechanisms that underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effects of atorvastatin, we characterized the effect of either a single or an 11 day administration of atorvastatin in sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemic rats. Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg p.o.) strongly decreased the rate of both very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG and VLDL-apolipoprotein B secretion. The inhibitor also decreased hepatic TG concentration. Hepatic TG synthesis activity was also decreased by atorvastatin, and its activity was correlated with both hepatic and plasma TG concentration. There was also a strong correlation between the hepatic TG synthesis and hepatic non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) concentration (r(2)=0.815). These effects required chronic administration of the inhibitor and were not observed by acute treatment. Repeated administration of atorvastatin also strongly reduced hepatic acyl-coenzyme A synthase mRNA levels. These results suggest that the reduced hepatic NEFA most likely lowers hepatic TG synthesis and TG secretion in sucrose-fed hypertriglyceridemic rats.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26283494>Modification of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristic of zein film surfaces by contact with  plasma treated PDMS and  content.</a></h2><p>Zein has been widely studied as a biopolymer due to its unique film-forming abilities. Surface properties are of high importance for certain applications which include microfluidics and tissue engineering, as they drastically affect the end result. It is important to develop techniques to modify zein surface properties without compromising bulk material properties. In this study, we developed a facile technique to change the water affinity of zein film surfaces, compatible with patterning techniques via soft lithography. This is achieved by a simple solvent casting technique onto a polydimethylsilohexane (PDMS) substrate that was exposed to  plasma. Water contact angle measurements (WCA) were used to assess the hydrophillicity of zein surfaces and they reached as low as 20°. Atomic force microscopy, optical absorbance and light microscopy were used to study the characteristics of the film and its surface topography. Hydrophilic zein surfaces had higher roughness values compared to hydrophobic ones. Surface roughness, introduced by sandpaper and gratings does not have the same effect as surface chemistry. The amphiphilic nature of plasticizer  also contributed to the change in the water contact angle of the films. In conclusion, we demonstrated that zein film's surface properties can be controlled by its ability to self-assemble depending on the substrate that it is being cast on.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether EET-mediated effects influence mitochondrial quality in HL-1 cardiac cells during starvation. HL-1 cells were subjected to serum- and amino  free conditions for 24h. We employed a dual-acting synthetic analog UA-8 (13-(3-propylureido)tridec-8-enoic ), possessing both EET-mimetic and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory properties, or 14,15-EET as model EET molecules. We demonstrated that EET-mediated events significantly improved mitochondrial function as assessed by preservation of the ADP/ATP ratio and oxidative respiratory capacity. Starvation induced mitochondrial hyperfusion observed in control cells was attenuated by UA-8. However, EET-mediated events did not affect the expression of mitochondrial dynamic proteins Fis1, DRP-1 or Mfn2. Rather we observed increased levels of OPA-1 oligomers and increased mitochondrial cristae density, which correlated with the preserved mitochondrial function. Increased DNA binding activity of pCREB and Nrf1/2 and increased SIRT1 activity together with elevated mitochondrial proteins suggest EET-mediated events led to preserved mitobiogenesis.

Several studies proposed renal lipotoxicity in glomerular and tubular cells but the effect of lipid on renal erythropoietin (EPO)-producing (REP) cells in the interstitium has not been elucidated. Since renal anemia is caused by derangement of EPO production in REP cells, we evaluated the effect of palmitate, a representative long-chain saturated fatty , on EPO production and the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. EPO production was suppressed by palmitate (palmitate-conjugated bovine serum albumin [BSA]) or a high palmitate diet, but not -conjugated BSA or a high  diet, especially under cobalt-induced pseudo-hypoxia both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, suppression of EPO production was not induced by a decrease in transcription factor HIF activity, while it was significantly associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, particularly transcription factor ATF4 activation, which suppresses 3'-enhancer activity of the EPO gene. ATF4 knockdown by siRNA significantly attenuated the suppressive effect of palmitate on EPO production. Studies utilizing inherited super-anemic mice (ISAM) mated with EPO-Cre mice (ISAM-REC mice) for lineage-labeling of REP cells showed that ATF4 activation by palmitate suppressed EPO production in REP cells. Laser capture microdissection confirmed ATF4 activation in the interstitial area of ISAM-REC mice treated with palmitate-conjugated BSA. Thus, endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitate suppressed EPO expression by REP cells in a manner independent of HIF activation.

Lipids accumulation was examined by HE staining or oil red staining. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to measure expressions of the genes involved in lipogenic synthesis.FK866 significantly promoted liver steatosis in the mice fed with HFD and hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro, accompanied by the increases of the expressions of lipogenic genes such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty  synthase (FASN). Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and NAD significantly rescued the actions of FK866 in vitro. In contrast, overexpression of NAMPT in HepG2 and Hep1-6 hepatocytes ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation. In addition, FK866 decreased the protein levels of Sirt1 and phospho-AMPKα in liver of the HFD fed mice. Furthermore, Resveratrol, a Sirt1 activator, significantly reduced lipogenic gene expressions, while EX-527, a Sirt1 specific inhibitor, had the opposite effects.Our results demonstrated that inhibition of NAMPT aggravated the HFD- or -induced hepatic steatosis through suppressing Sirt1-mediated signaling pathway. On the one hand, the inhibition of NAMPT reduced the production of NAD through inhibiting the NAD salvage pathway, resulting in the decrease of Sirt1 activity, and then attenuated the deacetylation of SREBP1 in which the inhibition of SREBP1 activity promoted the expressions of FASN and ACC.

We previously reported that Bscl2 (-/-) mice develop lipodystrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT) due to unbridled lipolysis. The residual epididymal WAT (EWAT) displays a browning phenotype with much smaller lipid droplets (LD) and higher expression of brown adipose tissue marker proteins. Here we used targeted lipidomics and gene expression profiling to analyze lipid profiles as well as genes involved in lipid metabolism in WAT of wild-type and Bscl2(-/-) mice. Analysis of total saponified fatty acids revealed that the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice contained a much higher proportion of  18:1n9  concomitant with a lower proportion of palmitic 16:0 , as well as increased n3- polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) remodeling. The acyl chains in major species of triacylglyceride (TG) and diacylglyceride (DG) in the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice were also enriched with dietary fatty acids. These changes could be reflected by upregulation of several fatty  elongases and desaturases. Meanwhile, Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes from EWAT had increased gene expression in lipid uptake and TG synthesis but not de novo lipogenesis. Both  and peroxisomal β-oxidation genes were also markedly increased in Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes, highlighting that these machineries were accelerated to shunt the lipolysis liberated fatty acids through uncoupling to dissipate energy. The residual subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ScWAT) was not browning but displays similar changes in lipid metabolism. Overall, our data emphasize that, other than being essential for adipocyte differentiation, Bscl2 is also important in fatty  remodeling and energy homeostasis.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146491>Respiratory stress in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex mutants of Candida albicans activates Snf1 kinase response.</a></h2><p>We have previously established that mitochondrial Complex I (CI) mutants of Candida albicans display reduced  consumption, decreased ATP production, and increased reactive oxidant species (ROS) during cell growth. Using the Seahorse XF96 analyzer, the energetic phenotypes of Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complex mutants are further characterized in the current study. The underlying regulation of energetic changes in these mutants is determined in glucose and non-glucose conditions when compared to wild type (WT) cells. In parental cells, the rate of  consumption remains constant for 2.5 h following the addition of glucose, oligomycin, and 2-DG, but glycolysis is highly active upon the addition of glucose. In comparison, over the same time period, electron transport complex mutants (CI, CIII and CIV) have heightened activities in both  consumption and glycolysis upon glucose uptake. We refer to the response in these mutants as an "explosive respiration," which we believe is caused by low energy levels and increased production of reactive  species (ROS). Accompanying this phenotype in mutants is a hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as an energetic stress response protein kinase for maintaining energy homeostasis. Compared to wild type cells, a 2.9- to 4.4-fold hyperphosphorylation of Snf1p is observed in all ETC mutants in the presence of glucose. However, the explosive respiration and hyperphosphorylation of Snf1 can be partially reduced by the replacement of glucose with either glycerol or  in a mutant-specific manner. Furthermore, Inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (BSO) or anti-oxidants (mito-TEMPO) likewise confirmed an increase of Sfn1 phosphorylation in WT or mutant due to increased levels of ROS. Our data establish the role of the C. albicans Snf1 as a surveyor of cell energy and ROS levels. We interpret the "explosive respiration" as a failed attempt by ETC mutants to restore energy and ROS homeostasis via Snf1 activation. An inherently high OCR baseline in WT C. albicans with a background level of Snf1 activation is a prerequisite for success in quickly fermenting glucose.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Stimulation of oxygen consumption, ketogenesis and CO2 production following addition of octanoate and oleate in perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>Changes in metabolic rates (oxygen consumption, ketogenesis, 14CO2 production from labelled fatty acids, ) following the addition of octanoate or oleate were studied in isolated livers from fed and starved rats perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer in a non-recirculating system. The following results were obtained. The infusion of fatty acids caused a large increase in the rate of oxygen consumption. The effect was greater with octanoate than with oleate and was half-maximal with fatty  concentrations (free plus albumin bound) around 0.1 mM. The effects of oleate were only partially suppressed when the perfusate contained albumin concentrations near the physiological range. When fatty acids were oxidized at high rates, the glycolytic rate was diminished by 50%. The increase in oxygen consumption could not be explained fully by the increased ATP demand for fatty  metabolism or by a compensation for the diminished extramitochondrial ATP generation. In the presence of phenylalkyl oxirane carboxylic , an inhibitor of the transport of long-chain acyl-CoA derivates into the mitochondria, ketogenesis and 14CO2 production from labelled oleate were strongly inhibited, whereas the increase in oxygen consumption was only slightly affected. In the presence of antimycin A, the increase in oxygen consumption due to fatty acids was totally abolished. Following pretreatment of rats with ciprofibrate (induction of enzymes for peroxisomal beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids), ketogenesis (but not 14CO2 production) from oleate was enhanced threefold. The increase in oxygen consumption, however, was not affected. In conclusion, the increase in hepatic oxygen consumption due to addition of fatty acids reflects a mitochondrial process; it is, in part, independent of the ATP demand of the cell. An uncoupling-like effect of fatty acids on the respiratory chain and its possible physiological significance in ketogenesis are discussed.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27788147>Exploring the Lean Phenotype of Glutathione-Depleted Mice: Thiol, Amino  and Fatty  Profiles.</a></h2><p>Although reduced glutathione (rGSH) is decreased in obese mice and humans, block of GSH synthesis by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) results in a lean, insulin-sensitive phenotype. Data is lacking about the effect of BSO on GSH precursors, cysteine and glutamate. Plasma total cysteine (tCys) is positively associated with stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity and adiposity in humans and animal models.To explore the phenotype, amino  and fatty  profiles in BSO-treated mice.Male C3H/HeH mice aged 11 weeks were fed a high-fat diet with or without BSO in drinking water (30 mmol/L) for 8 weeks. Amino  and fatty  changes were assessed, as well as food consumption, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, body composition and liver vacuolation (steatosis).Despite higher food intake, BSO decreased particularly fat mass but also lean mass (both P<0.001), and prevented fatty liver vacuolation. Physical activity increased during the dark phase. BSO decreased plasma free fatty acids and enhanced insulin sensitivity. BSO did not alter liver rGSH, but decreased plasma total GSH (tGSH) and rGSH (by ~70%), and liver tGSH (by 82%). Glutamate accumulated in plasma and liver. Urine excretion of cysteine and its precursors was increased by BSO. tCys, rCys and cystine decreased in plasma (by 23-45%, P<0.001 for all), but were maintained in liver, at the expense of decreased taurine. Free and total plasma concentrations of the SCD products,  and palmitoleic acids were decreased (by 27-38%, P <0.001 for all).Counterintuitively, block of GSH synthesis decreases circulating tCys, raising the question of whether the BSO-induced -resistance is linked to cysteine depletion.

It is also a dangerous pathogen that can cause serious and even lethal skin infections. The topical administration of metronidazole via nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, such as liquid crystalline systems, can modulate both the drug permeation and activity, decreasing its side effects and increasing the drug potent activity against the gram-positive bacteria. This study aimed at: (1) structurally developing and characterizing a liquid crystalline systems composed of chitosan and polyethyleneimine dispersion as the aqueous phase,  as the oily phase, and ethoxylated and propoxylated cetyl alcohol as the surfactant (FPC) for metronidazole incorporation (0.5% w/w); (2) evaluating the in vitro release and skin permeation and retention properties of the metronidazole-loaded liquid crystalline systems (FPC-M); (3) investigating the in vitro antibacterial activity of FPC-M against Staphylococcus aureus. Polarised light microscopy indicated that both FPC and FPC-M are hexagonal systems. Rheological, texture, and bioadhesion assays showed that both are elastic and bioadhesive systems. According to the results of the in vitro release, permeation, and retention assays, FPC can modulate metronidazole release and allow metronidazole to stay for a longer time on the skin. The determination of FPC-M activity against Staphylococcus aureus showed that it could target the bacterial cell.

Despite the fast technical development in the production of aviation fuels, there are still several shortcomings such as a high cost of raw materials, a low yield of aviation fuels, and poor process techno-economic consideration. In recent years, olefin metathesis has become a powerful and versatile tool for generating new carbon-carbon bonds. The cross-metathesis reaction, one kind of metathesis reaction, has a high potential to efficiently convert plant oil into valuable chemicals, such as α-olefin and bio-aviation fuel by combining with a hydrotreatment process.In this research, an efficient, four-step conversion of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals was developed by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreating. Firstly, plant oil including oil with poor properties was esterified to fatty  methyl esters by an enzyme-catalyzed process. Secondly, the fatty  methyl esters were partially hydrotreated catalytically to transform poly-unsaturated fatty  such as linoleic  into . The olefin cross-metathesis then transformed the  methyl ester (OAME) into 1-decene and 1-decenoic  methyl ester (DAME). The catalysts used in this process were prepared/selected in function of the catalytic reaction and the reaction conditions were optimized. The carbon efficiency analysis of the new process illustrated that it was more economically feasible than the traditional hydrotreatment process.A highly efficient conversion process of plant oil into bio-aviation fuel and valuable chemicals by the combination of enzymatic transesterification, olefin cross-metathesis, and hydrotreatment with prepared and selected catalysts was designed.

Dead animals show a massive fatty degeneration of the liver. The cause is still unclear. Previous findings suggest that there may be parallels to human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The object of the study was to examine the changes in the fat contents, the fatty  composition and the iron content in livers of animals, which have died from hepatic lipidosis.The conspicuous livers (n = 85) were collected from 20 flocks where the phenomenon of massive increased animal losses accompanied by marked macroscopically visible pathological liver steatosis suddenly occurred. For comparison and as a reference, livers (n = 16) of two healthy flocks were taken. Healthy and diseased flocks were fed identical diets concerning official nutrient recommendations and were operating under standardized, comparable conventional conditions.Compared to livers of healthy animals, in the livers of turkeys died from hepatic lipidosis there were found massively increased fat levels (130 ± 33.2 vs. 324 ± 101 g/kg dry matter-DM). In all fatty livers, different fatty acids concentrations were present in significantly increased concentrations compared to controls (palmitic : 104 g/kg DM, +345%; palmitoleic : 18.0 g/kg DM, + 570%; : 115 g/kg DM, +437%). Fatty acids concentrations relevant for liver metabolism and  were significantly reduced (arachidonic : 2.92 g/kg DM, -66.6%; eicosapentaenoic : 0.141 g/kg DM, -78.3%; docosahexaenoic : 0.227 g/kg DM, -90.4%). The ratio of certain fatty acids to one another between control and case livers changed analogously to liver diseases in humans (e.g.: C18:0/C16:0 - 0.913 against 0.311; C16:1n7/C16:0 - 0.090 against 0.165; C18:1/C18:0 - 0.938 against 4.03).

THP-1 monocytes were stimulated with AA or OA and analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) and Human Exon 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix). Data were corroborated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Comparisons with publicly available data were conducted by standard bioinformatics. AA and OA elicited a complex response marked by a general DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation in the 1-200 μM range, respectively, with a maximal differential response at the 100 μM dose. The divergent response to AA and OA was prominent within the gene body of target genes, where it correlated positively with transcription. AA-induced DNA methylation profiles were similar to the corresponding profiles described for palmitic , atherosclerosis, diabetes, , and autism, but relatively dissimilar from OA-induced profiles. Furthermore, human atherosclerosis grade-associated DNA methylation profiles were significantly enriched in AA-induced profiles. Biochemical evidence pointed to β-oxidation, PPAR-α, and sirtuin 1 as important mediators of AA-induced DNA methylation changes. In conclusion, AA and OA exert distinct effects on the DNA methylome.

Heavy-labeled precursor and subtraction lipidomic experiments in mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells, a model cell line for the study of fatty  amide metabolism, establish the biosynthetic pathways for the N-acylglycines and the PFAMs. We provide evidence that the N-acylglycines are formed by a long-chain specific glycine-conjugating enzyme, glycine N-acyltransferase-like 3 (GLYATL3). siRNA knockdown of GLYATL3 in the N18TG2 cells resulted in a decrease in the levels of the N-acylglycines and the PFAMs. This is the first report of an enzyme responsible for long-chain N-acylglycine production in cellula. The production of the PFAMs in N18TG2 cells was reported to occur by the oxidative cleavage of the N-acylglycines, as catalyzed by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). siRNA knockdown of PAM resulted in an accumulation of [(13)C18]N-oleoylglycine and decreased levels of [(13)C18]oleamide when the N18TG2 cells were grown in the presence of [(13)C18].

Female rats were randomly assigned (n=7 rats/group) to drink water or water sweetened with 13% (w/v) HFCS-55, sucrose or fructose for 8 weeks. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest (P=.03) hepatic total lipid and triglyceride content and histological evidence of fat infiltration. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest hepatic de novo  indicated by the up-regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and the highest (P<.001)  (18:1n-9) content. This was accompanied by reduced β-oxidation indicated by down-regulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Disposal of excess lipids by export of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein from the liver was increased as shown by up-regulation of gene expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in rats drinking sucrose, but not HFCS-55 solution. The observed lipogenic effects were attributed to the slightly higher fructose content of HFCS-55 solution in the absence of differences in macronutrient and total caloric intake between rats drinking HFCS-55 and sucrose solution. Results from gene expression and fatty  composition analysis showed that, in a hypercaloric state, some types of sugars are more detrimental to the liver.

Lipid plasma membrane composition was identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The motile sperm samples presented the following phospholipids in a high frequency in the plasma membrane: phosphatidylcholine 38:4 (composed of stearic and arachidonic fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 36:1 (stearic and  fatty acids), phosphatidylethanolamine 34:4 (myristic and arachidonic fatty acids), glycerophosphatidic  36:4 (palmitic and arachidonic fatty acids), phosphatidylcholine 40:4 plasmanyl and phosphatidylcholine 40:5 plasmenyl.

In the present study, we investigated the ability of 4HD, XAG, CAR, and FKB to reduce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. When HepG2 cells were treated with a mixture of fatty acids (FAs; palmitic  :  = 1 : 2 ratio), significant lipid accumulation was observed. Under the same experimental conditions, addition of chalcones at 5 μM significantly suppressed the FA-induced lipid accumulation. We found that the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a key molecule involved in , was decreased in these chalcone-treated cells. We also found that these chalcones increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is involved in FA oxidation. Moreover, these chalcones increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), upstream regulators of SREBP-1 and PPARα. We confirmed that an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, reversed chalcone-induced changes in SREBP-1 and PPARα expression in the HepG2 cells. Collectively, we found that 4HD, XAG, CAR, and XAG attenuated lipid accumulation through activation of the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20442319>Oxidation of intramyocellular lipids is dependent on mitochondrial function and the availability of extracellular fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are related to both enlarged intramyocellular triacylglycerol stores and accumulation of lipid intermediates. We investigated how lipid overflow can change the oxidation of intramyocellular lipids (ICL(OX)) and intramyocellular lipid storage (ICL). These experiments were extended by comparing these processes in primary cultured myotubes established from healthy lean and obese type 2 diabetic (T2D) individuals, two extremes in a range of metabolic phenotypes. ICLs were prelabeled for 2 days with 100 microM [(14)C] (OA). ICL(OX) was studied using a (14)CO(2) trapping system and measured under various conditions of extracellular OA (5 or 100 microM) and glucose (0.1 or 5.0 mM) and the absence or presence of mitochondrial uncoupling [carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)]. First, increased extracellular OA availability (5 vs. 100 microM) reduced ICL(OX) by 37%. No differences in total lipolysis were observed between low and high OA availability. Uncoupling with FCCP restored ICL(OX) to basal levels during high OA availability. Mitochondrial mass was positively related to ICL(OX), but only in myotubes from lean individuals. In all, a lower mitochondrial mass and lower ICL(OX) were related to a higher cell-associated OA accumulation. Second, myotubes established from obese T2D individuals showed reduced ICL(OX). ICL(OX) remained lower during uncoupling (P < 0.001), even with comparable mitochondrial mass, suggesting decreased mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the variation in ICL(OX) in vitro was significantly related to the in vivo fasting respiratory quotient of all subjects (P < 0.02). In conclusion, the rate of ICL(OX) is dependent on the availability of extracellular fatty acids and mitochondrial function rather than mitochondrial mass.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28679273>Acoustic radiation force on a fluid cylindrical particle immersed in water near an impedance boundary.</a></h2><p>This work presents a theoretical model to calculate the acoustic radiation force of a fluid cylindrical particle immersed in water near a boundary. A solution of the acoustic radiation force function, which is the radiation force per unit  density and unit cross-sectional surface area, is derived for a cylinder near a boundary in normal incident plane wave by applying the translation addition theorem of cylindrical function. The effects of impedance boundary on acoustic radiation force of a fluid  cylinder and a mixture fluid cylinder immersed in water are analyzed with particular emphasis on the radius of fluid cylinder and the distance from its center to the impedance boundary. The results reveal that the existence of particle trapping behavior depends on the choice of the nondimensional frequency ka as well as the offset distance from the impedance boundary.

Therefore, the development of pharmacological or natural agents to reduce fat accumulation in the liver is an important effort. The Sechium edule shoots have already been verified to decrease serum lipids and cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis. However, how Sechium edule shoots modulate hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of polyphenol extracts (SPE) of Sechium edule shoots in reducing lipid accumulation in -treated HepG2 cells. We found that water extracts (SWE) of Sechium edule shoots could decrease serum and hepatic lipid contents (e.g., triacylglycerol and cholesterol). Furthermore, SWE and SPE through the AMPK (AMP-activating protein kinase) signaling pathway could decrease lipogenic relative enzymes, such as FAS (fatty  synthase), HMGCoR (HMG-CoA reductase), and SREBPs (sterol regulatory element binding proteins), and increase the expression of CPT-I (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) and PPARα (peroxisome proliferators activated receptor α), which are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism.

The metabolic fate of the lipids was examined.Macrophages utilised both oleate and (control) VLDL-triacylglycerol (TAG) to a similar extent. Most was deposited as cellular lipid; about 10% of oleate was oxidised compared to 25% of cVLDL-TAG. LPS significantly increased oleate oxidation and its deposition as cellular lipid (mostly as TAG) at 48hrs but abolished both oxidation and storage of VLDL-TAG. VLDL produced during  (eVLDL) was assimilated by the unstimulated macrophage to a greater extent than oleate or cVLDL-TAG and selectively stored as cellular lipids (no oxidation); LPS decreased eVLDL utilisation. VLDL-TAG utilisation was decreased by the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) inhibitor terahydrolipstatin. LPL activity was greater in oleate than in VLDL incubations, but was increased by incubation with eVLDL. LPS had no effect (oleate, cVLDL) or increased (eVLDL) LPL activity.VLDL represented an efficient substrate for the macrophage. However under conditions of sepsis/ eVLDL utilisation was limited and directed away from oxidation, suggesting that the increased plasma TAG (eVLDL) concentrations resulting from sepsis is not a respiratory fuel for the macrophage but may supply cellular lipid.Copyright 2002 S.

PGI(2) and NO were diminished and PGF(2α) levels, the PGI(2)/TXA(2) ratio and the intima/media ratio were increased in rabbits fed with HD. In conclusion, feeding HD for a short period increased ARA plasma levels and unbalanced release of vasodilator/vasoconstrictor PG redirected the pathway to vasoconstrictor metabolite release. These lipid metabolism alterations in addition to the reduced NO levels and the moderate changes in the vascular morphology contributed to the endothelial dysfunction in this animal model.

The post-synthetic addition of octylphosphonic  to /oleylamine-capped CsPbBr NCs promoted the attachment of octylphosphonate to the NC surface, while the remaining oleylammonium ligands maintained the high dispersability of the NCs in non-polar solvent. Through powerful 2D solid-state P-H NMR, we demonstrated that an ethyl acetate/acetonitrile purification regime was crucial for initiating the self-assembly of extensive octylphosphonate chains. Octylphosphonate ligands were found to preferentially bind in a monodentate mode through P-O, leaving polar P[double bond, length as m-dash]O and P-OH groups free to form inter-ligand hydrogen bonds. The octylphosphonate ligand network strongly passivated the nanocrystal surface, yielding a fully-purified CsPbBr NC ink with PLQY of 62%, over 3 times higher than untreated NCs. We translated this to LED devices, achieving maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance of 7.74% and 1022 cd m with OPA treatment, as opposed to 3.59% and 229 cd m for untreated CsPbBr NCs.

However, a better understanding of the ecophysiology of syntrophic LCFA-degrading microbial communities in anaerobic digesters is needed to develop operating strategies that mitigate inhibitory LCFA accumulation from FOG. In this research, DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) was coupled with metagenomic sequencing for a genome-centric comparison of oleate (C)-degrading populations in two anaerobic codigesters operated with either a pulse feeding or continuous-feeding strategy. The pulse-fed codigester microcosms converted oleate into methane at over 20% higher rates than the continuous-fed codigester microcosms. Differential coverage binning was demonstrated for the first time to recover population genome bins (GBs) from DNA-SIP metagenomes. About 70% of the C-enriched GBs were taxonomically assigned to the Syntrophomonas genus, thus substantiating the importance of Syntrophomonas species to LCFA degradation in anaerobic digesters. Phylogenetic comparisons of C-enriched GBs showed that phylogenetically distinct Syntrophomonas GBs were unique to each codigester. Overall, these results suggest that syntrophic populations in anaerobic digesters can have different adaptive capacities, and that selection for divergent populations may be achieved by adjusting reactor operating conditions to maximize biomethane recovery.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336948>Hypoxia Modulates Effects of Fatty Acids on NES2Y Human Pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty acids (FAs) induce apoptosis in the human pancreatic NES2Y β-cell line while unsaturated FAs have nearly no detrimental effect. Moreover, unsaturated FAs are capable of inhibiting the pro-apoptotic effect of saturated FAs. Hypoxia is also known to have deleterious effects on β-cells function and viability. In the present study, we have tested the modulatory effect of hypoxia on the effect of FAs on the growth and viability of the human pancreatic NES2Y β-cells. This study represents the first study testing hypoxia effect on effects of FAs in pancreatic β-cells as well as in other cell types. We showed that hypoxia increased the pro-apoptotic effect of saturated stearic  (SA). Endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling seemed to be involved while redistribution of FA transporters fatty  translocase/cluster of differentiation 36 (FAT/CD36) and fatty -binding protein (FABP) do not seem to be involved in this effect. Hypoxia also strongly decreased the protective effect of unsaturated  (OA) against the pro-apoptotic effect of SA. Thus, in the presence of hypoxia, OA was unable to save SA-treated β-cells from apoptosis induction. Hypoxia itself had only a weak detrimental effect on NES2Y cells. Our data suggest that hypoxia could represent an important factor in pancreatic β-cell death induced and regulated by FAs and thus in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29131231>A strain-induced exciton transition  shift in CdSe nanoplatelets: the impact of an organic ligand shell.</a></h2><p>We study the influence of surface passivating ligands on the optical and structural properties of zinc blende CdSe nanoplatelets.

Further the exciton reduced mass in these CdSe quantum wells is determined by a new method and this agrees well with the expected values substantiating that ligand-strain induced changes in the colloidal quantum well thickness are responsible for the observed spectral shifts.

Rates of , glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and free fatty  (FFA) oxidation as well as glycogen content were assessed in isolated EDL (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscles from female and male MLC-GLUT4 transgenic and control mice. In male MLC-GLUT4 EDL, increased glucose influx predominantly led to increased . In contrast, in female MLC-GLUT4 EDL increased glycogen synthesis was observed. In both sexes, GLUT4 overexpression resulted in decreased exogenous FFA oxidation rates. The decreased rate of FFA oxidation in male MLC-GLUT4 EDL was associated with increased lipid content in liver, but not in muscle or at the whole body level. To determine how changes in substrate metabolism and insulin action may influence energy balance in an environment that encouraged physical activity, we measured voluntary training activity, body weight, and food consumption of MLC-GLUT4 and control mice in cages equipped with training wheels. We observed a small decrease in body weight of MLC-GLUT4 mice that was paradoxically accompanied by a 45% increase in food consumption. The results were explained by a marked fourfold increase in voluntary wheel exercise. The changes in substrate metabolism and physical activity in MLC-GLUT4 mice were not associated with dramatic changes in skeletal muscle morphology. Collectively, results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of altering muscle substrate utilization by overexpression of GLUT4. The results also suggest that as a potential treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, increased skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression may provide benefits in addition to improvement of insulin action.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704984>Antibacterial activity of extracted bioactive molecules of Schinus terebinthifolius ripened fruits against some pathogenic bacteria.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work is to identify the chemical constituents and the bioactivity of essential oil (EO), acetone extract (ACE) and n-hexane extract (HexE) of S. terebinthifolius ripened fruits using GC-MS.

Rutin is a natural flavonoid with significant roles in combating cellular oxidative stress and regulating lipid metabolism. The current study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying rutin's hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Rutin treatment was applied to male C57BL/6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet and HepG2 cells challenged with . Hepatic lipid accumulation was evaluated by triglyceride assay and Oil Red O staining. Oxidative hepatic injury was assessed by malondialdehyde assay, superoxide dismutase assay and reactive  species assay. The expression levels of various lipogenic and lipolytic genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions. In addition, liver autophagy was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In both fat-challenged murine liver tissues and HepG2 cells, rutin treatment was shown to significantly lower triglyceride content and the abundance of lipid droplets. Rutin was also found to reduce cellular malondialdehyde level and restore superoxide dismutase activity in hepatocytes. Among the various lipid-related genes, rutin treatment was able to restore the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and its downstream targets, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and 2 (CPT-1 and CPT-2), while suppressing those of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), diglyceride acyltransfase 1 and 2 (DGAT-1 and 2), as well as acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, rutin was shown to repress the autophagic function of liver tissues by down-regulating key autophagy biomarkers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). The experimental data demonstrated that rutin could reduce triglyceride content and mitigate oxidative injuries in fat-enriched hepatocytes. The hypolipidemic properties of rutin could be attributed to its ability to simultaneously facilitate fatty  metabolism and inhibit lipogenesis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show that PPARdelta is the PPAR subtype expressed at the highest level in insulinoma cells and rat pancreatic islets. Furthermore, PPARdelta displays high transcriptional activity and acts in pronounced synergy with retinoid-X-receptor (RXR). Interestingly, unsaturated fatty acids mimic the effects of synthetic PPARdelta agonists. Using short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate that the ability of unsaturated fatty acids to stimulate fatty  metabolism is dependent on PPARdelta. Activation of PPARdelta increases the fatty  oxidation capacity in INS-1E beta-cells, enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from islets, and protects GSIS against adverse effects of prolonged fatty  exposure. The presented results indicate that the nuclear receptor PPARdelta is a fatty  sensor that adapts beta-cell mitochondrial function to long-term changes in unsaturated fatty  levels. As maintenance of mitochondrial metabolism is essential to preserve beta-cell function, these data indicate that dietary or pharmacological activation of PPARdelta and RXR may be beneficial in the prevention of beta-cell dysfunction.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158441>Effects of Antioxidants in Reducing Accumulation of Fat in Hepatocyte.</a></h2><p>The progress of the hepatic steatosis (HS), a clinicopathological status, is influenced by cellular oxidative stress, lipogenesis, fatty  (FA) oxidation, and inflammatory responses.

For this, we established an in vitro model using 1 mM  (OA) and human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells; 10 μM antioxidants were evaluated for their ability to reduce fat accumulation in hepatocytes. Our results showed that all three antioxidants were effective to reduce fat accumulation for the molecular targets such as reduction in lipid droplets, triglyceride (TG) concentration, reactive  species (ROS) production, and cell apoptosis, as well as in gene expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related effectors, lipogenesis, and inflammatory cytokines. There were simultaneous increases in diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging effect, cell survival, AMPK phosphorylation, NRF2-related gene expression for cellular defense, and FA β-oxidation. However, among these, ATX more effectively inhibited ER stress and lipogenesis at the intracellular level than VC or NAC. Consequently, ATX was also more effective in inhibiting cell death, lipotoxicity, and inflammation.

This effect is caused by the toxic properties of fatty acids on rumen microbial populations, coating of feed particles diminishing the accessibility for microbes, and a reduction in dry matter intake (DMI). The latter effect is caused by postabsorptive long-chain fatty acids eliciting anorexic signaling; however, whether circulating long-chain fatty acids affect rumen CH production alike is unknown. To approach this question, 5 rumen-cannulated Holstein cows in late lactation received 2 jugular catheters and were kept in respiration chambers to measure CH production and DMI for 48 h. In a crossover design, cows were intravenously infused with a 20% lipid emulsion (LIPO) or 0.9% NaCl (CON). The LIPO cows received 2.1 kg of triglycerides/d [0.152 ± 0.007 g of triglycerides/(kg of BW × h)] consisting of 12.1% palmitic , 4.2% stearic , 31.1% , and 52.7% linoleic . Blood and rumen fluid samples were taken hourly during the day. Results showed that LIPO compared with CON infusion increased plasma triglyceride as well as free fatty  and serotonin concentrations but reduced the proportion of de novo synthesized milk fatty acids (sum of C6 to C16). Daily CH production and DMI were lower, whereas daily CH yield (CH/DMI) was greater in LIPO than CON cows, although CH yield decreased from d 1 to d 2 by 2 to 14% in LIPO-infused cows only. This effect was associated with a higher (acetate + butyrate)/propionate ratio, tending lower propionate concentrations between 24 and 34 h of infusion, reduced relative abundances of genera belonging to Succinivibrio, Ruminococcaceae, and Ruminiclostridium, and greater relative Bacteroidetes genus abundances in the rumen.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

In addition, OA increased the levels of MDA, TNF-α, and IL-1β, as well as MPO activity in lung tissues (P < 0.05). However, after treatment with HSS, all of these changes were alleviated (P < 0.05), and these changes were mitigated when treated with HSS by ip then iv injection (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MDA level and MPO activity were positively correlated with TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the lung tissue, respectively (P < 0.01).HSS attenuated ALI induced by OA in rats and might protect against ALI through selective resistance to oxidation and inhibiting inflammatory infiltration.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9748733>[Fatty  composition of plasma phosphatidylcholine and levels of lipids and lipoproteins in hyperlipoproteinemia.

The objective of the present study was to assess how the fatty  composition in plasma phosphatidyl choline affects the total and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride and apolipoprotein B concentrations in subjects with primary hyperlipoproteinaemia and dyslipidaemia.In a group of 142 subjects with primary hyperlipoproteinaemia and dyslipidaemia the concentrations of plasma lipids, lipoproteins apolipoproteins and fatty acids in plasma phosphatidyl choline (PC) were assessed. The authors provided evidence by discriminant analysis where the dependent variables were the lower quintiles (Q1 + Q2) and the upper quintiles (Q4 + Q5) of concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B and the independent variables were FA concentrations in plasma PC, that the total cholesterol concentration was inversely associated with the concentration of docosahexaenic  (22:6n-3). The concentration of LDL-cholesterol correlated inversely with the concentration of palmitoleic  (16:1n-7). Triglyceridaemia was inversely associated with the linoleic  concentration (18:2n-6). The concentration of apolipoprotein B correlated positively with myristic  (14:0) and negatively with concentrations of  (18:1n-9) and linoleic  (18:2n-6).The submitted results indicate that the fatty  concentrations of PC in plasma are significantly and markedly correlated with concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B.

Dietary vitamin A restriction has been suggested to specifically promote IMF, whereas a polymorphism of the () gene has shown to specifically increase MUFA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effects of provitamin A (PVA) carotenoid intake and genotype (>) on hepatic retinoid content and on the , muscle (LM and gluteus medius [GM]), and subcutaneous fat (SF) content and   composition. Following a split-plot design, 32 castrated Duroc pigs, half of each of the 2 homozygous genotypes (CC and TT), were subjected from 165 to 195 d of age to 2 finishing diets differing in the PVA carotenoid content (an enriched-carotene diet [C+] and a control diet [C-]). Both diets were identical except for the corn line used in the feed. The C+ was formulated with 20% of a carotenoid-fortified corn (M37W-Ph3) whereas the C- instead used 20% of its near isogenic M37W line, which did not contain PVA carotenoids. No vitamin A was added to the diets. The C- was estimated to provide, at most, 1,300 IU of vitamin A/kg and the C+ to supply an extra amount of at least 800 IU vitamin A/kg. Compared with the pigs fed the C-, pigs fed with C+ had 3-fold more retinoic  ( < 0.01) and 4-fold more gene expression in the  ( = 0.06).

The mechanisms by which the risk variants cause kidney damage, although not well-understood, are believed to involve injury to glomerular podocytes. The intracellular localization and function of APOL1 in podocytes remain unclear, with recent studies suggesting possible roles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), , endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes. Here, we demonstrate that APOL1 also localizes to intracellular lipid droplets (LDs). While a large fraction of risk variant APOL1 (G1 and G2) localizes to the ER, a significant proportion of wild-type APOL1 (G0) localizes to LDs. APOL1 transiently interacts with numerous organelles, including the ER, , and endosomes. Treatment of cells that promote LD formation with  shifted the localization of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, with accompanying reduction of autophagic flux and cytotoxicity. Coexpression of G0 APOL1 with risk variant APOL1 enabled recruitment of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, accompanied by reduced cell death. The ability of G0 APOL1 to recruit risk variant APOL1 to LDs may help explain the recessive pattern of kidney disease inheritance. These studies establish APOL1 as a bona fide LD-associated protein, and reveal that recruitment of risk variant APOL1 to LDs reduces cell toxicity, autophagic flux, and cell death. Thus, interventions that divert APOL1 risk variants to LDs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate their cytotoxic effects.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28173868>Docosahexaenoic  increases accumulation of adipocyte triacylglycerol through up-regulation of lipogenic gene expression in pigs.</a></h2><p>Changing dietary fatty  composition in modern diet influences the prevalence of . Increasing evidences suggest favorable effects of n-3 PUFA for protecting against  and the metabolic syndrome. However, the regulation of n-3 PUFA in adipose is still unclear. Thus, this study addressed metabolism of different dietary fats in the adipose tissue of porcine model.Eight-week-old cross-bred pigs were randomly assigned to three groups and fed a 2% fat diet for 30 days from either soybean oil (SBO), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or beef tallow. An in vitro experiment was conducted in which linoleic  (LA), DHA or  (OA) were added to represent the major fatty  in the SBO-, DHA- or BT- diets, respectively. Adipocytes size and lipid metabolism related genes were analyzed.Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) was lower in DHA- than in BT-fed pigs, and the product of lipolysis, glycerol was highest in BT-fed pigs. In addition, expression of the lipolytic genes, adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase was higher in BT-fed pigs and with OA treatment in vitro. DHA promoted protein kinase A activity in pigs without affecting lipolytic genes. Adipocyte cell sizes, TAG content and expression of lipogenic-related genes including, adipose differentiated related protein (ADRP) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) were elevated by DHA in vivo and in vitro, indicating DHA promoted adipogenesis to trap TAG in adipose tissue. Fatty  β-oxidation genes were increased in the DHA-fed pigs.This effect was partly explained by the effect of DHA to promote adipogenesis to trap TAG in adipocytes and also increase expression of genes involved in adipocyte fatty  oxidation. Therefore, our results suggest a direct effect of DHA on adipocyte metabolism, resulting in TAG turnover and fatty  dissipation to facilitate plasma lipid uptake from the circulation.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23394493>Increased oxidative stress and coenzyme Q10 deficiency in juvenile fibromyalgia: amelioration of hypercholesterolemia and fatigue by ubiquinol-10 supplementation.</a></h2><p>Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by generalized pain and chronic fatigue of unknown etiology. To evaluate the role of oxidative stress in this disorder, we measured plasma levels of ubiquinone-10, ubiquinol-10, free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol esters (CE), and free fatty acids (FFA) in patients with juvenile FM (n=10) and in healthy control subjects (n=67). Levels of FC and CE were significantly increased in juvenile FM as compared with controls, suggesting the presence of hypercholesterolemia in this disease. However, plasma level of ubiquinol-10 was significantly decreased and the ratio of ubiquinone-10 to total coenzyme Q10 (%CoQ10) was significantly increased in juvenile FM relative to healthy controls, suggesting that FM is associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, plasma level of FFA was significantly higher and the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in total FFA was significantly lower in FM than in controls, suggesting increased tissue oxidative damage in juvenile FM. Interestingly, the content of monoenoic acids, such as  and palmitoleic acids, was significantly increased in FM relative to controls, probably to compensate for the loss of PUFA. Next, we examined the effect of ubiquinol-10 supplementation (100 mg/day for 12 weeks) in FM patients. This resulted in an increase in coenzyme Q10 levels and a decrease in %CoQ10. No changes were observed in FFA levels or their composition. However, plasma levels of FC and CE significantly decreased and the ratio of FC to CE also significantly decreased, suggesting that ubiquinol-10 supplementation improved cholesterol metabolism.

This has been well described in liver, where LC n-3 PUFA modulate the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. However, the complexity of biological pathway modulations and the nature of bioactive molecules are still under investigation. The present study aimed to investigate the dose-response effects of LC n-3 PUFA on the production of peroxidised metabolites, as potential bioactive molecules, and on global gene expression in liver. Hypercholesterolaemic rabbits received by daily oral administration (7 weeks) either -rich oil or a mixture of oils providing 0.1, 0.5 or 1 % (groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively) of energy as DHA. Levels of specific peroxidised metabolites, namely 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE)-protein adducts, issued from LC n-3 PUFA were measured by GC/MS/MS in liver in parallel to transcription profiling. The intake of LC n-3 PUFA increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the hepatic production of 4-HHE. At the highest dose, LC n-3 PUFA provoked an accumulation of TAG in liver, which can be directly linked to increased mRNA levels of lipoprotein hepatic receptors (LDL-receptor and VLDL-receptor). In groups 1 and 2, the mRNA levels of microsomal TAG transfer protein decreased, suggesting a possible new mechanism to reduce VLDL secretion. These modulations of genes related to lipoprotein metabolism were independent of PPARα signalling but were probably linked to the activation of the farnesol X receptor pathway by LC n-3 PUFA and/or their metabolites such as HHE.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16691318>Decreased bodyweight without rebound and regulated lipoprotein metabolism by gymnemate in genetic multifactor syndrome animal.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to find obesity control method without rebound.

Two amide prodrugs of sobetirome were shown to be efficient substrates of FAAH with V/K values comparable to the natural endocannabinoid FAAH substrate anandamide. In mice, a systemic dose of sobetirome prodrug leads to a substantial ∼60-fold increase in brain distribution (K) of sobetirome compared to an equimolar systemic dose of the parent drug. The increased delivery of sobetirome to the brain from the prodrug was diminished by both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of FAAH in vivo. The increased brain exposure of sobetirome arising from the prodrug corresponds to ∼30-fold increased potency in brain target engagement compared to the parent drug. These results suggest that FAAH-targeted prodrugs can considerably increase drug exposure to the CNS with a concomitant decrease in systemic drug levels generating a desirable distribution profile for CNS acting drugs.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9622272>Divergent responses of the liver to increased delivery of glucose or fatty acids: implications for the pathogenesis of type IV hyperlipoproteinemia.</a></h2><p>This study examines the patterns of response of primary cultures of hamster hepatocytes to increased delivery of glucose or oleate. Increased glucose in the medium produced: (1) increased triglyceride in the cells and the medium; (2) no change in cholesterol ester in the cells or the medium; (3) no change in apo B100 secreted into the medium; (4) more apo B100 particles within the VLDL range with an increase in the VLDL triglyceride to apo B100 ratio. By contrast, increased oleate in the medium resulted in: (1) increased triglyceride in the cells and the medium; (2) increased cholesterol ester in the cells and the medium; and (3) increased apo B100 secreted into the medium. Important differences in the intracellular metabolism of triglyceride and cholesterol ester were also documented. Under all circumstances, there was substantially more radiolabelled triglyceride (overall eight times more) in the cell than in the medium, indicating that up to 90% of the newly synthesized triglyceride enters the cellular pool rather than being secreted with apo B100. By contrast, almost half of the newly synthesized cholesterol ester molecules were secreted with apo B100, pointing to an equal probability of entering the cell storage pool as opposed to being secreted. The data establish therefore two patterns of response of the liver to increased triglyceride synthesis depending on whether the substrate drive is glucose or oleate.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19256553>Effect of polyphenol-rich extract from walnut on diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia in mice via enhancement of fatty  oxidation in the liver.</a></h2><p>The kernel pellicles of walnut are rich in ellagitannins with antioxidative activity. A polyphenol-rich extract from walnuts (WP, 45% polyphenol) was prepared and evaluated for its hypolipidemic effect in high fat diet fed mice. Oral administration of WP (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly reduced liver weight and liver and serum triglycerides (TG). Hepatic beta-oxidation in cytosol, including peroxisome, was enhanced by WP (50-200 mg/kg). mRNA expressions of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and acyl coenzyme A oxidase (ACOX) 1 were enhanced by WP (50-200 mg/kg). With respect to the hypotriglyceridemic mechanism of WP, it suppressed neither olive oil induced serum TG elevation in mice nor  induced TG accumulation in HepG2 cells. On the other hand, mRNA expressions of PPARalpha, ACOX1, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1A in HepG2 cells were significantly enhanced by addition of WP (100 microg/mL). Moreover, tellimagrandin I, a polyphenolic constituent in WP, enhanced ACOX1 expression at 1-100 microg/mL. In conclusion, WP was found to possess hypotriglyceridemic activity via enhancement of peroxisomal fatty  beta-oxidation in the liver. These results suggest that tellimagrandin I is involved in the hypotriglyceridemic mechanism of WP.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690249>Identification of novel serum biomarker for the detection of acute myeloid leukemia based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a life-threatening hematological malignancy.

Hence we were interested in the behaviour of fatty  binding protein under conditions of elevated urea (up to 200 mM) and potassium chloride such as exist during estivation. Also we examined whether there were interactions between glycolytic intermediates and the binding ability of the protein. The amount of bound fatty  (a fluorescence assay using cis-parinarate) was not affected (P < 0.05) by glucose, fructose 6-phosphate or phosphoenolpyruvate at physiological concentrations.

Ultrasound pretreatment is a mechanical cell disruption method that has been shown to enhance lipid recovery from algae due to cavitation effects that disrupt algae cell walls. In this study, a locally grown mixture of Chlorella vulgaris/Cyanobacteria leptolyngbya was sonicated in an ultrasonic reactor with a clamp-on transducer prior to solvent lipid extraction. This configuration allows for a non-contact delivery method of ultrasonic  with improved operational advantages (no fouling of transducer, continuous operation, and fully scalable design). A central composite design (CCD) was implemented to statistically analyze and evaluate the effect of ultrasonic power (350-750 W) and treatment time (5-30 min) on lipid yield. Lipid recovery was found to increase with both ultrasonic power and treatment time. Total lipid yields (on dry biomass basis) extracted via the Bligh and Dyer method from Chlorella vulgaris/cyanobacteria co-culture ranged from 8.3% for untreated algae to 16.9% for algae sonicated with 750 W power for 30 min, which corresponds to more than a doubling of lipid recovery due to ultrasound pretreatment. Increased power and treatment times were found to increase the degree of cell disruption as observed in the SEM and TEM images after ultrasonic pretreatment. Additionally, hexane (1:1 v/v) was evaluated as an alternative to the standard Bligh & Dyer (2:2:1.8 v/v/v chloroform/methanol/cell suspension) lipid extraction solvent system. On average, the Bligh and Dyer method extracted on average over twice the amount of lipids compared to hexane extraction. The lipid profile of the algae extracts indicates high concentrations of lauric  (12:0), palmitic  (16:0), stearic  (18:0),  (18:1), and linoleic  (18:2). This particular configuration of an ultrasonic system proved to be a viable method for the pretreatment of algae for enhanced lipid yields.

In this work, a selective process using carbon feast-famine cycles was applied to obtain an indigenous microbial community of hydrocarbon-degrading and lipid-accumulating bacteria, using a real lubricant-based wastewater as carbon source. In the conditions applied, the enriched bacterial community, dominated by members of the genus Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, was able to degrade almost all hydrocarbons present in the wastewater within 24 h' incubation and to accumulate, although in low levels, triacylglycerol (TAG) (<5% of cell dry  (CDW)) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.8% ± 1.1% of the CDW) as well as an unknown lipid (29% ± 6% of CDW), presumably a wax ester-like compound. The influence of culture conditions, namely carbon and nitrogen concentrations (and C/N ratio) and cultivation time, on the amount and profile of produced storage compounds was further assessed using a statistical approach based on a central composite circumscribed design and surface response methodology. The regression analysis of the experimental design revealed that only nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio are significant for neutral lipid biosynthesis (p < 0.05). Maximum neutral lipid content, i.e. 33% (CDW basis), was achieved for the lowest carbon and nitrogen concentrations evaluated (10 g COD L and 0.02 g N L). PHA accounted for less than 5% of CDW. In these conditions, neutral lipid content was mainly composed by TAG, about 70% (w/w). TAG precursors, namely monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG) and fatty acids (FA), accounted for 22% of total neutral lipids and WE for about 7%. Nevertheless, according to the applied response surface model, further improvement of neutral lipids content is still possible if even lower nitrogen concentrations are used. The fatty acids detected in TAG extracts ranged from myristic  (C14:0) to linoleic  (C18:2), being the most abundant palmitic  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0) and  (C18:1). This study shows the feasibility of combining treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated wastewater, herein demonstrated for lubricant-based wastewater, with the production of bacterial neutral lipids using open mixed bacterial communities. This approach can decrease the costs associated to both processes and contribute to a more sustainable waste management and production of lipid-based biofuels.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Breeds with high tolerance to SWL are relevant to understand the physiological responses to pasture scarcity so they could be used in programs for animal breeding. In the Canary Islands there are two dairy goat breeds with different levels of tolerance to SWL: the Palmera, susceptible to SWL; and the Majorera, tolerant to SWL. Fat is one of the milk components most affected by environmental and physiological conditions. This study hypothesises that feed-restriction affects Majorera and Palmera breeds differently, leading to different fatty  profiles in the mammary gland and milk. An interaction between breed and feed-restriction was observed in the mammary gland. Feed-restriction was associated with an increase in  and a decrease in palmitic  percentage in the Palmera breed whereas no differences were observed in the Majorera breed. Palmitic and  acids together constituted around 60% of the total fatty acids identified, which suggests that Palmera breed is more susceptible to SWL. In milk, feed-restriction affected both breeds similarly. Regarding the interaction of the breed with the treatment, we also observed similar responses in both breeds, but this influence affects only around 2% of the total fatty acids. In general, Majorera breed is more tolerant to feed-restriction.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30132841>Peroxidase expression is decreased by palmitate in cultured podocytes but increased in podocytes of advanced diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>High levels of serum free fatty acids (FFAs) are associated with lipotoxicity and type 2 . Palmitic  (PA) is the predominant circulating saturated FFA. PA induces mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H O  ) generation in cultured podocytes. To elucidate the role of PA in antioxidant defense systems in diabetic nephropathy (DN), cultured podocytes were exposed to 250 μM PA for 1-24 hr, and protein expressions of catalase, peroxiredoxins (Prxs), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were examined by western blot analysis. PA induced an early transient increase in the Prx1, Prx2, and GPx1 levels in podocytes, but not catalase. Long-term exposure of PA to podocytes significantly decreased the protein levels of Prx1, Prx2, GPx1, and catalase. Coincubation of PA-treated cells with , however, restored the expression of these proteins. In advanced human diabetic glomeruli, H O generation was elevated as shown by increased fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein. Strong immunostaining for Prx1, Prx2, GPx1, and catalase was observed in the podocytes of advanced human DN, wherein transforming growth factor-β1 staining was also positive. These results suggest that podocytes are susceptible to PA-induced oxidative damage with impaired peroxidase activity and that peroxidases have futile antioxidant effects in the podocytes in the late stages of DN.

Elongation of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL) family member 6 (Elovl6) is a microsomal enzyme that regulates the elongation of C12-16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs).

The feeding trail lasted for 90 d before and during the spawning season. Fish were reared in a flowing seawater system and fed to apparent satiation twice daily. Compared with diet D:E-0·68, diet D:E-1·09 significantly enhanced the oestradiol production in females, whereas diet D:E-2·05 significantly enhanced the testosterone production in males. In ovaries, diet D:E-1·09 induced highest mRNA expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). In testes, diet 2·05 resulted in highest mRNA expression of FSHR, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450c17 and 3β-HSD. Fatty  profiles in fish tissues reflected closely those of diets. Female fish had more gonadal EPA content but less DHA content than male fish, whereas there was a reverse observation in liver. In conclusion, the dietary DHA:EPA ratio, possibly combined with the dietary EPA:arachidonic  ratio, differentially regulated sex steroid hormone synthesis in mature female and male tongue soles. Females seemed to require more EPA but less DHA for the gonadal steroidogenesis than males. The results are beneficial to sex-specific nutritive strategies in domestic teleost.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388381>Modification of gene expression in rat cardiomyocytes by linoleic and docosahexaenoic acids .</a></h2><p>Regulation of cardiac fatty  metabolism is central to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We investigated the effects of select fatty acids on the expression of genes involved in immediate early as well as inflammatory and hypertrophic responses in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiac remodeling begins with upregulation of immediate early genes for c-fos and c-jun, followed by upregulation of inflammatory genes for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). At later stages, genes involved in hypertrophic responses, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are upregulated. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were treated with palmitic , a saturated fatty ; , a monounsaturated fatty ; linoleic , a polyunsaturated fatty  belonging to the n-6 class; and docosahexaenoic , a polyunsaturated fatty  belonging to the n-3 class. Linoleic  produced a greater increase in the mRNA expression of c-fos, c-jun, NF-κB, NFAT3, ANP, and BNP relative to palmitic  and . In contrast, docosahexaenoic  caused a decrease in the expression of genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy.

We previously showed that HO-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca]) in lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) involve the membrane Ca channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) and that inhibiting this channel attenuated HO-induced barrier disruption in vitro. We also showed that phosphorylation of TRPV4 by the Src family kinase, Fyn, contributes to HO-induced Ca influx in LMVEC. In endothelial cells, Fyn is tethered to the cell membrane by CD36, a fatty  transporter. In this study, we assessed the effect of genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of CD36 on Ca responses to HO HO-induced Ca influx was attenuated in LMVEC isolated from mice lacking CD36 (CD36). TRPV4 expression and function was unchanged in LMVEC isolated from wild-type (WT) and CD36 mice, as well as mice with deficiency for Fyn (Fyn). TRPV4 immunoprecipitated with Fyn, but this interaction was decreased in CD36 LMVEC. The amount of phosphorylated TRPV4 was decreased in LMVEC from CD36 mice compared with WT controls. Loss of CD36 altered subcellular localization of Fyn, while inhibition of CD36 fatty  transport with succinimidyl oleate did not attenuate HO-induced Ca influx. Lastly, we found that CD36 mice were protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that CD36 plays an important role in HO-mediated lung injury and that the mechanism may involve CD36-dependent scaffolding of Fyn to the cell membrane to facilitate TRPV4 phosphorylation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836699>The -targeted imidazole substituted  'TPP-IOA' affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and its protective efficacy in cells is influenced by cellular dependence on aerobic metabolism.</a></h2><p>A variety of -targeted small molecules have been invented to manipulate mitochondrial redox activities and improve function in certain disease states. 3-Hydroxypropyl-triphenylphosphonium-conjugated imidazole-substituted  (TPP-IOA) was developed as a specific inhibitor of cytochrome c peroxidase activity that inhibits apoptosis by preventing cardiolipin oxidation and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. Here we evaluate the effects of TPP-IOA on oxidative phosphorylation in isolated  and on mitochondrial function in live cells. We demonstrate that, at concentrations similar to those required to achieve inhibition of cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation in isolated . In live SH-SY5Y cells, TPP-IOA partially collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential, caused extensive fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, and decreased apparent mitochondrial abundance within 3h of exposure. Many cultured cell lines rely primarily on aerobic glycolysis, potentially making them less sensitive to small molecules disrupting oxidative phosphorylation. We therefore determined the anti-apoptotic efficacy of TPP-IOA in SH-SY5Y cells growing in glucose or in galactose, the latter of which increases reliance on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP supply. The anti-apoptotic activity of TPP-IOA that was observed in glucose media was not seen in galactose media. It therefore appears that, at concentrations required to inhibit cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation. In light of these data it is predicted that potential future therapeutic applications of TPP-IOA will be restricted to highly glycolytic cell types with limited reliance on oxidative phosphorylation.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have shown the effects of specific dietary fatty acids (FAs) on intestinal , but little is known about the effect of the stereospecifically numbered sn-2 position in triglycerides (TG) of human milk on the gut microbiome of infants. This study aimed at examining possible effects of sn-2 FAs of human milk on the gut microbial development of breastfeeding babies. Sn-2 FAs and intestinal  were assessed by GC-MS and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. The results showed that breast milk from mothers in China contained ten major sn-2 FAs dominated by palmitic  (C, 54.42%),  (C n-9, 14.95%), linoleic  (LA, C n-6, 12.81%), myristic  (C, 4.50%) and C (3.17%). Total long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) decreased from colostrum to mature milk, while total saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed no significant difference during lactation. A significant association between sn-2 FAs in milk and infant gut  was found between decanoic  (C), myristic  (C), stearic  (C), C, arachidonic  (AA, C n-6), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C n-3) with Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. These microbes were involved in short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production and other functions, and significantly increased at 13-15 d after breastfeeding was initiated. C and DHA were relevant to most of the microbes. This study demonstrated the relatively steady profiles of sn-2 FAs in breast milk and gut  of infants, together with their correlation during the breastfeeding period.

Olive oil is mostly composed of the monounsaturated fatty  omega-9. We showed omega-9 protects septic mice modulating lipid metabolism. Sepsis is initiated by the host response to infection with organ damage, increased plasma free fatty acids, high levels of cortisol, massive cytokine production, leukocyte activation, and endothelial dysfunction. We aimed to analyze the effect of omega-9 supplementation on corticosteroid unbalance, , bacterial elimination, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma expression, an omega-9 receptor and inflammatory modulator. We treated mice for 14 days with omega-9 and induced sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We measured systemic corticosterone levels, cytokine production, leukocyte and bacterial counts in the peritoneum, and the expression of PPAR gamma in both liver and adipose tissues during experimental sepsis. We further studied omega-9 effects on leukocyte rolling in mouse cremaster muscle-inflamed postcapillary venules and in the cerebral microcirculation of septic mice. Here, we demonstrate that omega-9 treatment is associated with increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decreased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1 in peritoneal lavage fluid of mice with sepsis. Omega-9 treatment also decreased systemic corticosterone levels. Neutrophil migration from circulation to the peritoneal cavity and leukocyte rolling on the endothelium were decreased by omega-9 treatment. Omega-9 also decreased bacterial load in the peritoneal lavage and restored liver and adipose tissue PPAR gamma expression in septic animals. Our data suggest a beneficial anti-inflammatory role of omega-9 in sepsis, mitigating leukocyte rolling and leukocyte influx, balancing cytokine production, and controlling bacterial growth possibly through a PPAR gamma expression-dependent mechanism.

The body's inability to store zinc necessarily requires a constant dietary supply to avoid alteration of physiological functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary enrichment with zinc on chemical-nutritional and aromatic properties of milk and cheese. Thirty commercial dairy cows, balanced for parity, milk production, and days in milk, were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The control group was fed with a conventional complete diet (22 kg of dry matter/animal per day), whereas the experimental group received a daily zinc supplementation of 60 mg per kg of dry complete feed. During the experimental period, the milk yield was monitored and samples of milk and caciotta cheese were collected to obtain information about the chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile. Dietary zinc integration did not influence milk yield and composition, but induced a marked reduction of somatic cell count and improved the oxidative stability of ripened caciotta cheese. In both milk and cheese, the experimental group samples were characterized by a lower concentration of saturated   and an increase in , vaccenic , and rumenic . The aromatic profile of dairy products was also positively affected by dietary zinc intake, with an increase in concentration of carboxylic , aldehydes, and esters. The present results suggest a positive role of zinc in improving animal health and nutraceutical properties of milk and corresponding cheese. Taking into account the analysis of  compounds, zinc dietary supplementation of dairy cows should contribute to the production of cheeses with interesting organoleptic properties, although more studies are necessary to confirm the consumer acceptability of these changes.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The four precursor fatty acids are metabolized (through desaturation and chain elongation) to form the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The principal fatty acids derived from linoleic  are arachidonic , which contains four double bonds (tetraene) and dihomogamma linolenic , whereas products formed from linolenic  are eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic . The major products from palmitoleic and  acids are the 20 carbon fatty acids with three double bonds (triene). In the presence of adequate dietary amounts of essential fatty acids, tetraene products predominate in plasma. When the intakes of both linoleic and linolenic acids are low, triene formation is high and hence the triene/tetraene ratio in plasma is used to assess the index of essential fatty  deficiency. The polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from essential fatty acids serve as cellular membrane phospholipid components which can influence the physicochemical characteristics of the lipid bilayer.

Hyperlipidemia, which is characterized by the excess accumulation of lipid contents in the bloodstream, may lead to several cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, in this study, anti-hyperlipidemic potential of U. macrocarpa water extract (UME) was examined in vitro and in vivo using HepG2 cells and experimental rats, respectively. The hyperlipidemia in experimental rats was induced by the high-cholesterol diet (HCD) followed by oral administration of various concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) of UME for 6 weeks. As a result, the UME significantly improved the biochemical parameters such as increased the level of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as reduced the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HCD-fed rats. In addition, UME also prevented lipid accumulation through regulating AMPK activity and lipid  proteins (ACC, SREBP1 and HMGCR) in the HCD-fed rats as compared to the controls. Moreover, similar pattern of gene expression levels was confirmed in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells.

Little is known about the association of TFA with brain or mental health. In this study, we examined the associations of objectively-measured plasma TFA concentrations with depression in a large population-based cross-sectional study among U.S. adults.We included 2136 non-pregnant participants aged 20 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. Four major TFAs, including palmitelaidic  (C16:1n-7t), elaidic  (C18:1n-9t), vaccenic  (C18:1n-7t), and linoelaidic  (C18:2n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9.Participants with depressive symptoms had a higher plasma concentration of total TFA compared with those without depressive symptoms (6.6 vs 6.0 μmol/g lipids, P = 0.046). After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratio (OR) of depressive symptoms comparing the highest with lowest tertile of TFAs was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.86-2.39) for total TFAs (P for trend 0.15). For each individual type of TFA, the corresponding OR was 1.78 (1.03-3.07) for elaidic  (P for trend 0.049), 1.23 (0.76-2.00) for linoelaidic  (P for trend 0.37), 1.19 (0.75-1.87) for palmitelaidic  (P for trend 0.46), and 1.20 (0.75-1.94) for vaccenic  (P for trend 0.43).The cross-sectional study design limited causal inferences of the findings.In a nationally representative population, plasma elaidic , a major trans fatty , was positively associated with depressive symptoms in adults.

Aqueous suspensions of both solids at pH 7.4 showed negligible payload release whereas a marked delivery was observed in the presence of sodium dithionite due to the rupture of the azo bonds. Besides, a moderate cargo release was observed at acidic pH due to the hydrolysis of the urea bonds that linked the azo derivative onto the external surface of the inorganic scaffolds. In vitro digestion models showed that S1 and S2 microparticles could be used for the controlled release of payload in the reducing colon environment (in which azoreductase enzymes are present).

The performance of S2 microparticles for the treatment of colitis in rats (induced by oral administration of a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  solution) was tested. The controlled release of hydrocortisone from S2 in the colon of injured rats induced marked reduction in colon/ ratio and in clinical activity score.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates lipid metabolism are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated adipogenesis by inhibiting lipid accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty  (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]- (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial  consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes.

They are unlikely capable to manifest pleiotropic effect.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 and its analog exendin-4 can ameliorate certain aspects of this syndrome by inducing  loss and reducing hepatic triglyceride accumulation, but it is unclear whether these effects result from the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 on the pancreas, or from direct action on the liver. This study investigated the direct action and putative cellular mechanism of exendin-4 on steatotic hepatocytes in culture. Steatosis was induced in cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells by incubation in media supplemented with 2 mM each of linoleic  and . Steatotic hepatocytes were then pre-incubated in the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 for 30 min, then treated with exendin-4 over a period of 24 h. Cell viability and triglyceride content were characterized by a TUNEL assay and AdipoRed staining, respectively. Our results showed that steatotic cells maintained high levels of intracellular triglycerides (80%) compared to lean controls (25%). Exendin-4 treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular triglyceride content after 12 h that persisted through 24 h, while protein kinase A inhibitors abolished the effects of exendin-4. The results demonstrate the exendin-4 induces a partial reduction in triglycerides in steatotic hepatocytes within 12 h via the GLP-1 receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase A.

During NAFLD pathogenesis, changes in blood and liver contents of different fatty  types also vary. Cytochrome P450 2A5 (CYP2A5), an important enzyme in mouse liver, metabolizes many drugs and activates multiple pro-carcinogens with widely varying structures. According to the changes in liver fatty  profiles observed in NAFLD animal models developed in our laboratory and others, saturated (PA/palmitic, and SA/stearic acids) and unsaturated (OA/, LA/linoleic, ALA/α-linolenic and AA/arachidonic acids) fatty acids were selected to induce mouse primary hepatocytes, at concentrations under 1 mM, as detected by MTT assay. After 24 h treatment with various fatty  concentrations and types, CYP2A5 mRNA and protein amounts, and enzyme activity were determined by real-time PCR, Western blot, and Coumarin 7-hydroxylation, respectively. Meanwhile, Nrf2 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot. The results indicated that saturated fatty acids are more potent in inducing CYP2A5 than unsaturated ones, except arachidonic . In addition, the changes in CYP2A5 expression were consistent with the alterations observed in Nrf2 expression, indicating that Nrf2 might play a regulatory role in CYP2A5 expression.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216387>Lipid profile changes in erythrocyte membranes of women with diagnosed GDM.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a glucose intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy. It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty  profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty  methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic  significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the  and vaccenic  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic  levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis-vaccenic  concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty  profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18321586>Synthesis and antioxidative activity of metalloporphyrins bearing 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol pendants.</a></h2><p>The novel metalloporphyrins (M=HH, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn) bearing 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol pendants as antioxidant substituents, and a long chain hydrocarbon palmitoyl group have been synthesized. The oxidation of compounds by PbO2 leads to the formation of the corresponding 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxyl radicals studied by EPR. The activity of porphyrins in lipid peroxidation has been examined using (1) in vitro lipid peroxidation induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide in respiring rat liver , (2) in vitro lipid peroxidation in liver homogenates of Wistar strain rats, and (3) a model process of peroxidation of (Z)-octadec-9-enic ()  as a structural fragment of lipids. The activity of these compounds depends dramatically on the nature of metal and might be changed from antioxidative (M=HH, Mn, Cu, Zn) to indifferent (M=Co), and to pro-oxidative one (M=Fe).

Preincubation with EPA or AA partially prevented the TNFα-induced decrease of ∆ψ. Incubation with AA resulted in up-regulation of the Cx43 gene expression. AA or PA significantly increased Cx43 protein content; however, presence of TNFα in general aggravated the negative effect of FFA. Only EPA was found to increase ATP generation in HUVECs. The fatty -specific induction of changes in Cx43 expression and protein concentration as well as the normalization of ∆ψ and increase of ATP generation seem to be the separate, independent mechanisms of FFA-mediated modulatory effect in the human endothelial cells pathology.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864855>Fermented  Extract Ameliorates Hepatosteatosis via Activation of Fatty  Oxidation.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a progressive disease involving the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver.

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and . Saturated palmitic  impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated  did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic  induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation.

Its mild-to-moderate form, representing approximately 80% of the total cases, is treated by topical application, with corticosteroid being the standard treatment. However, in case of , no single treatment works for every patient and optimizing topical therapy is a key aspect. A possible alternative is represented by cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant cyclic peptide administered orally in the treatment of the severe form. Its topical application could avoid the problems related to systemic immunosuppression, but the unfavourable physico-chemical properties (MW: 1202 Da; LogP ≈ 3) hinder its permeation across the stratum corneum. The aim of the paper was the preparation, characterization and ex-vivo evaluation of cyclosporine loaded microemulsions using  as oil phase, either Tween80 or a soluble derivative of vitamin E (TPGS) as surfactants and either Transcutol, propylene glycol or 1,3 propanediol as co-surfactants. The issue of formulation viscosity was also addressed 1) by evaluating the thickening of Tween80-based microemulsions by direct addition of different rheological modifiers, 2) by building pseudo-ternary phase diagrams using TPGS, to identify the water/oil/surfactants proportions resulting in viscous self-gelifying systems. Nine formulations (five Tween80-based and four TPGS-based) were selected, characterized in terms of droplets size (low viscosity systems) or rheological properties (high viscosity systems), loaded with 6 mg/g cyclosporine and applied ex-vivo on porcine skin for 22 h. A relevant skin accumulation was obtained either with a low-viscosity Tween80-based microemulsion (9.78 ± 3.86 µg/cm), or with a high viscosity TPGS-based microemulsion (18.3 ± 5.69 µg/cm), with an increase of about 3 and 6 times respectively for comparison with a control cyclosporine solution in propylene glycol. The role of water content, surfactant, co-surfactant and viscosity was also addressed and discussed. The kinetic of skin uptake from the best performing formulation was finally evaluated, highlighting a relatively quick skin uptake and the achievement, after 2 h of contact, of potentially therapeutic cyclosporine skin concentrations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This condition is associated with dyslipidemia and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Circulating levels of triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) have not yet been consistently defined in severe arthritis. Similarly, the metabolism of these lipids in the arthritic liver has not yet been clarified. Aiming at filling these gaps this study presents a characterization of the circulating lipid profile and of the fatty acids uptake and metabolism in perfused livers of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The levels of TG and total cholesterol were reduced in both serum (10-20%) and liver (20-35%) of arthritic rats. The levels of circulating FFA were 40% higher in arthritic rats, possibly in consequence of cytokine-induced adipose tissue lipolysis. Hepatic uptake and oxidation of palmitic and  acids was higher in arthritic livers. The phenomenon results possibly from a more oxidized state of the arthritic liver. Indeed, NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD ratios were 30% lower in arthritic livers, which additionally presented higher activities of the citric  cycle driven by both endogenous and exogenous FFA. The lower levels of circulating and hepatic TG possibly are caused by an increased oxidation associated to a reduced synthesis of fatty acids in arthritic livers. These results reveal that the lipid hepatic metabolism in arthritic rats presents a strong catabolic tendency, a condition that should contribute to the marked cachexia described for arthritic rats and possibly for the severe rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Mice lacking Pla2g5 showed markedly reduced lung ILC2 activation and eosinophilia following repetitive Alternaria Alternata inhalation. While Pla2g5-null mice had Wt levels of immediate IL-33 release after one Alternaria dose, they failed to upregulate IL-33 in macrophages following repeated Alternaria administration. Unexpectedly, while adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived (BM)-macrophages restored ILC2 activation and eosinophilia in Alternaria-exposed Pla2g5-null mice, exogenous IL-33 did not. Conversely, transfers of Pla2g5-null BM-macrophages reduced  in Alternaria-exposed Wt mice. Mass spectrometry analysis of free fatty acids (FFAs) demonstrated significantly reduced FFAs (including linoleic  (LA) and  (OA)) in lung and BM-macrophages lacking Pla2g5. Exogenous administration of LA or LA+OA to Wt mice sharply potentiated IL-33-induced lung eosinophilia and ILC2 expansion in vitro and in vivo.

Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, but GGH(4) inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of hepatic fatty  oxidation and lipogenic genes.

Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry  ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the mitochondria of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15610234>Renal tubular triglyercide accumulation following endotoxic, toxic, and ischemic injury.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol accumulates in renal cortical proximal tubules in response to diverse forms of injury or physiologic stress. However, the fate of triglycerides after acute renal insults is poorly defined. This study sought new insights into this issue.CD-1 mice were subjected to three diverse models of renal stress: (1)  [Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), injection]; (2) ischemia/reperfusion (I/R); or (3) glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis. Renal cortical, or isolated proximal tubule, triglyceride levels were measured approximately 18 hours later. To gain mechanistic insights, triglyceride levels were determined in (1) proximal tubules following exogenous phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) treatment; (2) cultured HK-2 cells after mitochondrial blockade (antimycin A) +/- serum; or (3) HK-2 cells following "septic" (post-LPS) serum, or exogenous fatty  (oleate) addition.Each form of in vivo injury evoked three-to fourfold triglyceride increases in renal cortex and/or proximal tubules. PLA(2) treatment of proximal tubules evoked acute, dose-dependent, triglyceride formation. HK-2 cell triglyceride levels rose with antimycin A. With serum present, antimycin A induced an exaggerated triglyceride loading state (vs. serum alone or antimycin A alone). "Septic" serum stimulated HK-2 triglyceride formation (compared to control serum). Oleate addition caused striking HK-2 cell triglyceride accumulation. Following oleate washout, HK-2 cells were sensitized to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion or oxidant attack.Diverse forms of renal injury induce dramatic triglyceride loading in proximal tubules/renal cortex, suggesting that this is a component of a cell stress response. PLA(2) activity, increased triglyceride/triglyceride substrate (e.g., fatty ) uptake, and possible systemic cytokine (e.g., from LPS) stimulation, may each contribute to this result. Finally, in addition to being a marker of prior cell injury, accumulation of triglyceride (or of its constituent fatty acids) may predispose tubules to superimposed ATP depletion or oxidant attack.</p><p>Keyword:['endotoximia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28731787>Effect of Euterpe oleracea Mart.

The oil from the fruits of Euterpe oleracea (OFEO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acids with potential for treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of OFEO on hyperlipidemia induced by Cocos nucifera L. saturated fat (GSC) in Wistar rats. Chromatographic profile showed that unsaturated fatty acids account for 66.08% in OFEO, predominately  (54.30%), and saturated fatty acids (palmitic  31.6%) account for 33.92%. GSC-induced dyslipidemia resulted in an increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and liver and abdominal fat, as well as atherogenic processes in the thoracic aorta. OFEO treatment did not reduce hypertriglyceridemia, but did reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic action of OFEO. OFEO treatment inhibited the formation of atheromatous plaques in the vascular endothelium of the treated rats, as well as those who were treated with simvastatin.

Even with the standard care of therapy, the prognosis remains dismal due to tumor heterogeneity, tumor infiltration, and, more importantly, the restrictive nature of the blood-brain  (BBB). To overcome the challenge of effectively delivering therapeutic cargo into the brain, herein a "smart", multifunctional polymeric micelle was developed using a cholesterol-conjugated polyoxyethylene sorbitol oleate. A cell-penetrating peptide, arginine-glycine repeats (RG), was incorporated into the micelles to improve cellular uptake, while a pH-sensitive masking sequence, histidine-glutamic  repeats (HE), was introduced for charge shielding to minimize nonspecific binding and uptake at physiological pH. Results demonstrated that (RG)- and (HE)-modified mixed micelles were optimized using this strategy to effectively mask the cationic charges of the activated cell-penetrating peptide (RG) at physiological pH, i.e., limiting internalization, and were selectively triggered in response to a mildly acidic microenvironment in vitro based on a charge reversal mechanism. In vivo results further confirmed that such micelles preferentially accumulated in both brain and tumor tissues in both xenograft and orthotropic glioma mouse models. Furthermore, micelles significantly inhibited tumor growth with limited toxicity to peripheral tissues. The combination of BBB penetration, tumor targeting, potent efficacy, and high tolerance of these micelles strongly suggests that they could be a promising candidate for safe and effective drug delivery to the brain.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469345>Tanycytic TSPO inhibition induces lipophagy to regulate lipid metabolism and improve energy balance.</a></h2><p>Hypothalamic glial cells named tanycytes, which line the 3 ventricle (3V), are components of the hypothalamic network that regulates a diverse array of metabolic functions for energy homeostasis.

On two occasions, participants were given isocaloric (2,660 kJ) and isovolemic (80 ml) loads of either  (long-chain FA) or olive oil (TG) containing radiolabeled lipid and water markers. Postload scintigraphy, blood sampling, and assessment of appetite were performed for 10 h, after which an ad libitum meal was served.

To date, in addition to human and bovine α-LA, the ability to form such anti-tumor complexes with OA was described for goat and camel α-LA. Although the mechanisms of the anticancer activity of human and bovine α-LA are already well-studied, little is currently known about the anticancer action of this camel protein. The goal of this study was to fill this gap and to analyze the anticancer and pro-apoptotic activities of camel α-LA in its free form (α-cLA) and as an OA-containing complex (OA-α-cLA) using four human  cell lines, including Caco-2  cells, PC-3 prostate  cells, HepG-2 hepatoma cells, and MCF-7 breast  cells as targets. The anti-tumor activities of OA-α-cLA and α-cLA were analyzed using MTT test, annexin/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, nuclear staining, and tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition methods. We show here that the OA-α-cLA complex does not affect normal cells but has noticeable anti- activity, especially against MCF-7 cells, thus boosting the anticancer activity of α-cLA and improving the selectivity of OA. The OA-α-cLA complex mediated  cell death via selective induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at lower IC than that of free α-cLA by more than two folds. However, OA induced apoptosis at higher extent than OA-α-cLA and α-cLA. OA also caused unselective apoptosis-dependent cell death in both normal and  cells to a similar degree. The apoptosis and cell-cycle arresting effect of OA-α-cLA may be attributed to the TK inhibition activity of OA. Therefore, OA-α-cLA serves as efficient anticancer complex with two functional components, α-cLA and OA, possessing different activities. This study declared the effectiveness of OA-α-cLA complex as a promising entity with anticancer activity, and these formulated OA-camel protein complexes constitute an auspicious approach for  remedy, particularly for breast .</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153053>Soy Isoflavones Regulate Lipid Metabolism through an AKT/mTORC1 Pathway in Diet-Induced  (DIO) Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The pandemic tendency of  and its strong association with serious co-morbidities have elicited interest in the underlying mechanisms of these pathologies.

We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo- and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma lipid classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar metabolism (stearic :  C-SA; palmitic :  C-PA; :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a  mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a  mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma lipid classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

Oleate or lowered glucose concentration caused hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing of GT1-7 cells by the activation of ATP-sensitive K channels (K). This effect of oleate was not dependent on fatty  oxidation or raised AMP-activated protein kinase activity or prevented by the presence of the UCP2 inhibitor genipin. Oleate did not alter intracellular calcium, indicating that CD36/fatty  translocase may not play a role. However, oleate activation of K may require ATP metabolism. The short-chain fatty  octanoate was unable to replicate the actions of oleate on GT1-7 cells. Although oleate decreased GT1-7 cell mitochondrial membrane potential there was no change in total cellular ATP or ATP/ADP ratios. Perforated patch and whole-cell recordings from mouse hypothalamic slices demonstrated that oleate hyperpolarized a subpopulation of ARC GE neurons by K activation. Additionally, in a separate small population of ARC neurons, oleate application or lowered glucose concentration caused membrane depolarization. In conclusion, oleate induces Kdependent hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing of a subgroup of GE hypothalamic neurons without altering cellular energy charge.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

To explore the interplay between HSA interaction with Zn/Cu and the plasma unsaturated fatty acids (DHA, LA, OA, and arachidonic  (ArA)), we have studied the metal dependence of the fatty  (FA) binding capacity of HSA (n) and structural consequences of the HSA-FA interactions. HSA loading with Zn decreases n value by 0.3-1.5, while its saturation with Cu causes the FA-dependent n changes by up to 0.9. The Cu-induced decline in n value for DHA is due to conformational rearrangements in HSA molecule. In other cases, the changes in n are attributed to steric hindarance/facilitation of the HSA-FA interaction because of the protein multimerization/monomerization, as confirmed by chemical crosslinking. The surface hydrophobicity of HSA is Cu-, Zn-, and FA-dependent and decreases upon the FA binding, according to bis-ANS fluorescence data. Overall, Zn or Cu binding selectively affect HSA interaction with the FAs studied, in part due to changes in quaternary structure of the protein.Copyright © 2019.

The objective of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between circulating concentrations of individual FAs and T2D incidence among Japanese adults. We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 4754 employees, aged 34-69 y, who attended a comprehensive health checkup in 2008-2009 and donated blood samples for the Hitachi Health Study. During 5 y of follow-up,  was identified on the basis of plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and self-report. Two controls matched to each case by sex, age, and date of checkup were randomly chosen by using density sampling, resulting in 336 cases and 678 controls with FA measurements. GC was used to measure the FA composition in serum phospholipids. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs after adjusting for potential confounders. We examined the association of T2D risk with 25 different individual and combinations of FAs. T2D risk was positively associated with serum dihomo-γ-linoleic  concentration (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.11; trend = 0.02) and inversely associated with Δ5-desaturase activity (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.99; trend = 0.02), independent of body mass index (BMI). There were also inverse associations between T2D risk with serum total n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic , and -vaccenic , but these were attenuated and became nonsignificant after adjustment for BMI. Serum n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were not associated with T2D risk. T2D risk was associated with circulating concentrations of the n-6 PUFA dihomo-γ-linoleic  and Δ5-desaturase activity but not with n-3 PUFA or SFA concentrations in Japanese adults.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569635> Wolf Extract Ameliorates Hepatic Steatosis through Regulation of Lipid , Inhibition of ER Stress, and Activation of Autophagy via AMPK Activation.</a></h2><p> Wolf (PCW) is an edible, pharmaceutical mushroom with remarkable biological properties including anti-tumor, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-ageing, and anti-diabetic effects. In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)-palmitic and -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid , inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'inflammation', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601320>Protective role of erdosteine pretreatment on -induced acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Erdosteine is a mucolytic agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. We evaluated the protective effect of erdosteine pretreatment on  (OA)-induced acute lung injury.Twenty-four male Wistar Albino rats were assigned to four treatments: control (oral saline + 50 μL intravenous [i.v.] saline), OA (oral saline + 50 μL i.v.

Four hours after OA injection, lung tissues were excised for biochemical and histopathologic evaluation.OA treatment increased lung  and tissue malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels, but erdosteine pretreatment significantly suppressed these changes (0.57 ± 0.1 g, 3.27 ± 0.48 nmol/mg protein, and 33.57 ± 4.6 nmol/mg protein, respectively, for OA versus 0.36 ± 0.02 g, 1.84 ± 0.15 nmol/mg protein, and 22.10 ± 2.55 nmol/mg protein, respectively, for OA + erdosteine; P < 0.05 for all).

Palmitic  (PA) is the predominant circulating saturated FFA, yet its role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is not clear. Recently, one study suggested that mitochondrial superoxide production is related to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in diabetic mice kidneys. To elucidate the link between PA and oxidative stress and AMPK activity in DN, we compared the cultured murine podocytes exposed to PA and  (OA). Incubation of cells with 250 μM PA or OA induced a translocation of CD36, a fatty  transport protein, with intracellular lipid accumulation. PA, but not OA, induced mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H O ) generation in podocytes, as shown by enhanced fluorescence of MitoSOX Red and dichlorofluorescein (DCF), respectively. Costimulation of PA-treated cells with the H O scavenger catalase abolished the PA-induced DCF fluorescence. Only PA induced mitochondrial damage as shown by electron microscopy. The AMPK activity was determined by immunoblotting, measuring the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) to total AMPK. Only PA significantly increased the p-AMPK levels compared with controls. Addition of catalase to PA-treated cells did not affect the PA-stimulated p-AMPK levels. Collectively, our results indicate that PA induces mitochondrial superoxide and H O generation in cultured podocytes, which may not be directly linked to AMPK activation. Given that, PA seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN through lipotoxicity initiated by mitochondrial superoxide overproduction.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941349>Lipotoxic Palmitate Impairs the Rate of β-Oxidation and Citric  Cycle Flux in Rat Neonatal Cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Diabetic hearts exhibit intracellular lipid accumulation. This suggests that the degree of fatty  oxidation (FAO) in these hearts is insufficient to handle the elevated lipid uptake. We previously showed that palmitate impaired the rate of FAO in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Here we were interested in characterizing the site of FAO impairment induced by palmitate since it may shed light on the metabolic dysfunction that leads to lipid accumulation in diabetic hearts.We measured fatty  oxidation, acetyl-CoA oxidation, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (Cpt1b) activity. We measured both forward and reverse aconitase activity, as well as NAD+ dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. We also measured reactive  species using the 2', 7'-Dichlorofluorescin Diacetate (DCFDA) assay. Finally we used thin layer chromatography to assess diacylglycerol (DAG) levels.We found that palmitate significantly impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation as well as citric  cycle flux, but not Cpt1b activity. Palmitate negatively affected net aconitase activity and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The impaired enzyme activities were not due to oxidative stress but may be due to DAG mediated PKC activation.This work demonstrates that palmitate, a highly abundant fatty  in human diets, causes impaired β-oxidation and citric  cycle flux in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes. This metabolic defect occurs prior to cell death suggesting that it is a cause, rather than a consequence of palmitate mediated lipotoxicity. This impaired mitochondrial metabolism can have important implications for metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

We evaluated the effects of breed, 24 h fasting, and dietary energy source (HO:  versus CH: carbohydrates) on the expression of candidate genes involved in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis in the adipose tissue from Iberian and Duroc growing pigs. The Iberian pigs showed greater feed intake, backfat thickness, and saturated fatty acids (SFA) content in the subcutaneous fat, whereas the Duroc pigs had greater ham  and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content.

Regarding gene expression, breed and feeding status (fasting versus postprandial) had significant effects on gene expression, with quantitative interactions between them, while diet showed negligible effects. In general, adipogenic and lipogenic genes were upregulated in the Iberian pigs and in postprandial samples. In contrast, the expression of lipolytic genes showed complex interaction effects. Our results agree with the phenotypic differences between the Iberian and Duroc breeds and with the inhibition of lipogenesis by fasting. Quantitative interactions between breed and feeding status effects were observed, which indicates a different response to fasting of the two breeds, with the obese Iberian breed showing a more stable expression of lipogenic genes.

We recently reported that PLA2 mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine (L-PC) when both are applied to the apical surface of cultured EC monolayers, resulting in increased bacterial translocation (BT) and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Free fatty acids (FFA) are the other products of this reaction, however, their effect on Caco-2 cell permeability has not been reported. In addition to PC, other luminal phospholipids are present at the surface of the enterocyte. PLA2 may also mediate the hydrolysis of luminal phospholipids other than PC. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phospholipids other than PC and common FFA on intestinal epithelial permeability and BT. Human Caco-2 enterocytes were grown to confluence on porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system. Monolayer integrity and tight-junction permeability were measured as TEER. First, common FFA released by PC hydrolysis were determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In separate experiments, monolayers were treated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (L-PE), or palmitoleic ,  acids, linoleic acids, and arachidonic  solubilized in solution with PC. The magnitude of BT was determined 2 h after treatment by adding Escherichia coli C25 to the apical chamber followed by quantitatively culturing basal-chamber samples. Statistical analysis was by the Kurosaki-Wallis test. TLC of PC samples incubated with PLA2 on the apical surface of Caco-2 monolayers demonstrated the production of palmitoleic ,  acids, linoleic acids, and arachidonic . L-PE significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, but to a lesser degree than L-PC alone. L-PE had no effects on BT. Palmitoleic  and  likewise significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, however, less than L-PC. All FFA tested had no effect on BT. Phospholipids applied to the apical surface of enterocytes, such as those found in vivo in mucus, can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme PLA2 resulting in lysophospholipid and FFA species that can alter enterocyte monolayer permeability. However, FFA and L-PL, other than L-PC, appear to have no effect to stimulate BT.

The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with pancreatic triglyceride content (PTGC), and to investigate the impact of bariatric surgery on ectopic fat pads, pancreatic fat (PTGC) and hepatic fat (HTGC).In all, 45 subjects (13 lean, 13 obese nondiabetics and 19 T2D, matched for age and gender) underwent 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, computed tomography of the visceral abdominal fat, metabolic and lipidomic analysis, including  homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), -secretion homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-B) and plasma fatty- composition. Twenty obese subjects were reassessed 6 months after the bariatric surgery.PTGC was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic subjects (23.8±3.2%) compared with obese (14.0±3.3; P=0.03) and lean subjects (7.5±0.9%; P=0.0002). PTGC remained significantly associated with T2D after adjusting for age and sex (β=0.47; P=0.004) or even after adjusting for waist circumference, triglycerides and HOMA-IR (β=0.32; P=0.04). T2D, C18:1n-9 (), uric , triglycerides and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were the five more important parameters involved in PTGC prediction (explained 80% of PTGC variance). Bariatric surgery induced a huge reduction of both HTGC (-51.2±7.9%) and PTGC (-43.8±7.0%) reaching lean levels, whereas body mass index remained greatly elevated. An improvement of  HOMA-IR and no change in HOMA-B were observed after bariatric surgery. The PTGC or HTGC losses were not correlated, suggesting tissue-specific mobilization of these ectopic fat stores.Pancreatic fat increased with T2D and drastically decreased after the bariatric surgery. This suggests that decreased PTGC may contribute to improved beta cell function seen after the bariatric surgery. Further, long-term interventional studies are warranted to examine this hypothesis and to determine the degree to which ectopic fat mobilization may mediate the improvement in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077002>Palmitoleic (16:1 cis-9) and cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11)  alter  in bovine adipocyte cultures.</a></h2><p>Our objectives were to: (1) confirm elongation products of palmitoleic  (16:1 cis-9) elongation in vitro using stable isotopes and (2) evaluate if exogenous supplementation of palmitoleic , elongation products, or both are responsible for decreased desaturation and  rates observed with palmitoleic  supplementation in bovine adipocytes.

To examine the reactions of flavin mononucleotide with unsaturated fatty acids bearing a double bond at different positions, an electron spin resonance, a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance and a high performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass spectrometry were employed. The control reaction mixtures contained 25μmolL(-1) of flavin mononucleotide, 1.0mmolL(-1) of FeSO4(NH4)2SO4, 10mmolL(-1) of cholic , 30mmolL(-1) of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1molL(-1) of α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone in deuterium oxide.

The control reaction mixtures without FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone were exposed to the visible light at 436nm (7.8Jcm(-2)). After the irradiation, α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was added. The reactions started from adding FeSO4(NH4)2SO4 and performed at 25°C for 1min. Electron spin resonance measurements of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent signals (α(N)=1.58mT and α(Hβ)=0.26mT). High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed prominent peaks at the retention times of 31.1min {(z)-6-octadecenoic }, 39.6min {(z)-9-octadecenoic }, 44.9min {(z)-11-octadecenoic } and 40.2min {(z, z)-9, 12-octadecadienoic }. High performance liquid chromatography-electron spin resonance-mass analyses of the control reaction mixtures showed that 4-carboxybutyl, 7-carboxyheptyl and 9-carboxynonyl radicals formed in the control reaction mixtures of (z)-6-octadecenoic , (z)-9-octadecenoic  {or (z, z)-9,12-octadecadienoic } and (z)-11-octadecenoic , respectively.

The influence of specific nutrients on the molecular regulation of  is not well characterized and is known to be influenced by many factors including timing and physiological status. A trial was performed to study the effects of different dietary energy sources on lipogenic genes transcription in ham adipose tissue of Iberian pigs, at different growth periods and on feeding/fasting situations. A total of 27 Iberian male pigs of 28 kg BW were allocated to two separate groups and fed with different isocaloric feeding regimens: standard diet with carbohydrates as energy source (CH) or diet enriched with high  sunflower oil (HO). Ham subcutaneous adipose tissue was sampled by biopsy at growing (44 kg mean BW) and finishing (100 kg mean BW) periods. The first sampling was performed on fasted animals, while the last sampling was performed twice, with animals fasted overnight and 3 h after refeeding. Effects of diet, growth period and feeding/fasting status on gene expression were explored quantifying the expression of a panel of key genes implicated in  and lipid metabolism processes. Quantitative PCR revealed several differentially expressed genes according to diet, with similar results at both timings: RXRG, LEP and FABP5 genes were upregulated in HO group while ME1, FASN, ACACA and ELOVL6 were upregulated in CH. The diet effect on ME1 gene expression was conditional on feeding/fasting status, with the higher ME1 gene expression in CH than HO groups, observed only in fasting samples. Results are compatible with a higher de novo endogenous synthesis of fatty acids (FA) in the carbohydrate-supplemented group and a higher FA transport in the -supplemented group. Growth period significantly affected the expression of most of the studied genes, with all but PPARG showing higher expression in finishing pigs according to a pattern dissimilar from the usual in cosmopolitan pig breeds. Feeding/fasting status only influenced PPARG gene transcription. The lack of effects of feeding/fasting status on lipogenic gene expression and the higher ME1 response to diet in fasting samples than in postprandial sampling, suggest the persistence of de novo  during fasting.

Here, kinetics of heterogeneous reaction of ozone with six unsaturated fatty acids (, vaccenic , eladic , myristoleic , palmitoleic  and 2-hexadecenoic ) were studied via a flow system combined with attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) and overall reactive uptake coefficients (γ) values were derived according to the changes in absorbance from infrared spectra. Results have shown reaction rates are highly dependent on structures of unsaturated fatty acids. Cis-isomer has faster reaction kinetics than trans-isomer, and conjugated system between CC and CO bonds can greatly inhibit reactivity. Also, it is found that a longer carbon chain length between CC bond and COOH group or a shorter chain length between CC bond and last carbon seemingly enhances reaction kinetics. In addition, changes in redox activity and hydrophilicity of  samples before and after exposure ozone have been reported for the first time.

To address this, the deep photochemical processes were evaluated by Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometry coupled with a discrimination of its leaf fatty  profile. Plants exposed to 125-250 mm NaCl showed higher photochemical light harvesting efficiencies and lower energy dissipation rates. under higher NaCl exposure, there is evident damage of the  evolving complexes (OECs). On the other hand, Reaction Centre (RC) closure net rate and density increased, improving the energy fluxes entering the PS II, in spite of the high amounts of energy dissipated and the loss of PS II antennae connectivity. Energy dissipation was mainly achieved through the auroxanthin pathway. Total fatty  content displayed a similar trend, being also higher under 125-250 mm NaCl with high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The increase in  and palmitic  allows the maintenance of the good functioning of the PS II. Also relevant was the high concentration of chloroplastic C16:1t in the individuals subjected to 125-250 mm NaCl, related with a higher electron transport activity and with the organization of the Light Harvesting Complexes (LHC) and thus reducing the activation of energy dissipation mechanisms.

It is known that HPS plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Fatty acids, such as  (OLA), exhibit the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and the binding site of STAT3 is found in the promoter region of HPS. However, the regulation of HPS by fatty acids is still obscure. To clarify the regulation of HPS, we detected the expression of HPS by western blots. In addition, a hepatic steatosis cell culture model was established by treatment of different fatty acids, including linoleic  (LNA), , palmitic , and stearic . The intracellular lipid accumulation was confirmed by oil red O staining. Blocking of STAT3 activity was achieved by the pretreatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, stattic. We found that activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was mediated in the regulation of HPS expression. Treatment of unsaturated fatty acids significantly induced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the expressions of HPS were increased in unsaturated fatty -treated HepG2 cells, as compared with saturated fatty -treated groups. Also, the expression of HPS induced by OLA was blocked by the inhibition of STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of HPS by small interfering ribonucleic  transfection decreased the protective effect of OLA on cell viability. Taken together, we provided evidence that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of OLA-induced HPS expression and the increased HPS may further participate in the development of NAFLD. In addition, the increase of HPS might be involved in the protective effect of OLA on cell viability.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561889>Assessment of oxidative damage induced by iron oxide nanoparticles on different nervous system cells.</a></h2><p>Iron oxide nanoparticles (ION) have received much attention for their utility in biomedical applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery and hyperthermia, but concerns regarding their potential harmful effects are also growing. Even though ION may induce different toxic effects in a wide variety of cell types and animal systems, there is a notable lack of toxicological data on the human nervous system, particularly important given the increasing number of applications on this specific system. An important mechanism of nanotoxicity is reactive  species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress. On this basis, the main objective of this work was to assess the oxidative potential of silica-coated (S-ION) and -coated (O-ION) ION on human SH-SY5Y neuronal and A172 glial cells. To this aim, ability of ION to generate ROS (both in the absence and presence of cells) was determined, and consequences of oxidative potential were assessed (i) on DNA by means of the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1)-modified comet assay, and (ii) on antioxidant reserves by analyzing ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Conditions tested included a range of concentrations, two exposure times (3 and 24 h), and absence and presence of serum in the cell culture media. Results confirmed that, even though ION were not able to produce ROS in acellular environments, ROS formation was increased in the neuronal and glial cells by ION exposure, and was parallel to induction of oxidative DNA damage and, only in the case of neuronal cells treated with S-ION, to decreases in the GSH/GSSG ratio. Present findings suggest the production of oxidative stress as a potential action mechanism leading to the previously reported cellular effects, and indicate that ION may pose a health risk to human nervous system cells by generating oxidative stress, and thus should be used with caution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A set of assays was conducted in complete and serum-free culture media for 3 and 24 h to assess O-ION cytotoxic effects - cell membrane disruption, cell cycle alteration and cell death induction -, and genotoxic effects - primary DNA damage, H2AX phosphorylation and micronuclei induction -, considering also DNA repair competence and iron ion release. Results obtained show that O-ION exhibit a moderate cytotoxicity related to cell membrane impairment, cell cycle disruption and cell death induction, especially notable in serum-free medium. Iron ion release was only observed in complete medium, indicating that cytotoxicity observed was not related to the presence of ions in the medium. However, O-ION genotoxic effects were limited to the induction of primary DNA damage, not related to double strand breaks, and this damage did not become fixed in cells in most conditions. Alterations in repair ability (DNA repair competence assay) were observed when cells where treated with O-ION before or during the challenge with HO, but not during the repair period. Further investigation is needed to clarify the possible role of oxidative stress and protein corona on observed O-ION toxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Then, the steatotic cells were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations (25 to 100 μmol/L) of silybin as phytosome complex with vitamin E. The effects of silybin on lipid accumulation and metabolism, and on indices of oxidative stress were evaluated by absorption and fluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, spectrophotometric and fluorimetric assays.Lipid-loading resulted in intracellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation inside lipid droplets, whose number and size increased. TG accumulation was mediated by increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). The lipid imbalance was associated with higher production of reactive  species (ROS) resulting in increased lipid peroxidation, stimulation of catalase activity and activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Incubation of steatotic cells with silybin 50 μmol/L significantly reduced TG accumulation likely by promoting lipid catabolism and by inhibiting lipogenic pathways, as suggested by the changes in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), PPAR and SREBP-1c levels. The reduction in fat accumulation exerted by silybin in the steatotic cells was associated with the improvement of the oxidative imbalance caused by lipid excess as demonstrated by the reduction in ROS content, lipid peroxidation, catalase activity and NF-κB activation.We demonstrated the direct anti-steatotic and anti-oxidant effects of silybin in steatotic cells, thus elucidating at a cellular level the encouraging results demonstrated in clinical and animal studies.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28490085>Cellulose nanomaterials emulsion coatings for controlling physiological activity, modifying surface morphology, and enhancing storability of postharvest bananas (Musa acuminate).</a></h2><p>Cellulose nanomaterials (CNs)-incorporated emulsion coatings with improved moisture barrier, wettability and surface adhesion onto fruit surfaces were developed for controlling postharvest physiological activity and enhancing storability of bananas during ambient storage. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-based emulsion coating (CNFC: 0.3% CNF/1% /1% sucrose ester fatty  (w/w wet base)) had low contact angle, high spread coefficient onto banana surfaces, and lower surface tension (ST, 25.4mN/m) than the critical ST (35.2mN/m) of banana peels, and exhibited good wettability onto banana surfaces. CNFC coating delayed the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and reduced ethylene and CO production, thus delaying fruit ripening.

In our previously study, total sesquiterpene glycosides (TSG) isolated from Loquat leaf exhibited therapeutic effect on Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in vivo, but the accurate active compound remains unknown. Sesquiterpene glycoside 1 (SG1) is a novel compound, which is exclusively isolated from Loquat leaf, but its biological activity has been rarely reported. The present study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of SG1, the main component of TSG, in  (OA)-induced HepG2 cell model of NAFLD with its related mechanisms of action. In this study, both SG1 and TSG were found to signiﬁcantly reduce the lipid deposition in the cell model. They could also decrease total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and intracellular free fatty  (FFA) contents. Compared with OA-treated cells, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level increased, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal levels respectively decreased after the administration of SG1 or TSG. The high dose of SG1 (140 μg/mL) displayed a similar therapeutic effect as TSG at 200 μg/mL. Both SG1 and TSG were found to suppress the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and the phosphorylation of c-jun terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream target c-Jun in OA-treated cell. These results demonstrate again that TSG are probably the main responsible chemical profiles of Loquat leaf for the treatment of NAFLD, for which it can effectively improve OA-induced steatosis and reduce oxidative stress, probably by downregulating of CYP2E1 expression and JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation, while SG1 may be the principle compound.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here, we used 16S rRNA analysis and metabolomics to analyze the effect of GOS on  and metabolites. Results show that the abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Oscillibacter decreased significantly in GOS-fed mice. Twenty-one metabolites, including , arachidic , and behenic , decreased significantly in the GOS-fed mice. Fatty  synthesis and blood triglyceride content significantly decreased in the GOS-fed mice compared with those in the control mice, suggesting that GOS may improve lipid metabolism in mice. Additionally, after three weeks of a GOS-rich diet, the mouse  was significantly enriched in Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, and Parasutterella. The blood glucose level of the GOS-fed group was significantly higher than that of the control group, whereas the abundance of Coprococcus and Odoribacter (butyrate-producing bacteria) was significantly decreased. The metabolism of butyrate, known to reduce plasma glucose levels, was significantly downregulated in the GOS-fed mice, an effect potentially detrimental to the glucose metabolism of the host. This dual-omics analysis provided important information on the changes in host-microbe-metabolite interactions resulting from GOS supplementation. Our results provide evidence that GOS may improve lipid metabolism, and that long-term GOS supplementation had a detrimental effect on the host's glucose metabolism, which could be important for optimizing methods of prebiotic supplementation and developing approaches to prevent diseases using prebiotic interventions.</p><p>Keyword:['microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29574981>Phosphatidylcholine 36:1 concentration decreases along with demyelination in the cuprizone animal model and in post-mortem multiple sclerosis brain tissue.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease.

However, difficulties related to administration and body distribution limit the clinical use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. In this study, we proposed to use nanocarriers to enable siRNA application in the topical treatment of skin disorders. A siRNA nanodispersion based on liquid crystalline phase and composed of monoolein (MO),  (OA) and polyethylenimine (PEI) was developed and its physicochemical properties, efficiency of complexation and carrier/siRNA stability were assessed. Subsequently, cell viability, cellular uptake, in vitro skin irritation test using reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) and in vitro IL-6 knockdown in  skin model were evaluated. The results showed that the liquid crystalline nanodispersion is a promising topical delivery system for administration of siRNA, being able to overcome the limitations of the route of administration, as well those resulting from the characteristics of siRNA molecules. The formulation was effective at complexing the siRNA, presented high rate of cell uptake (∼90%), increased the skin penetration of siRNA in vitro, and did not cause skin irritation compared with Triton-X (a moderate irritant), resulting in a 4-fold higher viability of reconstructed human epidermis and a 15.6-fold lower release of IL-1α. A single treatment with the liquid crystalline nanodispersion carrying IL-6 siRNA for 6h was able to reduce the extracellular IL-6 levels by 3.3-fold compared with control treatment in  skin model. Therefore, liquid crystalline nanodispersion is a suitable nanocarrier for siRNA with therapeutic potential to suppress skin disease-specific genes.

Previous studies have indicated that the C18:1 content is a polygenic trait, and no stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) except for FAD2 have been reported. By performing a GWAS using 375 low erucic  B. napus accessions genotyped with the Brassica 60K SNP array and constructing a high-density SNP-based genetic map of a 150 DH population, we identified a novel QTL on the A9 chromosome.

By fine mapping and gene expression analysis, we found three potential candidate genes and verified the fatty acids in a homologous gene mutant of Arabidopsis. A metal ion-binding protein was found to be the most likely candidate gene in the region. Thus, the C18:1 content can be further increased to about 80% with this novel locus together with FAD2 mutant allele without compromise of agronomic performance. A closely linked marker, BnA129, for this novel QTL (OLEA9) was developed so that we can effectively identify materials with high C18:1 content at an early growth stage by marker-assisted selection.

Currently, there are few options to treat NAFLD, including life style changes and insulin sensitizers. Recent evidence suggests that the cannabinoids Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and cannabidiol (CBD) improve insulin sensitivity; we aimed at studying their effects on lipid levels.The effects of THCV and CBD on lipid levels were examined in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems, with special emphasis on models of hepatosteatosis. Transcriptional, post-translational and metabolomic changes were assayed.THCV and CBD directly reduce accumulated lipid levels in vitro in a hepatosteatosis model and adipocytes. Nuclear magnetic resonance- (NMR) based metabolomics confirmed these results and further identified specific  changes in THCV and CBD-treated hepatocytes. Treatment also induced post-translational changes in a variety of proteins such as CREB, PRAS40, AMPKa2 and several STATs indicating increased lipid metabolism and, possibly, mitochondrial activity. These results are supported by in vivo data from zebrafish and obese mice indicating that these cannabinoids are able to increase yolk lipid mobilization and inhibit the development of hepatosteatosis respectively.Our results suggest that THCV and CBD might be used as new therapeutic agents for the pharmacological treatment of obesity- and -related NAFLD/hepatosteatosis.Copyright © 2015.

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following  loss. We investigated the effect of  loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of  changes between groups revealed that the -loss group had greater reductions in . The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the -loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the -loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ-linolenic  levels were detected in the -loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following  loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the -loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild  loss improves abdominal obesity, overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to obesity-related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

In this work, synthesis of kojic monooleate ester (KMO) was carried out using lipase-catalysed esterification of kojic  and  in a solvent-free system. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used to optimise the main important reaction variables, such as enzyme amount, reaction temperature, substrate molar ratio, and reaction time along with immobilised lipase from Candida Antarctica (Novozym 435) as a biocatalyst. The RSM data indicated that the reaction temperature was less significant in comparison to other factors for the production of a KMO ester. By using this statistical analysis, a quadratic model was developed in order to correlate the preparation variable to the response (reaction yield). The optimum conditions for the enzymatic synthesis of KMO were as follows: an enzyme amount of 2.0 wt%, reaction temperature of 83.69°C, substrate molar ratio of 1:2.37 (mmole kojic :) and a reaction time of 300.0 min. Under these conditions, the actual yield percentage obtained was 42.09%, which is comparably well with the maximum predicted value of 44.46%. Under the optimal conditions, Novozym 435 could be reused for 5 cycles for KMO production percentage yield of at least 40%. The results demonstrated that statistical analysis using RSM can be used efficiently to optimise the production of a KMO ester.

HepG2 cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) mixture (: palmitic , 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro fatty liver. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce fatty liver in vivo. Intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and fatty  transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW.

SCD1 catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). MUFA are then incorporated into triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Previous studies have shown that  deficiency in mice induces metabolic changes in the liver characterized by a decrease in de novo  and an increase in β-oxidation. Interestingly, -deficient mice show a decrease in the expression and maturation of the principal lipogenic transcription factor sterol receptor element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The mechanisms mediating this effect on de novo  and β-oxidation have not been fully elucidated. We evaluated the role of  on de novo  and β-oxidation in HepG2 cells. We also used -deficient mice and two strains of transgenic mice that produce either oleate (GLS5) or palmitoleate (GLS3) in a liver-specific manner. We demonstrate that the expression of β-oxidation markers increases in -deficient hepatocytes and suggest that this is due to an increase in cellular polyunsaturated fatty  content. We also show that the changes in the level of SREBP-1 expression, for both the precursor and the mature forms, are mainly due to the lack of oleate in -deficient hepatocytes. Indeed, oleate treatment of cultured HepG2 cells or hepatic oleate production in chow-fed GLS5 mice can restore SREBP-1 expression and increase hepatic de novo . Finally, we show that oleate specifically increases SREBP-1 nuclear accumulation, suggesting a central role for oleate in SREBP-1 signaling activity.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26257990>Pathways commonly dysregulated in mouse and human obese adipose tissue: FAT/CD36 modulates differentiation and .</a></h2><p>Obesity is linked to adipose tissue hypertrophy (increased adipocyte cell size) and hyperplasia (increased cell number).

This hypothesis was tested in human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1), which were differentiated into macrophages with 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and further activated with LPS for 24 h. Monocytes, macrophages, and AcM were transfected with a negative control, or mimics for miR-155-3p and miR-let-7b-5p. The expression of both miRNAs and some proinflammatory genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, let-7b mimic reduced the expression of IL6 and TNF in monocytes, and SERPINE1 expression in LPS-activated macrophages. However, IL6, TNF, and SERPINE1 were upregulated in macrophages by let-7b mimic. IL6 expression was higher in the three types of cells after transfecting with miR-155-3p mimic.

Pre-exposure to OA at higher dose significantly improved the HW/BW ratio, myocardial infarct size, lipid profiles (total cholesterol, HDL-C) and cardiac injury biomarkers (LDH, CK-MB, cardiac troponin-I, MMP-9), thus suggesting its cardio-protective role. The ameliorative potential of the higher dose of OA was further substantiated by its ability to reduce the cardiac oxidative stress as evidenced by significant decrease in lipid peroxidation coupled with increase in superoxide dismutase activity and reduced glutathione level. Significant decrease in heart rate as well as increase in RR and QT intervals in  pre-exposed rats were also observed. OA pre-treatment also reduced the histopathological alterations seen in myocardial injury group rats.

In the post-starvation period, energy metabolism in the tumor was altered from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis/lactate fermentation, with the acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Hyperglycemia at the post-starvation period induced the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1, hypoxia-induced factor-1α and Nanog, as well as the phosphorylation of Stat3. Taken together, these findings suggest that ICR induces an increase in the number of CSCs and enhances EMT by promoting the Warburg/Crabtree effect following post-fasting food overconsumption.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer', 'energy', 'glycolysis', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252854>Human milk enriched with human milk lyophilisate for feeding very low birth  preterm infants: A preclinical experimental study focusing on fatty  profile.</a></h2><p>Human milk, with essential nutrients and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as the omega 3 and 6 fatty acids is important for development of the central nervous system and the retina in very low birth  infants (<1,500 g). However, breast milk may not be sufficient to meet these needs. The possibility of supplementing breast milk with a lyophilisate of human milk was explored in this study. The objectives of this study were to determine the total lipid content and the lipid profile of the Human Milk on Baseline (HMB) and that of the Concentrates with the Human Milk + lyophilisate (with lyophilisate of milk in the immediate period (HMCI), at 3 months (HMC3m), and at 6 months (HMC6m) of storage).Fifty donors from the Human Milk Bank of Children's Hospital provided consent, and donated milk samples. Macronutrient (including total lipids) quantification was performed using the MIRIS® Human Milk Analyzer, and the fatty  profile was determined by gas chromatography (CG-FID, SHIMADZU®).There was a higher lipid concentration in HMCI relative to HMB. The concentrations of the main fatty acids (% of total) were as follows: palmitic  (C16:0) HMB, 22.30%; HMCI, 21.46%; HMC3m, 21.54%; and HMC6m, 21.95% (p<0.01);  (C18:1n-9) HMB, 30.41%; HMCI, 30.47%; HMC3m, 30.55%; and HMC6m, 29.79% (p = 0.46); linoleic  (C18:2n-6) HMB, 19.62%; HMCI, 19.88%; HMC3m, 19.49%; and HMC6m, 19.45% (p = 0.58); arachidonic  (C20:4n-6) HMB, 0.35%; HMCI, 0.16%; HMC3m, 0.13%; and HMC6m, 0.15% (p<0.01); α-linolenic  (C18:3n-3) HMB,1.32%; HMCI, 1.37%; HMC3m, 1.34%; and 1.34% HMC6m (p = 0.14); docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3) HMB, 0.10%; HMCI, 0.06%; HMC3m, 0.05%; and HMC6m, 0.06% (p<0.01).

Glucolipotoxicity caused by elevated plasma glucose and lipid levels is a major cause of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, due to increased oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1), an insulinotropic glucoincretin hormone, is known to promote β-cell survival via its actions on its G-protein-coupled receptor on β-cells. Here, we report that a nonapeptide, GLP1(28-36)amide, derived from the C-terminal domain of the insulinotropic GLP1, exerts cytoprotective actions on INS-1 β-cells and on dispersed human islet cells in vitro in conditions of glucolipotoxicity and increased oxidative stress independently of the GLP1 receptor. The nonapeptide appears to enter preferably stressed, glucolipotoxic cells compared with normal unstressed cells. It targets  and improves impaired mitochondrial membrane potential, increases cellular ATP levels, inhibits cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis, and enhances the viability and survival of INS-1 β-cells. We propose that GLP1(28-36)amide might be useful in alleviating β-cell stress and might improve β-cell functions and survival.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28276564>Dietary fatty acids on aortic root calcification in mice with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with , dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and chronic low-grade inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on vascular calcification by the modulation of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the aortic roots of LepLDLR mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and a greater atheroma plaque size, calcification, and RANKL/CATHK expression in the aortic root than mice on MUFA-enriched diets, with an increasing OPG expression in the aortic roots of the latter. Our study demonstrates that compared to dietary SFAs, MUFAs from olive oil protect against atherosclerosis by interfering with vascular calcification via the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the setting of MetS. These findings open opportunities for developing novel nutritional strategies with olive oil as the most important dietary source of MUFAs (notably ) to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572061>Cellular toxicity of dietary trans fatty acids and its correlation with ceramide and diglyceride accumulation.</a></h2><p>High fatty  (FA) levels are deleterious to pancreatic β-cells, largely due to the accumulation of biosynthetic  intermediates, such as ceramides and diglycerides, which induce ER stress and apoptosis. Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of  intermediates and the severity of cell damage.

A bioactive polyunsaturated fatty , 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic  (KetoC), is known to have various beneficial physiological effects; however, the effect of KetoC on  remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of KetoC on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, and explored the intracellular mechanism responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects.RAW 264.7 cells were pre-treated with or without KetoC, and then stimulated with or without P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. Levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific antagonists for G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)40 and GPR120 were used to clarify the receptor for KetoC. The intracellular mechanism was investigated using western blotting analysis to separate nuclear and cytosolic NF-κB p65 protein.KetoC (5 μmol/L) was not toxic to RAW 264.7 cells, and significantly reduced the expression of TNFα and IL-6 mRNA and protein, and IL-1β mRNA. No protein production of IL-1β was observed. Additionally, when bound to GPR120, KetoC trended to downregulate nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels. However, the antagonist for GPR40 failed to diminish the action of KetoC.KetoC suppressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β via NF-κB p65, by binding to its receptor GPR120. KetoC is a promising candidate in future studies as a bioactive anti-inflammatory agent in treating periodontal disease.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Breakfast (day 2) consisted of triacylglycerols (TAGs) fed as capsules (30 g oil + (13)C(7) triolein) to avoid activation of mouth taste receptors. Next, modified sham feeding of cream cheese occurred over 2 hours. In the 2 trials, the stimulus was either higher fat (HF) or lower fat (LF) cream cheese. A liquid meal was consumed at lunch. Blood sampling occurred intermittently, and chylomicron particles S(f) >400 TAGs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.(13)C(2)-Label was found in fasting-state lipoproteins, and persons with higher body fat percentages showed greater dilution of meal TAGs from endogenous sources. For both trials, 13% ± 4% of lipoprotein TAGs  was derived from the previous evening meal. Incremental area under the curve for TAGs during HF was ∼2.5 times higher than after LF exposure (46 ± 15 vs 17 ± 5 μmol/L/h; P = .04). The greater HF morning lipemia occurred with elevated glucose, insulin, and nonesterified fatty acids peak after lunch.These data support a connection between enteral lipid metabolism and oral fat exposure, resulting in elevated postprandial lipemia.

Autophagy, an evolutionarily-conserved house-keeping process, was implicated in cellular lipid handling by either feeding and/or degrading lipid-droplets (LDs). We hypothesized that beyond phagocytosis of dead adipocytes, AT-FC biogenesis is supported by the AT microenvironment by regulating autophagy.

Autophagic flux was decreased by AT-CM, and fluorescently following autophagosomes over time revealed ~20% decline in new autophagic vesicles' formation rate, and 60-70% decrease in autophagosomal growth rate, without marked alternations in the acidic lysosomal compartment. Suppressing autophagy by either targeting autophagosome formation (pharmacologically, with 3-methyladenine or genetically, with Atg12±Atg7-siRNA), decreased the rate of LD formation induced by . Conversely, interfering with late autophago-lysosomal function, either pharmacologically with bafilomycin-A1, chloroquine or leupeptin, enhanced LD formation in macrophages without affecting LD degradation rate. Similarly enhanced LD biogenesis rate was induced by siRNA targeting Lamp-1 or the V-ATPase.

Even-chain fatty acids (butyrate, octanoate, or oleate) played a crucial role (i) to depress the lactate release, from 40% (butyrate or oleate) to 72% (octanoate), and (ii) to lower the threshold concentration for lactate utilization (down to 1 mM with octanoate). The effects of fatty acids were connected to their inhibition of hepatic , estimated by the detritiation of [6-3H]glucose (about -30% with butyrate or oleate and -45% with octanoate). Fatty acids depressed the cellular concentration of pyruvate which, at physiological concentration of lactate, favors its utilization. The rise in ketone bodies concentration in response to fatty acids reflected an enhanced acetyl CoA production, resulting in an accumulation of citrate. In parallel there was a drop of the cellular concentration of fructose 2,6-biphosphate. As a result, there was an inhibition of the flux through 6-phosphofructo-1 kinase (50, 75, or 40% inhibition with butyrate, octanoate, or oleate, respectively). The other regulatory  steps, catalyzed by glucokinase and pyruvate kinase, were not affected by fatty acids. Inhibition of hepatic  by fatty acids seems connected to acetyl-CoA generation since octanoate, readily metabolized to acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies by hepatocytes, had a more potent stimulatory effect on the hepatic uptake of lactate than butyrate or oleate. Propionate, which yields practically no acetyl CoA, slightly stimulated lactate release and elevated the threshold of lactate utilization. The present data suggest thus that, in hepatocytes from fed rats, fatty acids effectively inhibit  and switch liver cell metabolism toward gluconeogenic conditions, which promotes lactate utilization.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140723>Myeloid differentiation protein 1 protected myocardial function against high-fat stimulation induced pathological remodelling.</a></h2><p>Myeloid differentiation 1 (MD-1) is a secreted protein that regulates the immune response of B cell through interacting with radioprotective 105 (RP105). Disrupted immune response may contribute to the development of cardiac diseases, while the roles of MD-1 remain elusive. Our studies aimed to explore the functions and molecular mechanisms of MD-1 in -induced cardiomyopathy. H9C2 myocardial cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) containing palmitic  and  to challenge high-fat stimulation and adenoviruses harbouring human MD-1 coding sequences or shRNA for MD-1 overexpression or knockdown in vitro. MD-1 overexpression or knockdown transgenic mice were generated to assess the effects of MD-1 on high-fat diet (HD) induced cardiomyopathy in vivo. Our results showed that MD-1 was down-regulated in H9C2 cells exposed to FFA stimulation for 48 hours and in  mice induced by HD for 20 weeks. Both in vivo and in vitro, silencing of MD-1 accelerated myocardial function injury induced by HD stimulation through increased cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, while overexpression of MD-1 alleviated the effects of HD by inhibiting the process of cardiac remodelling. Moreover, the MAPK and NF-κB pathways were overactivated in MD-1 deficient mice and H9C2 cells after high-fat treatment. Inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB pathways played a cardioprotective role against the adverse effects of MD-1 silencing on high-fat stimulation induced pathological remodelling. In conclusion, MD-1 protected myocardial function against high-fat stimulation induced cardiac pathological remodelling through negative regulation for MAPK/NF-κB signalling pathways, providing feasible strategies for  cardiomyopathy.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this work was to assess the hypothesis that antioxidant-rich extra virgin olive oil (AR-EVOO) counteracts iron-rich diet (IRD)-induced oxidative stress hindering hepatic steatosis. Male Wistar rats were fed and IRD (200 mg iron/kg diet) versus a control diet (CD; 50 mg iron/kg diet) with alternate AR-EVOO supplementation (100 mg/day) for 21 days. IRD induced liver steatosis and oxidative stress (higher levels of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation with glutathione depletion), mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased citrate synthase and complex I and II activities) and loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with a drastic enhancement in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) ratio upregulating the expression of lipogenic enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty  (FA) synthase and stearoyl desaturase 2) and downregulating those involved in FA oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl transferase and acyl-CoA oxidase) over values in the CD group. IRD also upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes. AR-EVOO supplementation alone did not modify the studied parameters, however, IRD combined with AR-EVOO administration returned IRD-induced changes to baseline levels of the CD group. It is concluded that IRD-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevented by AR-EVOO supplementation, which might be related to the protective effects of its components such as hydroxytyrosol, , tocopherols and/or PUFAs, thus representing a suitable anti-steatotic strategy to avoid progression into more severe stages of the disease, underlying NAFLD associated with iron overloading pathologies or .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed at investigating the biophysical interactions of EFAs with Meibomian lipids.Rheology of mixtures of Human Meibomian lipids with EFAs (LA-linoleic , ALA-alpha-linolenic ), OA (), and GLA (gamma-linolenic ) was studied using Langmuir trough technology on an artificial tear solution at the ocular surface temperature. Pressure-area profiles were used to determine compressibility and elasticity of the mixed films.LA enhanced spreading of Meibomian lipids and increased their compressibility and elasticity which can be beneficial for tear stability. ALA condensed Meibomian lipids film with less elasticity deemed unfavourable for tear stability. OA expanded Meibomian lipids but decreased elasticity at high compressions making films less stable. GLA had little or no favourable effect on tear stability. Higher concentrations of FAs made films less stable.EFAs or OA in topical ophthalmic preparations can affect spread and stability of the tear film lipid layer. Rheology of mixed films should be tested using Langmuir trough technology to determine suitable type and amount of a lipid additive for therapeutic eye drops.

These electrophilic products induce pleiotropic signaling actions that modulate metabolic and inflammatory responses in cell and animal models. The metabolism of NO(2)-FA includes reduction of the vinyl nitro moiety by prostaglandin reductase-1, mitochondrial β-oxidation, and Michael addition with low molecular weight nucleophilic amino acids. Complex lipid reactions of fatty  nitroalkenes are not well defined. Herein we report the detection and characterization of NO(2)-FA-containing triacylglycerides (NO(2)-FA-TAG) via mass spectrometry-based methods. In this regard, unsaturated fatty acids of dietary triacylglycerides are targets for nitration reactions during gastric acidification, where NO(2)-FA-TAG can be detected in rat plasma after oral administration of nitro- (NO(2)-OA). Furthermore, the characterization and profiling of these species, including the generation of beta oxidation and dehydrogenation products, could be detected in NO(2)-OA-supplemented adipocytes. These data revealed that NO(2)-FA-TAG, formed by either the direct nitration of esterified unsaturated fatty acids or the incorporation of nitrated free fatty acids into triacylglycerides, contribute to the systemic distribution of these reactive electrophilic mediators and may serve as a depot for subsequent mobilization by lipases to in turn impact adipocyte homeostasis and tissue signaling events.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although studies on the mammalian proteins have elucidated aspects of Ngb and Cygb biophysics and indicated potential functions, the properties of non-mammalian Ngbs and Cygbs are largely uncharacterized. We have expressed the recombinant zebrafish proteins Ngb, Cygb1, and Cygb2 in Escherichia coli and characterized their nitrite reduction rates, spectral properties, autoxidation rate constants, redox potentials and lipid binding properties. The three zebrafish proteins can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide with a broad range of reaction rate constants.

We observe that zebrafish Ngb and Cygb2 have comparable spectral features to those of human Ngb and Cygb, consistent with a six-coordinate heme, whereas unexpectedly Cygb1 has a five-coordinate heme, a slower autoxidation and in general has properties more akin to  transport proteins. In agreement with a possible  carrier and nitrite reductase role, we detect mRNA transcript for Cygb1 but not Cygb2 or Ngb in zebrafish blood. Unlike human Cygb, neither of the zebrafish globins binds  with high affinity. This finding suggests that lipid binding may be a trait acquired later during evolution and not an ancestral property of cytoglobins.

Mice with liver-specific p53 deletion develop steatosis and show increased levels of p63. Down-regulation of p63 attenuates liver steatosis in p53 knockout mice and in diet-induced obese mice, whereas the activation of p63 induces lipid accumulation. Hepatic overexpression of N-terminal transactivation domain TAp63 induces liver steatosis through IKKβ activation and the induction of ER stress, the inhibition of which rescues the liver functions. Expression of TAp63, IKKβ and XBP1s is also increased in livers of obese patients with NAFLD. In cultured human hepatocytes, TAp63 inhibition protects against -induced lipid accumulation, whereas TAp63 overexpression promotes lipid storage, an effect reversible by IKKβ silencing.

CO-EtOAc suppressed the mRNA levels of fatty  transporter genes (CD36 and FABP) and lipogenesis genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC1), but upregulated genes that govern lipolysis (HSL) and lipid oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1, and ACOX). Moreover, CO-EtOAc increased the protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK, ACC1, CPT-1, and PPARα, but downregulated the expression of mature SREBP-1c and FAS. AMPK plays an essential role in CO-EtOAc-mediated amelioration of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that CO-EtOAc significantly inhibited  gain, epididymal adipose tissue , and hepatic lipid accumulation via regulation of the expression of fatty  transporter, lipogenesis, and fatty  oxidation genes and proteins in C57BL/6 mice fed a 60% high-fat diet. Therefore, Chinese olive fruits may have the potential to improve the metabolic abnormalities associated with fatty liver under high fat challenge.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'lipogenesis', 'oxygen', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417996>Comparative Study of Orange and its Main Bioactive Constituents as Remedy for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver in Rats.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is accused as inducer of both cardiovascular and chronic liver diseases.

In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids protect beta-cells from the long-term negative effects of saturated fatty acids. We aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying this protective action of unsaturated fatty acids. To address the aim, insulin-secreting MIN6 cells were exposed to palmitate in the absence or presence of oleate and analyzed by using nano-LC MS/MS based proteomic approach. Important findings were validated by using alternative approaches. Proteomic analysis identified 34 proteins differentially expressed in the presence of palmitate compared to control samples. These proteins play a role in insulin processing, mitochondrial function, metabolism of biomolecules, calcium homeostasis, exocytosis, receptor signaling, ER protein folding, antioxidant activity and anti-apoptotic function. When oleate was also present during culture, expression of 15 proteins was different from the expression in the presence of palmitate alone. Most of the proteins affected by oleate are targets of the ER stress response and play a pro-survival role in beta cells such as protein folding and antioxidative defence. We conclude that restoration of pro-survival pathways of the ER stress response is a major mechanism underlying the protective effect of unsaturated fatty acids in beta-cells treated with saturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A Mass Spectrometry And Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - based metabolomics study.</a></h2><p> (MetS) represents a group of abnormalities that enhances the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. The Mediterranean diet seems to be an important dietary pattern, which reduces the incidence of MetS. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) - a simple phenol found in olive oil - has received increased attention for its antioxidant activity. Recently, the European Foods Safety Authority (EFSA) claimed that dietary consumption of HT exhibits a protective role against cardiovascular disease. In this study, an experimental protocol has been setup, including isolated HT administration in a diet induced model of MetS in young Wistar rats, in order to find out whether HT has a protective effect against MetS. Rats were randomly divided into two groups nurtured by high-carbohydrate high-fat (H) (MetS inducing diet) and high-carbohydrate high-fat + HT (HHT). HT (20mg/kg/d oral gavage, water vehicle) was administered for 8 weeks on the basal diet. Previous pharmacological evaluation of HT showed that hepatic steatosis was reduced and the inflammatory cells into the liver were infiltrated. These indicate that HT shows bioactivity against . Therefore, the metabolomics evaluation of liver extracts would indicate the putative biochemical mechanisms of HT activity. Thus, the extracts of liver tissues were analyzed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS, Orbitrap Discovery) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Avance III 600MHz). Multivariate analysis was performed in order to gain insight on the  effects of HT administration on the liver metabolome. Normalization employing multiple internal standards and Quality Control-based Robust LOESS (LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) Signal Correction algorithm (QC-RLSC) was added in the processing pipeline to enhance the reliability of metabolomic analysis by reducing unwanted information. Experimentally, HHT rats were clearly distinguished from H in PLS-DA, showing differences in the liver metabolome between the groups and specific biomarkers were determined supporting the pharmacological findings. More specifically, HT has shown to be effective towards the mobilization of lipids as various lipid classes being differentially regulated between the H and HHT groups. Interestingly branched fatty  esters of hydroxy  acids (OAHSA) lipids have been shown to be up regulated to the HHT group, denoting the alleviation of the MetS to the animals administered with HT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The hypothesis that n-3 PUFA, which modulate protein homoeostasis via effects on insulin sensitivity, could contribute to maintain muscle mass during energy restriction was tested in rats fed a high-fat diet (4 weeks) rich in 18 : 1 n-9 (, OLE-R), 18 : 3 n-3 (α-linolenic , ALA-R) or n-3 long-chain (LC-R) fatty  and then energy restricted (8 weeks). A control group (OLE-ad libitum (AL)) was maintained with AL diet throughout the study. Rats were killed 10 min after an i.v. insulin injection. All energy-restricted rats lost weight and fat mass, but only the OLE-R group showed a significant muscle loss. The Gastrocnemius muscle was enriched with ALA in the ALA-R group and with LC-PUFA in the ALA-R and LC-R groups. The proteolytic ubiquitin-proteasome system was differentially affected by energy restriction, with MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 mRNA levels being decreased in the LC-R group (-30 and -20 %, respectively). RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation levels increased in the LC-R group (+70 %), together with insulin receptor mRNA (+50 %).

We examined the combined effects of different types of dietary carbohydrates and fats on the etiology of obesity and its complications in the Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rat, a model of obesity. Specifically, these rats were fed an isocaloric diet containing various combinations of carbohydrates [palatinose (P), an insulin-sparing sucrose analogue, and sucrose (S)] and fatty acids [ (O) and linoleic  (L)]. After 8 wk, palatinose feeding (PO and PL) led to significant reductions in visceral fat mass, adipocyte cell size, hyperglycemia, and  compared with sucrose feeding (SO and SL); pancreatic islet hypertrophy was also prevented by palatinose feeding. Linoleic--fed rats (PL and SL) exhibited reduced insulin-immunoreactive staining of the pancreatic islets, enhanced macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, and an elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration when compared with -fed rats (PO and SO).

We found that SPRC significantly reduced hepatic reactive  species (ROS) and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) levels. Moreover, SPRC also increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. By Western blot, we found that this protective effect of SPRC was importantly attributed to the regulated hepatic antioxidant-related proteins, including protein kinase B (Akt), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE, an enzyme that synthesizes hydrogen sulfide). Next, we examined the detailed molecular mechanism of the SPRC protective effect using - (OA-) induced HepG2 cells. The results showed that SPRC significantly decreased intracellular ROS and MDA levels in OA-induced HepG2 cells by upregulating the phosphorylation of Akt, the expression of HO-1 and CSE, and the translocation of Nrf2. SPRC-induced HO-1 expression and Nrf2 translocation were abolished by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. Moreover, the antioxidative effect of SPRC was abolished by CSE inhibitor DL-propargylglycine (PAG) and HO-1 siRNA.

Four sources of fatty acids are used for lipoprotein synthesis: de-novo lipogenesis, cytoplasmic triglyceride stores, fatty acids derived from lipoproteins taken up directly by the liver and plasma FFA. Quantitatively, de-novo lipogenesis plays a minor role in regulating VLDL synthesis, but evidently it is elevated under conditions of high carbohydrate feeding. Cytoplasmic triglyceride stores appear to essentially contribute to VLDL triglycerides. Plasma FFA enter the hepatocytes and are either oxidized or esterified. The relationship between oxidation and esterification appears to be important in regulating the VLDL synthesis. An enhanced esterification is accompanied by increased VLDL secretion. The addition of  to hepatocytes has been shown to stimulate production of VLDL triglyceride and apoB. In human beings, an acute experimental elevation of plasma FFA stimulates VLDL production. In healthy men strong positive relations were found between the late increases in large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and plasma FFA concentrations after 6 h following a mixed meal. In contrast, n-3 fatty acids impair VLDL assembly and secretion. Chronic hyperinsulinemia seems to stimulate VLDL production. On the other hand, the short-term addition of insulin has been shown to inhibit VLDL-triglyceride and apoB production in vitro. There is in vivo evidence that acute hyperinsulinemia suppresses VLDL-apoB and VLDL-triglyceride production in insulin-sensitive humans. Part of this action is due to suppression of plasma FFA. In patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), VLDL production was increased when compared with subjects with normal glucose (NGT). When infusing a lipid emulsion, VLDL production could not be further stimulated in IGT patients in contrast to NGT persons. Hypertriglyceridemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually the consequence of a VLDL overproduction. In type 2 diabetic patients, in contrast to normal men, insulin failed to suppress VLDL1 particle release. In normal men, an elevation of blood glucose led to a decrease in fatty  oxidation and an increase in hepatic triglyceride secretion. Under these conditions, approximately 30% of total VLDL triglycerides coming out of the liver did not originate from plasma FFA. In conclusion, plasma FFA seem to play an important role in stimulating hepatic VLDL production. Other factors such as chronic hyperinsulinemia or nutrition modify this effect.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592082>Effect of the ratios of unsaturated fatty acids on the expressions of genes related to fat and protein in the bovine mammary epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the different ratios of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) (, linoleic , and linolenic ) on the cell viability and triacylglycerol (TAG) content, as well as the mRNA expression of the genes related to lipid and protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Primary cells were isolated from the mammary glands of Holstein dairy cows and were passaged twice.

For all of the treatments, the the fetal bovine serum in the culture solution was replaced with fatty -free BSA (1 g/L), and the cells were treated with different ratios of , linoleic, and linolenic acids (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, 2:13.3:1, 3:20:1, and 4:26.7:1) for 48 h, which were group 1 to group 5. The control culture solution contained only fatty -free BSA without UFAs (0 μM). The results indicated that the cell viability was not affected by adding different ratios of UFAs, but the accumulation of TAG was significantly influenced by supplementing with different ratios of UFAs. Adding different ratios of UFAs suppressed the expression of ACACA and FASN but had the opposite effect on the abundances of FABP3 and CD36 mRNA. The expression levels of PPARG, SPEBF1, CSN1S1, and CSN3 mRNA in the BMECs were affected significantly after adding different ratios of UFAs. Our results suggested that groups 1, 2, and 3 (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, and 2:13.3:1) had stronger auxo-action on fat synthesis in the BMECs, where group 3 (2:13.3:1) was the best, followed by group 4 (3:20:1). However, group 5 (4:26.7:1) was the worst. Genes related to protein synthesis in the BMECs were better promoted in groups 2 and 3, and group 3 had the strongest auxo-action, whereas the present study only partly examined the regulation of protein synthesis at the transcriptional level; more studies on translation level are needed in the future.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether OMT can attenuate LPS-induced ALI through regulation of the ENaC and MAPK pathway using an ALI mouse model. Histological assessment of the lung and inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were performed by H&E and Wright-Giemsa staining. The lung wet/dry (W/D)  ratio and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), ENaC subunits, and the MAPK pathway members were determined. Isolated type II rat alveolar epithelial cells were incubated with OMT 30 min before LPS stimulation to investigate the activation of ENaC and the MAPK pathway. The results showed that OMT remarkably alleviated histopathologic changes in lung and pulmonary edema, reduced inflammatory cell counts in BALF, and decreased TNF-α and CRP levels in a dose-dependent manner. OMT significantly increased the three subunits of ENaC proteins in vivo and in vitro, while it decreased p-ERK/ERK, p-p38/p38, and p-JNK/JNK ratios in vivo. However, only the JNK pathway was markedly inhibited in vitro following pretreatment with OMT. Collectively, the results suggested that OMT might alleviate LPS-induced ALI by elevating ENaC proteins and inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30467782>Hydrothermal Synthesis and Upconversion Properties of About 19 nm ScO: Er, Yb Nanoparticles with Detailed Investigation of the  Transfer Mechanism.</a></h2><p>The ScO: Er, Yb nanoparticles (NPs) with the size of about 19 nm were synthesized by a simple -mediated hydrothermal (HT) process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), upconversion luminescence (UCL) spectra, and decay curves were used to characterize the resulting samples. The ScO: Er, Yb NPs made by HT method exhibit the stronger UCL, of which the red UCL are enhanced by a factor of 4, in comparison with those samples prepared by solvothermal (ST) method at the same optimized lanthanide ion concentrations. The UCL enhancement can be attributed to the reduced surface groups and longer lifetimes. Under 980 nm wavelength excitation, the decay curves of Er: (H, S) → I and F → I emissions for ScO: Er, Yb NPs samples are both close to each other, resulting from the cross relaxation  transfer from Er to Yb, followed by an  back transfer within the same Er-Yb pair. Also, under the relatively low-power density, the slopes of the linear plots of log(I) vs. log(P) for red and green emissions are 2.5 and 2.1, implying the existence of three-photon processes.

Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α/β (PPARα/β) activation has been shown to exert beneficial effects on age-associated renal changes, its effects on age-associated renal fibrosis have not been investigated yet. Here, we show that the PPARα/β activator, MHY2013, can significantly alter lipid  in renal tubule epithelial cells and attenuate renal fibrosis in aged Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We found that MHY2013 significantly increased nuclear translocation and activity of PPARα/β in NRK52E renal epithelial cells. Moreover, the enhanced PPARα/β activity increased the expression of fatty  oxidation-associated PPARα/β target genes. In addition, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)- and -induced lipid accumulation and fibrosis-associated gene expression were decreased in NRK52E cells by MHY2013 pretreatment. To evaluate the effects of MHY2013 on age-associated renal fibrosis, aged SD rates were orally administered MHY2013 (1 and 5 mg/kg) daily for 1 month. MHY2013 efficiently increased PPARα/β activation and reduced renal lipid accumulation in aged SD rat kidneys. Furthermore, renal fibrosis was significantly decreased by MHY2013, indicating the importance of renal lipid  in age-associated renal fibrosis. Taken together, our results suggest that activation of PPARα/β signaling during aging prevents age-associated renal fibrosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recently, ellagic  (EA) has drawn attention mainly due to its biological functionalities and a series of molecular targets. However, the molecular mechanism by which EA attenuates hepatic steatosis in individuals with undesirable hepatic genetic alterations remains rarely studied. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of EA in a hepatic steatosis mouse model featuring elevated expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its downstream modulators of  by hydrodynamic injection of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT). Hematoxylin and eosin staining, oil red O staining, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed for mechanistic investigations. Human hepatoma cell lines were used for mechanical validation in vitro. The results suggest that EA lightens the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes of AKT-injected mice and an -induced in vitro hepatic steatosis model. Mechanistically, EA administration decreases the expression of phospho-AKT (Thr308) and suppresses two effectors lying downstream of the AKT/mTORC1 pathway, ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and SREBP-1, in the AKT-injected mice. The consequence of the EA-mediated decrease of SREBP-1 is found to be a transcriptional and translational inhibition of fatty  synthase (FASN), accompanied by the downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Consistent with in vivo findings, EA efficiently represses the SREBP-1/FASN axis in vitro.

Furthermore, the growth inhibitory activity of five extracts, obtained using ethanol, methanol, acetone, chloroform or diethyl ether as a solvent, from the cultured  was tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Algal extracts exhibited a considerable inhibitory activity against  strains, while a slight inhibition was observed against . The different extracts showed significant differences in bacterial growth inhibition, with the highest activity that was recorded for the ethanol extract, followed by that of methanol. Based on the chemical characterization, these findings could be related to the antimicrobial activity played by the combination of total carbohydrates and polyphenols, which were determined at high levels in ethanol and methanol extracts, as well as by the highest number and levels of single polyphenols. Conversely, the lower growth inhibitory activities found in chloroform and diethyl ether extracts could be related to the isolation of minor  classes (e.g., neutral and medium polar lipids) composed by fatty acids, such as stearic,  and arachidonic acids, typically characterized by antimicrobial activity.

Contrariwise, OA incorporation increased in the PL fractions and showed no changes in TAG.

This study evaluated the effects of irrigation with two water sources: low-cost water DEsalination and SEnsoR Technology (DESERT) desalinated water (DW) EC ∼1 dS m) and reclaimed water (RW) (EC ∼ 3 dS m) combined with two irrigation strategies: full irrigation (FI) (100% of ET) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI, 50% of ET) on fruit yield, ripening indices, and oil yield and quality of olive trees cv Arbosana planted in Mediterranean conditions. Our results showed that RW without water restrictions increased the fruit yield by 35% due to a slight increase in the fruit  and, mainly, to a greater fruit set than the control trees; although this did not result in a higher oil yield (g tree) since the oil content per fruit dry  was reduced. The RDI strategy did not decrease the fruit yield despite the fact that olive  tended to decrease, and it increased the oil yield by ∼14.5%. The combination of both stresses (RW and RDI) neither decreased the fruit yield; however, it significantly reduced oil yield (25% less in 2018) since oil content per fruit dry  was strongly reduced (40%) compared to control trees. Both RDI treatments, regardless water source, determined acidity levels in olive paste lower than in FI treatments; however, it reduced oil extractability and fatty yield. The finding about oil quality indicated that olive exposure to RW, regardless of the water amount, decreased oil quality mainly due to the reduction of  and the increase of C18:2/C18:3 ratio and peroxides; on the contrary, both RW and RDI improved the total polyphenols. In all cases, the parameters met the legislation. In short, with appropriate management, RW and RDI have great potential to manage oil olive production; nevertheless, studies subjected to long-term use of these techniques should be experienced to ensure the sustainability of oil yields and quality.Copyright © 2019 Romero-Trigueros, Vivaldi, Nicolás, Paduano, Salcedo and Camposeo.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179489>Comparison of diets enriched in stearic, , and palmitic acids on , immune response, cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women-randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Direct comparisons between SFAs varying in chain length, specifically palmitic  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0), relative to the latter's metabolic product,  (18:1), on cardiometabolic risk factors are limited.The aim of this study was to determine the relative comparability of diets enriched in palmitic , stearic , and  on  and coagulation markers, T lymphocyte proliferation/ex-vivo cytokine secretion, plasma cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations.Hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women (n = 20, mean ± SD age 64 ± 7 y, BMI 26.4 ± 3.4 kg/m2, LDL cholesterol ≥ 2.8 mmol/L) were provided with each of 3 diets [55% energy (%E) carbohydrate, 15%E protein, 30%E fat, with ∼50% fat contributed by palmitic , stearic , or  in each diet; 5 wk/diet phase] using a randomized crossover design with 2-wk washouts between phases.

Measurement of specific products of OA within the complex mixture of digesta lipids is however challenging.

The products of C-OA after 24 h of incubation were analysed by gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Numerous C-labeled 18:1 intermediates and oxygenated FA were detected and no elongation or desaturation of OA occurred. Diet supplementation with fish oil (i.e., MFD conditions) resulted in no unique metabolites of OA but in relevant changes in the relative contribution of specific metabolic pathways. The inhibition of 18:0 saturation caused by this treatment appeared largely attributable to increased oxygenated FA proportion, in particular the candidate milk  inhibitor 10-oxo-18:0, and warrants further research on the association between MFD and oxygenated FA. Changes in the concentration of C-labeled  18:1 intermediates but not in  18:1, were also observed.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28522296>Oleate protects macrophages from palmitate-induced apoptosis through the downregulation of CD36 expression.</a></h2><p>In obese patients, free fatty acids ectopically accumulated in non-adipose tissues cause cell death. Saturated fatty acids are more deleterious to non-adipose cells, and supplementation with monounsaturated fatty acids has been proposed to rescue cells from saturated fatty -induced cytotoxicity; however, the mechanisms are not well understood. To understand the cytoprotective role of monounsaturated fatty acids in lipotoxic cell death of macrophages, we investigated the antagonizing effect of oleate and the underlying mechanisms in palmitate-treated RAW264.7 cells. Palmitate strongly induced apoptosis in macrophages by increasing CD36 expression, which was identified to mediate both endoplasmic reticulum stress and the generation of reactive  species. Co-treatment with oleate significantly reduced CD36 expression and its downstream signaling pathways of apoptosis in palmitate-treated cells.

However, molecular mechanisms regulating lipophagy are still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of  (OA) on lipophagy in cells. We found that OA treatment results in accumulation of p62 and LC3-II proteins and reduces red fluorescence in cells stably expressing mCherry-GFP-LC3. In addition, OA inhibits the co-localization of LC3 with LAMP1 under serum-deprived condition, suggesting that OA blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In the cells with ATG5 or ULK1 gene deletion, LDs did not increase upon OA treatment more than in wild type cells. However, cell starvation following OA removal resulted in reduced lipid accumulation by lipophagy and recovery of autophagy flux, suggesting that the specific condition of OA treatment and cell starvation are important for lipophagy flux activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular link between SHIP2 expression and metabolic dyslipidemia using overexpression or suppression of SHIP2 gene in HepG2 cells. The results showed that overexpression of the wild type SHIP2 gene (SHIP2-WT) led to a higher total lipid content (28%) compared to control, whereas overexpression of the dominant negative SHIP2 gene (SHIP2-DN) reduced total lipid content in oleate treated cells by 40%. Overexpression of SHIP2-WT also led to a significant increase in both secretion of apoB100 containing lipoproteins and de-novo , as demonstrated by an enhancement in secreted apoB100 and MTP expression, increased intra and extracellular triglyceride levels and enhanced expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP1c, FAS and ACC. On the other hand, overexpression of the SHIP2-DN gene prevented oleate-induced de-novo  and secretion of apoB100 containing lipoproteins in HepG2 cells.

In the present study, we demonstrate a novel and robust methodology for the sustainable production of fatty acids from Moringa oleifera Lam oil using lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis (without the presence of emulsifiers or buffer solutions). Seven commercial lipases from Candida rugosa (CRL), Burkholderia cepacia (BCL), Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL), Rhizopus niveus (RNL), Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFL), Mucor javanicus (MJL), and porcine pancreas (PPL) were used as biocatalysts.

We have previously characterized the role of triacylglycerol (TAG) formation in the neuronal response to Fe-induced OS. In this work we characterize the role of the α-syn variant A53T during Fe-induced injury and investigate whether lipid metabolism has implications for neuronal fate. To this end, we used the N27 dopaminergic neuronal cell line either untransfected (UT) or stably transfected with pcDNA3 vector (as a transfection control) or pcDNA-A53T-α-syn (A53T α-syn). The overexpression of A53T α-syn triggered an increase in TAG content mainly due to the activation of Acyl-CoA synthetase. Since fatty  (FA) β-oxidation and phospholipid content did not change in A53T α-syn cells, the unique consequence of the increase in FA-CoA derivatives was their acylation in TAG moieties. Control cells exposed to Fe-induced injury displayed increased OS markers and TAG content. Intriguingly, Fe exposure in A53T α-syn cells promoted a decrease in OS markers accompanied by α-syn aggregation and elevated TAG content.

Steatohepatitis plays a critical role in the process resulting in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Puerarin is a herbal product widely used in Asia, and is believed to have therapeutic benefits for alleviating the symptoms of steatohepatitis. The present study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of puerarin in reducing lipid accumulation in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells. Hepatocytes were treated with OA with or without puerarin to observe lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining. We also examined hepatic lipid contents (e.g., triacylglycerol and cholesterol) following treatment with puerarin. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to measure sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty  synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein and mRNA expression, respectively. Our results revealed that puerarin suppressed OA-induced lipid accumulation, and reduced the triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. Furthermore, puerarin decreased the expression levels of lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and SREBPs, and increased the expression levels of PPARα, which are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism through the AMPK signaling pathway. These results indicate that puerarin has the same ability to activate AMPK, and reduce SREBP-1 and FAS expression, thus inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis and increasing hepatic antioxidant activity. We found that puerarin exerted a regulatory effect on lipid accumulation by decreasing lipogenesis in hepatocytes.

Notably, the effects of glycerol application on G3P and 18:1 fatty  content, and gene expression levels, in cacao leaves were dosage dependent. A 100 mm glycerol spray application was sufficient to stimulate the defence response without causing any observable damage, and resulted in a significantly decreased lesion formation by the cacao pathogen Phytophthora capsici; however, a 500 mm glycerol treatment led to chlorosis and cell death.

In addition, the mRNAs encoding the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1 and SREBP-1-regulated monounsaturated fatty  biosynthetic enzymes are also increased. Hepatic synthesis of fatty acids and accumulation of triacylglycerols increases in Cyp27(-/-) mice and is associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Cholic  feeding reverses hepatomegaly and hypertriglyceridemia but not adrenomegaly in Cyp27(-/-) mice. These studies confirm the importance of CYP27 in bile  synthesis and they reveal an unexpected function of the enzyme in triacylglycerol metabolism.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803473>The influence of the storage temperature on the stability of lipid microparticles containing ginger oleoresin.</a></h2><p>Ginger oleoresin (GO) can be encapsulated within a protective lipid matrix in order to facilitate handling, provide protection against the external environment or promote the stability of GO compounds. The aim of this study was to verify the ability of solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) containing GO (10-20% w/w) to maintain or improve the stability of ginger compounds, by monitoring SLMs' characteristics during storage at different temperatures (25 and 40 °C).

However, the effect of procyanidin B2 on free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced hepatic steatosis remains obscure. The present study is therefore aimed to elucidate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 against hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we reported that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced lipid accumulation and its associated oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS and superoxide anion radicals, blocking loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring glutathione content, and increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD and CAT) in hepatocytes. Procyanidin B2 mechanistically promoted lipid degradation via modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathway. Molecular docking analysis indicated a possible ligand-binding position of procyanidin B2 with TFEB. In addition, administration of procyanidin B2 resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and also ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. It was confirmed that procyanidin B2 prevented HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation through down-regulating -related gene expressions (PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP-1c), inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-6 and TNF-α) and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity (GPx, SOD and CAT). Moreover, hepatic fatty acids analysis indicated that procyanidin B2 caused a significant increase in the levels of palmitic ,  and linoleic . Intriguingly, procyanidin B2 restored the decreased nuclear TFEB expression in HFD-induced liver steatosis and up-regulated its target genes involved in lysosomal pathway (Lamp1, Mcoln, Uvrag), which suggested a previously unrecognized mechanism of procyanidin B2 on ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state, which had important implications that modulation of TFEB might be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and procyanidin B2 could represent a promising novel agent in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, Consistent upregulation of IL-17A was observed in the HFD-induced steatosis mice but not the normal chow-fed control mice. Administration of IL-17A impaired liver function, aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation by inhibiting fatty  oxidation in the HFD mice. Conversely, inhibition of IL-17A using an anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly attenuated HFD-induced liver injury. Furthermore, IL-17A accelerated hepatic steatosis through activation of the JNK-PPARα pathway in the HFD mice and OA-preloaded hepatocytes.The present study demonstrated that a high fat diet induces IL-17A expression, which exacerbates the progression of NAFLD by inhibiting fatty  β-oxidation and promoting the accumulation of triglycerides (TG).Copyright © 2017.

Human leucine zipper protein (LZIP) regulates the expression of genes involved in , cell migration, and stress response. The aim of this study was to determine the regulatory role of LZIP in stress-induced hepatic steatosis. We used a microarray analysis to identify LZIP-induced genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. LZIP increased the expression of apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) mRNA. In the presence of stress inducer, APOA4 promoter analysis was performed, and LZIP-induced lipid accumulation was monitored in mouse primary cells and human tissues. Under Golgi stress conditions, LZIP underwent proteolytic cleavage and was phosphorylated by AKT to protect against proteasome degradation. The stabilized N-terminal LZIP was translocated to the nucleus, where it directly bound to the APOA4 promoter, leading to APOA4 induction. LZIP-induced APOA4 expression resulted in increased absorption of surrounding free fatty acids. LZIP also promoted hepatic steatosis in mouse liver. Both LZIP and APOA4 were highly expressed in human steatosis samples. Our findings indicate that LZIP is a novel modulator of APOA4 expression and hepatic lipid metabolism.

Addition of GLP-1 dose (10, 50, 100nmol/L) dependently lowered the TG content and reached plateau at 100 nmol/L of GLP-1 [TG(8.38±1.47) μg/mg].

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) provides the staple food with serving as main source of  and protein. Germination of sorghum generally increases the nutritive value of seeds and the effects of germination on lipids composition of seeds vary greatly with processing conditions. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the effect of emerging processing techniques such as ultrasound (US) and microwave (MW) on fatty acids composition and oil yield of sorghum seeds before and after germination.Initially sorghum grains were soaked with 5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) for surface sterilization. Afterwards, grains were soaked in excess water for 22 h at room temperature and were divided into four portions. The first portion (100 g grains) was subjected to germination without applying any microwave and ultrasonic treatment (T). Second portion was further divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and grains were subjected to ultrasonic treatments using two different ultrasonic intensities (US: 40%; US: 60%) within range of 0-100% and with two different time durations (t: 5 min; t: 10 min) at constant temperature. Third portion was also divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and exposed to microwave treatments at two different power levels (MW: 450 watt; MW: 700 watt) within the range of 100-900 W for two different time durations (t: 15 s; t: 30s). Similarly, fourth portion was divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group). Each group was exposed to both MW (MW, MW) (100-900 watt power) & US (US, US) (0-100% intensity) treatments at two different time levels (t, t). Then, germination was carried out and pre-treated raw and pre-treated germinated sorghum grains were analyzed for total oil yield, fatty  composition and unsaturated fatty acids (Un-SFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio by gas chromatography.The results revealed that oil yield in sorghum before and after germination ranged from 6.55 to 7.84% and 6.28 to 7.57%, respectively. All the microwave and ultrasound processed samples showed significant difference in oil yield than the raw sorghum grains. The highest tested yield was 7.84 ± 0.31% when combination of microwave power (700 W) and ultrasound intensity (60%) was applied for 30s and 10 min, respectively. The results further demonstrate that the raw sorghum contained palmitic (13.73 ± 0.10%), palmitoleic (0.43 ± 0.02%), stearic (1.07 ± 0.04%),  (37.15 ± 0.10%), linoleic (43.33 ± 0.21%), linolenic (1.55 ± 0.04%), arachidic  (0.13 ± 0.01%) and eicosenoic  (0.37 ± 0.02%), respectively. The highest fatty  percentage for palmitic, stearic and arachidic  was 13.75 ± 0.07%, 1.11 ± 0.09% and 0.15 ± 0.03% at 60% US intensity for 10 min (T), respectively. Maximum amount observed was 1.60 ± 0.09% of linolenic  while amount of eicosenoic  decreased from 0.37 ± 0.02% to 0.31 ± 0.01% after processing. In case of applying combination of microwave and sonication treatments, the change in eicosenoic  increased from 0.35 ± 0.02% to 0.40 ± 0.04% while there was no significant change in other fatty acids. The ungerminated sorghum oil possessed 14.93-15.05% and 82.83-83.12% of SFA and Un-SFA, respectively. After germination, percentage of saturated fatty acids increased (16.4-16.55%) while decreased for unsaturated fatty acids (80.13-80.56%) were noted.The results of the present study conclude that the yield of oil from sorghum grains increased by emerging processing. Fatty  analysis of sorghum oil suggested that pre-treatment strategies will not affect the quality of the oil with respect to essential fatty acids content. Overall, the composition of saturated fatty  in germinated grain is improved than ungerminated grains after processing.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526351>Docosahexaenoyl serotonin emerges as most potent inhibitor of IL-17 and CCL-20 released by blood mononuclear cells from a series of N-acyl serotonins identified in human intestinal tissue.</a></h2><p>Fatty  amides (FAAs), conjugates of fatty acids with ethanolamine, mono-amine neurotransmitters or amino acids are a class of molecules that display diverse functional roles in different cells and tissues.

Postprandial changes in gut hormones, glucose homeostasis, satiety, lipid and inflammatory parameters after meals were analysed. Some of the solid fractions of the IPO were removed and thus the fatty  composition of the PO and IPO was not entirely equal (PO vs IPO: palmitate 39.8 vs 38.7; oleate 43.6 vs 45.1). PO, IPO and HOS contained 9.7, 38.9 and 0.2 g/100 g total fatty acids of palmitic  at the sn-2 position, respectively. At 37 °C, IPO contained 4.2% SFC whereas PO and HOS were completely melted.Our novel observation shows that the incremental area under curve (iAUC) 0-6 h of plasma GIP concentration was on average 16% lower following IPO meal compared with PO and HOS (P < 0.05) meals.

A total of 27 Large White × Landrace growing pigs at 44 ± 1 d of age (11.96 ± 0.18 kg) were randomly allocated to three treatments ( = 9). Dietary treatments included: (1) normal protein diet with 20% crude protein (CP) (NP); (2) a low crude protein diet formulated to contain approximately 17% CP (LP); and (3) a low crude protein diet with 17% CP supplemented with 1% AKG at the expense of regular corn components (ALP).

Different pathogenic processes have been proposed, among them, an increase of bone marrow (BM) fat resulting from adipocyte accumulation. Marrow adipocytes are active BM residents that influence the microenvironment by releasing cytokines, adipokines, and free fatty acids (FA). We explored the impact of palmitate (Palm) and oleate on function and survival of BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) of osteonecrotic patients (ONMSC) and healthy volunteers. Moreover, we analyzed the FA profile of the serum and the BM supernatant fluid (BMSF). We demonstrated that exposure to the saturated FA Palm favored MSC differentiation through the adipogenic lineage at the expense of the osteoblastic phenotype. Moreover,  was intensified in ONMSC. The susceptibility to Palm toxicity was aggravated in ONMSC concomitantly with a greater activation of the proapoptotic extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Moreover, cellular mechanisms implicated in the protection against lipotoxicity, such as stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 expression, were dysregulated in ONMSC. Palm-induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 secretion was also exacerbated in ONMSC. Our results established that, in the serum, the FA profiles were comparable in ON and healthy subjects. However, both the concentrations and the FA composition were modified in the BMSF of ON patients, highlighting a drastic change of the BM microenvironment in ON patients. Altogether, our work suggests that marrow adipocyte enlargement could affect the process of bone remodeling and, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of ON.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30076294>A secretome profile indicative of oleate-induced proliferation of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Increased   (FA) is often observed in highly proliferative tumors. FAs have been shown to modulate the secretion of proteins from tumor cells, contributing to tumor survival. However, the secreted factors affected by FA have not been systematically explored. Here, we found that treatment of oleate, a monounsaturated omega-9 FA, promoted the proliferation of HepG2 cells. To examine the secreted factors associated with oleate-induced cell proliferation, we performed a comprehensive secretome profiling of oleate-treated and untreated HepG2 cells. A comparison of the secretomes identified 349 differentially secreted proteins (DSPs; 145 upregulated and 192 downregulated) in oleate-treated samples, compared to untreated samples. The functional enrichment and network analyses of the DSPs revealed that the 145 upregulated secreted proteins by oleate treatment were mainly associated with cell proliferation-related processes, such as lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and ER stress. Based on the network models of the DSPs, we selected six DSPs (MIF, THBS1, PDIA3, APOA1, FASN, and EEF2) that can represent such processes related to cell proliferation.

Although NAFLD was first described in 1980, a complete understanding of the mechanism and causes of this disease is still lacking. Six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) plays a role in integrating inflammatory and nutritional signals with metabolism. Our previous study suggested that STAMP2 may be a suitable target for treating NAFLD. In the current study, we performed a focused drug-screening and found that cilostazol could be a potential STAMP2 enhancer. Thus, we examined whether cilostazol alleviates NAFLD through STAMP2. The in vivo and in vitro pharmacological efficacies of cilostazol on STAMP2 expression and lipid accumulation were analyzed in NAFLD mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and in HepG2 cell lines treated by  (OA), respectively. Cilostazol increased the expression of STAMP2 through transcriptional regulation in vivo and in vitro. Cilostazol also dampened the STAMP2 downregulation caused by the HFD and by OA in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Cilostazol activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vivo and in vitro, and AMPK functions upstream of STAMP2, and reversed downregulation of STAMP2 expression through AMPK in the NAFLD model. Cilostazol ameliorates hepatic steatosis by enhancing hepatic STAMP2 expression through AMPK. Enhancing STAMP2 expression with cilostazol represents a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20736083>Repercussion of a deficiency in mitochondrial ß-oxidation on the carbon flux of short-chain fatty acids to the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle in Aspergillus nidulans.</a></h2><p>The fungus Aspergillus nidulans contains both a mitochondrial and peroxisomal ß-oxidation pathway. This work was aimed at studying the influence of mutations in the foxA gene, encoding a peroxisomal multifunctional protein, or in the scdA/echA genes, encoding a mitochondrial short-chain dehydrogenase and an enoyl-CoA hydratase, respectively, on the carbon flux to the peroxisomal ß-oxidation pathway. A. nidulans transformed with a peroxisomal polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase produced PHA from the polymerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates derived from the peroxisomal ß-oxidation of external fatty acids. PHA produced from erucic  or heptadecanoic  contained a broad spectrum of monomers, ranging from 5 to 14 carbons, revealing that the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle can handle both long and short-chain intermediates. While the ∆foxA mutant grown on erucic  or  synthesized 10-fold less PHA compared to wild type, the same mutant grown on octanoic  or heptanoic  produced 3- to 6-fold more PHA. Thus, while FoxA has an important contribution to the degradation of long-chain fatty acids, the flux of short-chain fatty acids to peroxisomal ß-oxidation is actually enhanced in its absence. While no change in PHA was observed in the ∆scdA∆echA mutant grown on erucic  or  compared to wild type, there was a 2- to 4-fold increased synthesis of PHA in ∆scdA∆echA cells grown in octanoic  or heptanoic . These results reveal that a compensatory mechanism exists in A. nidulans that increases the flux of short-chain fatty acids towards the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle when the mitochondrial ß-oxidation pathway is defective.2010 Elsevier B.V.

This narrative review discusses the signs, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of essential fatty  deficiency (EFAD). EFAD may occur in patients with conditions that severely limit the intake, digestion, absorption, and/or  of fat. EFAD may be prevented in patients requiring parenteral nutrition by inclusion of an intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) as a source of LA and ALA. Early ILEs consisted solely of soybean oil (SO), a good source of LA and ALA, but being rich in LA may promote the production of proinflammatory fatty acids. Subsequent ILE formulations replaced part of the SO with other fat sources to decrease the amount of proinflammatory fatty acids. Although rare, EFAD is diagnosed by an elevated triene:tetraene (T:T) ratio, which reflects increased  of  to Mead  in the absence of adequate LA and ALA. Assays for measuring fatty acids have improved over the years, and therefore it is necessary to take into account the particular assay used and its reference range when determining if the T:T ratio indicates EFAD. In patients with a high degree of suspicion for EFAD, obtaining a fatty  profile may provide additional useful information for making a diagnosis of EFAD. In patients receiving an ILE, the T:T ratio and fatty  profile should be interpreted in light of the fatty  composition of the ILE to ensure accurate diagnosis of EFAD.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159189>Priming of Hypothalamic Ghrelin Signaling and Microglia Activation Exacerbate Feeding in Rats' Offspring Following Maternal Overnutrition.</a></h2><p>Maternal overnutrition during pregnancy leads to metabolic alterations, including , hyperphagia, and inflammation in the offspring.

The current study aims to identify the effect of maternal programming on microglia activation and ghrelin-induced activation of hypothalamic neurons leading to food intake response. We employed a nutritional programming model exposing female Wistar rats to a cafeteria diet (CAF) from pre-pregnancy to weaning. Food intake in male offspring was determined daily after fasting and subcutaneous injection of ghrelin. Hypothalamic ghrelin sensitivity and microglia activation was evaluated using immunodetection for Iba-1 and c-Fos markers, and Western blot for TBK1 signaling. Release of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β after stimulation with palmitic, , linoleic , or C6 ceramide in primary microglia culture were quantified using ELISA. We found that programmed offspring by CAF diet exhibits overfeeding after fasting and peripheral ghrelin administration, which correlates with an increase in the hypothalamic Iba-1 microglia marker and c-Fos cell activation. Additionally, in contrast to , linoleic, or C6 ceramide stimulation in primary microglia culture, stimulation with palmitic  for 24 h promotes TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β release and TBK1 activation. Notably, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) palmitic  or LPS inoculation for five days promotes daily increase in food intake and food consumption after ghrelin administration.

The degradation rate of the lipids was high during the first 15 days of incubation, reaching the fatty acids content, values around 20-40% of those found in the control. From that moment on, the rate of degradation was slower or even null. It was observed that in all treatments, the linolenic  reached the highest degradation ratio in comparison with the other fatty acids, which may be caused by the action of lipoxygenases. The lipase activity and the content of deoxynivalenol were also determinate on the flours. The lipase activity increased until day 25 of incubation reaching twice the initial value. The deoxynivalenol content also increased along incubation while fatty acids decreased. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude in the signal of fatty acids in whole wheat flours varied in relation to the degree of humidity and fungal infection of the grains from which they were obtained. Otherwise, lipids and their oxidation products are related with the pathogenesis and production of mycotoxins. These observations highlight the importance of an adequate manipulation of wheat grains on the processing chain to prevent quality changes and mycotoxins contamination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a simple and effective ligand-modification strategy is proposed by introducing 2-hexyldecanoic  (DA) with two short branched chains to replace  (OA) with long chains during the synthesis process. These two short branched chains not only maintain their colloidal stability but also contribute to efficient radiative recombination. The calculations show that CsPbBr QDs with DA modification (CsPbBr -DA QDs) have larger binding  than CsPbBr QDs with OA (CsPbBr -OA QDs), resulting in significantly enhanced stability. Due to the strong binding  between DA ligands and QDs, CsPbBr -DA QDs exhibit no aggregation phenomenon even after stored in air for more than 70 d, and CsPbBr -DA QDs films can maintain 94.3% of initial PL intensity after 28 d, while in CsPbBr -OA QDs films occurs a rapid degradation of PL intensity. Besides, the enhanced amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) performance of CsPbBr -DA QDs films has been demonstrated under both one- and two-photon laser excitation. The ASE threshold of CsPbBr -DA QDs films is reduced by more than 50% and their ASE photostability is also improved, in comparison to CsPbBr -OA QDs films.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We have previously shown that EETs trigger a protective response limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing cellular death. Considering it is unknown how EETs regulate cell death processes, the major focus of the current study was to investigate their role in the autophagic response of HL-1 cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) during starvation. We employed a dual-acting synthetic analog UA-8 (13-(3-propylureido)tridec-8-enoic ), possessing both EET-mimetic and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory properties, or 14,15-EET as model EET molecules. We demonstrated that EETs significantly improved viability and recovery of starved cardiac cells, whereas they lowered cellular stress responses such as caspase-3 and proteasome activities. Furthermore, treatment with EETs resulted in preservation of mitochondrial functional activity in starved cells. The protective effects of EETs were abolished by autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or pharmacological inhibition of autophagy. Mechanistic evidence demonstrated that sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive potassium channels (pmKATP) and enhanced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) played a crucial role in the EET-mediated effect. Our data suggest that the protective effects of EETs involve regulating the autophagic response, which results in a healthier pool of  in the starved cardiac cells, thereby representing a novel mechanism of promoting survival of cardiac cells. Thus, we provide new evidence highlighting a central role of the autophagic response in linking EETs with promoting cell survival during deep metabolic stress such as starvation.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26286349>In vitro fermentation of nuts results in the formation of butyrate and c9,t11 conjugated linoleic  as chemopreventive metabolites.</a></h2><p>The consumption of foods rich in dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as nuts can contribute to a healthy diet. Therefore, the formation of fermentation end-products which might exert chemopreventive effects regarding colon cancer was investigated after an in vitro simulated digestion and fermentation of nuts using human fecal microbiota.Fermentation supernatants (FS) and pellets (FP) were obtained after an in vitro fermentation of hazelnuts, almonds, macadamia, pistachios and walnuts. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids (BA) in FS as well as fatty acids in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of SCFA compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of vaccenic  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty  methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic  (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA deoxycholic-/iso-deoxycholic  (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal microbiota to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite.

In addition, we assessed the effects of mitoquinone on mitochondrial respiration, measured respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential in intact cells, and tested the intriguing hypothesis that mitoquinone might impart fuel selectivity in intact BAE cells. In  respiring on differing concentrations of complex I substrates, mitoquinone and rotenone had interactive effects on ROS consistent with redox cycling at multiple sites within complex I. Mitoquinone increased respiration in isolated  respiring on complex I but not complex II substrates. Mitoquinone also increased oxygen consumption by intact BAE cells. Moreover, when added to intact cells at 50 to 1000 nM, mitoquinone increased glucose oxidation and reduced fat oxidation, at doses that did not alter membrane potential or induce cell toxicity. Although high dose mitoquinone reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, the positively charged mitochondrial-targeted cation, decyltriphenylphosphonium (mitoquinone without the coenzyme Q moiety), decreased membrane potential more than mitoquinone, but did not alter fuel selectivity. Therefore, non-specific effects of the positive charge were not responsible and the quinone moiety is required for altered nutrient selectivity.In summary, the interactive effects of mitoquinone and rotenone are consistent with redox cycling at more than one site within complex I. In addition, mitoquinone has substrate dependent effects on mitochondrial respiration, increases repiration by intact cells, and alters fuel selectivity favoring glucose over fatty  oxidation at the intact cell level.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23964317>Dietary carnosic  suppresses hepatic steatosis formation via regulation of hepatic fatty  metabolism in high-fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>In this study, we examined the hepatic anti-steatosis activity of carnosic  (CA), a phenolic compound of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) leaves, as well as its possible mechanism of action, in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice model.

Glucolipotoxicity causes cardiomyocyte injury by increasing energy insufficiency, impairing proteasomal-mediated protein degradation and inducing apoptosis. Proteasome-evading proteins are degraded by autophagy in the lysosome, whose metabolism and function are regulated by master regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB). Limited studies have examined the impact of glucolipotoxicity on intra-lysosomal signaling proteins and their regulators. By utilizing a mouse model of diet-induced , type-1 diabetes (Akita) and ex-vivo model of glucolipotoxicity (H9C2 cells and NRCM, neonatal rat cardiomyocyte), we examined whether glucolipotoxicity negatively targets TFEB and lysosomal proteins to dysregulate autophagy and cause cardiac injury. Despite differential effects of  and diabetes on LC3B-II, expression of proteins facilitating autophagosomal clearance such as TFEB, LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were decreased in the obese and diabetic heart. In-vivo data was recapitulated in H9C2 and NRCM cells, which exhibited impaired autophagic flux and reduced TFEB content when exposed to a glucolipotoxic milieu. Notably, overloading myocytes with a saturated fatty  (palmitate) but not an unsaturated fatty  (oleate) depleted cellular TFEB and suppressed autophagy, suggesting a fatty  specific regulation of TFEB and autophagy in the cardiomyocyte. The effect of glucolipotoxicity to reduce TFEB content was also confirmed in heart tissue from patients with Class-I . Therefore, during glucolipotoxicity, suppression of lysosomal autophagy was associated with reduced lysosomal content, decreased cathepsin-B activity and diminished cellular TFEB content likely rendering myocytes susceptible to cardiac injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The dietary treatments were as follows: CON (control total mixed ration with SBM, no WLS), WLS30 (30% of the SBM was replaced, on a DM basis, by WLS), and WLS50 (50% of the SBM was replaced by WLS).Feed intake by the cows was not affected (p = 0.331) by the diets. Milk production decreased with increasing proportions of WLS in the diet. Cows fed WLS50 yielded approximately 1 kg/d (p < 0.001) less milk than cows fed the CON diet. The proportions of milk fat (p = 0.640), protein (p = 0.507), and lactose (p = 0.709) were not altered by the diet.

The fatty  oxidation inhibitor etomoxir did neither reduce OA-induced respiration nor affect the OA-induced GLP-1 release.

Recently, we reported that nitro-fatty acids (NO-FAs), products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions of nitric oxide and nitrite, modulate macrophage and other immune cell functions. Bone marrow cell suspensions were isolated from mice and supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with NO-OA for different times. RAW 264.7 macrophages were used for short-term (1-5min) experiments. We discovered that NO-OA reduces cell numbers, cell colony formation, and proliferation of macrophages differentiated with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), all in the absence of toxicity. In a case of GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), NO-OA acts via downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. In the case of M-CSF-induced BMMs, NO-OA decreases activation of M-CSFR and activation of related PI3K and ERK. Additionally, NO-OA also attenuates activation of BMMs. In aggregate, we demonstrate that NO-OA regulates the process of macrophage differentiation and that NO-FAs represent a promising therapeutic tool in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies linked with increased accumulation of macrophages in inflamed tissues.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the specific mechanism underlying ROS production and OA progression has never been elucidated. Osteoarthritic cartilage was obtained from patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, and chondrocytes were isolated from these tissues. The cells were treated with varying concentrations (10,100,500 μM, and 5 mM) of /palmitate (O/P) mixture at different times, that is at 6, 24, and 48 h. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. ROS production was detected using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The protein levels of NOX4 and cleaved-caspase3 were detected using Western blot assay. O/P significantly decreased cell viability at 10, 100, 500 μM, and 5 mM in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the cell viability was reduced by 500 μM O/P mixture at 6, 24, and 48 h in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with 500 μM O/P significantly enhanced ROS production and cell apoptosis in chondrocytes. Furthermore, treatment with O/P mixture significantly enhanced the expression of NOX4 and caspase3 activation in a dose- and time- dependent manner. More importantly, inhibition of NOX4 could partially eliminate O/P-induced chondrocytes apoptosis by reducing ROS production. To conclude, O/P treatment enhances ROS production and cell apoptosis mainly by upregulating the protein levels of NOX4 and caspase3 activation in chondrocytes, indicating a potential therapeutic target of OA in obesity patients.© 2016 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28887275>FFA4 (GPR120) as a fatty  sensor involved in appetite control, insulin sensitivity and inflammation regulation.</a></h2><p>Unsaturated long-chain fatty acids have been suggested to be beneficial in the context of cardiovascular disorders based in epidemiologic studies conducted in Greenland and Mediterranean.

Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between gustatory salivation and BMI, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, a daytime sleepiness scale) or sleep habits among 26 healthy young individuals (20 males and 6 females; mean age: 26.0 ± 4.3 years). We also measured the saliva flow rate (SFR) that was induced by gum-chewing or each of three prototypical tastants (acetic , sucrose, and NaCl). Further, the SFR was induced by fatty , provided as  (OA) homogenized in non-fat milk. All participants showed normal rates of salivation during resting and gum-chewing states. The increase in the SFR induced by OA, but not by each of the three tastants, was associated with BMI. Moreover, both daytime sleepiness level and frequency of snoring were associated with the increase in the SFR induced by NaCl. These results suggest that BMI is associated with salivation induced by oral fatty  exposure. Additionally, the regulatory mechanism for the NaCl-induced salivation reflex may have a relationship with impairments of the respiratory control system that are related to snoring during sleep and lead to daytime sleepiness because of insufficient sleep.

As a result, MT58 cells have a 50% decrease in their phosphatidylcholine (PC) level within 24 h when cultured at the nonpermissive temperature (40 degrees C). This is due to a relative rapid breakdown of PC that is not compensated for by the inhibition of de novo PC synthesis. Despite this drastic decrease in cellular PC content, cells are viable and can proliferate by addition of lysophosphatidylcholine. By [(3)H]oleate labeling, we found that the FA moiety of the degraded PC is recovered in triacylglycerol. In accordance with this finding, an accumulation of lipid droplets is seen in MT58 cells. Analysis of PC-depleted MT58 cells by electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed a partial dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in spherical structures on both sites of the nucleus, whereas the morphology of the plasma membrane, , and Golgi complex was unaffected. In contrast to these morphological observations, protein transport from the ER remains intact. Surprisingly, protein transport at the level of the Golgi complex is impaired.

We cloned the putative FFAR1 receptor from bovine neutrophils and analyzed the sequence to construct a homology model. Our results revealed that the sequence of bovine FFAR1 shares 84% identity with human FFAR1 and 31% with human FFAR3/GPR41. Therefore, we constructed a homology model of bovine FFAR1 using human as the template.

The expression of miR-150 was up-regulated dramatically in both human NAFLD patients and HFD mice model, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . miR-150 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis and  significantly in NAFLD mice. miR-150 deficiency decreased the expression of genes related to fatty  uptake, synthesis and gluconeogenesis, while increased the expression of genes related to fatty  β-oxidation.

And overexpression of miR-150 significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of CFLAR 3'-UTR, while the effect of miR-150 was blocked when the binding site of miR-150 within the CFLAR 3'-UTR was mutated.

Here, we estimated the turnover of select molecular species of CL in mammalian cell cultures and compared it to the turnover of other lipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol. Cells were labeled with myristic , 9,10-²H₂-, or D-[U-¹³C₆]-glucose and analyzed by mass spectrometry at different time points of pulse-chase experiments. The turnover of glycerol groups was monitored by specific isotopologues that carried ¹³C primarily in the glycerol carbons, whereas the turnover of acyl groups was monitored by molecular species that carried myristoyl or ²H₂-oleoyl groups. We found that the turnover of CL, but not of mitochondrial PC and PE, was substantially slower than the turnover of other cellular phospholipids. In dioleoyl-PC and dioleoyl-PE, the acyl turnover was faster than the glycerol turnover, indicating continuous deacylation and reacylation of the oleoyl residues. In contrast, the acyl turnover was similar to the glycerol turnover in tetraoleoyl-CL, suggesting that oleoyl remodeling did not take place continuously in endogenous CL. We conclude that CL, once assembled in mitochondrial membranes, remains largely inert to degradation and acyl remodeling.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with . Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that RES ameliorated free fatty  (FFA)-induced ( (OA): palmitic  (PA) = 2:1) glycolipid metabolic disorders in hepatocytes. Simultaneously, RES partially reverted the relatively shallow daily oscillations of FFA-induced circadian clock gene transcription and protein expression in HepG2 cells. RES also attenuated FFA-triggered reactive  species (ROS) secretion and restored mitochondrial membrane potential consumption, as well as the restoration of mitochondrial respiratory complex expression. This study provides compelling evidence that RES controls intracellular lipid metabolic imbalance in a Bmal1-dependent manner.

Curcumin has a great potential for anti-oxidation and anti-, but the effect on metabolic reconstruction remains little known. Here we performed metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and explored ethanol pathogenic insight as well as curcumin action pattern. We identified seventy-one metabolites in mouse liver. Carbohydrates and lipids were characteristic categories. Pathway analysis results revealed that ethanol-induced pathways including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty  biosynthesis and pentose and glucuronate interconversions were suppressed by curcumin. Additionally, ethanol enhanced galactose metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway. Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and pyruvate metabolism were inhibited in mice fed ethanol diet plus curcumin. Stearic ,  and linoleic  were disease biomarkers and therapical biomarkers.

The comprehension of controls for carbon partitioning and oil accumulation in nonseed tissues is essential to generate oil-rich biomass in perennial bioenergy crops. Persea americana (avocado), a basal angiosperm with unique features that are ancestral to most flowering plants, stores ~ 70 % TAG per dry weight in its mesocarp, a nonseed tissue. Transcriptome analyses of select pathways, from generation of pyruvate and leading up to TAG accumulation, in mesocarp tissues of avocado was conducted and compared with that of oil-rich monocot (oil palm) and dicot (rapeseed and castor) tissues to identify tissue- and species-specific regulation and biosynthesis of TAG in plants.RNA-Seq analyses of select lipid metabolic pathways of avocado mesocarp revealed patterns similar to that of other oil-rich species. However, only some predominant orthologs of the fatty  biosynthetic pathway genes in this basal angiosperm were similar to those of monocots and dicots. The accumulation of TAG, rich in , was associated with higher transcript levels for a putative stearoyl-ACP desaturase and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated acyl-CoA synthetases, during fruit development. Gene expression levels for enzymes involved in terminal steps to TAG biosynthesis in the ER further indicated that both acyl-CoA-dependent and -independent mechanisms might play a role in TAG assembly, depending on the developmental stage of the fruit. Furthermore, in addition to the expression of an ortholog of WRINKLED1 (WRI1), a regulator of fatty  biosynthesis, high transcript levels for WRI2-like and WRI3-like suggest a role for additional transcription factors in nonseed oil accumulation. Plastid pyruvate necessary for fatty  synthesis is likely driven by the upregulation of genes involved in  and transport of its intermediates. Together, a comparative transcriptome analyses for storage oil biosynthesis in diverse plants and tissues suggested that several distinct and conserved features in this basal angiosperm species might contribute towards its rich TAG content.Our work represents a comprehensive transcriptome resource for a basal angiosperm species and provides insight into their lipid metabolism in mesocarp tissues. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptome of oil-rich mesocarp of avocado, with oil-rich seed and nonseed tissues of monocot and dicot species, revealed lipid gene orthologs that are highly conserved during evolution. The orthologs that are distinctively expressed in oil-rich mesocarp tissues of this basal angiosperm, such as WRI2, ER-associated acyl-CoA synthetases, and lipid-droplet associated proteins were also identified.

Despite the use of new cholesterol-lowering drugs, atherosclerotic vascular disease will likely continue to be the main cause of death in Western countries. Furthermore, the statistical relationship between cholesterol and cardiovascular mortality only explains a relatively minor component of differences in mortality among diverse countries. For these reasons, the interest in preventive approaches complementary or alternative to cholesterol reduction should be one of the main objectives of cardiovascular research in the years to come. Already in the '70s the very low incidence of atherosclerotic diseases in Mediterranean countries (Greece and Southern Italy) and the importance of the "dietary factor" in such protection were noticed. Diets for people in these countries are, among other components, very rich in , the main constituent of olive oil, with about 29% of daily caloric intake derived from monounsaturated fatty acids. , besides exerting relatively minor effects on the quantitative and qualitative regulation of cholesterol levels, appears to interfere directly with the inflammatory response that characterizes early atherogenesis. The endothelial expression of adhesion molecules for circulating monocytes, induced by inflammatory cytokines, minimally oxidized LDL and the advanced glycation end-products present in diabetes, substantially contributes to the onset and early progression of atherosclerosis. In an in vitro model of early atherogenesis based on cultured endothelial cells stimulated by cytokines, we observed that the incorporation of  in total cell lipids--mostly at the expenses of saturated fatty acids--decreases the expression of several endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules, among which vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, involved in the selective monocyte recruitment in the arterial intima.  also determines a parallel reduction in messenger RNA for this molecule, interfering with the activation of the most important transcription factor controlling endothelial activation, nuclear factor-kappa B. Thus, possibly in concert with other more highly unsaturated fatty acids,  may contribute to the prevention of atherosclerosis also through a modulation of gene expression for endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules. This series of investigations emphasizes the possibility of preventive interventions in atherosclerosis based on the modulation of vascular response to classical "triggers" (cholesterol, advanced glycation end-products of diabetes), an intervention strategy fundamentally different from--and thereby complementary to--those now more in fashion.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29959350>Utilization of lactic  in human myotubes and interplay with glucose and fatty  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Once assumed only to be a waste product of anaerobe glycolytic activity, lactate is now recognized as an  source in skeletal muscles.

As major cellular dysfunctions are induced by 7KC, it is important to identify molecules able to impair its side effects. Since consumption of olive and argan oils, and fish is important in the Mediterranean diet, the aim of the study was to determine the ability of  (OA), a major compound of olive and argan oil, and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) present in fatty fishes, such as sardines, to attenuate 7KC-induced cytotoxic effects. Since elaidic  (EA), the trans isomer of OA, can be found in hydrogenated cooking oils and fried foods, its effects on 7KC-induced cytotoxicity were also determined. In murine microglial BV-2 cells, 7KC induces cell growth inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunctions, reactive  species overproduction and lipid peroxidation, increased plasma membrane permeability and fluidity, nuclei condensation and/or fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, which are apoptotic characteristics, and an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, which is a criterion of autophagy. 7KC is therefore a potent inducer of oxiapoptophagy (OXIdation+APOPTOsis+autoPHAGY) on BV-2 cells. OA and EA, but not DHA, also favor the accumulation of lipid droplets revealed with Masson's trichrome, Oil Red O, and Nile Red staining. The cytotoxicity of 7KC was strongly attenuated by OA and DHA. Protective effects were also observed with EA. However, 7KC-induced caspase-3 activation was less attenuated with EA. Different effects of OA and EA on autophagy were also observed. In addition, EA (but not OA) increased plasma membrane fluidity, and only OA (but not EA) was able to prevent the 7KC-induced increase in plasma membrane fluidity. Thus, in BV-2 microglial cells, the principal fatty acids of the Mediterranean diet (OA, DHA) were able to attenuate the major toxic effects of 7KC, thus reinforcing the interest of natural compounds present in the Mediterranean diet to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While some of these proteins are known to be essential for the regulation of cellular and organismic lipid metabolism, key questions concerning LD protein function, such as their targeting to LDs, are still unanswered. Intriguingly, some proteins are restricted to subsets of LDs by an as-yet-unknown mechanism. This finding makes LD targeting even more complex. Here, we characterize the  protein CG2254, which is targeted to subsets of LDs in cultured cells and in different larval  tissues, where the prevalence of subsets of LDs appears highly dynamic. We find that an amphipathic amino  stretch mediates CG2254 LD localization. Additionally, we identified a juxtaposed sequence stretch limiting CG2254 localization to a subset of LDs. This sequence is sufficient to restrict a chimeric protein consisting of the subset-targeting sequence introduced to an otherwise pan-LD-localized protein sequence to a subset of LDs. Based on its subcellular localization and annotated function, we suggest that CG2254 is renamed Lipid droplet subset dehydrogenase 1 (Ldsdh1).© 2017.

They manifest alterations in different biological functions. According to our original phylogenetic theory of general pathology, atherosclerosis is associated with altered biological function of trophology, eating, biological reaction of exotrophy. Atherosclerosis is induced by eating of nonoptimal for phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens meat diet with high content of palmitic saturated fatty  (SFA), which leads to in vivo formation of phylogenetically early low-efficient palmitic pathway of FA metabolism instead of highly-efficient  pathway operating in herbivores. Accumulation of nonligand palmitic very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the bloodstream results from nonphysiological reaction of compensation upon transport of palmitic SFA to cells. An increase in blood content of palmitic triglycerides (TG) and nonligand palmitic VLDLЛ→LDL coincides with the development of hypercholesterolemia: type IV→ type IIb → type V. Atheromatosis compensates changes in lipoproteins by activation of the biological function of endoecology (purity of the extracellular medium) in vivo, thus fulfilling the biological reaction of . This is physiological denaturation of apoВ-100 in nonligand VLDL→LDL by neutrophils via peroxidation, opsonization by the complement components, transcytosis across the endothelial monolayer and removal to the intima of elastic arteries that serves as a collection and utilization pool for phogogens from local intravascular pool of the intercellular medium. Endogenous phlogogens are utilized by phylogenetically early polyfunctional resident macrophages which are small in number and do not proliferate. Blood-borne monocytes-macrophages are also involved in this process, however, they do not express  hydrolase of polyenic cholesteryl esters. Atheromatous masses are partially catabolized polyenic FA esterified by the alcohol cholesterol which were not internalized by cells. Atheromatosis is a process of pathological compensation in the realization of the function of endoecology.

Therefore, their profiles of lipid nutrients and polyphenols were determined.To establish and compare the fatty , tocopherol, phytosterol and polyphenol profiles of Mediterranean oils: cosmetic and dietary argan oils (AO; Morocco: Agadir, Berkane); olive oils (OO; Morocco, Spain, Tunisia); milk thistle seed oils (MTSO; Tunisia: Bizerte, Sousse, Zaghouane); nigella seed oil (NSO).The biochemical profiles were determined by gas chromatography-flame ionization, high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, coupled with mass spectrometry as required. The antioxidant and cytoprotective activities were evaluated with the KRL (Kit Radicaux Libres) and the fluorescein diacetate tests on nerve cells treated with 7-ketocholesterol (7KC).The fatty  profile revealed high linoleic  (C18:2 n-6) content in AO, OO, MTSO and NSO. The highest levels of  (C18:1 n-9) were found in AO and OO. The tocopherol profile showed that Agadir AO contained the highest amount of α-tocopherol, also present at high level in MTSO and Tunisian OO; Berkane AO was rich in γ-tocopherol. The phytosterol profile indicated that β-sitosterol was predominant in the oils, except AO; spinasterol was only present in AO. Polyphenol profiles underlined that OO was the richest in polyphenols; hydroxytyrosol was only found in OO; few polyphenols were detected in AO. The oils studied have antioxidant activities, and all of them, except NSO, prevented 7KC-induced cell death. The antioxidant characteristics of AO were positively correlated with procatechic  and compestanol levels.Based on their biochemical profiles, antioxidant and cytoprotective characteristics, AO, OO, and MTSO are potentially beneficial to human health.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268669>Influence of calcium chloride in the high temperature acetification by strain Acetobacter aceti WK for vinegar.</a></h2><p>To improve the thermotolerant properties (TTP) of acetic  bacteria (AAB) cells for high temperature acetification.At high temperature (36 ± 1°C), the acetification rate (ETA) is usually lower than at 30 ± 1°C.

This study was conducted to examine the therapeutic effect of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a naturally occurring curcuminoid and a metabolite of curcumin, on  (OA)-induced steatosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. HepG2 cells were incubated with OA to induce steatosis, and then treated with various concentrations of THC. The results showed that THC treatment significantly decreased lipid accumulation in OA-treated HepG2 cells, possibly, by inhibiting the expression of the lipogenic proteins, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS), and fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4). Moreover, THC attenuated OA-induced hepatic lipogenesis in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, which was reversed by pretreatment with an AMPK inhibitor. THC promoted lipolysis and upregulated the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation. Glucose uptake and insulin signaling impaired in HepG2 cells incubated with OA were abated by THC treatment, including phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and downstream signaling pathways, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which are involved in  and glycogen synthesis, respectively. Altogether, these results demonstrated the novel therapeutic benefit of THC against hepatic steatosis and, consequently, a potential treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018.

Caspase 8 and Fas-associated protein with death domain-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) is an important target gene in regulating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). At present, the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway related to NASH was unknown. Here the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway and its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism, glucose uptake, oxidative stress and inflammatory response were studied in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells.OA-treated HepG2 cells were employed as a in vitro model of steatosis,  and oxidative stress. The model cells were then treated by silibinin (5, 20, 50, and 100 μM) for 24 h and detected for the related indicators as follows: (1) cellular triglycerides (TG), nitric oxide (NO) and glucose uptake; (2) the mRNA levels of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα); (3) the protein levels of PPARα, SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, CFLAR, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (pAKT), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and 4A (CYP4A).Compared to the control, OA-treatment led to a result as follows: (1) increased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) up-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) decreased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) down-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARα, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2. Compared to OA-treated HepG2 cells, silibinin treatment could improve the indicators as follows: (1) decreased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) down-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) increased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) up-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARα, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2.Silibinin can ameliorate some metabolic alterations and induce some molecular changes by activating the CFLAR-JNK pathway and thereby regulating its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism (PPARα, SREBP-1C and PNPLA3), glucose uptake (PI3K-AKT), oxidative stress (NRF2, CYP2E1, CYP4A) and inflammatory response(NO) in OA-treated HepG2 cells demonstrating its possible use in ameliorating various symptoms of NASH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The first analysis was of two gene families with key roles in regulation of oil quality and in particular the accumulation of , namely stearoyl ACP desaturases (SAD) and acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases (FAT). In both cases, these were found to be large gene families with complex expression profiles across a wide range of tissue types and developmental stages. The detailed classification of the oil palm SAD and FAT genes has enabled the updating of the latest version of the oil palm gene model. The second analysis focused on disease resistance (R) genes in order to elucidate possible candidates for breeding of pathogen tolerance/resistance. Ortholog analysis showed that 141 out of the 210 putative oil palm R genes had homologs in banana and rice. These genes formed 37 clusters with 634 orthologous genes. Classification of the 141 oil palm R genes showed that the genes belong to the Kinase (7), CNL (95), MLO-like (8), RLK (3) and Others (28) categories. The CNL R genes formed eight clusters. Expression data for selected R genes also identified potential candidates for breeding of disease resistance traits.

Nevertheless, matrices with functional properties, such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), should be precisely examined for supplementary advantages. The objective of this study was to identify the existence of combined biological actions of a functional oil enriched in PSs within MCTs and high- canola (HOC), relative to a control (olive oil), in overweight, hyperlipidemic men using a rigorously controlled dietary intervention. Twenty-three overweight, hyperlipidemic men consumed both types of oil in a randomized, crossover trial for 6 weeks each. Fasted plasma samples were collected on the first and last 2 days of each study period. Body weight decreased -1.22 +/- 0.35 kg (P = .0019) and -1.68 +/- 0.47 kg (P = .0016) after the 6-week study period in the olive oil and functional oil groups, respectively. The end points for total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the functional oil group (P = .0006) were lower than in the olive oil group (P = .0002). Total cholesterol values decreased from comparable baseline to end point of 4.71 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) in the functional oil phase and 5.14 +/- 0.19 mmol/L (P = .0001) in the olive oil phase (P = .0592). In addition, LDL-C demonstrated a similar drop, to an end point of 3.12 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (P < .0001) and 3.54 +/- 0.18 mmol/L (P = .0002), for the functional oil and olive oil groups, respectively, with significant changes (P = .0221). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change in either treatment. Triacylglycerol end points decreased in functional oil and olive oil groups (P = .0195 and .0105, respectively) to the same extent from baseline. Results indicate that PSs mixed within an MCT- and HOC-rich matrix lower plasma LDL-C, without significantly changing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, in hyperlipidemic, overweight men, and may therefore decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12785004>Fatty acids and glucose increase neutral endopeptidase activity in human microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), a membrane-bound metallopeptidase enzyme that degrades neuropeptides, bradykinin, atrial natriuretic factor, enkephalins, and endothelin may regulate response to injury.

The effect of the antioxidative agents vitamin E and C on NEP enzyme activation was determined by treating the cultured cells with alpha-tocopherol succinate and/or L-ascorbic . Cell membrane preparations were assayed for NEP activity by incubation with glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methoxy-beta naphthylamide to generate a fluorescent degradation product methoxy 2 naphthylamine.

Antioxidant vitamin E and C treatment significantly reduced NEP enzyme activity after fatty  exposure (P < 0.05). Thus, hyperglycemia and  associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus may increase endothelial cell NEP activity and thereby decrease early pro-inflammatory responses.

ACSs (Acyl-CoA synthetases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the esterification of fatty acids (FA) with CoA. Recent studies suggest that ACS enzymes drive the uptake of LCFA indirectly by their enzymatic activity and could promote special metabolic pathways dependent on their localization.The only protein located at the plasma membrane which has consistently been shown to enhance FA uptake is CD36.The current study investigated whether ACSs and CD36 could regulate hepatic LCFA uptake.FATP2 and FATP4 were both localized to the ER of HuH7 and HepG2 cells as shown by double immunofluorescence in comparison to marker proteins. ACSL1 was located at  in both cell lines. Overexpression of FATP2, FATP4 and ACSL1 highly increased ACS activity as well as the uptake of [3H]- and fluorescent Bodipy-C12 (B12) fatty . Quantitative FACS analysis showed a correlation between ACS expression levels and B12 uptake. FATP2 had the highest effect on B12 uptake of all proteins tested. CD36 was mainly localized at the plasma membrane. Whereas [3H]- uptake was increased after overexpression, CD36 had no effect on B12 uptake.Uptake of LCFA into hepatoma cells can be regulated by the expression levels of intracellular enzymes. We propose that ACS enzymes drive FA uptake indirectly by esterification. Therefore these molecules are potential targets for treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis (NASH).</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15910890>Oleoylethanolamide, an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist, lowers body weight and  in obese rats.</a></h2><p>The fatty- ethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), is a naturally occurring lipid that regulates feeding and body weight [Rodriguez de Fonseca, F., Navarro, M., Gomez, R., Escuredo, L., Nava, F., Fu, J., Murillo-Rodriguez, E., Giuffrida, A., LoVerme, J., Gaetani, S., Kathuria, S., Gall, C., Piomelli, D., 2001.

OEA reduces food intake in wild-type mice, but not in mice deficient in PPAR-alpha (PPAR-alpha(-/-)), an effect that is also observed with the PPAR-alpha agonists Wy-14643 and GW7647 [Brown, P.J., Chapman, J.M., Oplinger, J.A., Stuart, L.W., Willson, T.M. and Wu, Z., 2000.

By contrast, specific agonists of PPAR-delta/beta (GW501516) or PPAR-gamma (ciglitazone) have no such effect. In obese Zucker rats, which lack functional leptin receptors, OEA reduces food intake and lowers body-weight gain along with plasma lipid levels. Similar effects are seen in diet-induced obese rats and mice. In the present study, we report that subchronic OEA treatment (5mgkg(-1), intraperitoneally, i.p., once daily for two weeks) in Zucker rats initiates transcription of PPAR-alpha and other PPAR-alpha target genes, including fatty- translocase (FAT/CD36), liver fatty- binding protein (L-FABP), and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2). Moreover, OEA decreases neutral lipid content in hepatocytes, as assessed by Oil red O staining, as well as serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The results suggest that OEA regulates lipid metabolism and that this effect may contribute to its anti-obesity properties.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29372063>Production of  biomass on sugarcane distillery wastewater: physiological aspects and potential for biodiesel production.</a></h2><p>Sugarcane distillery waste water (SDW) or vinasse is the residual liquid waste generated during sugarcane molasses fermentation and alcohol distillation. Worldwide, this effluent is responsible for serious environmental issues. In Reunion Island, between 100 and 200 thousand tons of SDW are produced each year by the three local distilleries. In this study, the potential of  to reduce the pollution load of SDW and to produce interesting metabolites has been investigated.The fungal biomass yield was 35 g L corresponding to a yield of 0.47 g of biomass/g of vinasse without nutrient complementation. Analysis of sugar consumption indicated that mono-carbohydrates were initially released from residual polysaccharides and then gradually consumed until complete exhaustion. The high biomass yield likely arises from polysaccharides that are hydrolysed prior to be assimilated as monosaccharides and from organic acids and other complex compounds that provided additional C-sources for growth. Comparison of the size exclusion chromatography profiles of raw and pre-treated vinasse confirmed the conversion of humic- and/or phenolic-like molecules into protein-like metabolites. As a consequence, chemical  demand of vinasse decreased by 53%. Interestingly, analysis of intracellular lipids of the biomass revealed high content in  and physical properties relevant for biodiesel application.The soft-rot fungus  demonstrated a great ability to grow on vinasse and to degrade this complex and hostile medium. The high biomass production is accompanied by a utilization of carbon sources like residual carbohydrates, organic acids and more complex molecules such as melanoidins.

Proliferative and synthetic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) increase intimal thickness and destabilize atheromatous plaques. This study aimed to investigate whether saturated palmitic  (PA) and monounsaturated  (OA) modulate autophagy activity, cell proliferation, and vascular tissue remodeling in an aortic VSMC cell line. Exposure to PA and OA suppressed growth of VSMCs without apoptotic induction, but enhanced autophagy flux with elevation of Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3I/II. Cotreatment with autophagy inhibitors potentiated the FFA-suppressed VSMC growth and showed differential actions of PA and OA in autophagy flux retardation. Both FFAs upregulated lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) but only OA increased LDL uptake by VSMCs. Mechanistically, FFAs induced hyperphosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK. All pathways, except OA-activated PI3K/Akt cascade, were involved in the LOX-1 upregulation, whereas blockade of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK cascades ameliorated the FFA-induced growth suppression on VSMCs. Moreover, both FFAs exhibited tissue remodeling effect through increasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and their gelatinolytic activities, whereas high-dose OA significantly suppressed collagen type I expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated LOX-1 knockdown significantly attenuated the OA-induced tissue remodeling effects in VSMCs. In conclusion, OA and PA enhance autophagy flux, suppress aortic VSMC proliferation, and exhibit vascular remodeling effect, thereby leading to the loss of VSMCs and interstitial ECM in vascular walls and eventually the instability of atheromatous plaques.

The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed only in distantly related models and remains poorly understood. Although polarized epithelial cells have a rather simple morphology with a basolateral and an apical domain, hepatocytes exhibit complex polarization structures. However, it has been reported that some selected polarized HepG2 cell clones can exhibit a honeycomb pattern of distribution of the  proteins typical of columnar polarized epithelia, which can be used as a simple model to study the role of cell polarization in viral infection of hepatocytes. To obtain similar clones, HepG2 cells expressing CD81 (HepG2-CD81) were used, and clones were isolated by limiting dilutions. Two clones exhibiting a simple columnar polarization capacity when grown on a semipermeable support were isolated and characterized. To test the polarity of HCV entry and release, our polarized HepG2-CD81 clones were infected with cell culture-derived HCV. Our data indicate that HCV binds equally to both sides of the cells, but productive infection occurs mainly when the virus is added at the basolateral domain. Furthermore, we also observed that HCV virions are released from the basolateral domain of the cells. Finally, when polarized cells were treated with  and U0126, a MEK inhibitor, to promote lipoprotein secretion, a higher proportion of infectious viral particles of lower density were secreted. This cell culture system provides an excellent model to investigate the influence of cell polarization on the HCV life cycle. Hepatitis C is a major health burden, with approximately 170 million persons infected worldwide. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) primarily infects hepatocytes, which are highly polarized cells with a complex organization. The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed in distantly related models and remains unclear. Hepatocyte organization is complex, with multiple apical and basolateral surfaces. A simple culture model of HepG2 cells expressing CD81 that are able to polarize with unique apical and basolateral domains was developed to study HCV infection. With this model, we demonstrated that HCV enters and exits hepatocytes by the basolateral domain. Furthermore, lower-density viral particles were produced under conditions that promote lipoprotein secretion. This cell culture system provides a useful model to study the influence of cell polarization on HCV infection.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword:['tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27508010>Preliminary study of urine metabolism in type two diabetic patients based on GC-MS.</a></h2><p>Comparative study of type 2  and healthy controls by metabolomics methods to explore the pathogenesis of Type II .Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with a variety of multivariate statistical analysis methods to the healthy control group 58 cases, 68 cases of Type II  group were analyzed.

Further, G protein- and β-arrestin-based signaling can be differentially modulated by different ligands, thus eliciting ligand-specific responses ("biased agonism"). Whether GPR40 engages β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms and is subject to biased agonism is unknown. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors for real-time monitoring of cell signaling in living cells, we detected a ligand-induced GPR40-β-arrestin interaction, with the synthetic GPR40 agonist TAK-875 being more effective than palmitate or oleate in recruiting β-arrestins 1 and 2. Conversely, TAK-875 acted as a partial agonist of Gq/11-dependent GPR40 signaling relative to both FFAs. Pharmacological blockade of Gq activity decreased FFA-induced insulin secretion. In contrast, knockdown or genetic ablation of β-arrestin 2 in an insulin-secreting cell line and mouse pancreatic islets, respectively, uniquely attenuated the insulinotropic activity of TAK-875, thus providing functional validation of the biosensor data. Collectively, these data reveal that in addition to coupling to Gq/11, GPR40 is functionally linked to a β-arrestin 2-mediated insulinotropic signaling axis. These observations expose previously unrecognized complexity for GPR40 signal transduction and may guide the development of biased agonists showing improved clinical profile in type 2 .© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829991>Pro-inflammatory fatty  profile and colorectal cancer risk: A Mendelian randomisation analysis.</a></h2><p>While dietary fat has been established as a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), associations between fatty acids (FAs) and CRC have been inconsistent. Using Mendelian randomisation (MR), we sought to evaluate associations between polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated FAs (SFAs) and CRC risk.We analysed genotype data on 9254 CRC cases and 18,386 controls of European ancestry. Externally weighted polygenic risk scores were generated and used to evaluate associations with CRC per one standard deviation increase in genetically defined plasma FA levels.Risk reduction was observed for  and palmitoleic MUFAs (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.92, P = 3.9 × 10; OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.15-0.84, P = 0.018). PUFAs linoleic and arachidonic  had negative and positive associations with CRC respectively (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 3.7 × 10; OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07, P = 1.7 × 10).

In rodents, intragastric infusion of the fatty  amide oleoylethanolamide increases striatal extracellular dopamine levels via vagal afferent signaling. Here we tested whether supplementation with PhosphoLean™, a dietary supplement that contains the precursor of the fatty  amide oleoylethanolamide (N-oleyl-phosphatidylethanolamine), would reduce impulsive responding and alcohol use in heavy drinking young adults. Twenty-two individuals were assigned to a three-week supplementation regimen with PhosphoLean™ or placebo. Impulsivity was assessed with self-report questionnaires and behavioral tasks pre- and post-supplementation. Although self-report measures of impulsivity did not change, supplementation with PhosphoLean™, but not placebo, significantly reduced false alarm rate on a Go/No-Go task. In addition, an association was found between improved sensitivity on the Go/No-Go task and reduced alcohol intake. These findings provide preliminary evidence that promoting fatty  derived gut-brain dopamine communication may have therapeutic potential for reducing impulsivity in heavy drinkers.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Lipotoxicity to the pancreatic beta cells is considered to be a major underlying cause for this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to analyse the toxicity profile of FFAs in the human EndoC-βH1 beta-cell line and to compare the results with isolated rat and human islets with special reference to the physiologically most prevalent FFAs palmitic  (PA) and  (OA). Toxicity after a 2-day incubation with the different FFAs was analysed by the caspase-3 assay and confirmed by the propidium iodide and annexin V staining tests. The long-chain saturated PA (C16:0) and the monounsaturated OA (C18:1) were both toxic to human EndoC-βH1 beta cells and pseudoislets, as well as to rat islets, and, as confirmed in a pilot experiment, also to human islets. Furthermore, OA provided no protection against the toxicity of PA. Likewise, elaidic  (EA, the trans isomer of OA; trans-OA) was significantly toxic, in contrast to the non-metabolisable analogues methylated PA (MePA) and methylated OA (MeOA). Fatty acids with a chain length  < C16 were not toxic in EndoC-βH1 beta cells. Caspase-3 was also activated by linoleic  (LA)(C18:2) but not by γ-linolenic  (γ-LNA)(C18:3). Overall, only long-chain FFAs with chain lengths  > C14, which generate hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation, were toxic. This conclusion is also supported by the toxicity of the branched-chain FFA pristanic , which is exclusively metabolised in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The lack of a protective effect of the monounsaturated fatty  OA has important consequences for a beta-cell protective lipid composition of a diet. A cardioprotective diet with a high OA content does not fulfil this requirement.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171217>Application of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent as the carrier for ferrofluid: A novel strategy for pre-concentration and determination of mefenamic  in human urine samples by high performance liquid chromatography under experimental design optimization.</a></h2><p>In this study, ferrofluid of magnetic nanoparticles,  (OA), combined with hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (FeO [iron oxide]-OA-DES) was prepared and coupled with vortex-assisted liquid phase microextraction, to pre-concentrate and determine mefenamic  (MFA) in urine samples, following high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

At least in the case of COX-2, the enzyme becomes folded into a stable Eallo/Ecat pair. Some COX inhibitors ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coxibs) and common fatty acids (FAs) modulate Ecat activity by binding Eallo. However, the interactions and outcomes often differ between isoforms. For example, naproxen directly and completely inhibits COX-1 by binding Ecat but indirectly and incompletely inhibits COX-2 by binding Eallo. Additionally, COX-1 is allosterically inhibited up to 50% by common FAs like palmitic , whereas COX-2 is allosterically activated 2-fold by palmitic . FA binding to Eallo also affects responses to COX inhibitors. Thus, COXs are physiologically and pharmacologically regulated by the FA tone of the milieu in which each operates-COX-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and COX-2 in the Golgi apparatus. Cross-talk between Eallo and Ecat involves a loop in Eallo immediately downstream of Arg-120. Mutational studies suggest that allosteric modulation requires a direct interaction between the carboxyl group of allosteric effectors and Arg-120 of Eallo; however, structural studies show some allosterically active FAs positioned in COX-2 in a conformation lacking an interaction with Arg-120. Thus, many details about the biological consequences of COX allosterism and how ligand binding to Eallo modulates Ecat remain to be resolved.© 2019 Smith and Malkowski.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28817670>Synthesis, radiosynthesis and in vitro evaluation of 18F-Bodipy-C16/triglyceride as a dual modal imaging agent for brown adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue research is in the focus in the field of endocrinology.

Blockage in the wild-type strain is due to repression of  operon transcription, leading to levels of fatty  synthetic proteins (including AcpA) that are insufficient to support  synthesis. Transcription of the  operon is regulated by FabT, a repressor protein that binds DNA only when it is bound to an acyl-ACP ligand. Since AcpA is encoded in the  operon, its synthesis is blocked when the operon is repressed and  thus cannot provide a stable supply of ACP for synthesis of the acyl-ACP ligand required for DNA binding by FabT. In contrast to AcpA,  transcription is unaffected by growth with exogenous fatty acids and thus provides a stable supply of ACP for conversion to the acyl-ACP ligand required for repression by FabT. Indeed,  and  strains have essentially the same  fatty  synthesis phenotype in -grown cultures, which argues that neither strain can form the FabT-acyl-ACP repression complex. Finally, acylated derivatives of both AcpB and AcpA were substrates for the  enoyl-ACP reductases and for  PlsX (acyl-ACP; phosphate acyltransferase).

Following treatment of cells with various concentrations of elaidic  or with vehicle for 24 h, cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive  species (ROS) release were measured using flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was measured by Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining, and cellular redox status was determined using ELISA analysis. Furthermore, western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of factors associated with oxidative damage and components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways. The results demonstrated that elaidic  treatment inhibited cell viability, elevated cell apoptosis and resulted in a loss of MMP. In addition, elaidic  induced marked alterations in cellular redox status. Treatment with high doses of elaidic  treatment also enhanced the release of ROS, and upregulated lipid peroxide and malondialdehyde levels; however, it reduced superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Furthermore, elaidic  resulted in upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 and downregulation of heme oxygenase 1, which are two key antioxidative factors. Elaidic  treatment also induced or inhibited the expression of numerous ER stress/UPR‑associated molecules. It induced glucose‑regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expression, whereas the expression levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) were upregulated and then downregulated following treatment with various doses of elaidic . These results indicated that elaidic  inhibited SH‑SY5Y cell growth and induced apoptosis by enhancing oxidative stress and activating the ER stress/UPR signaling pathway and the GRP78/ATF4/CHOP pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27341449>Identification of Novel Genetic Determinants of Erythrocyte Membrane Fatty  Composition among Greenlanders.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) are involved in cellular processes important for normal body function, and perturbation of FA balance has been linked to metabolic disturbances, including type 2 diabetes. An individual's level of FAs is affected by diet, lifestyle, and genetic variation. We aimed to improve the understanding of the mechanisms and pathways involved in regulation of FA tissue levels, by identifying genetic loci associated with inter-individual differences in erythrocyte membrane FA levels. We assessed the levels of 22 FAs in the phospholipid fraction of erythrocyte membranes from 2,626 Greenlanders in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped on the MetaboChip or imputed. We identified six independent association signals. Novel loci were identified on chromosomes 5 and 11 showing strongest association with  (rs76430747 in ACSL6, beta (SE): -0.386% (0.034), p = 1.8x10-28) and docosahexaenoic  (rs6035106 in DTD1, 0.137% (0.025), p = 6.4x10-8), respectively. For a missense variant (rs80356779) in CPT1A, we identified a number of novel FA associations, the strongest with 11-eicosenoic  (0.473% (0.035), p = 2.6x10-38), and for variants in FADS2 (rs174570), LPCAT3 (rs2110073), and CERS4 (rs11881630) we replicated known FA associations. Moreover, we observed metabolic implications of the ACSL6 (rs76430747) and CPT1A (rs80356779) variants, which both were associated with altered HbA1c (0.051% (0.013), p = 5.6x10-6 and -0.034% (0.016), p = 3.1x10-4, respectively). The latter variant was also associated with reduced  (HOMA-IR, -0.193 (0.050), p = 3.8x10-6), as well as measures of smaller body size, including weight (-2.676 kg (0.523), p = 2.4x10-7), lean mass (-1.200 kg (0.271), p = 1.7x10-6), height (-0.966 cm (0.230), p = 2.0x10-5), and BMI (-0.638 kg/m2 (0.181), p = 2.8x10-4). In conclusion, we have identified novel genetic determinants of FA composition in phospholipids in erythrocyte membranes, and have shown examples of links between genetic variants associated with altered FA membrane levels and changes in metabolic traits.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218681>Graphene oxide nano-bio interaction induces inhibition of spermatogenesis and disturbance of fatty  metabolism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Graphene oxide (GO) has the potential for wide applications, which necessitates an intensive investigation of its potential hazard on human and environmental health. Even if previous studies show reproductive toxicity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the mechanisms of reproductive toxicity by GO are poorly understood. To understand the underlying mechanisms of GO-induced reproductive toxicity, we investigated the interaction between GO and C. elegans using Raman spectroscopy, sperm counts produced by spermatogenesis, progeny and analyzed the fatty  metabolism using molecular techniques. GO-characteristic Raman spectral bands measured throughout C. elegans, brood size and Hoecst staining of dissected gonads clearly showed GO accumulation in the reproductive organs, reduced progeny and low sperm counts, which are possibly direct results of the reproductive toxicity from GO exposure. Interestingly, reduced fatty  metabolites, such as stearic, , palmitoleic, and palmitic acids, were found with GO exposure. We found that GO increased intestinal fat accumulation in wild type N2, fat-5(tm420), and fat-7(wa36) mutants, whereas it decreased fat storage in the fat-6(tm331) and nhr-49(nr2041) mutants. GO exposure affected C. elegans fat accumulation and consumption, which was possibly regulated by daf-16 and nhr-80 gene activity. Also, GO exposure suppressed the survival of long-lived fat-5(tm420) mutants, whereas it increased the survival of short-lived nhr-49(nr2041) mutants. Hence, our studies collectively indicated that GO accumulation in reproductive organs, suppression of spermatogenesis, and the alteration of fatty  metabolism play critical roles in understanding mechanisms of toxicity in C. elegans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results obtained from a number of experimental studies suggest that targeting different components of the inflammatory machinery may result in the improvement of the metabolic phenotype. Unsaturated fatty acids exert antiinflammatory activity through several distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested the capacity of ω3 and ω9 fatty acids, directly from their food matrix, to exert antiinflammatory activity through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 and GPR40 pathways. GPR120 was activated in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues, reverting inflammation and  in obese mice. Part of this action was also mediated by GPR40 on muscle, as a novel mechanism described. Pair-feeding and immunoneutralization experiments reinforced the pivotal role of GPR120 as a mediator in the response to the nutrients. The improvement in  sensitivity in the high-fat substituted diets was associated with a marked reduction in tissue inflammation, decreased macrophage infiltration, and increased IL-10 levels. Furthermore, improved glucose homeostasis was accompanied by the reduced expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and reduced body mass.

With the increased prevalence of obesity, and consequently NAFLD, there is a need for novel therapeutics in this area. To facilitate this effort, a cellular model of hepatic steatosis was developed using HepaRG cells and the resulting biochemical alterations were determined.Using global metabolomic profiling, by means of a novel metabolite extraction procedure, the metabolic profiles in response to the saturated fatty  palmitate, and a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, palmitate and oleate (1:2) were examined.We observed elevated levels of the branched chain amino acids, tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates, sphingosine and acylcarnitines, and reduced levels of carnitine in the steatotic HepaRG model with both palmitate and palmitate:oleate treatments. In addition, elevated levels of diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols as well as altered bile  metabolism were selectively displayed by palmitate-induced steatotic cells.Biochemical changes in pathways important in the transition to hepatic steatosis including insulin resistance, altered mitochondrial metabolism, and oxidative stress are revealed by this global metabolomic approach.

Recently, many smart redox-sensitive nanocarriers have been developed to address this problem. However, due to significant tumor heterogeneity, some redox-sensitive nanomedicines still show poor selectivity in drug release. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a ROS-triggered prodrug nanoplatform fabricated with oxidation-responsive cabazitaxel (CTX) prodrugs for synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy, thioether-/selenoether-linked conjugates of CTX and  (OA). These prodrugs can be readily self-assembled into nanoparticles, with pyropheophorbide a (PPa) co-encapsulated into the prodrug-nanosystem for combination therapy. The dual-source ROS-responsive prodrug nanosystems selectively and rapidly release CTX not only in response to endogenous ROS overproduced in tumor cells, but also to exogenous PPa-generated ROS under laser irradiation. Moreover, the selenium-containing linkage demonstrates significant advantages over a sulfur-containing linkage in terms of ROS-triggered drug release and cytotoxicity. The prepared prodrug-nanosystems significantly prolong the systemic circulation and tumor distribution of both CTX and PPa, thereby demonstrating synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy in vivo.

Obesity is closely associated with life-style-related diseases. This study was performed to clarify whether chikusetsusaponins prevent obesity induced in mice by a high-fat diet for 9 weeks.We performed two in vivo experiments. In one, female ICR mice were fed a high-fat diet with or without 1 or 3% chikusetsusaponins isolated from P. japonicus rhizomes for 9 weeks. In the other, lipid emulsion with or without chikusetsusaponins was administered orally to male Wistar rats, and then the plasma triacylglycerol level was measured 0.5 to 5 h after the orally administered lipid emulsion. For in vitro experiments, the inhibitory effects of total chikusetsusaponins and various purified chikusetsusaponins on pancreatic lipase activity were determined by measuring the rate of release of  from triolein in an assay system using triolein emulsified with lecithin.Total chikusetsusaponins prevented the increases in body weight and parametrial adipose tissue weight induced by a high-fat diet. Furthermore, consumption of a high-fat diet containing 1 or 3% total chikusetsusaponins significantly increased the fecal content and triacylglycerol level at day 3 compared with the high-fat diet groups. Total chikusetsusaponins inhibited the elevation of the plasma triacylglycerol level 2 h after the oral administration of the lipid emulsion. Total chikusetsusaponins, chikusetsusaponin III, 28-deglucosyl-chikusetsusaponin IV and 28-deglucosyl-chikusetsusaponin V inhibited the pancreatic lipase activity.The anti-obesity effects of chikusetsusaponins isolated from P. japonicus rhizomes in mice fed a high-fat diet may be partly mediated through delaying the intestinal absorption of dietary fat by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity.

One of the typical properties of this family, which includes milk thistle (), is the richness of the oil in various compounds (flavonoids, alkaloids, tocopherols, and unsaturated fatty acids). Currently, and for the coming decades, age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, are a major public health problem. Preventing their appearance or opposing their evolution is a major objective. In this context, the cytoprotective activities of milk thistle seed oil produced in Tunisia were studied on the 158N model using 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) and 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S) as cytotoxic agents. 7KC and 24S were used because they can be increased in the brain and body fluids of patients with major age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In order to evaluate the cytoprotective properties of milk thistle seed oil, complementary techniques of microscopy, flow cytometry, and biochemistry were used. The chemical composition of milk thistle seed oil has also been determined by various chromatography techniques. Milk thistle seed oils from different area of Tunisia are rich in tocopherols and are strongly antioxidant according to various biochemical tests (KRL (Kit Radicaux Libres), FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power), and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl)).

In this work we combined ligand blotting assays and tandem mass spectrometry to characterize proteins with the property to bind lipophorin at the midgut membrane of Panstrongylus megistus, a vector of Chagas' disease. We further evaluated the role of lipophorin binding proteins in the transfer of lipids between the midgut and lipophorin.

It was shown that β-ATPase partially co-localizes with lipophorin at the plasma membrane of isolated enterocytes and in the sub-epithelial region of the midgut tissue. The interaction of endogenous lipophorin and β-ATPase was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Blocking of β-ATPase significantly diminished the binding of lipophorin to the isolated enterocytes and to the midgut tissue. In vivo assays injecting the β-ATPase antibody significantly reduced the transfer of [(3)H]-diacylglycerol from the midgut to the hemolymph in insects fed with [9,10-(3)H]-, supporting the involvement of lipophorin-β-ATPase association in the transfer of lipids. In addition, the β-ATPase antibody partially impaired the transfer of fatty acids from lipophorin to the midgut, a less important route of lipid delivery to this tissue.

PPAR alpha is involved in the regulation of in vivo triglyceride levels, presumably through its effects on fatty  and lipoprotein metabolism. Some nuclear receptors have been involved in rapid effects mediated by non-genomic mechanisms. In this paper, we report the rapid non-genomic effects of PPAR alpha ligands on the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and secretion of insulin in freshly isolated mouse islets of Langerhans. The hypolipidemic fibrate PPAR alpha agonist WY-14 643 decreased the glucose-induced calcium oscillations in intact islets. This effect was mimicked by the synthetic agonist GW7647 and the endogenous agonist oleylethanolamide. The WY-14 643 action was rapid in onset (5 min) and was still produced in the presence of protein and mRNA synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide, and actinomycin-d. This suggests that it is independent of gene transcription. In addition, WY-14 623 impaired mitochondrial function, increased ROS formation and decreased insulin release. PPAR alpha is present in beta-cells, mainly in the cytosol and nucleus, with a small subpopulation localized in the plasma membrane. However, the presence of the PPAR alpha ligand effects in mice bearing a disrupted Ppar alpha gene raises the possibility that the rapid effects of the agonists in pancreatic beta-cells are independent of the receptor.

Aliphatic formates, such as (,)-8,11-heptadecadienyl formate (8,11-F17) and ()-8-heptadecenyl formate (8-F17), are rarely encountered natural products that are abundant in  sp. Sasagawa (Acari: Acaridae) mite secretions. Linoleic  and  are predicted as key intermediates in the synthesis of the closely related aliphatic formates. To gain insight in this biosynthetic pathway, acarid mite feeding experiments were conducted using C-labeled precursors to precisely track incorporation. Analyses using C NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that the C-labeling pattern of the precursors was detectable on formates in exocrine secretions and likewise on fatty acids in total lipid pools. Curiously, the results demonstrated that the formates were biosynthesized without the dehomologation of corresponding fatty acids. Careful examination of the mass spectra from labeling experiments revealed that the carbonyl carbon of the formates is originally derived from the C-1 position of the fatty acids. Consistent with a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reaction, labeling studies support the insertion of an  atom between the carbonyl group and carbon chain. Empirical data support the existence of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase responsible for the catalyzation of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. The predicted existence of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase capable of converting aliphatic aldehydes to formates represents an exciting opportunity to expand the enzymatic toolbox available for controlled biochemical synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26138421>[Effects of mechanical ventilation with different tidal volumes on coagulation/fibrinolysis in rabbits with acute respiratory distress syndrome].</a></h2><p>To observe the effects of mechanical ventilation with different tidal volumes (VT) on coagulability and fibrinolytic characteristics in rabbits with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by two-hits with  (OA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Forty healthy adult male rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (8 rabbits in each group): sham operation group, model group, low VT group (6 mL/kg), rontine VT group (10 mL/kg ), high VT group (15 mL/kg). ARDS model was reproduced by sequential injection of 0.1 mL/kg OA and 500 μg/kg LPS via auricular vein, and the rabbits in sham operation group received normal saline in same volume. Mechanical ventilation was performed in different VT groups after model reproduction, and the end of the experiment was determined as 6 hours after LPS injection. Blood was collected from the carotid artery at 30 minutes and 360 minutes after LPS injection, with which arterial partial pressure of  (PaO2) was determined, and oxygenation index was calculated. Internal jugular vein blood was collected at 5, 120, 240, and 360 minutes after LPS injection, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (Fib) and antithrombin III (AT-III) were determined. The blood was collected at the end of the experiment, and then the rabbits were sacrificed, and serum levels of procollagen type III (PIIIP), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as well as PIIIP level in lung tissue were determined. The wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) of lung tissues was calculated.Compared with sham operation group, oxygenation index at both 30 minutes and 360 minutes were significantly decreased in model group, while W/D ratio was significantly increased. PT and APTT at 5 minutes were significantly shortened followed by a gradual increase. Fib and AT-III showed no change at 5 minutes followed by a gradual decrease, while serum PAI-1 and PIIIP as well as PIIIP in lung tissue were significantly increased. There was no significant difference in oxygenation index between all VT groups and model group, with a tendency to increase in low VT group. W/D ratio in low VT group was the lowest (5.09±0.19), and it was significantly lower than that of the model group (6.02±0.27, P<0.01), while it was the highest in high VT group (6.27±0.32).

The change tendency of all parameters in routine VT group was lower than that in low VT group, PT at 120 minutes and 360 minutes, APTT at 240 minutes and 360 minutes was significantly shorter than that in model group, and Fib at 120 minutes and 240 minutes were significantly higher than those in model group (all P<0.05). No significant difference was found in AT-III, serum PAI-1 and PIIIP as well as lung PIIIP as compared with model group. PT and APTT at 360 minutes in high VT group were significantly longer than those in model group, Fib at 360 minutes was significantly lower than that in model group, and lung PIIIP was significantly higher than that in model group.There are some important changes in coagulability which changes from a hyper state into a hypo coagulate state, while fibrinolysis is inhibited during the pathological process of ARDS produced by two-hit of OA and LPS. Mechanical ventilation with low VT can obviously improve coagulability and fibrinolytic status, while ventilation with routine VT has little effect on coagulability and fibrinolytic status. Mechanical ventilation with high VT, however, will greatly deteriorate the coagulability and fibrinolytic function in ARDS.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527986>Energy and nitrogen partitioning in dairy cows at low or high metabolizable protein levels is affected differently by postrumen glucogenic and lipogenic substrates.</a></h2><p>This study tested the effects of energy from glucogenic (glucose; GG) or lipogenic (palm olein; LG) substrates at low (LMP) and high (HMP) metabolizable protein levels on whole-body energy and N partitioning of dairy cattle. Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty  constituents are palmitic, , and linoleic ), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine energy and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross energy intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated energy retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk fat yield and milk energy output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable energy intake, increased milk fat yield and milk energy output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty  concentrations, and had no effect on energy retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable energy intake, and total milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields. Milk energy output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total energy retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted energy retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra energy intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, it has been found that the NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to inflammatory response. However, there are no reports about the involvement of NLRP3 in PFE- associated ALI. Glibenclamide is a kind of hypoglycaemic drug with anti-inflammatory effect. It has been reported to have the anti-inflammatory effect related to inhibiting NLRP3.  To determine whether NLRP3 inflammasome was involved in ALI induced by PFE or whether glibenclamide had therapeutic effects on such lung injury, we designed this experiment.  The rat model of intravenous injection of  (OA) was used to simulate PFE. Rats were divided into three groups: control, OA and glibenclamide treatment group. Blood free fatty  (FFA) concentration was determined by ACS-ACOD. Histopathological examinations were taken to assess the severity of lung injury. The expression of NLRP3 pathway and its downstream products were analyzed by IHC, WB, qPCR and ELISA.  Four hours after intravenous OA injection, the typical pathological manifestations of ALI accompanied by elevated levels of plasma FFAs were found. The activity of NLRP3 inflammasomes increased in OA group, too. Pretreatment with glibenclamide partly inhibited the increase in NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β expression induced by OA, simultaneously attenuated the lung injury. But it has little effect on the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in this experiment.

In the present study, increasing doses of a preparation of omega-3 rich phospholipids extracted from krill oil were administered orally to non-human primates for 12 weeks and the time course of EPA, DHA and 22 other fatty acids in erythrocytes was determined bi-weekly during treatment and for 8 weeks after cessation of treatment. Plasma concentrations of six endocannabinoid-type mediators being downstream metabolites of some fatty acids analyzed in erythrocytes were also determined.Six diabetic, dyslipidemic non-human primates were included, three in a vehicle control group and three being treated with the omega-3 rich phospholipid preparation. The vehicle control and test items were given daily by gavage and the test item doses were 50, 150 and 450 mg phospholipids/kg/day. Each dose level was given for four weeks. Blood was sampled at baseline and thereafter bi-weekly. Fatty acids were determined in erythrocytes by methylation followed by gas-chromatography. Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators were analyzed in plasma by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry.The treatment resulted in a dose-related increase in the fraction of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte membranes and a dose-related decrease of other poly-unsaturated fatty acids, in particular omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Erythrocyte concentrations of saturated fatty acids remained unchanged throughout the experiment. Plasma concentrations of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like mediators changed accordingly as those being downstream arachidonic  decreased, downstream of the saturated palmitic and  acids remained unchanged while a downstream EPA metabolite increased.Increasing the omega-3 index by administering an omega-3 rich phospholipid extracted from krill oil did not alter the ratio of unsaturated vs. saturated fatty acids in the erythrocyte membranes but only the relative concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids, in particular unsaturated omega-6 fatty acids.

As a secondary crosslinking mechanism, glutaraldehyde unfolds some of the α-helices and turns them into β-sheets. While crosslinking resulted in stiffer and less ductile zein films, it made the surface of the films rougher, measured using AFM, and more hydrophilic, measured using WCA. In the crosslinking conditions in this study, the number of crosslinks estimated from rubber elasticity theory were not enough to change the water vapor permeability of the films significantly.

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been used as both diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, their application is often limited because of a lack of water solubility, lack of cancer treatment efficacy, and ineffective targeting of tumour cells. In this report, a double ligand (caffeic -polyethylene glycol-folic ; FA-PEG-CA, caffeic -polyethylene glycol-pheophorbide-a; PheoA-PEG-CA) coated iron oxide nanoparticle has been fabricated that overcomes the limitations of conventional SPION. Photosensitizer and tumour targeting ligands were coated on SPION using a ligand-substitution method. We confirmed the successful substitution of  ligands with FA-PEG-CA and PheoA-PEG-CA ligands by FT-IR spectroscopy. The caffeic  coated iron oxide nanoparticles (CAMNPs) also demonstrated high water solubility in an aqueous environment and folate-mediated active tumour targeting. The water solubility of CAMNPs was evaluated by DLS measurement and TEM images. The cytotoxicity of CAMNPs increased two-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells at a laser irradiation condition. The fabricated CAMNPs retained their ability to function as both MRI diagnostic and tumour-selective therapeutic agents.

Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was suppressed in the pulmonary artery of EPC-treated animals.

This study aims to remodel energy metabolism in myotubes by replacing glucose with galactose during growth and differentiation to ultimately examine the consequences for fatty  and glucose metabolism. Exposure to galactose showed an increased [(14)C] oxidation, whereas cellular uptake of  uptake was unchanged. On the other hand, both cellular uptake and oxidation of [(14)C]glucose increased in myotubes exposed to galactose. In the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide p-trifluormethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) the reserve capacity for glucose oxidation was increased in cells grown with galactose. Staining and live imaging of the cells showed that myotubes exposed to galactose had a significant increase in mitochondrial and neutral lipid content. Suppressibility of fatty  oxidation by acute addition of glucose was increased compared to cells grown in presence of glucose. In summary, we show that cells grown in galactose were more oxidative, had increased oxidative capacity and higher mitochondrial content, and showed an increased glucose handling. Interestingly, cells exposed to galactose showed an increased suppressibility of fatty  metabolism. Thus, galactose improved glucose metabolism and metabolic switching of myotubes, representing a cell model that may be valuable for metabolic studies related to insulin resistance and disorders involving mitochondrial impairments.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857237>Cellular metabolism network of Bacillus thuringiensis related to erythromycin stress and degradation.</a></h2><p>Erythromycin is one of the most widely used macrolide antibiotics. To present a system-level understanding of erythromycin stress and degradation, proteome, phospholipids and membrane potentials were investigated after the erythromycin degradation. Bacillus thuringiensis could effectively remove 77% and degrade 53% of 1 µM erythromycin within 24 h. The 36 up-regulated and 22 down-regulated proteins were mainly involved in spore germination, chaperone and nucleic  binding. Up-regulated ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase and ribosomal proteins confirmed that the synthesis of protein, DNA and RNA were enhanced after the erythromycin degradation. The reaction network of /gluconeogenesis was activated, whereas, the activity of spore germination was decreased. The increased synthesis of phospholipids, especially, palmitoleic  and , altered the membrane permeability for erythromycin transport. Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase and palmitoleic  could be biomarkers to reflect erythromycin exposure. Lipids, disease, pyruvate metabolism and citrate cycle in human cells could be the target pathways influenced by erythromycin. The findings presented novel insights to the interaction among erythromycin stress, protein interaction and metabolism network, and provided a useful protocol for investigating cellular metabolism responses under pollutant stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We examined changes in fatty acids (FAs) released from isolated renal cortical  subjected to Ca(2+)-induced MPT. Exposing  to Ca(2+) stimulated mitochondrial swelling and release of FAs such as arachidonic (20:4) and docosahexenoic acids which increased 71% and 32%, respectively, and linoleic (18:2) which decreased 23% compared to controls. Stearic (18:0),  (18:1), and linoleic (18:3) acids were unchanged. To elucidate a mechanism for FA release,  were pre-treated with bromoenolactone (BEL) to inhibit Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) gamma activity (iPLA(2)γ). BEL blocked Ca(2+)-induced release of arachidonic and behenic (22:0) acids. Finally, four FAs were released in the absence of Ca(2+) in a BEL-sensitive manner, including arachidonic and docosatrienoic acids. Thus, extensive FA release occurs during Ca(2+)-induced MPT, and that mitochondrial iPLA(2)γ maintains mitochondrial arachidonic  homeostasis under both basal and Ca(2+)-induced stress conditions.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The tiger groupers were infected with Vibrio vulnificus for 21 days. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analysis was used to assess the variation in metabolite profiles of E. fuscoguttatus. Metabolite productions in infected fishes were significantly influenced by fatty  production. The Omega 9 (ω-9) was abundant under the challenged conditions compared to Omega 3 (ω-3) and Omega 6 (ω-6). A total of six fatty acids from the ω-9 group were detected in high concentration in the infected fishes compared to the control groupers. These metabolites are , Palmitoleic , 6,9-Octadecenoic , 8,11-Eicosadienoic , cis-Erucic  and 5,8,11-Eicosatrienoic . The production of ω-9 differed significantly (p ≤ 0.001) in the challenged samples. The detected ω-9 compounds were quantified based on three different extraction techniques with Supelco 37-component FAME mix (Supelco, USA). The highest concentration of ω-9 groups compared to the other fatty acids detected is 1320.79 mg/4 g and the lowest is 939 mg/4 g in challenged-starved; meanwhile, in challenged-fed, the highest concentration detected is 1220.87 mg/4 g and the lowest is 917.25 mg/4 g.

In the present study, two concentrations of GABA, i.e., 0.5 mM and 1 mM were applied to examine the tolerance of rice seedlings against As(III) (25 µM) toxicity, through the modulations of fatty acids (FAs), stress responsive amino acids (AAs) and polyamines (PAs) biosynthesis. Exogenous GABA (0.5 mM) application significantly reduced the HO and TBARS levels and recovered the growth parameters against As(III) stressed rice seedlings. Simultaneously, co-application of GABA (0.5 and 1 mM) and As(III), consistently enhanced the level of unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) (cis-10-pentadecanoic , , α-linolenic  and γ-linolenic ), which was higher than saturated fatty  (SFA). Among the USFAs, level of linolenic  was found to be always higher with GABA application. Similarly, elevated level of AAs (proline, methionine, glutamic  and cysteine) was also observed with the application of GABA (0.5 and 1 mM) in As(III) stressed seedlings. GABA also enhanced the expression of genes involved in the polyamine synthesis pathway namely arginine decarboxylase (AD), spermine (SPM) and spermidine (SPD) synthase against As(III) treatments, which was higher in roots than in shoots, resulting in enhanced root PAs level. Contrarily, the expression of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (S-AMD) was significantly higher in shoots. Among all the PAs, level of putrescine (PUT) was found to be highest with GABA application. Overall, the study demonstrates that GABA (0.5 mM) at lower concentration plays a vital role in As(III) tolerance by enhancing the biosynthesis of USFA, AA and PA, reducing the level of TBARS and HO in rice seedlings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Intranasal instillation with cSiO triggers profuse inflammation in the lung and onset of autoimmunity in lupus-prone mice; however, dietary supplementation with the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  docosahexaenoic  (DHA) abrogates these responses. Inflammasome activation, IL-1 cytokine release, and death in alveolar macrophages following cSiO exposure are early and critical events that likely contribute to triggering premature autoimmune pathogenesis by this particle. Here we tested the hypothesis that DHA suppresses cSiO-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1 cytokine release, and cell death in the macrophage. The model used was the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line stably transfected with the inflammasome adapter protein ASC (RAW-ASC). Following priming with LPS, both the canonical activator nigericin and cSiO elicited robust inflammasome activation in RAW-ASC cells, as reflected by IL-1β release and caspase-1 activation. These responses were greatly diminished or absent in wild-type RAW cells. In contrast to IL-1β, cSiO induced IL-1α release in both RAW-ASC and to a lesser extent in RAW-WT cells after LPS priming. cSiO-driven effects in RAW-ASC cells were confirmed in bone-marrow derived macrophages. Pre-incubating RAW-ASC cells with 10 and 25 μM DHA for 24 h enriched this fatty  in the phospholipids by 15- and 25-fold, respectively, at the expense of . DHA pre-incubation suppressed inflammasome activation and release of IL-1β and IL-1α by nigericin, cSiO, and two other crystals - monosodium urate and alum. DHA's suppressive effects were linked to inhibition of LPS-induced , and  transcription, potentially through the activation of PPARγ. Finally, nigericin-induced death was inflammasome-dependent, indicative of pyroptosis, and could be inhibited by DHA pretreatment. In contrast, cSiO-induced death was inflammasome-independent and not inhibited by DHA. Taken together, these findings indicate that DHA suppresses cSiO-induced inflammasome activation and IL-1 cytokine release in macrophages by acting at the level of priming, but was not protective against cSiO-induced cell death.Copyright © 2019 Wierenga, Wee, Gilley, Rajasinghe, Bates, Gavrilin, Holian and Pestka.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27246737>Supplementing dietary sugar promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress-independent  and fatty liver in goose.</a></h2><p>It is known that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) contributes to  (IR) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mammals. However, we recently demonstrated that overfeeding with a traditional diet (mainly consisting of cooked maize) does not induce ERS in goose. As cellular studies show that high glucose and palmitate can trigger ERS in mammalian cells, we hypothesized that supplementing sugar to the traditional diet could induce ERS, thus promoting  and fatty liver. To test the hypothesis, we first treated goose primary hepatocytes with high glucose (25 mM and 50 mM) and palmitate (0.5 mM) supplemented with or without 0.25 mM oleate. Data indicated that, as in mammalian cells, high glucose and palmitate indeed induced ERS in goose primary hepatocytes, and palmitate-induced ERS was suppressed by supplemental 0.25 mM oleate. We then tested the hypothesis with an in vivo study, in which Landes geese overfed with traditional or novel diets (i.e., the traditional diet supplemented with sugar) were compared with control geese (normally fed with cooked maize) for ERS, IR and fatty liver. The differences in glucose tolerance,  tolerance and postprandial blood glucose between the geese overfed with traditional and novel diets suggested that supplementing dietary sugar promoted IR. This promotion was accompanied with an increasing trend of liver weight and abdominal fat weight relative to body weight. Surprisingly, compared to overfeeding with the traditional diet, overfeeding with the novel diet did not induce ERS, even further suppressed ERS in goose fatty liver. Together, our findings suggest that supplementing dietary sugar promotes ERS-independent IR and fatty liver in goose. It is intriguing to discover the factor(s) protecting goose liver from ERS as well as the non-ERS mechanism underlying IR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Sunflower seed oil is one of the vegetable oils most commonly used in the food industry. Two variables were applied to the low  sunflower seed oil in this work i.e. heating temperature (180-210-240°C) and time of heating (15-30-60-120 minutes), to study from the edible point of view the variations of its physico-chemical properties. After 120 minutes heating at 240°C the following was found: refractive index (1.476), free acidity (0.35%), K232 (2.87), K270 (3.71), antiradical activity (45.90% inhibition), total phenols (523 mg kg), peroxide value (17.00 meq kg), p-anisidine value (256.8) and Totox (271.7), all of which showed a constant deterioration.

Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected liver disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency) liver diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with liver steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major liver diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and insulin (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific fatty -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, , behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD.

In mice, both a single bout of exercise and exercise training increased circulating 12,13-diHOME and surgical removal of brown adipose tissue (BAT) negated the increase in 12,13-diHOME, suggesting that BAT is the tissue source for exercise-stimulated 12,13-diHOME. Acute 12,13-diHOME treatment of mice in vivo increased skeletal muscle fatty  uptake and oxidation, but not glucose uptake.

In contrast to palmitic , unsaturated fatty acids produced significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both cell types. Increases were fatty  specific, dose-dependent and different for each cell type. The arachidonic  effects on [Ca2+]i were higher in spermatids than in spermatocytes and persisted when residual extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i originated from release of intracellular calcium stores. At the concentrations required for these increases, unsaturated fatty acids produced no significant changes in the plasma membrane potential of or non-specific permeability in spermatogenic cells. For the case of arachidonic , the [Ca2+]i increases were not caused by its metabolic conversion to eicosanoids or anandamide; thus we attribute this effect to the fatty  itself. As estimated with fluorescent probes, unsaturated fatty acids did not affect the intracellular pH but were able to induce a progressive decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The association of this decrease with reduced reactive  species (ROS) production strongly suggests that unsaturated fatty acids induced mitochondrial uncoupling. This effect was stronger in spermatids than in spermatocytes. As a late event, arachidonic  induced caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of external Ca2+. The concurrent but differential effects of unsaturated fatty acids on [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial functions are additional manifestations of the metabolic changes that germ cells undergo during their differentiation.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409663>Characterisation and attempted differentiation of European and extra-European olive oils using stable isotope ratio analysis.</a></h2><p>European law requires a designation of origin for virgin and extra virgin olive oils (at least in terms of EU/non-EU provenance).

The isotopic composition of olive oils was successfully used to distinguish samples originating in the two areas.

Some groups also received sulindac in their food (80 mg/kg food) starting from the ninth week following the first DMH or vehicle administration. and linoleic  reached higher levels in plasma and liver lipids when rats were fed high concentrations of olive or soy oil, respectively. Rats fed a low or high soy oil-based diet showed no significant difference in the number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in proximal or distal  specimens. In contrast, rats fed a higher olive oil-based diet developed a significantly lower number of ACF than rats fed a low concentration of olive oil. Addition of sulindac reduced the number of ACF in rats fed the 4%, but not the 15%, soy oil diet. In contrast, the effect of sulindac was significant when combined with both the low and high concentrations of olive oil. High soy oil-based diet or DMH treatment upregulated  expression of Bcl-2, but not that of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In contrast, olive oil dose-dependently downregulated the expression of both Bcl-2 and COX-2 in  mucosa and also abrogated the upregulation of Bcl-2 by DMH. Olive oil/sulindac combinations were effective in downregulating  mucosa Bcl-2 expression (with the 4% oil diet) and COX-2 expression (with the 15% oil diet). These effects were not observed in rats fed the soy oil/sulindac combinations. Caspase-3 activity in  mucosa was unaffected by soy oil or soy oil/sulindac combinations. The addition of olive oil, on the other hand, significantly enhanced  caspase-3 activity.Diets containing high levels of olive oil exert a significant protective effect from tumor development that is additive with the inhibitory effect of sulindac. These inhibitory effects are mediated by regulating the expression and activity of key proteins involved in prostaglandin-biosynthesis and apoptosis-induction pathways.

Under metabolic overload conditions, in cells with a high protein-secretory activity, such as hepatocytes and Langerhans β cells, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is critical in to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis). UPR integrated by a tripartite signaling system, through activating transcription factor 6, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1, regulates gene transcription and translation to resolve stress and conserve proteostasis.

In the present study, mung bean seeds were treated with adenosine triphosphate and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). The metabolomic changes during development of mung beans under different energy statuses were investigated. In total, 42 metabolites were identified. Principal component analysis revealed that the featured compounds produced in seeds were , linoleic, and succinic acids. Sugars, including maltose, sucrose, and glucose were related to sprouting. Mung bean seeds utilised diverse energy resources and produced higher succinic  content. Sugars and secondary metabolites accumulated in sprouts. Nitrogen, sugar, and amino    contributed to this physiological process. DNP caused an energy deficit, which resulted in the consumption and translation of glucose. Higher contents of other saccharides and amino acids were observed. The transcriptional results further confirmed our  hypothesis. In conclusion, sufficient energy supply is crucial for sprout development and nutritive metabolite synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This could by driven at least in part by an altered placental fat transfer. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We investigated the in vivo materno-fetal transfer of fatty acids (FAs) in obese pregnant women using stable isotopes.Ten obese and ten normo- pregnant women (control) received orally a bolus of C-labeled FAs 12 h before elective caesarean section:  (C-OA), linoleic  (C-LA) and docosahexaenoic  (C-DHA). Maternal blood samples were collected at -12 (basal), -8, -4, -2, 0 h relative to the time of cesarean section. At the time of birth, arterial and venous cord bloods as well as placental tissue were collected. FAs composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography and isotopic enrichment by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry.Maternal plasma insulin and placental  tended to higher values in obese pregnant women although they did not present serum hyperlipidemia. Higher concentrations of C-LA and C-DHA were found in non-esterified FAs fraction in maternal plasma of obese mothers. The ratio of placental uptake for C-LA and C-DHA was lower in obese women compared to normal  pointing toward a limited capacity of FA placental transfer, especially of essential FAs. Maternal insulin was associated to this lower placenta/maternal plasma ratio for both C-LA (R = -0.563, P = 0.012) and C-DHA (R = -0.478, P = 0.033). In addition, the ratio cord/maternal plasma of C-LA was significantly lower in obese women compared to controls.In conclusion, obese mothers without hyperlipidemia showed a reduced materno-fetal transfer of polyunsaturated FAs which could affect fetal development.

Since mitochondrial-targeted anticancer therapy (mitocans) may be useful in breast cancer, we examined the effect of anacardic  on cellular bioenergetics and OXPHOS pathway proteins in breast cancer cells modeling progression to endocrine-independence: MCF-7 estrogen receptor α (ERα)+ endocrine-sensitive; LCC9 and LY2 ERα+, endocrine-resistant, and MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. At concentrations similar to cell proliferation IC50 s, anacardic  reduced ATP-linked  consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial reserve capacity, and coupling efficiency while increasing proton leak, reflecting mitochondrial toxicity which was greater in MCF-7 compared to endocrine-resistant and TNBC cells. These results suggest tolerance in endocrine-resistant and TNBC cells to mitochondrial stress induced by anacardic . Since anacardic  is an alkylated 2-hydroxybenzoic , the effects of salicylic  (SA, 2-hydroxybenzoic  moiety) and  (OA, monounsaturated alkyl moiety) were tested. SA inhibited whereas OA stimulated cell viability. In contrast to stimulation of basal OCR by anacardic  (uncoupling effect), neither SA nor OA altered basal OCR- except OA inhibited basal and ATP-linked OCR, and increased ECAR, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Changes in OXPHOS proteins correlated with changes in OCR. Overall, neither the 2-hydroxybenzoic  moiety nor the monounsaturated alky moiety of anacardic  is solely responsible for the observed mitochondria-targeted anticancer activity in breast cancer cells and hence both moieties are required in the same molecule for the observed effects.

Previous studies depict that Cr(III) plays important roles in maintaining normal glucose and lipid metabolism, whereas its effect on the hepatic lipid metabolism is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of Cr on hepatic steatosis induced by  (OA) in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. Hepatic steatosis model was co-administered with Cr. Indexes of lipid accumulation were determined and associated genes expression were analyzed. The data showed that OA could induce lipid accumulation and triglyceride (TG) content in SMMC-7721 cells, and significantly increase the expression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). This steatosis effect of OA was ameliorated by Cr. The TG accumulation and up-regulation of CD36 and DGAT2 genes followed steatosis induction were inhibited by Cr. After the treatment of Cr, excessive intracellular OA content was also attenuated. Furthermore, Cr still performed inhibitory effect of DGAT2 expression at the presence of DGAT2 agonist or inhibitor, which indicated that the inhibitory effect of Cr on  is associated with the downregulation of DGAT2 expression. These findings demonstrate that Cr alleviates hepatic steatosis via suppressing CD36 expression to prevent fatty  uptake, as well as suppressing DGAT2 expression to inhibit TG synthesis. It suggests that CD36 and DGAT2 might become the novel drug targets for their properties in hepatic steatosis. Most importantly, Cr may be a potential anti-steatosis candidate to offer protective effects against liver damage.</p><p>Keyword:['lipogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727036>Supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water to grazing lambs on tissue glycogen level and lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Lambs ( = 18; 40.1 ± 7.4 kg BW) were used to assess supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water on growth, tissue glycogen levels, postmortem glycolysis, and lipogenesis.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the cellular uptake and binding processes of free and protein-bound unesterified DHA in retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) line ARPE-19 as a model of the human outer blood-retinal barrier and isolated porcine RPE cell fractions. Uptake of free [C]DHA by ARPE-19 cells was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 283 µM, and was significantly inhibited by eicosapentaenoic , arachidonic , and linoleic , but not by . Further, the uptakes of [C]DHA associated with retinol-binding protein ([C]DHA-RBP), [C]DHA associated with low-density lipoprotein ([C]DHA-LDL) and [C]DHA associated with bovine serum albumin ([C]DHA-BSA) in ARPE-19 cells increased time-dependently at 37°C, and were significantly reduced at 4°C, suggesting the involvement of -dependent transport processes. [C]DHA-LDL uptake by ARPE-19 cells was significantly inhibited by excess unlabeled LDL, but not by an inhibitor of scavenger receptor B type I. Fatty  transport protein (FATP) 2 and 4 mRNAs were expressed in ARPE-19 cells, and [C]DHA uptake was observed in FATP2- and FATP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes. Photo-reactive crosslinking and mass spectrometry analyses identified 65-kDa retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein (RPE65) as a DHA-binding protein in porcine RPE cell membrane fractions.

More recently, AnxA6 has also been linked to triglyceride storage in adipocytes. Here we investigated the potential role of AnxA6 in fatty  (FA) - induced lipid droplet (LD) formation in hepatocytes. AnxA6 was associated with LD from rat liver and HuH7 hepatocytes. In  (OA) -loaded HuH7 cells, substantial amounts of AnxA6 bound to LD in a Ca-independent manner. Remarkably, stable or transient AnxA6 overexpression in HuH7 cells led to elevated LD numbers/size and neutral lipid staining under control conditions as well as after OA loading compared to controls. In contrast, overexpression of AnxA1, AnxA2 and AnxA8 did not impact on OA-induced lipid accumulation. On the other hand, incubation of AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells or primary hepatocytes from AnxA6 KO-mice with OA led to reduced FA accumulation and LD numbers. Furthermore, morphological analysis of liver sections from A6-KO mice revealed significantly lower LD numbers compared to wildtype animals. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2α (cPLAα)-dependent LD formation was ineffective in AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells. We conclude that cPLAα-dependent pathways contribute to the novel regulatory role of hepatic AnxA6 in LD formation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we elucidated the protective mechanisms of OA-NO2 against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.HK-2 cells were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by re-oxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Bax mitochondrial translocation, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) cytosolic leakage and Akt/Gsk 3β phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blotting. Bax activation was visualized by immunocytochemistry. GW9662 and siRNA transfection were employed to examine the involvement of PPAR-γ.OGD/R injury promoted mitochondrial translocation and activation of Bax, leakage of cytochrome c and AIF, subsequent caspase-3 activation, and eventually cell apoptosis. Pre-incubation with OA-NO2 (1.25 µM, 45min) inhibited Bax activation and blocked apoptotic cascade, while the protective effects were negated by GW9662 or PPAR-γ siRNA.

In such association studies, fatty acids have typically been expressed as the percentage of a particular fatty  relative to the total fatty acids in a sample. Using two human cohorts, this study examined relationships between blood lipids (TAG, and LDL, HDL or total cholesterol) and circulating fatty acids expressed either as a percentage of total or as concentration in serum. The direction of the correlation between stearic , linoleic , dihomo-γ-linolenic , arachidonic  and DHA and circulating TAG reversed when fatty acids were expressed as concentrations v. a percentage of total. Similar reversals were observed for these fatty acids when examining their associations with the ratio of total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol. This reversal pattern was replicated in serum samples from both human cohorts. The correlations between blood lipids and fatty acids expressed as a percentage of total could be mathematically modelled from the concentration data. These data reveal that the different methods of expressing fatty acids lead to dissimilar correlations between blood lipids and certain fatty acids.

Nitro- (OA-NO2) reversibly inhibited complex II-linked respiration in isolated rat heart  in a pH-dependent manner and suppressed superoxide formation. Nitroalkylation of Fp subunit was determined by BME capture and the site of modification by OA-NO2 defined by mass spectrometric analysis. These effects translated into reduced basal and maximal respiration and favored glycolytic metabolism in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts as assessed by extracellular H(+) and O2 flux analysis. The perfusion of NO2-FA induced acute cardioprotection in an isolated perfused heart ischemia/reperfusion (IR) model as evidenced by significantly higher rate-pressure products.

In pancreatic β-cells, it helps counter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that impairs insulin secretory capacity during Type 2 diabetes. Chronic exposure of β-cells to saturated fatty acids (FAs) such as palmitate stimulates ER stress and modulates autophagy, but the effects of unsaturated FAs such as oleate, which are also elevated during , are less well understood. We therefore treated MIN6 cells and mouse islets for 8-48 h with either palmitate or oleate, and then monitored autophagic flux, signaling pathways, lysosomal biology, and phospholipid profiles. Compared with palmitate, oleate more effectively stimulated both autophagic flux and clearance of autophagosomes. The flux stimulation occurred independently of ER stress, nutrient-sensing (mTOR) and signaling pathways (protein kinases A, C, and D). Instead the mechanism involved the exchange factor directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2). Oleate reduced cellular cAMP, and its effects on autophagic flux were reproduced or inhibited, respectively, by  knockdown or activation.

Creatine is a small molecule that plays a large role in energy metabolism, but since the enzyme creatine kinase is not present in the liver, the classical role in energy metabolism does not hold in this tissue. Fat accumulation in the liver can lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a progressive disease that is prevalent in humans. We have previously reported that creatine can directly influence lipid metabolism in cell culture to promote lipid secretion and oxidation. Our goal in the current study was to determine whether similar mechanisms that occur in cell culture were present in vivo. We also sought to determine whether dietary creatine supplementation could be effective in reversing steatosis. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet or a high-fat diet supplemented with creatine for 5 weeks. We found that rats supplemented with creatine had significantly improved rates of lipoprotein secretion and alterations in mitochondrial function that were consistent with greater oxidative capacity. We also find that introducing creatine into a high-fat diet halted hepatic lipid accumulation in rats with fatty liver. Our results support our previous report that liver cells in culture with creatine secrete and oxidize more , demonstrating that dietary creatine can effectively change hepatic lipid metabolism by increasing lipoprotein secretion and oxidation in vivo. Our data suggest that creatine might be an effective therapy for NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The activity of hexokinase in the macrophage is very high, as high as that in any other major tissue of the body, and higher than that of phosphorylase or 6-phosphofructokinase, suggesting that glucose is a more important fuel than glycogen and that the pentose phosphate pathway is also important in these cells. The latter suggestion is supported by the high activities of both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. However, the rate of glucose utilization by 'resting' macrophages incubated in vitro is less than the 10% of the activity of 6-phosphofructokinase: this suggests that the rate of  is increased dramatically during phagocytosis or increased secretory activity. The macrophages possess higher activities of citrate synthase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase than do lymphocytes, suggesting that the tricarboxylic  cycle may be important in energy generation in these cells. The activity of 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase is higher in the macrophage, but that of 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is very much lower than those in the lymphocytes. The activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase is higher in macrophages, suggesting that fatty acids as well as acetoacetate could provide acetyl-CoA as substrate for the tricarboxylic  cycle. No detectable rate of acetoacetate or 3-hydroxybutyrate utilization was observed during incubation of resting macrophages, but that of oleate was 1.0 nmol/h per mg of protein or about 2.2% of the activity of palmitoyltransferase. The activity of glutaminase is about 4-fold higher in macrophages than in lymphocytes, which suggests that the rate of glutamine utilization could be very high. The rate of utilization of glutamine by resting incubated macrophages was similar to that reported for rat lymphocytes, but was considerably lower than the activity of glutaminase.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478159>Simultaneous lipolysis/permeation in vitro model, for the estimation of bioavailability of lipid based drug delivery systems.</a></h2><p>The simultaneous processes of lipid digestion and absorption together determine the oral bioavailability of drugs incorporated into lipid based drug delivery systems (LBDDS).

Caco-2 cells absorbed  bound to BSA from both the apical and basolateral surfaces at the same rate.  in micellar solution was absorbed more efficiently than  bound to BSA. Regardless of its site or mode of presentation, the majority of the incorporated  was found in triglycerides. Only a small fraction was subjected to beta-oxidation or esterification into phospholipids. Most of the incorporated  was still retained intracellularly at 24 h. The polarity of triglyceride secretion was influenced by the experimental conditions. Triglyceride secretion was not significantly polarized when -BSA was presented apically. However, the ratio of basolateral to apical secretion at 24 h was 9:1 for -BSA presented basolaterally. For  in taurocholate micelles there was a trend toward polarity of secretion to the apical media (apical to basolateral ratio = 2:1). The inclusion of 2-monoacylglycerol in -taurocholate micelles did not augment triglyceride synthesis or secretion. These differences indicate that compartmentation of FA metabolism in Caco-2 cells is influenced by the site of FA presentation. Northern and Western blot hybridization studies indicated that the liver fatty -binding protein but not the intestinal fatty -binding protein gene is expressed in these cells. The absence of this latter 15 kDa protein indicates that it is not required by Caco-2 cells for the synthesis of triglycerides or for the polarized export of triglyceride.

The function of trophology (feeding) is implemented by two biological reactions: exophilia - external feeding and endophilia - internal feeding. The function of endoecology prevents exceeding of upper limit of physiological interval by no substrate, catabolites and endogenous phlogogens. It is implemented by two biological functions: excretion and . The etiological factors of atherosclerosis are the following ones. The  mono-saturated fatty  in chemical reactions is by far more active than palmitic fatty . In the ocean, all animals were carnivorous (piscivorous); species Homo Sapiens, in millions of years of life on dry land, forcedly became a herbivorousone. The main role in development of herbivorous animals belongs to insulin; the hormone regulating in the first-place metabolism of fatty acids, expresses transmutation of all endogenously synthesized from glucose palmitic saturated fatty  in  monosaturated fatty . The late in phylogenesis insulin can't initiate transmutation of exogenous palmitic saturated fatty  of food into  mono-saturated fatty . Under effect of insulin in vivo an active  type of metabolism of fatty acids is developed; and outside if effect of insulin palmitic type of metabolism of fatty acids is developed. In the ocean, synthesis of active eicosanoids occurs from ῳ-3 polyene fatty acids; there is no such fatty acids in dry land. The basis of pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is feeding of large amount of carnivorous (meat) food by phylogenetically herbivorous Homo Sapiens. This way a deficiency of palmitic saturated fatty acids in cells if developed blocking their bio-accessibility. The lipoproteins of low density are not developed in the initiated by insulin transfer of  triglycerides to cells in  apoE/B-100 lipoproteins of very low density and their absorption by cells. The transfer of triglycerides into lipoproteins of very low density is blocked under slow processes of transmutation of palmitic lipoproteins of very low density into lipoproteins of low density, retention cumulation of lipoproteins of low density in blood. Only because of partial utilization by monocytes of non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density →lipoproteins of low density that occurs in the intima of arteries of elastic type, atheromotosis is developed. The atheromotosis masses of intima are first of all interim catabolites of polyene fatty acids; the cells could not to absorb them by apoB-100-endocytosis in the content of lipoproteins of low density. The atherosclerosis, hyperlipoproteinemia, high content of lipoproteins of low density in blood and deficiency of polyene fatty acids in cells are a result of disorder of trophology function; the atheromotosis of arteries is only partial implementation of endoecology function.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672544>Hydrogen peroxide permeability of cellular membranes in insulin-producing cells.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen peroxide (HO) plays a central role in redox signalling and in oxidative stress-mediated cell death. It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and . Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty   did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty  palmitic  accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Key findings were: (i) hypothalamic astrocytes are targeted by unsaturated, but not saturated lipids in lean mice; (ii) in obese mice labeling of these astrocytes by unsaturated  cannot be detected unless β-oxidation or ketogenesis is inhibited; (iii) the hypothalamus of obese animals increases ketone body and neutral lipid synthesis while tanycytes, hypothalamic cells facing the ventricle, increase their lipid droplet content; and (iv) tanycytes show different labeling for saturated or unsaturated lipids.

Herein, a salt-free zero-charged catanionic surfactant with low chain melting temperature was prepared by mixing equimolar tetradecyltrimethylammonium oxide (TTAOH) and  (OA) in water, and its concentration-dependent aggregate transition was investigated. In the dilute region (c ≤ 5 wt%), fluorescence microscopy observations revealed the formation of vesicles (the L phase). Further increasing c induced a transition from the L phase to LLCs via a region where vesicles and lamellae coexist. With ordered hydrophobic domains, the LLCs can be used as hosts for the doping of fullerene C (refers to C hereafter) with the highest C/TTAO  ratio of 0.04. The doping of C effectively improves the viscoelasticity of the LLCs confirmed by rheological characterization while only slight modifications on their matrixes have been detected using small angle X-ray scattering measurements.

Hepatocytes were exposed to OA or PA (0.125-2 mmol/l) or their combination at ratios of 3:1, 2:1 or 1:1 at the final concentrations of 0.5-1 mmol/l. Both OA and PA caused a dose-dependent increase in triacylglycerol content in hepatocytes. PA was more steatogenic at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/l while OA at 0.75 and 1 mmol/l. PA exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect associated with ROS production, present markers of apoptosis and necrosis and a decrease in albumin production. OA induced a damage of the cytoplasmic membrane from 1 mM concentration. Mixture of OA and PA induced lower cytotoxicity with less weakened functional capacity than did PA alone. Extent of steatosis was comparable to that after exposure to OA alone. In conclusion, OA or combination of OA with PA is more suitable for simulation of simple steatosis than PA alone.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26040376>[Consumption of nuts and vegetal oil in people with type 1 ].</a></h2><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the cardiovascular benefits of the Mediterranean Diet, enriched with olive oil and nuts.

All high-fat diets elevated concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) but lowered resistin concentrations in both plasma and adipose tissue. In conclusion, fish oil may be beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity by upregulation of adiponectin and downregulation of leptin production; n3 and n6 PUFA do not play a role at the dietary levels tested in reducing adiposity and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (leptin, PAI-1, MCP-1 and resistin) and anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291010>Indian freshwater edible snail Bellamya bengalensis lipid extract prevents T cell mediated hypersensitivity and inhibits LPS induced macrophage activation.</a></h2><p>Soup prepared from the foot of fresh water edible snail, Bellamya bengalensis, is traditionally consumed by the tribes of Jharkhand against rheumatism like bone and joint inflammation.

Role of Sirtuins 1 and 3.</a></h2><p>Susceptibility to develop hypertension may be established during early stages of life that include the intrauterine period, infancy and childhood. We recently showed that blood pressure increased when rats reached adulthood when sucrose was ingested for a short-term critical window from postnatal day 12 to 28 in the rat, which corresponds to days around weaning. Here, we studied several factors that might participate in the increased susceptibility to hypertension when adulthood is reached by analyzing the changes produced at the end of the sucrose ingestion during this critical period.  of the rats at the end of the sucrose period was decreased even if there was an increased ingestion in Kcal. We found an increase in blood pressure accompanied by a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in the aorta. When insulin was administered to rats receiving sucrose, glucose in plasma diminished later than in controls and this slight insulin resistance may reduce nitric oxide synthase action.  that modulates eNOS expression was increased, lipoperoxidation was elevated and total non-enzymatic anti-oxidant capacity was decreased. There was also a decrease in SOD2 expression. We also studied the expression of Sirt1, which regulates eNOS expression and Sirt3, which regulates SOD2 expression as possible epigenetic targets of enzyme expression involved in the long- term programming of hypertension. Sirt3 was decreased but we did not find an alteration in Sirt1 expression. We conclude that these changes may underpin the epigenetic programming of increased susceptibility to develop hypertension in the adults when there was exposure to high sucrose levels near weaning in rats.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653011>Fatty  Profile and Antioxidant Status Fingerprint in Sarcopenic Elderly Patients: Role of Diet and Exercise.</a></h2><p>Plasma fatty acids (FAs) and oxidant status contribute to the etiology of sarcopenia in the elderly concurring to age-related muscle loss and elderly frailty through several mechanisms including changes in FA composition within the sarcolemma, promotion of chronic low-grade inflammation, and . The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolenic . Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly.

A total of 281 subjects, aged >19 and <60 years, participated in a cross-sectional, population-based study performed in Brazil. The following SNP spanning the TNF-α gene were genotyped: -238G/A (rs361525), -308G/A (rs1800629), -857C/T (rs1799724) and -1031T/C (rs1799964).

The structural and metabolic integrity of the cells was verified by electron microscopy, a high percentage of Trypan Blue exclusion, a low degree of release of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) in the medium, and by the retention of sensitivity to agents known to modify metabolic and transport activity in everted sacs of intestinal mucosa. The isolated intestinal epithelial cells were used to study glycerolipid biosynthesis from glucose, glycerol, 2-monoacylglycerol, and free fatty acids. The cells actively incorporated the labeled precursors into glycerolipids without specific cofactor requirements. Addition of fatty acids stimulated the incorporation of both glucose and glycerol into triacylglycerols and glycerophospholipids, the greatest effect being observed with palmitate. The stimulation of monoacylglycerol acylation appeared to depend on both the nature of the monoacylglycerol and fatty  supplied. Stereospecific analyses of the diacylglycerols formed from 2-monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids showed that 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerols (62-70%) were the major and that 2,3-diacyl-sn-glycerols (30-38%) the minor intermediates in triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The data indicate that isolated intestinal epithelial cells exhibit a total capacity of glycerolipid synthesis and a stereochemical course of reaction which is comparable to that observed for triacylglycerol formation in everted sacs of intestinal mucosa, but much less specific than that seen in microsomal preparations of intestinal mucosa.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30461332>Toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) to THP-1 macrophages: interactions with saturated or unsaturated free fatty acids.</a></h2><p>In a biological microenvironment, free fatty acids (FFA) as ubiquitous biological molecules might interact with nanoparticles (NPs) and consequently change the toxicological responses.

This study investigated the interactions between ZnO NPs and saturated or unsaturated FFA (complexed to BSA), namely stearic  (SA, C18:0),  (OA, C18:1), and α-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3). It was shown that BSA, SA, OA, and ALA increased the atomic force microscope (AFM) heights as well the polydispersity index (PDI) of ZnO NPs. BSA modestly protected THP-1 macrophages from ZnO NP exposure, whereas OA and ALA led to relatively less cyto-protective effects of BSA. Moreover, only co-exposure to ZnO NPs and SA significantly promoted the release of interleukin-8. BSA, SA, OA, and ALA equally changed intracellular ROS and Zn ions associated with ZnO exposure, but co-exposure to ZnO NPs and OA/ALA particularly activated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis genes.

Sheng-jiang powder (SJP), an empirical Chinese medicine formula to treat NAFLD, showed great efficacy but the specific mechanisms have never been reported. Therefore, we performed this study to explore the effect of SJP on NAFLD and the potential mechanism.NAFLD was induced by high fat diet (HFD) feeding. Rats were treated with SJP/normal saline daily for 10 weeks and all rats were euthanized after 12 weeks' feeding.  tissue samples were obtained for biochemistry test and pathological evaluation. Additionally,  induced LO2 cells were employed to simulate a cell model of NAFLD. Cells were subjected to western blotting for Akt, mTOR, S6, SREBP1-c, and FASN detection after coincubated with SJP, LY294002 (a selective PI3K inhibitor), or the combination for 24h.HFD significantly induced hepatic steatosis. Plenty of lipid droplets were observed under transmission electron microscope. The ultrastructure of  cells showed distinct changes with obvious endoplasmic reticulum expansion, mitochondrial contraction, and cell matrix solidification. Although no difference was detected in serum hepatic enzymes and tissue proinflammatory cytokines, the tissue level of SOD and GSH-px was much lower and the pathologic injuries were much severe in HFD feeding rats. However, SJP treatment significantly attenuated the ultrastructure changes and protected rat  against inflammatory injury. Abundant of lipid droplets and high expression of pAkt, pmTOR, pS6, and FASN were observed in  treated LO2 cells, while these changes were restored by SJP treatment.SJP is efficient in attenuating HFD induced NAFLD in rats and this effect might be partly related to the inhibition of Akt/mTOR/S6 pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30292750>Nanostructured  carriers versus solid  nanoparticles for the potential treatment of pulmonary hypertension via nebulization.</a></h2><p>With the non-selective vasodilating action, short half-life and first-pass  of sildenafil (SC), local application in the lung for pulmonary arterial hypertension is of high demand.

Optimized NLCs (200-268 nm in size) were appraised versus SLNs both in vitro and in vivo.

Stability studies at 4 °C indicated potential colloidal and entrapment stability over 3 months. Interestingly, NLCs demonstrated efficient nebulization, low interaction with mucin and higher viability of A549 cells (3-fold increase in IC relative to SLNs) providing good aptitudes for pulmonary application. In vivo administration of free SC in rats revealed localized intra-alveolar bleeding, presumably related to excessive vasodilatation.

The purpose of this study was to identify potential intrinsic defects in lipid turnover and lipolysis in myotubes established from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects. Lipid trafficking and lipolysis were measured by pulse-chase assay with radiolabeled substrates in myotubes from non-obese/non-diabetic (lean), obese/non-diabetic (obese) and obese/diabetic (T2D) subjects. Lipolytic protein content and level of Akt phosphorylation were measured by Western blot. HSL was overexpressed by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Myotubes established from obese and T2D subjects had lower lipolysis (-30-40%) when compared to lean, using  as precursor. Similar observations were also seen for labelled glycerol. Incorporation of  into diacylglycerol (DAG) and free fatty  (FFA) level was lower in T2D myotubes, and acetate incorporation into FFA and complex lipids was also lower in obese and/or T2D subjects. Both protein expression of HSL (but not ATGL) and changes in DAG during lipolysis were markedly lower in cells from obese and T2D when compared to lean subjects. -stimulated glycogen synthesis (-60%) and Akt phosphorylation (-90%) were lower in myotubes from T2D, however, overexpression of HSL in T2D myotubes did not rescue the diabetic phenotype. In conclusion, intrinsic defects in lipolysis and HSL expression co-exist with reduced  action in myotubes from obese T2D subjects.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between February 2014 and February 2015, 105 cases of NAFLD were recruited and confirmed by liver biopsy pathology, including patients with mild NAFLD (n=58) and moderate-severe NAFLD (n=47); nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () (n=53) and non- (n=52); and 50 healthy participants were regarded as the healthy control group. MiR-9 expression was measured by qRT-PCR. For in vitro experiments, L-02 normal liver cells were divided into normal control group (cultured with original culture medium), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group (cultured with DMSO) and  group (cultured with  to induce fatty change), and MTT assay was used to measure the effect of different  concentrations on cell proliferation. Nile red staining was used to detect intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets. Further, synthetic miR-9 mimic and its control and miR-9 inhibitors and its control were independently transfected into L-02 cells. RESULTS MiR-9 levels in the mild NAFLD group and moderate-severe NAFLD group were significantly higher than in the healthy control group (both P<0.05). Mean fluorescence intensity of lipid droplets increased with the duration of induction, and were dramatically higher in oleate-treated L-02 cells; intracellular triglyceride (TG) content was also higher. miR-9 levels significantly increased following oleate induction. Importantly, miR-9 levels were significantly elevated upon miR-9 mimic transfection. Conversely, miR-9 level was lowered with miR-9 inhibitors transfection. Additionally, Onecut2 and SIRT1 were identified as miR-9 targets. CONCLUSIONS A positive relationship between miR-9 and steatosis was established with our results that miR-9 mimic transfection decreased intracellular lipid content.

PON1 activity as determined with paraoxon (i.e., POase activity) yields more controversial results, which can be explained by the lack of adjustment for the Q192R polymorphism.

To establish the nature of antioxidant principles in the bioactive ethyl acetate fractions of bark (HZEB) and leaf (HZEL);  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and cell-based antioxidant protection in erythrocytes (CAP-e) assays were performed. From acute toxicity study, HZEB and HZEL at 200 and 300 mg/kg b.w., were relatively safe at their effective doses. The degree of protection was measured by using biochemical parameters such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TB) and total protein (TP) contents. Hepatic markers e.g. thiobarbituric  reactive species (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were evaluated along with histopathological observations of liver tissues. Both fractions showed significant improvement in restoring SGOT, SGPT, ALP, TB and TP level. TBARS, SOD, CAT and GSH levels were significantly altered towards normal values. Both fractions at 300 mg/kg showed remarkable improvement in liver markers as compared to silymarin. Histopathological examinations showed reduction in hepatic necrosis and appeared normal hepatocellular architecture in HZEB and HZEL treated groups. In CAP-e assay, IC of HZEB (54.66 mg/mL) was higher than HZEL (60.88 mg/mL) and in ORAC assay, AUC of HZEB and HZEL were 33.46, 21.29 respectively and results were comparable with trolox. GC-MS and LC-MS analysis identified a total no. of 44 compounds. Few compounds were identified as bioactive compounds e.g. catechol (7.23%), tetraacetyl-d-xylonic nitrile (3%),  (0.49%), 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol (3.71%), 3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenol (0.31%), and conifer alcohol (7.41%).

Negative values of Gibbs free  of mixing (ΔG ) were obtained throughout the investigated ranges of the unsaturated C18 fatty- (L1, L2 and L3) mixed systems, indicating that very strong attractions occurred between molecules in the monolayers. The bend and kink effects from the cis-double bond(s) in the hydrocarbon chain affected the membrane fluidity and molecular packing in the monolayers, which resulted in a greater interaction between unsaturated C18 fatty acids and DP. The most thermodynamically stable mole composition of unsaturated C18 fatty acids to DP was observed at 50:1; this ratio is suggested to be the best mole ratio and will be subsequently used to prepare DP-C18 fatty- nanoliposomes.

We hypothesised that skeletal muscle  of endurance-trained athletes have increased sensitivity for fatty  (FA)-induced uncoupling, which is driven by the mitochondrial protein adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1).Capacity for FA-induced uncoupling was measured in endurance-trained male athletes (T) and sedentary young men (UT) in an observational study and also in isolated skeletal muscle  from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and C2C12 myotubes following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of ANT1. Thus, fuelled by glutamate/succinate (fibres) or pyruvate ( and myotubes) and in the presence of oligomycin to block ATP synthesis, increasing levels of oleate (fibres) or palmitate ( and myotubes) were automatically titrated while respiration was monitored. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in humans and via insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes.Skeletal muscle from the T group displayed increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.011) compared with muscle from the UT group, and this was associated with elevated insulin sensitivity (p = 0.034). ANT1 expression was increased in T (p = 0.013).  from ZDF rats displayed decreased sensitivity for FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008). This difference disappeared in the presence of the adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor carboxyatractyloside. Partial knockdown of ANT1 in C2C12 myotubes decreased sensitivity to the FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008) and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p = 0.025) compared with controls.Increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and is affected by ANT1 activity in skeletal muscle.

Thirty-two noncastrated crossbred lambs at 4-5 months of age, with an average initial  of 17.39 ± 2.16 kg, were distributed into four treatments in a randomized block experimental design with eight animals per treatment. Experimental diets were composed of pearl millet silage ammoniated with four levels of urea (0%, 2%, 4% and 6%, on dry matter basis (DM). Carcass conformation and fatness decreased linearly (p < 0.05). Except for the fat content, the proximate composition was not influenced (p < 0.05) by the diets.

Pearl millet silage ammoniated with urea allows for the production of good-quality lamb meat, with greater concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, lambs fed diets with pearl millet ammoniated with up to 6% lead to a reduction of carcass characteristics without significantly affecting loin-eye area possibly associated with low palatability of the additive used. The lower acceptance of the silages with higher levels of urea is due to the ammonia retention in the material is attributed to the ammonization process.

However, the mechanism of Ufd2p-mediated ubiquitination is largely unclear. Here, we show that Ufd2p catalyses K48-linked multi-monoubiquitination on K29-linked ubiquitin chains assembled by the ubiquitin ligase (Ufd4p), resulting in branched ubiquitin chains. This reaction depends on the interaction of K29-linked ubiquitin chains with two N-terminal loops of Ufd2p. Only following the addition of K48-linked ubiquitin to substrates modified with K29-linked ubiquitin chains, can the substrates be escorted to the proteasome for degradation. We demonstrate that this ubiquitin chain linkage switching reaction is essential for ERAD,  and  pH resistance in yeast. Thus, our results suggest that Ufd2p functions by switching ubiquitin chain linkages to allow the degradation of proteins modified with a ubiquitin linkage, which is normally not targeted to the proteasome.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877525>Phase behavior of cholesterol in mixtures with hypo- and hypercholesterolemic lipids.</a></h2><p>Some lipidic bioactives are largely reported to present hypocholesterolemic effects, for example, , α-tocopherol, and octacosanol, found in rice-bran, olive, and sunflower oils. In contrast, some saturated and trans-unsaturated lipids found in animal fats or partially hydrogenated oils have been associated with the opposite effect.

The minimal melting temperature (eutectic points) of the mixtures followed the order: α-tocopherol <  < elaidic  < stearic  < octacosanol. Among all biocompounds, stearic and trans- acids promoted few changes in the normal thermodynamic behavior of cholesterol when in a mixture.

Serotonin and dopamine might contribute to NEFA-dependent β-cell dysfunction, since extracellular signal of these monoamines decreases GSIS.

Major fatty acids at the sn-2 position were palmitic  (68.7%), ARA (9.8%) and  (7.9%). This is the first study reporting a two-step enzymatic method for structured TAGs preparation. Compared to the one-pot synthesis, current method significantly improves the efficiency of the acidolysis by product inhibition elimination. The synthetic TAGs have potential use in infant formulas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from tissues and act locally or systemically to promote insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'. Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index and insulin sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that 12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased fatty  (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for metabolic disorders.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'hyperlipedemia', 'insulin resistance', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26210489>Natural Rumen-Derived trans Fatty Acids Are Associated with Metabolic Markers of Cardiac Health.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that industrial trans fatty acids (iTFA) impair lipid profiles while ruminant trans fatty acids (rTFA) may lower  and blood pressure. The objective of this article was to determine if the plasma phospholipid percentage of rTFA is associated with a favorable cardiometabolic profile. We collected fasting blood samples from 200 individuals from Quebec city (QC, Canada) aged from 18 to 55 years old, including 100 obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg m(-2)) and 100 non-obese (BMI < 30 kg m(-2)) men and women. Fatty  levels in plasma phospholipids were determined using gas chromatography. After separating the subjects into two groups, according to the median percentage of rTFA in plasma phospholipids, participants in the group with higher percentages of rTFA (0.86 ± 0.24 %) had higher adiponectin levels (p = 0.01) and a lower blood pressure (systolic, p = 0.005; diastolic, p = 0.04). In contrast, concentrations in plasma phospholipids of elaidic , a major iTFA, are positively correlated with glycemia in non-obese subjects (p = 0.01) and with both triacylglycerol (TAG) (p = 0.0007) and total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.009) in obese subjects.

We cross sectionally investigated whether the proportion of total C18:1 TFA in red blood cells (RBCs), which mirrors dietary TFA intake, independently relates to carotid plaque prevalence in subjects with new-onset type 2  without prior cardiovascular disease (n=101, 56% men, mean age 61 years) and age- and sex-matched controls (n=96). RBC fatty  composition was determined by gas chromatography. Plaque (defined as carotid intima-media thickness ≥1.5 mm) was sonographically assessed at three bilateral carotid segments. In multivariate models adjusting for group ( or control) and classical cardiovascular risk factors, for each 0.1% increase in RBC total C18:1 TFA isomers, plaque prevalence increased by 53% (P=.002). In contrast, for each 0.1% increase in RBC alpha-linolenic , the vegetable omega-3 fatty , plaque prevalence decreased by 43% (P<.001). We conclude that the RBC membrane proportion of total C18:1 TFA, considered a proxy of intake, directly relates to the ultrasound feature that best predicts future cardiovascular events.

Thus, we explored the effects of connexin43 (Cx43) on sepsis-induced intestinal injury in order to provide potential therapeutic strategies. Rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models  and cell models (IEC-6 cells) pretreated with LPS  were used in the current study. Firstly, different methods, such as Cx43 inhibitors (18--GA and oleamide) or siRNA targeting Cx43 and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (a kind of ROS scavenger), were used to observe the effects of Cx43 channels mediating ROS transfer on intestinal injury. Secondly, the influence of ROS content on the activity of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway was explored through the application of NAC, sp600125 (a JNK1 inhibitor), and nicotinamide (a Sirt1 inhibitor). Finally, luciferase assays and ChIP were used to determine the direct regulation of FoxO3a on proapoptotic proteins, Bim and Puma. The results showed that sepsis-induced intestinal injury presented a dynamic change, coincident with the alternation of Cx43 expression. The inhibition of Cx43 attenuated CLP-induced intestinal injury  and LPS-induced IEC-6 injury . The changes of Cx43 channel function regulated ROS transfer between the neighboring cells, which mediated the activation of the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway. FoxO3a directly affected its downstream target genes, Bim and Puma, which are responsible for cell or tissue apoptosis. In summary, our results suggest that Cx43 inhibition suppresses ROS transfer and inactivates the JNK1/Sirt1/FoxO3a signaling pathway to protect against sepsis-induced intestinal injury.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008074>Activation of free fatty  receptor 1 improves hepatic steatosis through a p38-dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis is highly correlated with insulin resistance and diabetes. Although, it has been demonstrated that activation of free fatty  receptor 1 (FFAR1) by agonists showed benefits for the improvement of diabetes, the effects of FFAR1 agonists on hepatic steatosis were unknown. In this study, a high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis animal model was utilized to evaluate the effects of an FFAR1 agonist, GW9508, on hepatic lipid accumulation, and HepG2 hepatoma cells were also used to clarify the possible mechanisms. Administration of GW9508 significantly decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation with decreased expressions of -related proteins in HFD mice. Knockdown of hepatic Ffar1 by lentiviral vectors containing short hairpin RNA targeted to Ffar1 diminished the effect of GW9508 in HFD mice. In addition, GW9508 decreased -induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by decreases in the expression of -related proteins. Moreover, GW9508 downregulated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) through a p38-dependent pathway, whereas knockdown of Ffar1 in HepG2 cells diminished the effect of GW9508 on the decrease in SREBP1. Considering all these results together, GW9508 exerts a therapeutic effect to improve hepatic steatosis through a p38-dependent pathway.

In this work, by biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological techniques, the existence of a connection among myelin to the axon was evaluated, to understand how ATP could be transferred from sheath to the axoplasm. Data confirm a functional expression of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated myelin. Moreover, WB and immunohistochemistry on optic nerve slices show that connexins 32 and 43 are present in myelin and colocalize with myelin basic protein. Interestingly, addition of carbenoxolone or oleamide, two gap junction blockers, causes a decrease in oxidative metabolism in purified myelin, but not in mitochondria. Similar effects were observed on conduction speed in hippocampal Schaffer collateral, in the presence of oleamide. Confocal analysis of optic nerve slices showed that lucifer yellow (that only passes through aqueous pores) signal was found in both the sheath layers and the axoplasma. In the presence of oleamide, but not with , signal significantly decreased in the sheath and was lost inside the axon. This suggests the existence of a link among myelin and axons.

The present study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of MAE on hepatocyte cultured with high fatty  and the underlying mechanisms. By using human hepatoma cell HepG2 as cell model, the results showed that MAE suppressed fatty  synthesis and enhanced fatty  oxidation, contributing to amelioration of lipid accumulation induced by  (OA). Moreover, MAE also inhibited acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) activities by stimulating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). MAE attenuated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its target molecules, such as fatty  synthase (FAS).

The objective of this study was to investigate the appropriate conditions for the codigestion of NaOH-pretreated 2POMW with food waste. NaOH pretreatment can increase the methane production by increasing the soluble chemical  demand (sCOD), but it may cause inhibition because of higher levels of alkalinity, sodium ion, volatile fatty acids and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Therefore, the first experimental phase of this study aimed to investigate the effect of different mixing ratios of 2POMW to food waste. A continuous stirred tank reactor experiment with different mixing ratios of 3%, 4.3%, 5.7% and 8.3% (2POMW: food waste) was conducted. NaOH pretreatment in the range of 6-20% was used. A mixing ratio up to 4.3%, when 10% NaOH pretreatment was used, caused no inhibition and increased methane production by 445.9mL/g-VS(2POMW). For this mixing ratio an additional experimental phase was conducted with the 20% NaOH pretreatment as the 20% NaOH pretreatment had the highest sCOD. The methane gas production was increased by 503.6mL/g-VS(2POMW). However, pH adjustment was required for applying this concentration of the high alkalinity 20% NaOH-pretreated 2POMW. Therefore, we consider using 10% NaOH pretreatment in a mixing ratio of 4.3% to be more applicable. The increase in methane gas production was correlated to the  concentration inside the reactors. The high  concentration of 61.8mg/L for the 8.3% mixing ratio was responsible for the strong inhibition. This study showed that adjusting the appropriate mixing ratio of the NaOH-pretreated 2POMW could increase the electricity production of a reactor that regularly receives food waste.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that excess unsaturated free fatty acids (UFFA) present in the sebum may cause barrier impairment associated with increased follicular stratum corneum (SC) thickening and  seen in acne. Therefore, epidermal and sebaceous lipid profiles from acne and healthy subjects were analyzed and an in vitro epidermal tissue model was developed to validate this hypothesis. Significantly increased levels of free fatty acids (p < 0.05) were observed in skin lipids of human acne vs. healthy subjects. Exposure of human epidermal equivalents (HEEs) to the UFFA  (OA), also present in sebum, led to barrier impairment associated with increased SC lipid disorder, increased secretion of interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and excessive SC thickening.

Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a new member of the plasma apolipoprotein family that may play a role in lipid metabolism and electron transport activity of the mitochondrium. However, its physiological functions have not been elucidated yet. Based on our previous data in a non-mammalian experimental system [1], we hypothesized that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to increased lipoprotein-production induced by, e.g., hormones and oxidative stress. To gain insight into a mammalian experimental system, we compared the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells with those in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Incubation of the cells with BSA-complexed  (OA-Alb) induced triglyceride accumulation, but did not affect cell viability. qPCR using specific primer pairs and Western blot analysis with in-house produced rabbit anti-ApoO antisera demonstrated significant increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels in both cell lines. ROS formation due to OA-Alb treatment was only slightly altered in LMH cells, indicating an intact antioxidant defense system of the cells. Oxidative stress applied by addition of HO revealed induction of ApoO transcript and protein level in the same or even higher extent as monitored in the presence of OA-Alb. Upon treatment with estrogen for 24 h quantitative analysis of ApoO transcript and protein revealed increases of ApoO expression supporting the assumption that estrogen affects lipoprotein metabolism at various points. Furthermore, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential upon incubation with OA-Alb.

It is noteworthy that p53 can promote the expression of damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), an inducer of autophagy-mediated apoptosis. However, the relationship between p53-mediated apoptosis and autophagy in hepatosteatosis remains elusive. This study aimed to examine how p53 orchestrates autophagy and apoptosis to affect hepatosteatosis.HepG2 cells were treated with  (OA) for 24 h to induce hepatosteatosis. Mice were fed a high-fat diet for 20 or 40 weeks to induce hepatosteatosis.OA induced a dose-dependent increase in steatosis severity and apoptosis. OA also induced autophagy, which was a critical inducer of apoptosis in mild steatosis induced by 400 μM OA, but not in the more severe steatosis induced by 800 and 1200 μM OA. p53 inhibition by siRNA mostly blocked OA-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, OA-induced autophagy was DRAM-dependent and primarily occurred in the  (mitophagy), where DRAM was localized. In severe steatosis induced by 1200 μM OA, apoptosis was mainly dependent on p53-induced expression of BAX, which was also localized to the . Our in vivo study showed that p53 expression increased in both mild and severe hepatosteatosis. Increased DRAM expression and autophagy were identified in mild hepatosteatosis, whereas greater BAX expression was observed in severe hepatosteatosis.p53 may induce apoptosis via different mechanisms.

However, a systematic comparison of effects of diets with different composition of 18-C fatty acids on browning/beiging phenotype has not been done. In this study, we compared the effects of different dietary fats, rich in specific 18-carbon fatty acids, on thermogenesis and lipid metabolism. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet containing 5.6% kcal fat from lard and 4.4% kcal fat from soybean oil (CON) or high-fat diets (HFD) containing 25% kcal from lard and 20% kcal fat from shea butter (stearic -rich fat; SHB), olive oil (-rich oil; OO), safflower oil (linoleic -rich oil; SFO), or soybean oil (mixed , linoleic, and α-linolenic acids; SBO)  for 12 weeks, with or without a terminal 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. When compared to SHB, feeding OO, SFO, and SBO resulted in lower  gain. The OO fed group had the highest thermogenesis level, which resulted in lower  fat accumulation and improved glucose and lipid metabolism. Feeding SFO downregulated expression of lipid oxidation-related genes and upregulated expression of lipogenic genes, perhaps due to its high n-6:n-3 ratio. In general, HFD-feeding downregulated  expression in both subcutaneous and epididymal white adipose tissue, and suppressed NE-induced  expression in brown adipose tissue. These results suggest that the position of double bonds in dietary fatty acids, as well as the quantity of dietary fat, may have a significant effect on the regulation of oxidative and thermogenic conditions in vivo.</p><p>Keyword:['browning', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30369486>Oleoylethanolamide differentially regulates glycerolipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion in intestine and liver.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat absorption takes place in the intestine, and the liver mobilizes endogenous fat to other tissues by synthesizing lipoproteins that require apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Dietary fat triggers the synthesis of oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a regulatory fatty  that signals satiety to reduce food intake mainly by enhancing neural PPARα activity, in enterocytes. We explored OEA's roles in the assembly of lipoproteins in WT and   mouse enterocytes and hepatocytes, Caco-2 cells, and human liver-derived cells. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, OEA increased synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion in chylomicrons, and MTP expression in a dose-dependent manner. OEA also increased MTP activity and triacylglycerol secretion in WT and knockout primary enterocytes. In contrast to its intestinal cell effects, OEA reduced synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion, and MTP expression and activity in human hepatoma Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Also, OEA reduced MTP expression and triacylglycerol secretion in WT, but not knockout, primary hepatocytes. These studies indicate differential effects of OEA on lipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly: in enterocytes, OEA augments glycerolipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly independent of PPARα. Conversely, in hepatocytes, OEA reduces MTP expression, glycerolipid synthesis, and lipoprotein secretion through PPARα-dependent mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fat metabolism', 'fatty liver', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202233>Anticandidal activity of the extract and compounds isolated from  Rottb.</a></h2><p>The phytochemical screening of  showed that carbohydrates and/or glycosides, flavonoids, tannins, sterols and/or triterpenes, and proteins and/or amino acids are present.

The high brightness is realized at high current density (). However, at high , the efficiency drops significantly, thereby limiting the achievable brightness. This notorious phenomenon has been known as efficiency roll-off, which is likely caused by the Auger- and/or thermal-induced emission quenching. In this work, we show that the Joule heat generated during device operation significantly affects the roll-off characteristics of QLEDs. To realize ultrabright and efficient QLEDs, the thermal stability of QDs is improved by replacing the conventional  ligands with 1-dodecanethiol. By further using a substrate with high thermal conductivity, the Joule heat generated at high  is effectively dissipated. Because of the effective thermal management, thermal-induced emission quenching is significantly suppressed, and consequently, the QLEDs exhibit a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.6%, which is virtually droop-free over a wide range of brightness (.., EQE = 16.1% @ 10 cd/m and 140 mA/cm). Moreover, due to the reduced efficiency roll-off and enhanced heat dissipation, the demonstrated QLEDs can be operated at a very high  up to 3885 mA/cm, thus enabling the devices to exhibit a record-high brightness of 1.6 × 10 cd/m and a lumen density of 500 lm/cm.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is becoming an important public health concern worldwide. However, there is little knowledge about the effects of GEM on NAFLD. In the present study, oleate-treated human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells were utilized to investigate the role of GEM in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. The present results demonstrated that GEM attenuated excessive intracellular triglyceride content in the steatosis model. Upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) protein and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was detected following treatment with GEM. Additionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that GEM increased the downstream genes related to PPARα and SREBP1, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, acyl-coA oxidase 1, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, LIPIN1 and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1. These findings demonstrated that GEM alleviated hepatic steatosis via the involvement of the PPARα and SREBP1 signaling pathways, which enhances lipid oxidation and interferes with lipid synthesis and secretion.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we show that HDLs, not LDLs, significantly decreased the apoptosis of human Tregs in vitro, whereas they did not alter naïve or memory CD4 T cell survival. Similarly,  bound to serum albumin increased Treg survival. Tregs bound and internalized high amounts of HDL compared with other subsets, which might arise from the higher expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I by Tregs; accordingly, blocking this receptor hindered HDL-mediated Treg survival. Mechanistically, we showed that HDL increased Treg ATP concentration and mitochondrial activity, enhancing basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity. Blockade of FA oxidation by etoxomir abolished the HDL-mediated enhanced survival and mitochondrial activity. Our findings thus suggest that Tregs can specifically internalize HDLs from their microenvironment and use them as an energy source. Furthermore, a novel implication of our data is that enhanced Treg survival may contribute to HDLs' anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394805>Effects of Olive Oil and Its Minor Components on Cardiovascular Diseases, Inflammation, and Gut .</a></h2><p>Olive oil is one of the main ingredients in the Mediterranean diet, being an important ally in disease prevention.

The unsaturation level of FAs is determined by fatty  desaturases such as stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs), which are under control of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). Differences in SCD genotype may thus confer variations in lipid metabolism and FA content among cattle breeds. This study investigated correlations between FA composition and lipogenic gene expression levels in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of beef cattle breeds of different gender from the Basque region of northern Spain. Pirenaica is the most important beef cattle breed in northern Spain, while Salers cattle and Holstein-Friesian cull cows are also an integral part of the regional beef supply.Pirenaica heifers showed higher monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and conjugated linoleic  (CLA) contents in subcutaneous adipose tissue than other breeds (P < 0.001). Alternatively, Salers bulls produced the highest  content, followed by Pirenaica heifers (P < 0.001). There was substantial variability in SCD gene expression among breeds, consistent with these differences in MUFA and CLA content. Correlations between SCD1 expression and most FA desaturation indexes (DIs) were positive in Salers (P < 0.05) and Pirenaica bulls, while, in general, SCD5 expression showed few significant correlations with DIs. There was a significant linear correlation between SCD1 and SRBEP1 in all breeds, suggesting strong regulation of SCD1 expression by SRBEP1. Pirenaica heifers showed a stronger correlation between SCD1 and SREBP1 than Pirenaica bulls. We also observed a opposite relationship between SCD1 and SCD5 expression levels and opposite associations of isoform expression levels with the ∆9 desaturation indexes.These results suggest that the relationships between FA composition and lipogenic gene expression are influenced by breed and sex. The opposite relationship between SCD isoforms suggests a compensatory regulation of total SCD activity, while opposite relationships between SCD isoforms and desaturation indexes, specially 9c-14:1 DI, previously reported as an indicator of SCD activity, may reflect distinct activities of SCD1 and SCD5 in regulation of FA content.

Their developmental profile, regional distribution and activity as well as cell type expression remain unknown. We determined that brain CPT1a RNA and total protein expression were unchanged throughout post-natal development (PND0, PND7, PND14, PND21 and PND50); however, CPT2 RNA peaked at PND 21 and remained unchanged through PND50 in all regions studied (cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum). Both long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase and medium acyl-CoA dehydrogenase showed a similar developmental profile to CPT2. Acylcarnitines, generated as a result of CPT1a activity, significantly increased with age and peaked at PND21 in all brain regions, concurrent with the increased expression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation.

However, it is not known how endothelial cells (EC) from large vessels process a postprandial surge of FA.This study was designed to characterize lipid droplet (LD) formation in EC by manipulating pathways leading to the formation and degradation of LD. In addition, several functions of LD-derived FA were assessed.LD were present in EC lining the aorta after the peak in plasma triglycerides initiated by a gavage of olive oil in mice, in vivo. Similarly, in isolated aorta,  treatment generates LD in EC ex vivo. Cultured EC readily form LD largely via the enzyme DGAT (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1) and degrade LD via ATGL (adipocyte triglyceride lipase) after FA loading. Functionally, LD-derived FA are dynamically regulated and function to protect EC from lipotoxic stress and provide FA for metabolic needs.Our results delineate endothelial LD dynamics for the first time in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, LD formation protects EC from lipotoxic stress, regulates EC , and provides a source of FA for adjacent cells in the vessel wall or tissues.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548870>Age-related changes in glucose utilization and fatty  oxidation in a muscle-specific manner during rabbit growth.</a></h2><p>The optimal utilization of energy substrates in muscle fibers is of primary importance for muscle contraction and whole body physiology. This study aimed to investigate the age-related changes in some indicators of glucose catabolism and fatty  oxidation in muscles of growing rabbits. Longissimus lumborum (fast-twitch, LL) and semimembranosus proprius (slow-twitch, SMP) muscles were collected at 10 or 20 weeks of age ( n=6 per age). Glucose transporter GLUT4 content was investigated by immunoblot assay. Activity levels of five enzymes were measured: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) for ; citrate synthase (CS), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) and -3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HAD) for oxidation. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation rates were assessed on fresh homogenates using [1-14C]-oleate as substrate. At both ages, mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidations rates, as well as activities of oxidative enzymes were higher in SMP than in LL. In both muscles, the apparent rate of fatty  oxidation by the mitochondria did not differ between the two ages. However, a decrease in the activities of the three oxidative enzymes was observed in LL, whereas activities of CS and HAD and peroxisomal oxidation rate of oleate increased between the two ages in SMP muscle. In both muscles, LDH activity increased between 10 and 20 weeks, without variations in glucose uptake (GLUT4 transporter content) and in the first step of glucose utilization (PFK activity). In conclusion, mitochondrial oxidation rate of fatty acids and activities of selected mitochondrial enzymes were largely unrelated. Moreover, regulation of energy metabolism with advancing age differed between muscle types.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22018000>Glucose deprivation in tuberous sclerosis complex-related tumors.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells possess unique metabolic phenotypes that are determined by their underlying oncogenic pathways. Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade promotes  and leads to glucose-dependence in tumors. In particular, cells with constitutive mTORC1 activity secondary to the loss of TSC1/TSC2 function are prone to undergo apoptosis upon glucose withdrawal in vitro, but this concept has not been tested in vivo. This study examines the effects of restricting glucose metabolism by pharmacologic and dietary means in a tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor xenograft model.Tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to receive unrestricted carbohydrate-free ("Carb-free") or Western-style diet in the absence or presence of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in one of four treatment groups. After 14 weeks, tumor sizes were significantly different among the four treatment groups with those receiving 2-DG having the smallest tumors. Unexpectedly, the "Carb-free" diet was associated with the largest tumors but they remained responsive to 2-DG. PET imaging showed significant treatment-related changes in tumor 18fluorodeoxyglucose-uptake but the standard uptake values did not correlate with tumor size. Alternative energy substrates such as ketone bodies and monounsaturated  supported the growth of the Tsc2-/- cells in vitro, whereas saturated palmitic  was toxic. Correspondingly, tumors in the high-fat, "Carb-free" group showed greater necrosis and liquefaction that contributed to their larger sizes. In contrast, 2-DG treatment significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation, increased metabolic stress (i.e., ketonemia) and AMPK activity, whereas rapamycin primarily reduced cell size.Our data support the concept of glycolytic inhibition as a therapeutic approach in TSC whereas dietary withdrawal of carbohydrates was not effective.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28496481>Evaluation of Various Biological Activities of the Aerial Parts of  Growing in Iran.</a></h2><p>The current study was assigned to evaluate the total phenol, total flavonoid content (TPC, TFC) and antioxidant properties of extracts from the aerial parts of  ().

The saturated solubility of DA in different oils, surfactants and co-surfactants was tested. The ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant was selected by constructing pseudo three phase diagrams to investigate the maximal microemulsion area. In vitro permeation studies of DA from microemulsion and suspension were performed to optimize the formulation further. Differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) and attenuated total reflection flourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were performed to investigate the mechanism of microemulsion action on skin. The optimized formulation was composed of /Labrasol/propylene glycol/water with 8/45/15/32 (w/w), and the DA loading was 0.75% (w/w). The permeation enhancement of microemusion was 6.00-fold as that of suspension, and the DA from microemulsion retained in the skin was 4.79-fold as that of suspension. DSC and ATR-FTIR results suggested that microemulsion could affect the intercellular lipid lamellae and keratin of the stratum corneum. The   of stratum corneum was disordered by the microemulsion so that the dermal drug delivery was enhanced. Therefore, the optimized microemulsion enhanced DA percutaneous permeation significantly through the interaction of microemulsion with skin, microemulsion is a promising approach for DA percutaneous delivery.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081527>The Protection Potential of Antioxidant Vitamins Against Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: a Rat Trial.</a></h2><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a fatal disease that includes inflammation formed by septic and non-septic causes. Reactive  radicals (ROS) play a key role in ARDS pathophysiology and constitute the base of damage process. Antioxidant vitamins are used for inhibiting hazardous effects of radicals. Therefore, effects of antioxidant vitamins such as α-lipoic  (ALA), vitamin E (VITE), and C (VITC) were investigated on  (OA)-induced ARDS rat model. Furthermore, high and low dose of methylprednisolone (HDMP, LDMP) was used for comparing effects of the vitamins. In this study, 42 male rats were divided to seven groups named control, OA, ALA, VITE, VITC, LDMP, and HDMP. OA was intravenously administered to all groups except control group and other compounds were orally administered (ALA, VITE, and VITC: 100 mg/kg, LDMP: 5 mg/kg, HDMP: 50 mg/kg) after OA injections. OA increased MDA level in lung tissue and TNF-α and IL-1β cytokine levels in serum. ALA, VITE, VITC, and both dose of MP significantly decreased the cytokine levels. Although OA reduced SOD, CAT, and GSH levels in lung tissue, the vitamins and LDMP markedly enhanced the levels except for HDMP. Furthermore, OA showed thickening in bronchi and alveolar septum, hyperemia in vessels, and inflammatory cell infiltrations in lung tissue histopathological examinations. Antioxidant vitamins may be useful for premedication of ARDS and similar disorders. However, methylprednisolone was not found sufficient for being a therapeutic agent for ARDS.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278884>Malassezia interaction with a reconstructed human epidermis: Keratinocyte immune response.</a></h2><p>The immediate immune response developed by the keratinocytes against Malassezia yeasts has been addressed yielding conflicting results.

Fatty  oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive  species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to  was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive  species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage.

Serum TFA level had a positive correlation with body mass index, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B48, and an inverse correlation with age and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Fasting serum TFA, by age quartile in the young generation with CAD and/or MetS, was higher than that in patients without CAD and/or MetS. On multivariate logistic regression, TFA was identified as a CAD risk after adjustment for classical risk factors.Serum TFA concentration was elevated in young patients with CAD and/or MetS.

In this context,  derivatives of dopamine or N-acyl-dopamines are novel substances that may be of high therapeutic interest as having the ability to cross the blood-brain  and acting in dopamine-like manner. In the present study we seek to define the influence of N-acyl-dopamines on lung ventilation and its hypoxic responses in the rat. We found that N-oleoyl-dopamine decreased both normoxic and peak hypoxic ventilation in response to 8% acute hypoxia, on average, by 31% and 41%, respectively. Its metabolite, 3'-O-methyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine, caused a 15% ventilatory decrease each, whereas an  ester derivative, 3'-O-oleoyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine, caused 11% and 19% ventilatory decreases, respectively. All three N-acyl-dopamines investigated displayed an inhibitory effect on ventilation. The findings indicate that 3'-O-methyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine and 3'-O-oleoyl-N-oleoyl-dopamine performed better than N-oleoyl-dopamine in term of less ventilatory suppression, albeit the differences among the three compounds were modest.

Aging and  independently contribute to muscle atrophy that is assumed to be a result of the activation of mutual physiological pathways. Understanding mechanisms contributing to the induction of skeletal muscle atrophy with aging and  is important for determining targets that may have pivotal roles in muscle loss in these conditions. We find that aging and  equally induce an anabolic resistance to acute skeletal muscle contraction as observed with decreases in anabolic signaling activation after contraction. Furthermore, treatment with the sphingosine-1-phosphate analog FTY720 for 4 wk increased lean mass and strength, and the anabolic signaling response to contraction was improved in obese but not older animals. To determine the role of chronic inflammation and different fatty acids on anabolic resistance in skeletal muscle cells, we overexpressed IKKβ with and without exposure to saturated fatty  (SFA; palmitic ), polyunsaturated fatty  (eicosapentaenoic ), and monounsaturated fatty  (). We found that IKKβ overexpression increased inflammation markers in muscle cells, and this chronic inflammation exacerbated anabolic resistance in response to SFA. Pretreatment with FTY720 reversed the inflammatory effects of palmitic  in the muscle cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate chronic inflammation can induce anabolic resistance, SFA aggravates these effects, and FTY720 can reverse this by decreasing ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031723>Inhibition of cholinergic potentiation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets by chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids: Protection by casein kinase 2 inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Chronic hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia are characteristic features of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that are thought to cause or contribute to β-cell dysfunction by "glucolipotoxicity." Previously we have shown that acute treatment of pancreatic islets with fatty acids (FA) decreases acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion. This acetylcholine response is mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors, which play a key role in regulating β-cell function. Here we examine whether chronic FA exposure also inhibits acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion using mouse and human islets.Islets were cultured for 3 or 4 days at different glucose concentration with 0.5 mM palmitic  (PA) or a 2:1 mixture of PA and  (OA) at 1% albumin (PA/BSA molar ratio 3.3). Afterwards, the response to glucose and acetylcholine were studied in perifusion experiments.FA-induced impairment of insulin secretion and Ca signaling depended strongly on the glucose concentrations of the culture medium. PA and OA in combination reduced acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion more than PA alone, both in mouse and human islets, with no evidence of a protective role of OA. In contrast, lipotoxicity was not observed with islets cultured for 3 days in medium containing less than 1 mM glucose and a mixture of glutamine and leucine (7 mM each). High glucose and FAs reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca storage capacity; however, preserving ER Ca by blocking the IP3 receptor with xestospongin C did not protect islets from glucolipotoxic effects on insulin secretion. In contrast, an inhibitor of casein kinase 2 (CK2) protected the glucose dependent acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion in mouse and human islets against glucolipotoxicity.These results show that chronic FA treatment decreases acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion and that this effect is strictly glucose dependent and might involve CK2 phosphorylation of β-cell M3 muscarinic receptors.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

In this study, we focused on plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), and chemically synthesized novel plumbagins conjugated with C2:0 to C22:6 fatty acids (5-O-acyl plumbagins). These chemically modified plumbagins enhanced mammalian pol inhibition and their cytotoxic activity. Plumbagin conjugated with chains consisting of more than C18-unsaturated fatty acids strongly inhibited the activities of calf pol α and human pol γ. Plumbagin conjugated with  (C18:1-acyl plumbagin) showed the strongest suppression of human  carcinoma (HCT116) cell proliferation among the ten synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins. The inhibitory activity on pol α, a DNA replicative pol, by these compounds showed high correlation with their  cell proliferation suppressive activity. C18:1-Acyl plumbagin selectively inhibited the activities of mammalian pol species, but did not influence the activities of other pols and DNA metabolic enzymes tested. This compound inhibited the proliferation of various human  cell lines, and was the cytotoxic inhibitor showing strongest inhibition towards HT-29  cells (LD50 = 2.9 µM) among the nine cell lines tested. In an in vivo anti-tumor assay conducted on nude mice bearing solid tumors of HT-29 cells, C18:1-acyl plumbagin was shown to be a promising tumor suppressor. These data indicate that novel 5-O-acyl plumbagins act as anti- agents based on mammalian DNA replicative pol α inhibition.

These conditions pose a challenge to the regulation of germination. The effect of recurring hydration-dehydration (Hy-Dh) cycles were tested on seeds from four Arabidopsis thaliana accessions [Col-0, Cvi, C24 and Ler]. Diurnal Hy-Dh cycles had a detrimental effect on the germination rate and on the final percentage of germination in Col-0, Cvi and C24 ecotypes, but not in the Ler ecotype, which showed improved vigor following the treatments. Membrane permeability measured by ion conductivity was generally increased following each Hy-Dh cycle and was correlated with changes in the redox status represented by the GSSG/GSH (oxidized/reduced glutathione) ratio. Among the ecotypes, Col-0 seeds displayed the highest membrane permeability, whilst Ler was characterized by the greatest increase in electrical conductivity following Hy-Dh cycles. Following Dh 2 and Dh 3, the respiratory activity of Ler seeds significantly increased, in contrast to the other ecotypes, indicative of a dramatic shift in metabolism.

Considerable differences were noticed in mitochondrial membrane lipid composition, namely in terms of fatty acyl chains and relative proportions of phospholipid classes, the modified diet inducing a decrease in the saturated to unsaturated molar ratio and an increase in the phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine molar ratio. Mass spectrometry lipid analysis showed significant differences in the major species of cardiolipin, with an apparent increased incorporation of  as a result of exposure to the modified diet. Rats fed the modified diet during 22 days showed decreased hepatic mitochondrial state 3 respiration and were more susceptible to Ca(2+)-induced transition pore opening. Rapeseed oil-enriched diet also appeared to promote a decrease in hydroperoxide production by the respiratory chain, although a simultaneous decrease in vitamin E content was detected.

In this study, we have investigated the role of stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase isoform C (SACPD-C), a soybean enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of stearic  into , which is expressed in developing seeds and in nitrogen-fixing nodules. In-depth cytological investigation of nodule development in sacpd-c mutant lines M25 and MM106 revealed gross anatomical alteration in the sacpd-c mutants. Transmission electron microscopy observations revealed ultrastructural alterations in the sacpd-c mutants that are typically associated with plant defense response to pathogens. In nodules of two sacpd-c mutants, the combined jasmonic  (JA) species (JA and the isoleucine conjugate of JA) were found to be reduced and 12-oxophytodienoic  (OPDA) levels were significantly higher relative to wild-type lines. Salicylic  levels were not significantly different between genotypes, which is divergent from previous studies of sacpd mutant studies on vegetative tissues. Soybean nodule phytohormone profiles were very divergent from those of roots, and root profiles were found to be almost identical between mutant and wild-type genotypes. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were also found to be higher in nodules of sacpd-c mutants.

In the absence of surfactant, tristearin acyl chains are marginally aligned normal to the interface. The surfactant glycerol monooleate (GMO), a common small-molecule monoacylglycerol (MW: 357 g/mol), preferentially adsorbs to the oil-water interface, displacing more of the tristearin as its concentration increases. The tristearin that remains at the interface is closely aligned normal to the interface. Adjacent to the interface, bulk tristearin increasingly aligns with its acyl chains entwined with the GMO acyl chain, which also preferentially aligns normal to the interface. In contrast, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), a bulkier, polymeric surfactant (MW: 1398 g/mol for a molecule with five monomers), both displaces tristearin from the interface and reduces the alignment of the molecules that remain. We suggest that the similar fatty  moieties of GMO () and tristearin (stearic ) lead to liquid-state association and alignment, the latter of which can then serve as a template onto which tristearin crystals can nucleate. Conversely, by both displacing tristearin from the interface and reducing alignment below that of the surfactant-free system, PGPR eliminates the possibility of tristearin interfacial crystallisation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The major products of SCD-catalyzed reactions are oleate (18:1n-9) and palmitoleate (16:1n-7).We generated mouse models with restricted exogenous MUFA supply and reduced endogenous MUFA synthesis, in which SCD1 global knockout (GKO) or liver-specific knockout (LKO) mice were fed a lipogenic high-sucrose very low-fat (HSVLF) or high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. In a gain-of-function context, we introduced liver-specific expression of either human SCD5, which synthesizes 18:1n-9, or mouse Scd3, which synthesizes 16:1n-7, into SCD1 GKO mice and fed the HSVLF diet.Lipogenic high-carbohydrate diets induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation in SCD1 GKO and LKO mice. Dietary supplementation with 18:1n-9, but not 18:0, prevented the HSVLF diet-induced hepatic ER stress and inflammation in SCD1 LKO mice, while hepatic SCD5, but not Scd3, expression reduced the ER stress and inflammation in GKO mice. Additional experiments revealed liver-specific deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α reduced hepatic inflammatory and ER stress response gene expression in SCD1 LKO mice.Our results demonstrate an indispensable role of hepatic oleate in protection against lipogenic diet-induced hepatic injury, and PGC-1α potentiates the ER stress response under conditions of restricted dietary oleate coupled to reduced capacity of endogenous hepatic oleate synthesis.Susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. In this study we show that modulation of two genes regulates the liver response, including ER stress and inflammation, to a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet. We reveal that hepatic availability of oleate, a monounsaturated fatty , is important for maintenance of liver health.Copyright © 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The article describes the application of cycled microwave power for the rapid synthesis of highly branched pure-phase face-centered cubic crystalline nickel multipod nanostructures with >99% multipod population. By controlling the power delivery to the reaction mixture through cycling, superior control is achieved over the growth kinetics of the metallic nanostructures, allowing formation of multipods consisting of arms with different aspect ratios. The multipod structures are formed under ambient conditions in a simple reaction system composed of nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)), oleylamine (OAm), and  (OAc) in a matter of minutes by selective heating at the (111) overgrowth corners on Ni nanoseeds. The selective heating at the corners leads to accelerated autocatalytic growth along the ⟨111⟩ direction through a "lightning rod" effect. The length is proprtional to the length and number of microwave (MW)-on cycles, whereas the core size is controlled by continuous MW power delivery. The roles of heating mode (cycling versus variable power versus convective heating) during synthesis of the materials is explored, allowing a mechanism into how cycled microwave  may allow fast multipod evolution to be proposed.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903761>Protective effects of grape seed and skin extract against high-fat-diet-induced lipotoxicity in rat lung.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a public health problem characterized by increased fat accumulation in different tissues.

The likely protection provided by grape seed extract (GSSE) was also investigated.In order to assess HFD effect on lung and GSSE protection we used a rat model.

We also analyzed transition metals (Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and iron) and lung free fatty acids using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS).HFD induced lipid profile imbalance increasing cholesterol and VLDL-C. HFD also induced an oxidative stress assessed by elevated MDA level and the drop of antioxidant activities such as SOD, CAT and POD. Moreover, HFD induced mineral disturbances by decreasing magnesium level and increasing Calcium and iron levels. HFD induced also disturbances in lung fatty  composition by increasing , stearic and arachidonic acids. Interestingly, GSSE alleviated all these deleterious effects of HFD treatment.As a whole, GSSE had a significant preventive effect against HFD-induced obesity, and hence may be used as an anti-obesity agent, and a benefic agent with potential applications against damages in lung tissue.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235728>Semicontinuous sophorolipid fermentation using a novel bioreactor with dual ventilation pipes and dual sieve-plates coupled with a novel separation system.</a></h2><p>Sophorolipids (SLs) are biosurfactants with widespread applications. The yield and purity of SLs are two important factors to be considered during their commercial large-scale production. Notably, SL accumulation causes an increase in viscosity, decrease in dissolved  and product inhibition in the fermentation medium. This inhibits the further production and purification of SLs. This describes the development of a novel integrated system for SL production using Candida albicans O-13-1. Semicontinuous fermentation was performed using a novel bioreactor with dual ventilation pipes and dual sieve-plates (DVDSB). SLs were separated and recovered using a newly designed two-stage separation system. After SL recovery, the fermentation broth containing residual glucose and  was recycled back into the bioreactor. This novel approach considerably alleviated the problem of product inhibition and accelerated the rate of substrate utilization. Production of SLs achieved was 477 g l , while their productivity was 1.59 g l  h . Purity of SLs improved by 23.3%, from 60% to 74%, using DVDSB with the separation system. The conversion rate of carbon source increased from 0.5 g g (in the batch fermentation) to 0.6 g g .

However, associations between  composition and fat taste sensitivity are controversial. The objective of this study was to examine the association between  composition, dietary intake and detection thresholds of four fatty stimuli (, paraffin oil, canola oil, and canola oil spiked with ) that could be perceived via gustatory and/or textural cues. In 30 participants, fat detection thresholds were determined in a repeated measurements design over twelve days.  status was examined by measuring the participants' BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. The habitual food intake was assessed via several questionnaires and twelve, non-consecutive 24-hour food diaries. In this study, a negative correlation was found between fat detection thresholds and the intake of food rich in vitamins and fibre. Moreover, a positive correlation was identified between the intake of high-fat food and fat detection thresholds. No differences in fat detection thresholds were observed due to variations in BMI or waist-to-hip ratio. These findings indicate that a regular intake of fatty foods might decrease an individuals' perceptual response to fats which might lead to excess fat intake on the long term.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty  synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE. Moreover, SNE can be used to develop health-food products for preventing NAFL disease.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'fatty liver', 'hyperlipedemia', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'lipogenesis', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19465148>Mitochondrial long chain fatty  beta-oxidation in man and mouse.</a></h2><p>Several mouse models for mitochondrial fatty  beta-oxidation (FAO) defects have been developed. So far, these models have contributed little to our current understanding of the pathophysiology. The objective of this study was to explore differences between murine and human FAO. Using a combination of analytical, biochemical and molecular methods, we compared fibroblasts of long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (LCAD(-/-)), very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (VLCAD(-/-)) and wild type mice with fibroblasts of VLCAD-deficient patients and human controls. We show that in mice, LCAD and VLCAD have overlapping and distinct roles in FAO. The absence of VLCAD is apparently fully compensated, whereas LCAD deficiency is not. LCAD plays an essential role in the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as , but seems redundant in the oxidation of saturated fatty acids. In strong contrast, LCAD is neither detectable at the mRNA level nor at the protein level in men, making VLCAD indispensable in FAO. Our findings open new avenues to employ the existing mouse models to study the pathophysiology of human FAO defects.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971334>Preventive effect of oleate on palmitate-induced  in skeletal muscle and its mechanism of action.</a></h2><p> in skeletal muscle is a feature associated with exposure to an excess of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate.  has been shown to blunt palmitate-induced  in muscle cells. However, there is no literature available regarding the effect of  on palmitate-induced  in intact muscle. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of  on palmitate-induced  in rat soleus muscle and its underlying mechanisms. For these purposes,  (1 mM) was administered for 12 h in the absence or presence of palmitate (2 mM). At the end of the experiment, plasmalemmal GLUT4, the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2, and the total expression of these signaling proteins were examined. We found that treatment with palmitate for 12 h reduced -stimulated GLUT4 translocation and the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2. However, the administration of  fully restored -stimulated GLUT4 translocation (P < 0.05), as well as AS160 and Akt-2 phosphorylation (P < 0.05) despite the continuous presence of palmitate. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K, only slightly prevented the -induced improvements in -stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and AS160 phosphorylation. However, this treatment completely inhibited the -induced improvement in -stimulated Akt-2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the -induced improvement in  signaling was not affected by compound C, an AMPK specific inhibitor. In conclusion, the results clearly indicate that  administration alleviates palmitate-induced  by promoting GLUT4 translocation in muscle, at least in part, by activating the PI3K pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16771072>Dietary lipids and .</a></h2><p> is one of the main causes of death in Western countries.

To investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of DAP on NAFLD, we treated HepG2 cells with  (OA) and DAP simultaneously and non‑simultaneously.

Following the aforementioned treatments, the biochemical indexes associated with NAFLD were measured as follows: i) The intracellular contents of triglyceride (TG), reactive  species (ROS) and fluorescent glucose 2‑[N‑(7‑nitrobenz‑2‑oxa‑1,3‑diazol‑4‑yl) amino]‑2‑deoxyglucose were analyzed with corresponding detection kits; and ii) the cellular expression levels of glycolipid metabolism‑ and oxidative stress‑related genes, including 5'AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1C (SREBP‑1C), patatin‑like phospholipase domain‑containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor α (PPARα), phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor‑like 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and CYP4A were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.

The degradation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, basic components of the epithelial barrier, was prevented in a GPR40-dependent manner in vitro. Oral inoculation of HYA in a mouse experimental periodontitis model suppressed the bacteria-induced degradation of E-cadherin and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production in the gingival tissue.

OA-NO2 significantly inhibited atrial fibrosis and depressed vulnerability for AF during right atrial electrophysiological stimulation to levels observed for AngII-naive animals. Left atrial epicardial mapping studies demonstrated preservation of conduction homogeneity by OA-NO2. The protection from fibrotic remodelling was mediated by suppression of Smad2-dependent myofibroblast transdifferentiation and inhibition of Nox2-dependent atrial superoxide formation.OA-NO2 potently inhibits atrial fibrosis and subsequent AF.

ATP is unique among the nucleotides in being able to turn non-native states of cyt c back to the native conformation. The peroxidase activity acquired by lipid-bound cyt c turns out to be very critical in the early stages of apoptosis. Nucleotide specificity is observed for apoptosome formation and caspase activation, the cleavage occurring only in the presence of dATP or ATP. In this study, we demonstrate the connection between peroxidase activity and -induced conformational transitions of cyt c and show how ATP is capable of modulating such interplay. By NMR measurement, we have demonstrated that ATP interacts with a site (S1) formed by K88, R91, and E62 and such interaction was weakened by mutation of E62, suggesting the selective role in the interaction played by the base moiety. Interestingly, the interactions of ATP and GTP with cyt c are significantly different at low nucleotide concentrations, with GTP being less effective in perturbing the S1 site and in eliciting apoptotic activity. To gain insights into the structural features of cyt c required for its pro-apoptotic activity and to demonstrate a regulatory role for ATP (compared to the effect of GTP), we have performed experiments on cell lysates by using cyt c proteins mutated on amino  residues that, as suggested by NMR measurements, belong to S1. Thus, we provide evidence that ATP acts as an allosteric effector, regulating structural transitions among different conformations and different oxidation states of cyt c, which are endowed with apoptotic activity or not. On this basis, we suggest a previously unrecognized role for ATP binding to cyt c at low millimolar concentrations in the cytosol, beyond the known regulatory role during the oxidative phosphorylation in .</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423749>PPARγ induces NEDD4 gene expression to promote autophagy and insulin action.</a></h2><p>The E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (NEDD4) plays a crucial role in governing a number of signaling , including insulin and autophagy signaling.

Here, we reported that NEDD4 mRNA and protein levels were increased by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) in HepG2 hepatocytes. PPARγ antagonist GW9662 abolished thiazolidinedione (TZD)-induced NEDD4 expression. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays showed that PPARγ directly bound to the potential PPAR-responsive elements (PPREs) within the promoter region of the human NEDD4 gene. In addition, TZDs increased Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake, which were abrogated through NEDD4 depletion. Furthermore, we showed that NEDD4-mediated autophagy induction and Akt phosphorylation were suppressed by  and high glucose treatment, activation of PPARγ successfully prevented this suppression.

Surface manipulation of metal halide perovskite (MHP) QDs has proven particularly challenging in comparison to that of more established inorganic materials due to dynamic surface species and low material formation ; most conventional methods of chemical manipulation targeted at the MHP QD surface will result in transformation or dissolution of the MHP crystal. In previous work, we have demonstrated record-efficiency QD solar cells (QDSCs) based on ligand-exchange procedures that electronically couple MHP QDs yet maintain their nanocrystalline size, which stabilizes the corner-sharing structure of the constituent PbI octahedra with optoelectronic properties optimal for solar  conversion. In this work, we employ a variety of spectroscopic techniques to develop a molecular-level understanding of the MHP QD surface chemistry in this system. We individually target both the anionic (oleate) and cationic (oleylammonium) ligands. We find that atmospheric moisture aids the process by hydrolysis of methyl acetate to generate acetic  and methanol. Acetic  then replaces native oleate ligands to yield QD surface-bound acetate and free . The native oleylammonium ligands remain throughout this film deposition process and are exchanged during a final treatment step employing smaller cations-namely, formamidinium. This final treatment has a narrow processing window; initial treatment at this stage leads to a more strongly coupled QD regime followed by transformation into a bulk MHP film after longer treatment. These insights provide chemical understanding to the deposition of high-quality, electronically coupled MHP QD films that maintain both quantum confinement and their crystalline phase and attain high photovoltaic performance.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29882787>Elastic MCF Rubber with Photovoltaics and Sensing on Hybrid Skin (H-Skin) for Artificial Skin by Utilizing Natural Rubber: 2nd Report on the Effect of Tension and Compression on the Hybrid Photo- and Piezo-Electricity Properties in Wet-Type Solar Cell Rubber.</a></h2><p>In contrast to ordinary solid-state solar cells, a flexible, elastic, extensible and light- solar cell has the potential to be extremely useful in many new engineering applications, such as in the field of robotics. Therefore, we propose a new type of artificial skin for humanoid robots with hybrid functions, which we have termed hybrid skin (H-Skin). To realize the fabrication of such a solar cell, we have continued to utilize the principles of ordinary solid-state wet-type or dye-sensitized solar rubber as a follow-up study to the first report. In the first report, we dealt with both photovoltaic- and piezo-effects for dry-type magnetic compound fluid (MCF) rubber solar cells, which were generated because the polyisoprene,  of the magnetic fluid (MF), and water served as p- and n- semiconductors. In the present report, we deal with wet-type MCF rubber solar cells by using sensitized dyes and electrolytes. Photoreactions generated through the synthesis of these components were investigated by an experiment using irradiation with visible and ultraviolet light. In addition, magnetic clusters were formed by the aggregation of Fe₃O₄ in the MF and the metal particles created the hetero-junction structure of the semiconductors. In the MCF rubber solar cell, both photo- and piezo-electricity were generated using a physical model. The effects of tension and compression on their electrical properties were evaluated. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated the effect of the distance between the electrodes of the solar cell on photoelectricity and built-in electricity.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28253633>Fatty acids penetration into human skin ex vivo: A TOF-SIMS analysis approach.</a></h2><p>Linoleic, , palmitoleic, palmitic, and stearic fatty acids (FAs) are commonly used in dermatological formulations. They differ by their structure, presence in the skin, and mode of application in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics compounding. These FAs are also known as chemical penetration enhancers, but their mechanisms of penetration enhancement and effect on  characteristics of the skin require additional study. In this study, the authors conducted an ex vivo analysis of the distribution of lipid components in the epidermis and dermis of human skin after applying individual FAs. The goal was to elucidate possible mechanisms of penetration enhancement and FA effects on  characteristics of the skin. FA penetration studies were conducted ex vivo on human skin and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) bioimaging analysis was performed to visualize and analyze distribution of FAs in skin sections. The current study demonstrated that TOF-SIMS imaging was effective in visualizing the distribution of linoleic, , palmitoleic, palmitic, and stearic  in the human skin ex vivo after the skin penetration experiment of individual FAs. The integration of the obtained TOF-SIMS images allowed a semiquantitative comparison of the effects induced by individual FA applications on the human skin ex vivo. FAs showed varying abilities to penetrate the skin and disorder the FAs within the skin, based on their structures and physicochemical properties. Linoleic  penetrated the skin and changed the distribution of all the analyzed FAs. Skin treatment with palmitoleic or  increased the amounts of singular FAs in the skin. Penetration of saturated FAs was low, but it increased the detected amounts of linoleic  in both skin layers. The results indicate that application of FAs on the skin surface induce redistribution of native FAs not only in the stratum corneum layer of epidermis but also in the lipid content of full epidermis and dermis layers. The results indicate that topically applied pharmaceutical products should be evaluated for potential chemical penetration enhancement and lipid component redistribution effects during formulation.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102241>Phenolic  inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end products in food simulation systems depending on their reducing powers and structures.</a></h2><p>The concentration of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in foods, which are formed by Maillard reaction, has demonstrated as risk factors associated with many chronic diseases.

The present study aims to compare the difference in pathology, blood gas values and biomarkers of two acute lung injury rat models at different time intervals. In the experiment, rats were randomly divided into three groups: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group,  (OA) group and control group. Changes of pathology, blood gas values and blood-air barrier biomarkers were analyzed at 15 minutes, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after injection. The results showed that the two models exhibited different features. Compared with the LPS rats, OA rats exhibited significantly severe pathological changes, lower arterial  partial pressure (PaO2) value and higher level of injury biomarkers. However, LPS rats boasted greater lactic  (LAC) level and more severe acidosis than OA rats. This study suggests that LPS-induced model has greater value in researches on microcirculation dysfunction and sepsis resulting from ALI, while OA-induced model has greater repeatability in area of gas exchanging after ALI.

The rapeseeds were roasted at different temperature/time combinations (at 140-180°C, and for 5-15min); subsequently, oil was pressed from the roasted seeds. The roasting improved the flavour and contributed to a substantial increase in the amount of a potent antioxidant-canolol. The changes in  compounds related to roasting conditions were monitored using comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC×GC-ToFMS), and the key odorants for the non-roasted and roasted seeds oils were determined by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O). The most important compounds determining the flavour of oils obtained from the roasted seeds were dimethyl sulphide, dimethyltrisulfide, 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine, 2,3-butenedione, octanal, 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine and phenylacetaldehyde. For the oils obtained from the non-roasted seeds, the dominant compounds were dimethylsulfide, hexanal and octanal. Based on GC×GC-ToFMS and principal component analysis (PCA) of the data, several compounds were identified that were associated with roasting at the highest temperatures regardless of the rapeseed variety: these were, among others, methyl ketones (2-hexanone, 2-heptanone and 2-octanone).Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, atomic force microscopy was employed, for the first time, to probe the surface interactions and adhesion  of model  (a commonly used surface modification organics for fluorite) molecules on fluorite surfaces with different orientations in both air and aqueous solutions at different pH conditions. Fitted with the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, the force results during surface approaching demonstrate the anisotropy in the surface charge of different orientations, with the {111} surface exhibiting a higher magnitude of surface charge, which could be attributed to the difference in the atomic composition. The adhesion measured during surface retraction shows that model  molecules have a stronger adhesion with the {100} surface than with the {111} surface in both air and aqueous solutions. The anisotropic adhesion  was analyzed in relation to the surface atom (especially calcium) activity, which was supported by the surface free  results calculated based on a three-probe-liquid method. Each calcium atom on the {100} surface with four dangling bonds is more active than the calcium atom on the {111} surface with only one dangling bond, supported by a larger value of the Lewis  component for the {100} surface. The model  molecules present in the ionic form at pH 9 exhibit a higher adhesion  with fluorite surfaces as compared to their molecular form at pH 6, which was related to the surface activity of different forms. The adhesion  measured in solution is much lower than that in air, indicating that the solvent exerts an important influence on the interactions of organic molecules with mineral surfaces. The results provide useful information on the fundamental understanding of surface interactions and adhesion  of organic molecules on mineral surfaces with different orientations, and the methodology can be extended to many other crystal surfaces in various interfacial processes.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27249207>Knockdown of triglyceride synthesis does not enhance palmitate lipotoxicity or prevent oleate-mediated rescue in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Experiments in a variety of cell types, including hepatocytes, consistently demonstrate the acutely lipotoxic effects of saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate (PA), but not unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleate (OA). PA+OA co-treatment fully prevents PA lipotoxicity through mechanisms that are not well defined but which have been previously attributed to more efficient esterification and sequestration of PA into triglycerides (TGs) when OA is abundant. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested by experimentally modulating the relative partitioning of PA/OA between TGs and other lipid fates in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that addition of OA to PA-treated hepatocytes enhanced TG synthesis, reduced total PA uptake and PA lipid incorporation, decreased phospholipid saturation and rescued PA-induced ER stress and lipoapoptosis. Knockdown of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), the rate-limiting step in TG synthesis, significantly reduced TG accumulation without impairing OA-mediated rescue of PA lipotoxicity. In both wild-type and DGAT-knockdown hepatocytes, OA co-treatment significantly reduced PA lipid incorporation and overall phospholipid saturation compared to PA-treated hepatocytes. These data indicate that OA's protective effects do not require increased conversion of PA into inert TGs, but instead may be due to OA's ability to compete against PA for cellular uptake and/or esterification and, thereby, normalize the composition of cellular lipids in the presence of a toxic PA load.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Estrogens are known to increase mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) by an unknown mechanism. Given that uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are key regulators of mitochondrial energy efficiency and ROS production, our aim was to check the presence and activity of UCPs in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells and tumors, as well as their relation to oxidative stress. Estrogen (1 nM) induced higher oxidative stress in the ER-positive MCF-7 cell line, showing increased mitochondrial membrane potential, H(2)O(2) levels, and DNA and protein damage compared to ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. All isoforms of uncoupling proteins were highly expressed in ER-positive breast cancer cells and tumors compared to negative ones. ROS production in  isolated from MCF-7 was increased by inhibition of UCPs with GDP, but not in  from MDA-MB-231. Estrogen treatment decreased uncoupling protein and catalase levels in MCF-7 and decreased GDP-dependent ROS production in isolated . On the whole, these results suggest that estrogens, through an ER-dependent mechanism, may increase mitochondrial ROS production by repressing uncoupling proteins, which offers a new perspective on the understanding of why estrogens are a risk factor for breast cancer.Copyright  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Both the amount and type of dietary fat modulate intestinal immune function. Absorption of long-chain fatty acids stimulates lymphocyte flux and lymphocyte blastogenesis in intestinal lymphatics. Long-chain fatty  absorption also significantly enhances migration of T lymphocytes to Peyer's patches, possibly due to up-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as alpha4-integrin and L-selectin. Lipoproteins are involved in stimulation of lymphocyte function by both receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms. However, unsaturated fatty acids at higher concentrations have a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immunity via eicosanoid release, receptor affinity changes or interactions with intracellular signal transduction. Fat absorption also influences various other cells in the intestinal mucosa: increased cytokine release from intestinal epithelial cells follows long-chain fatty  absorption. In Crohn's , elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition often induce remission, possibly by reducing antigenic load on activated immune cells in the intestine and, thus, down-regulating hyperreactive CD4 cells. Dietary  supplements caused an immunological reversal effect in the intestinal immune system of animals fed an elemental diet. An excess of long-chain fatty acids in an elemental diet, therefore, may negate its beneficial effect on gut-associated lymphoid tissues in Crohn's . In contrast, supplemental dietary fish oil apparently tends to prevent relapse of Crohn's . Because dietary fat intake is closely associated with immunological function of the intestinal mucosa, careful manipulation of dietary fat can be important in management of this .</p><p>Keyword:['inflammatory bowel disease']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19444596>Reduced endoplasmic reticulum luminal calcium links saturated fatty -mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death in liver cells.</a></h2><p>Chronic exposure to elevated free fatty acids, in particular long chain saturated fatty acids, provokes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death in a number of cell types. The perturbations to the ER that instigate ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein in response to fatty acids in hepatocytes have not been identified. The present study employed H4IIE liver cells and primary rat hepatocytes to examine the hypothesis that saturated fatty acids induce ER stress via effects on ER luminal calcium stores. Exposure of H4IIE liver cells and primary hepatocytes to palmitate and stearate reduced thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores and increased biochemical markers of ER stress over similar time courses (6 h). These changes preceded cell death, which was only observed at later time points (16 h). Co-incubation with oleate prevented the reduction in calcium stores, induction of ER stress markers and cell death observed in response to palmitate. Inclusion of calcium chelators, BAPTA-AM or EGTA, reduced palmitate- and stearate-mediated enrichment of cytochrome c in post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions and cell death.

Compared to other oils, olive oil infusion showed a significantly greater effect to reduce food intake (P<0.01). Total caloric intake, the sum of the calories from the diet and infused oil, was significantly reduced with olive oil (P<0.01) but not with coconut or safflower oil infusion, suggesting an oleate-specific effect on caloric intake. To further test this idea, different groups of rats received an intravenous infusion of oleate, linoleate, or octanoate (0.5mg/h). Oleate infusion decreased overnight food intake by 26% (P<0.001), but no significant effect was seen with linoleate, octanoate, or vehicle infusion (P>0.05). The effects of olive oil or oleate infusion could not be explained by changes in plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, or total FFA levels. The olive oil effect on food intake was not reduced in vagotomized rats, suggesting that oleate sensing may not involve peripheral sensors. In contrast, olive oil's effect was attenuated in high-fat-fed rats, suggesting that this effect is regulated (or impaired) under physiological (or pathological) conditions.

Using a cross-over design, 17 adults were fed high PA (HPA) and low PA/high  (HOA) diets, each for 3 weeks. The [1-(13)C]PA and [13-(13)C]PA tracers were administered with food in random order with each diet, and we assessed PA oxidation (PA OX) and serum AC concentration to determine whether a higher PA intake promoted incomplete PA OX. Dietary PA was completely oxidized during the HOA diet, but only about 40% was oxidized during the HPA diet. The [13-(13)C]PA/[1-(13)C]PA ratio of PA OX had an approximate value of 1.0 for either diet, but the ratio of the serum concentrations of MCACs to long-chain ACs (LCACs) was significantly higher during the HPA diet. Thus, direct measurement of PA OX did not confirm that the HPA diet caused incomplete PA OX, despite the modest, but statistically significant, increase in the ratio of MCACs to LCACs in blood.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026639>Effect of algal and bacterial diet on metal bioaccumulation in zooplankton from the Pearl River, South China.</a></h2><p>The biomagnification of metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) and the metalloid As in aquatic systems is a global health concern. In this study, concentrations of fatty  biomarkers in zooplankton were analyzed from the Pearl River, South China between September 2016 and July 2017. The objective was to examine how particulate matter, algae and bacteria food sources affect metal bioaccumulation using fatty  facilitation. In the zooplankton fraction, positive correlations were observed between Pb concentration and Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), Zn and Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (diatoms and Cryptophyceae biomarkers), Fe with Palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7, diatom marker), and a weak association of Mn with α-linolenic  (C18:3n-3). Cu concentration in the zooplankton increased significantly with an endogenous biotic biomarker Stearic  (C18:0, bacteria biomarker), while Cd concentrations increased with increasing  (C18:1n-9, green alga biomarker) concentration. There was a positive correlation between Cr concentration and the sum of Pentadecylic and Margaric acids (C15:0 + C17:0, bacteria biomarkers). Seven of the nine metals examined showed associations with fatty acids in the zooplankton. The bioaccumulation of Co, Cu, Pb, Fe, Mn and Zn concentration was correlated to the individual biomasses of Brachionus calyciflorus, Filinia longiseta, Schmackeria forbesi, Limnoithona sinenisis, Thermocyclops brevifurcatus, and Diaphanosoma dubium. For selected zooplankton taxa, the algal biomasses of Euglenophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, and Bacillariophyceae were correlated. Zooplankton were affected by selected species of phytoplankton and bacteria numbers in the Pearl River. These results show that metal accumulation in zooplankton is not only correlated with diet but is also in part, species specific with metal type. Thus, the bioaccumulation or scavenging of metals across trophic levels is a fundamental and complex component of metal cycling in aquatic environments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that  promotes aggressive PCa. Recently, a family of Free Fatty  (FFA) receptors (FFARs) has been identified and reported to affect several crucial biological functions of tumor cells such as proliferation, invasiveness, and apoptosis. Here we report that  (OA), one of the most prevalent FFA in human plasma, increases proliferation of highly malignant PC3 and DU-145 PCa cells. Furthermore, docetaxel cytotoxic action, the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of androgen-independent PCa, was significantly reduced in the presence of OA, when measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, suggesting that this FFA plays also a role in chemoresistance. OA induced intracellular calcium increase, in part due to the store operated calcium entry (SOCE), measured by a calcium imaging technique. Moreover, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was enhanced, as revealed by increased Akt phosphorylation levels. Intriguingly, attenuating the expression of FFA1/GPR40, a receptor for long chain FFA including OA, prevented the OA-induced effects. Of relevance, we found that FFA1/GPR40 is significantly overexpressed in tissue specimens of PCa, compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues, at both mRNA and protein expression level, analyzed by Real Time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments, respectively. Our data suggest that OA promotes an aggressive phenotype in PCa cells via FFA1/GPR40, calcium and PI3K/Akt signaling. Thus, FFA1/GPR40, might represent a potential useful prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced PCa.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668424>Lycopus lucidus Turcz. ex Benth.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The , relative liver , hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the , relative liver , serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

TNF-α increases surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression previously decreased by POA. TNF-α stimulation increases the expression of NFκB, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, MCP-1, and IL-6 genes and reduces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α gene. PA enhances the expression of MCP-1, IL-6, and COX-2 genes, while POA downregulates these genes, decreases expression of NFκB, and upregulates PPAR-α gene expression.POA has anti-inflammatory effects on ECs stimulated with TNF-α and may counter endothelial dysfunction.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is well established in terms of the plasma concentrations of free fatty  (FFA) that are up-regulated in cases associating with .  (OA) is known as the most abundant monounsaturated fatty  in the human circulatory system. Several pro-atherosclerotic responses of OA have been established. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) acts as a key role in regulating the normal physical function in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SIRT1 activation is developed as a novel approach to delay the progression of atherosclerotic injuries. However, the mechanism is still unclear as to whether OA affects SIRT1 expression and its activity in SMCs. We confirmed that OA treatment represses SIRT1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ levels in SMCs. Moreover, OA enhances by transforming the growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) release via activation of NF-κB. OA causes NO production by inducing the inducible nitric oxide synthase overexpression, thereby promoting the secretions of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-3. Overall, we suggested that OA enhances MMPs activation through SIRT1 down-regulation. Therefore, our findings might provide a novel route for developing new therapeutic treatments for FFAs-related CADs.© The Authors 2016.

Incidences of FRCs, except for steeply increasing , have remained low in Japan. Similarly, Mediterranean people enjoy relatively low risks of FRCs compared with American people. The low risks of FRCs in Japanese may be explained by limited intake of fats and oils as a whole, and a low ratio of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) versus n-3 PUFAs through consumption of the latter from marine foods. They also frequently consume vegetables and fruit, and dietary fiber. Mediterranean people moderately consume fats and oils from a large amount of olive oil, containing not only  but also polyphenols (including flavonoids), &mgr;-tocopherol and carotenoids (including &mgr;-carotene), which are antioxidants and anti-carcinogenic as in red wine, vegetables (including herbs) and fruit.

Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and  (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced vaccenic  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a fat-free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high-fat diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of obesity, fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of  (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or .Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26255707>Feeding regulates sex pheromone attraction and courtship in Drosophila females.</a></h2><p>In Drosophila melanogaster, gender-specific behavioural responses to the male-produced sex pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) rely on sexually dimorphic, third-order neural circuits. We show that nutritional state in female flies modulates cVA perception in first-order olfactory neurons. Starvation increases, and feeding reduces attraction to food odour, in both sexes. Adding cVA to food odour, however, maintains attraction in fed females, while it has no effect in males. Upregulation of sensitivity and behavioural responsiveness to cVA in fed females is paralleled by a strong increase in receptivity to male courtship. Functional imaging of the antennal lobe (AL), the olfactory centre in the insect brain, shows that olfactory input to DA1 and VM2 glomeruli is also modulated by starvation. Knocking down insulin receptors in neurons converging onto the DA1 glomerulus suggests that insulin-signalling partly controls pheromone perception in the AL, and adjusts cVA attraction according to nutritional state and sexual receptivity in Drosophila females.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737815>Isofraxidin, a coumarin component improves high-fat diet induced hepatic lipid homeostasis disorder and macrophage inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Isofraxidin (IF) is a coumarin compound produced in the functional foods Siberian ginseng and Apium graveolens.

Alterations in triglyceride metabolism, inflammation and oxidative status were monitored. Results show that IF mainly reduced triglyceride accumulation, TNF-α release and ROS activation in metabolic disordered cells. Next, a high-fat diet, which induced a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, was used to evaluate the therapeutic action of IF. Our results show that treatment with IF significantly inhibited the high-fat diet-induced elevation in , liver , lipid metabolism (TG, TC and HDL-C) and hepatic injury in mice. In biochemical terms, treatment with IF resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC, as well as reduced hepatic expression of FAS and HMGC, suggesting that lipogenesis was compromised. We also found robust evidence that treatment with IF significantly depleted infiltrating inflammatory cells (F4/80 Kupffer cells and CD68 macrophages) and inflammatory cytokine release (TNFα and IL-6). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity in IF-treated hepatic tissue correlated with down-regulation of TLR4 expression and NF-κB transcription.

Then, DEPs such as antithrombin III (AT III), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO), dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2), polycystin-2 and plasminogen were identified by western blotting. Subsequently, we focused on investigating the effect of AT III on endothelial integrity using siRNA interference technology. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β expression were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Alterations in the  component ZO-1 and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (pMLC) were determined by western blotting. The stress fiber F-actin were also detected by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, endothelial permeability was determined via a transwell permeability assay.A total of 5152 proteins were found to be expressed in lung tissues from the OA-treated and saline-treated mice. Among these proteins, 849 were differentially expressed between the two groups, including 545 upregulated and 304 downregulated proteins. After AT III knockdown, the levels of inflammatory factors and endothelial permeability were elevated, the expression of ZO-1 was decreased, and the expression of F-actin and pMLC was increased. All these results illustrated that AT III knockdown exaggerated the disruption of endothelial integrity mediated by OA.These findings using iTRAQ technology demonstrate, for the first time, differences in the lung tissue expression levels of proteins between OA-treated mice and saline-treated mice.

At a transcriptional level, HtyOle inhibited the expression of inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1β. Moreover, HtyOle was identified for the first time in olive oil by-products by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.

Though its antioxidant properties have been reported in different models of acute kidney injury (AKI), the mechanism by which OA-NO attenuates intracellular oxidative stress is not well investigated.

Human tubular epithelial cells were subjected to  and glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) injury. Pretreatment with OA-NO (1.25 μM, 45 min) attenuated OGD/R triggered reactive  species (ROS) generation and subsequent mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. This action was mediated via up-regulating endogenous antioxidant defense components including superoxide dismutase (SOD1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and γ-glutamyl cysteine ligase modulatory subunits (GCLM).

Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid metabolism that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and fatty acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of , the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Further, acute secretory effects of unsaturated FAs are independent of FAO, but mediated by a FFAR1 induced increase in cellular respiration.This study demonstrates novel data supporting effects of MUFAs on the ceramide biosynthetic pathway, triglyceride storage respiration and secretion in GLP-1 secreting cells. These findings may be of value for nutritional interventions, as well as for identification of novel targets, to help preserve L-cell mass and potentiate GLP-1 secretion in diabesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The use of this effluent as a low-cost alternative cultivation medium for microalgae could represent a viable supplementary treatment. We cultivated 11 microalgae species with potential use for biodiesel production to assess their growth capacities in biodiesel industrial washing waters. Only Monoraphidium contortum, Ankistrodesmus sp., Chlorococcum sp., and one unidentified Chlorophyceae species grew effectively in that effluent. M. contortum showed the highest growth capacity and had the second highest fatty  content (267.9 mg g of DW), predominantly producing palmitic (20.9%), 7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic (14%),  (16.2%), linoleic (10.5%), and linolenic acids (23.2%). In the second phase of the experiment, the microalgae were cultivated in biodiesel wash water at 75% of its initial concentration as well as in WC (control) medium. After 21 days of cultivation, 25.8 and 7.2% of the effluent nitrate and phosphate were removed, respectively, and the chemical  demand was diminished by 31.2%.

USMAA2-4 with enhanced mechanical properties in bioreactor. The cultivations have been performed by combining  with γ-butyrolactone at different concentration ratios with 1-pentanol at a fixed concentration. The batch and fed-batch fermentations have resulted in P(3HB-co-3HV-co-4HB) with compositions of 9-35 mol% 3HV and 4-24 mol% 4HB monomers. The DO-stat fed-batch fermentation strategies have significantly improved the production with a maximum 4.4-fold increment of cell dry  (CDW). Besides, appropriate feeding of the substrates has resulted in an increment of terpolymer productivity from 0.086-0.347 g/L/h, with a significantly shortened cultivation time. The bacterial growth and terpolymer formation have been found to be affected by the concentration of carbon sources supplied. Characterization of P(3HB-co-3HV-co-4HB) has demonstrated that incorporation of 3HV and 4HB monomer has significantly improved the physical and thermodynamic properties of the polymers, by reducing the polymer's crystallinity. The tensile strength, Young's modulus of the terpolymer has been discovered to increase with the increase of M . The fed-batch fermentation strategies employed in this study have resulted in terpolymers with a range of flexible materials having improved tensile strength and Young's modulus as compared to the terpolymer produced from batch fermentation.

It is elevated in some human tumors and may be involved with mechanisms of tumor promotion. In vitro systems have shown PLA2 activity to be altered by variations in fatty  and antioxidant components. This study encompassed two objectives. First, PLA2, activity in  tumors produced using azoxymethane (AOM) in Fischer-344 rats was examined. Secondly, this study tested the effect of iron supplementation as a potential pro-oxidant in diets of varied fatty  composition on PLA2 activity. Diets included 35 or 140 mg/kg or iron in AIN-76A based diets high in corn oil, menhaden oil, or beef tallow. Results for the first objective showed PLA2 activity to be significantly higher in  tumors than in normal mucosa with the increase due primarily to an increase in activity within a particulate subcellular fraction. In the second objective, fatty  composition of  mucosa was altered by both dietary fat and iron. Animals fed beef tallow had the highest level of  and corn oil-fed animals had the highest level of linoleic . Animals fed menhaden oil had the lowest level of arachidonic  and highest level of alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids. Iron supplementation in diets high in corn oil resulted in decreased membrane composition of palmitoleic and delta-linolenic . In spite of these changes in membrane composition, there were no changes in PLA2 activity.

We investigated lipid accumulation in cultured human hepatocytes (HepG2) and rat liver after exposure to four different carbon-based particles. HepG2 cells were exposed to particles for 3h and subsequently incubated for another 18h to manifest lipid accumulation. In an animal model of metabolic syndrome we investigated the association between intake of carbon black (CB, 14nm) particles and hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and gene expression of Srebp-1, Fasn and Scd-1 involved in lipid synthesis. There was a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular lipid content after exposure to CB in HepG2 cells, which was only observed after co-exposure to /palmitic . Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells after exposure to diesel exhaust particles, fullerenes C60 or pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes. All four types of particles also generated oxidatively damaged DNA, assessed as formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) sensitive sites, in HepG2 cells after 3h exposure. The animal model of metabolic syndrome showed increased lipid load in the liver after one oral exposure to 6.4mg/kg of CB in lean Zucker rats. This was not associated with increased iNOS staining in the liver, indicating that the oral CB exposure was associated with hepatic steatosis rather than steatohepatitis. The lipid accumulation did not seem to be related to increased  because there were unaltered gene expression levels in both the HepG2 cells and rat livers. Collectively, exposure to particles is associated with oxidative stress and steatosis in hepatocytes.© 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A successful therapeutic intervention by developing a suitable drug delivery system may revolutionize treatment across BBB. Efforts were given here to unravel the capability of a newly developed fatty  combination (stearic ::palmitic  = 8.08:4.13:1) (ML) as fundamental component of nanocarrier to deliver highly water soluble zidovudine (AZT) as a model drug into brain across BBB. A comparison was made with an experimentally developed standard phospholipid-based nanocarrier containing AZT. Both the formulations had nanosize spherical unilamellar vesicular structure with highly negative zeta potential along with sustained drug release profiles. Gamma scintigraphic images showed both the radiolabeled formulations successfully crossed BBB, but longer retention in brain was observed for ML-based formulation (MGF) as compared to soya lecithin (SL)-based drug carrier (SYF). Plasma and brain pharmacokinetic data showed less clearance, prolonged residence time, more bioavailability and sustained release of AZT from MGF in rats compared to those data of the rats treated with SYF/AZT suspension. Thus, ML may be utilized to successfully develop drug nanocarrier to deliver drug into brain across BBB, in a sustained manner for a prolong period of time and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy for many diseases of brain. Further, many anti-HIV drugs cannot cross BBB sufficiently. Hence, the developed formulation may be a suitable option to carry those drugs into brain for better therapeutic management of HIV.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier function']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29474539>miR-1224-5p Enhances Hepatic  by Targeting Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase α1 in Male Mice.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs are potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases. Here, miR-1224-5p was highly expressed in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and in obese (ob/ob) mice. To examine the potential role of miR-1224-5p, we constructed liver-specific adenoviral vectors expressing either an miR-1224-5p inhibitor sequence or miR-1224-5p mimic sequences. After tail-vein vector injection, HFD-fed mice were examined for expression of lipogenic genes. We found that miR-1224-5p inhibitors significantly attenuated hepatic  and steatosis in HFD-fed mice, whereas miR-1224-5p mimicked promoted lipid accumulation in the liver of chow-fed C57BL/6 mice. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that downregulation of miR-1224-5p in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes led to a reduction of cellular triglycerides after treatment with an  and palmitic  mixture. Importantly, this study also identified adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-1224-5p. miR-1224-5p binding to the 3' untranslated region of AMPKα1 suppressed expression of the AMPKα1 protein and its downstream molecules. Metformin, an activator of AMPK, also inhibited hepatic expression of miR-1224-5p.

The rates of , lactate formation and glutamine utilization were approximately linear with time for at least 80 h of culture. 3. The rates of glucose and glutamine utilization by cultured macrophages were approx. 500 and 90 nmol/h per mg of protein respectively. This rate of glucose utilization is at least 50% greater than that previously reported for macrophages during 60 min incubation in a shaking flask; and it is now increased by addition of glutamine to the culture medium. The rate of glutamine utilization in culture is similar to that previously reported for macrophages during 60 min incubation. The major end-product of glucose metabolism is lactate, and those of glutamine metabolism are CO2, glutamate, ammonia and alanine. 4. Oleate was utilized by these cells: 14C from [14C]oleate was incorporated into CO2 and cellular lipid. The highest rate of oleate utilization was observed when both glucose and glutamine were present in the culture medium. The presence of oleate in the culture medium did not affect the rates of utilization of either glucose or glutamine. Of the [14C]oleate incorporated into lipid, approx. 80% was incorporated into triacylglycerol and only 18% into phospholipid. 5. The turnover rate for the total ATP content of the macrophage in culture is about 10 times per minute: the value for the perfused isolated maximally working rat heart is 22. This indicates a high metabolic rate for macrophages, and consequently emphasizes the importance of the provision of fuels for their function in an immune response.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459113>Preventive and curative effect of Pistacia lentiscus oil in experimental .</a></h2><p>to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of the Pistacia lentiscus oil in experimental  model. was induced in male rats by instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS) in all groups.

The aim of this study was to investigate the lipid-modifying potential of organic solvent-partitioned extracts from fruiting bodies of Amauroderma rugosum in vitro using oleate-induced human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results demonstrated that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with ethyl acetate (EA) extract greatly decreased intracellular and secreted total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) compared with other extracts. Further investigation of cellular expression of selected apolipoproteins also revealed that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with the EA extract best attenuated the apolipoprotein (Apo) profile by downregulating ApoB-100 and ApoE while upregulating ApoA1. Because both ApoB-100 and ApoE are key components of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very LDL (VLDL), which are recognized as "bad cholesterol," this result indicates that treatment with the EA extract inhibited LDL and VLDL production in oleate-induced HepG2 cells. On the other hand, increasing ApoA1 evidence shows antiatherogenic benefits to increasing ApoA1, the key component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), particularly in relation to its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport and preventing LDL oxidation; this indicates that the EA extract upregulated the production of HDL ("good cholesterol").

Such experiments are generally restricted to shorter time periods and the results may not quantitatively reflect in planta rates. These limitations can be removed by using cultured embryos, provided they mimic growth and lipid deposition observed for embryos in planta. Mid-maturation embryos from Camelina sativa were cultured in vitro to assess the use of sufficient acetate or glycerol concentrations and labeling periods for stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometric detection. Maximum incorporation of exogenous acetate into   occurred at 1mM and above. This provides about 5% of the total carbon flux entering  , enough for (13)C isotopomer analysis while maintaining normal biosynthetic rates for over 24h. Labeling analysis indicates that acetate reports lipid metabolism uniformly across the embryo. At higher acetate concentrations with longer incubations, the rate of   synthesis is reduced and the composition of newly synthesized   changes. While the mole fractions of oleate that undergo Δ12-desaturation or elongation are independent of biosynthetic flux, Δ15-desaturation shows a bimodal dependence. These observations are consistent with changes occurring in planta over seed development. Incorporation rates of the glyceryl moiety into lipids saturates at about 0.5mM exogenous glycerol. At saturation, the exogenous glycerol almost completely replaces the endogenous supply of glycerol-3-phosphate without affecting net lipid accumulation or   composition. It is concluded that acetate and glycerol labeling of cultured C. sativa embryos can provide an accurate representation of lipid metabolism in embryos in vivo, and that in Camelina embryos glycerol-3-phosphate levels do not co-limit triacylglycerol synthesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

After 28 d, compared with WD, LDL-cholesterol was reduced 15·1% (P < 0·001) with FXCO and 7·4% (P < 0·001) with HOCO. Total cholesterol (TC) was reduced 11% (P < 0·001) with FXCO and 3·5% (P = 0·002) with HOCO compared with WD. Endpoint TC differed between FXCO and HOCO (P < 0·05).

No differences were observed in inflammatory markers after the consumption of HOCO compared with WD. In conclusion, consumption of novel HOCO alone or when blended with flaxseed oil is cardioprotective through lipid-lowering effects.

The increase of intracellular Ca triggers insulin granule release, therefore several mechanisms regulate Ca efflux within the β-cells, among others, the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA). In this work, we describe that lipotoxicity mediated mainly by the saturated palmitic  (PA) (16C) is associated with loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and potentially cell viability, a phenomenon that was induced to a lesser extent by stearic (18C), myristic (14C) and lauric (12C) acids. PA was localized on endoplasmic reticulum, activating arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR), as also promoted by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxins. In particular, our findings demonstrate an alteration in PMCA1/4 expression caused by PA and LPS which trigger the UPR, affecting not only insulin release and contributing to β-cell mass reduction, but also increasing reactive nitrogen species. Nonetheless, stearic  (SA) did not show these effects. Remarkably, the proteolytic degradation of PMCA1/4 prompted by PA and LPS was avoided by the action of monounsaturated fatty acids such as  and palmitoleic .  recovered cell viability after treatment with PA/LPS and, more interestingly, relieved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. While palmitoleic  improved the insulin release, this fatty  seems to have more relevant effects upon the expression of regulatory pumps of intracellular Ca.

All rats were received mechanical ventilation immediately after model reproduction. Carotid arterial blood was collected 4 hours after model reproduction for determining the arterial partial pressure of  (PaO), and oxygenation index (PaO/FiO) was calculated. Carotid venous blood and lung tissues were harvested, and the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in serum and lung tissue were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pulmonary pathology was observed under optical microscope, and pathological score of Smith was calculated.Under optical microscope, a large number of inflammatory cells infiltration in lung tissue, obvious alveolar collapse, fibrous exudation in alveolar and alveolar hyaline were found in HCl group. In OA group, however, microvascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema were the main pathological changes, with alveolar structure being kept relatively intact. Compared with sham group, pathological score of Smith in HCl and OA groups were increased, oxygenation was lowered, and inflammatory factors levels in serum and lung tissue were increased with levels in lung tissue being higher than those in serum, without significant difference between the two models. When pretreated with penehyclidine, however, pathological injury induced by HCl or OA was alleviated, and pathological score of Smith was also decreased as compared with that of corresponding model groups (5.48±1.76 vs. 9.69±2.02, 3.97±2.14 vs. 8.71±2.18, both P < 0.05), PaO/FiO was raised significantly [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 323±55 vs. 211±27, 307±56 vs. 207±31, both P < 0.05], the inflammatory factors levels in serum and lung tissue were obviously decreased [MPO (μg/L): 11.91±1.55 vs. 14.82±1.25, 12.75±1.16 vs. 16.97±2.06 in serum, 25.80±3.36 vs. 35.18±4.01, 24.23±1.24 vs. 33.94±1.43 in lung tissue; IL-8 (ng/L): 358±30 vs. 459±25, 377±38 vs. 427±34 in serum, 736±53 vs. 866±51, 701±53 vs. 809±39 in lung tissue; NF-κB (ng/L): 483±68 vs. 632±73, 514±83 vs. 685±78 in serum, 984±75 vs. 1 217±123, 944±90 vs. 1 163±105 in lung tissue; all P < 0.05].

There was no significant difference in oxygenation and inflammatory response between the two models of rats. Pre-intraperitoneal injection of penehyclidine equally improved oxygenation state, inhibited lung inflammation response, and reduced lung injury in the two kinds of ARDS, but there was no difference in protective role between two models pretreated with penehyclidine.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845147>Dietary fatty  composition impacts plasma fatty  ethanolamide levels and  composition in golden Syrian hamsters.</a></h2><p>Fatty  ethanolamides (FAEs) are a class of lipid amides that regulate numerous pathophysiological functions. To date, pharmacological research in this area has focused on the endocannabinoid system, metabolic pathways, and biological significance of FAEs; however, limited nutritional studies have been conducted to understand the actions of FAEs on food intake and their role on overall  composition. Therefore, the present study was designed with the hypothesis that high C18:1n9 will attenuate food consumption in golden Syrian male hamsters (n = 105). Moreover, the long-term (two months) effects of feeding hamsters various dietary oil blends, namely, C+S, 25:75 corn oil:n9 safflower oil; F+S, 25:75 flaxseed oil:n6 safflower oil; H+DHA, 85:15 high  canola oil:docosahexaenoic ; H+EPA, 85:15 high  canola oil:eicosapentaenoic ; HOCO, high  canola oil; OO, olive oil; and RC, regular canola oil, on the plasma levels of seven different FAEs and fatty acids (FAs) composition were investigated. A further objective was to characterize the actions of these diets on energy expenditure and overall  composition to determine if dietary fatty  (DFA) composition affects diet-induced obesity (DIO). The results show that DFA directly influenced plasma FA and FAE levels, with marked increases (p < 0.05) observed in plasma C18:1n9 levels after HOCO and OO treatments. Correspondingly, the most elevated plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were observed with HOCO and OO treatments, which also decreased (p < 0.05) food intake by ∼8% when compared with H+EPA dietary treatment when measured at the endpoint. Diminished food intake subsequent to HOCO and OO feeding may have resulted from increased OEA concentrations, demonstrating the anorexic properties of the high C18:1n9 dietary components. No differences were observed across OO, HOCO, and HOCO diets with omega-3 FA blends in terms of  composition, energy expenditure, plasma C18:1n9 levels, or OEA concentrations. Based on these findings, we conclude that the addition of HOCO to diets aids in the reduction of food intake, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy .</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'obesity', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16132689>Effect of Sargassum polycystum (Phaeophyceae)-sulphated polysaccharide extract against acetaminophen-induced  during toxic hepatitis in experimental rats.</a></h2><p>The effect of Sargassum polycystum crude extract on lipid metabolism was examined against acetaminophen-induced (800 mg/kg body wt., intraperitoneally)  during toxic hepatitis in experimental rats. The animals intoxicated with acetaminophen showed significant elevation in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty  in both serum and liver tissue. The levels of tissue total lipids and serum LDL-cholesterol were also elevated with depleted levels of serum HDL-cholesterol and tissue phospholipid. The acetaminophen-induced animals showed significant alterations in the activities of lipid metabolizing enzymes serum lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL). The levels of liver tissue fatty acids (saturated, mono and polyunsaturated) such as palmitic , stearic , , linoleic , arachidonic  and linolenic  monitored by gas chromatography were considerably altered in acetaminophen intoxicated animals when compared with control animals. The prior oral administration of Sargassum polycystum (200 mg/kg body wt./day for a period of 15 days) crude extract showed considerable prevention in the severe disturbances of lipid profile and metabolizing enzymes triggered by acetaminophen during hepatic injury. Liver histology also showed convincing supportive evidence regarding their protective nature against fatty changes induced during acetaminophen intoxication.

Such increased plasma NEFA concentrations induce changes in the microenvironment of the ovarian follicle, which can compromise oocyte competence. Exposing oocytes to elevated NEFA concentrations during maturation affects the gene expression and phenotype of the subsequent embryo, notably prompting a disrupted oxidative metabolism. We hypothesized that these changes in the embryo are a consequence of modified energy metabolism in the oocyte. To investigate this, bovine cumulus oocyte complexes were matured under elevated NEFA conditions, and energy metabolism-related gene expression, mitochondrial function, and ultrastructure evaluated. It was found that expression of genes related to REDOX maintenance was modified in NEFA-exposed oocytes, cumulus cells, and resultant blastocysts. Moreover, the expression of genes related to fatty  synthesis in embryos that developed from NEFA-exposed oocytes was upregulated. From a functional perspective, inhibition of fatty  β-oxidation in maturing oocytes exposed to elevated NEFA concentrations restored developmental competence. There were no clear differences in mitochondrial morphology or oxygen consumption between treatments, although there was a trend for a higher mitochondrial membrane potential in zygotes derived from NEFA-exposed oocytes. These data show that the degree of mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation has a decisive impact on the development of NEFA-exposed oocytes. Furthermore, the gene expression data suggest that the resulting embryos adapt through altered metabolic strategies, which might explain the aberrant energy metabolism previously observed in these embryos originating from NEFA-exposed maturing oocytes.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528831>Activation of AMPK Stimulates Neurotensin Secretion in Neuroendocrine Cells.</a></h2><p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical fuel-sensing enzyme, regulates the metabolic effects of various hormones. Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-amino  peptide predominantly localized in enteroendocrine cells of the small bowel and released by fat ingestion. Increased fasting plasma levels of pro-NT (a stable NT precursor fragment produced in equimolar amounts relative to NT) are associated with an increased risk of , cardiovascular disease, and mortality; however, the mechanisms regulating NT release are not fully defined. We previously reported that inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) increases NT secretion and gene expression through activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Here, we show that activation of AMPK increases NT secretion from endocrine cell lines (BON and QGP-1) and isolated mouse crypt cells enriched for NT-positive cells. In addition, plasma levels of NT increase in mice treated with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside, a pharmacologic AMPK activator. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of AMPKα decrease, whereas overexpression of the subunit significantly enhances, NT secretion from BON cells treated with AMPK activators or . Similarly, small interfering RNA knockdown of the upstream AMPK kinases, liver kinase B1 and Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, also attenuate NT release and AMPK phosphorylation. Moreover, AMPK activation increases NT secretion through inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Together, our findings show that AMPK activation enhances NT release through inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, thus demonstrating an important cross talk regulation for NT secretion.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877687>Ligand-Asymmetric Janus Quantum Dots for Efficient Blue-Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes.</a></h2><p>We present ligand-asymmetric Janus quantum dots (QDs) to improve the device performance of quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs).

Antioxidants inhibited this response, implicating a role for oxidative stress and NF-kappaB, a transcription factor for IL-8 that is activated by oxidative stress. In this study, we examined two mechanisms whereby LA, the dietary precursor for arachidonic  (AA), could increase the production of IL-8 via activation of AA pathways: 1) by generation of reactive oxygen species by the AA-pathway enzymes to activate NF-kappaB or 2) by AA metabolites. Normal and Crohn's HISM cells were exposed to LA, oxidizing solution (Ox), or oxidizing solution enriched with LA (OxLA). Exposure of cells to Ox or OxLA induced oxidative stress as determined by thiobarbituric  reactive substances. In normal cells, Ox but not LA activated NF-kappaB as determined by transfection experiments and Western blot. In Crohn's cells, NF-kappaB was spontaneously activated and was not further activated by Ox or LA. In contrast, TNF-alpha markedly increased activation of NF-kappaB in both normal and Crohn's cells. These results indicated that LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, so we evaluated the second mechanism of an effect of AA metabolites. In normal cells, OxLA, but not LA, markedly stimulated IL-8, whereas in Crohn's cells, both OxLA and LA stimulated IL-8. OxLA, also stimulated production of AA metabolites leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), PGE(2), and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) by normal and Crohn's cells. To determine whether AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response, cells were treated with OxLA plus indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Both Indo and NDGA blocked the IL-8 response to OxLA. To determine more specifically a role for AA metabolites, AA was used. Similar to OxLA, OxAA stimulated production of IL-8 and AA metabolites. Pinane thromboxane, a selective thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor blocker, inhibited OxAA stimulation of TXB(2) and IL-8 in a dose-response manner. MK886, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, inhibited OxAA stimulation of LTB(4) and IL-8 also in a dose-response manner. Analysis of specific gene products by RT-PCR demonstrated that HISM cells expressed receptors for both thromboxane and LTB(4). We conclude that AA metabolites mediated the IL-8 response to LA in HISM cells. Both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways were involved. LA did not increase IL-8 by activating NF-kappaB, but NF-kappaB appeared to be involved, because LA increased IL-8 only in situations where NF-kappaB was activated, either spontaneously in Crohn's cells or by Ox in normal cells. We speculate that AA metabolites increased IL-8 production by enhancing NF-kappaB-dependent transcription of IL-8.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammatory bowel disease']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27340432>Enhanced lipid production by Rhodosporidium toruloides using different fed-batch feeding strategies with lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the sole carbon source.</a></h2><p>Industrial biotechnology that is able to provide environmentally friendly bio-based products has attracted more attention in replacing petroleum-based industries. Currently, most of the carbon sources used for fermentation-based bioprocesses are obtained from agricultural commodities that are used as foodstuff for human beings. Lignocellulose-derived sugars as the non-food, green, and sustainable alternative carbon sources have great potential to avoid this dilemma for producing the renewable, bio-based hydrocarbon fuel precursors, such as microbial lipid. Efficient bioconversion of lignocellulose-based sugars into lipids is one of the critical parameters for industrial application. Therefore, the fed-batch cultivation, which is a common method used in industrial applications, was investigated to achieve a high cell density culture along with high lipid yield and productivity.In this study, several fed-batch strategies were explored to improve lipid production using lignocellulosic hydrolysates derived from corn stover. Compared to the batch culture giving a lipid yield of 0.19 g/g, the dissolved--stat feeding mode increased the lipid yield to 0.23 g/g and the lipid productivity to 0.33 g/L/h. The pulse feeding mode further improved lipid productivity to 0.35 g/L/h and the yield to 0.24 g/g. However, the highest lipid yield (0.29 g/g) and productivity (0.4 g/L/h) were achieved using an automated online sugar control feeding mode, which gave a dry cell weight of 54 g/L and lipid content of 59 % (w/w). The major fatty acids of the lipid derived from lignocellulosic hydrolysates were predominately palmitic  and , which are similar to those of conventional oilseed plants.Our results suggest that the fed-batch feeding strategy can strongly influence the lipid production.

Different tissues undergo gene expression changes in keeping with their specialized functions and driven by tissue specific transcriptional pathways. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are lipid-activated nuclear receptors that regulate metabolic pathways involved in lipid and glucose utilization or storage in mammals. To examine whether PPARs might mediate fatty  activation of metabolic gene programs that would be relevant during pre-migratory fattening, we used gray catbird as the focal species. PPAR isoforms cloned from catbird share high amino  identity with mammalian homologs (% vs human): gcPPARα (88.1%), gcPPARδ (87.3%), gcPPARγ (91.2%). We tested whether gcPPARs activated fatty  (FA) utilization genes using Lpl and Cpt1b gene promoter-luciferase reporters in mammalian cell lines. In C2C12 mouse myocytes gcPPARα was broadly activated by the saturated and unsaturated FAs tested; while gcPPARδ showed highest activation by the mono-unsaturated FA, 18:1  (+80%). In CV-1 monkey kidney cells gcPPARγ responded to the poly-unsaturated fatty , 20:5 eicosapentaenoic  (+60%). Moreover, in agreement with their structural conservation, gcPPARs were activated by isoform selective synthetic agonists similar to the respective mammalian isoform. Adenoviral mediated over-expression of PPARα in C2C12 myocytes induced expression of genes involved in fatty  transport, including Cd36/Fat, as well as Cpt1b, which mediates a key rate limiting step of mitochondrial β-oxidation. These gene expression changes correlated with increased lipid droplet accumulation in C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes and enhanced β-oxidation in myotubes. Collectively, the data predict that the PPARs play a conserved role in gray catbirds to regulate lipid metabolism in target tissues that undergo metabolic remodeling throughout the annual migratory cycle.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The isoprenoid farnesol (FOH) modulates  and reduces hepatic TG content in rodents. This effect involves activation of at least two nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor. We evaluated the effects of FOH (100 μM) in a cellular model of human hepatic steatosis by loading hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells with  (OA, 0.66 mM). FOH treatment decreased OA-induced TG accumulation by ~25%. Using PCR arrays, we found that FOH treatment modulated the mRNA levels of several -metabolizing enzymes, both alone and when cells were loaded with OA. While FOH activated PPARα and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), most of the FOH-mediated effects on -metabolizing genes could be attributed to activation of PPARα. In OA-loaded HepaRG cells, FOH increased fatty  oxidation, which was accompanied by up-regulation of PPARα target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, including hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2. These effects on gene expression were lost when the cells were co-treated with the PPARα antagonist, GW6471. OA treatment alone decreased the mRNA levels of the drug-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, 2B6, and 3A4, and increased CYP2E1 expression, all of which were attenuated by FOH co-treatment. These findings show that FOH treatment increases fatty  oxidation and decreases TG accumulation in steatotic HepaRG cells, which is likely attributable to PPARα-mediated induction of mitochondrial fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The animals were divided into four groups (n = 6 each): control/water; control/tucumã oil; diabetic/water; diabetic/tucumã oil treated for 14 days with 5.0 mL kg via oral gavage. Gas chromatograph characterization demonstrated that /elaidic fatty  is the most abundant component present in this oil, followed by palmitic and stearic fatty acids. Our results demonstrated an increase (p < 0.05) in water and food intake, blood glucose, thiobarbituric  reactive species (TBARS) levels, damage index, and frequency of damage; conversely body weight, insulin levels, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and cell viability were decreased in the diabetic/water group compared to the control/water group. The treatment with tucumã oil prevented these alterations in the diabetic/tucumã oil group compared to the diabetic/water group, and restored these parameters near to the control/water group. In summary, our findings demonstrated that treatment with tucumã oil causes a hypoglycemic effect improving insulin levels and antioxidant/oxidant status, and has a protector effect against pancreatic damage induced by oxidative stress in alloxan-induced diabetic mice.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor whose activation results in the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been reported that TLR4 is upregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH. This study aimed to examine the changes of TLR4 and its signaling pathways in sophocarpine's anti-inflammatory process on experimental NASH in vitro.Primary hepatocytes were isolated, and -induced steatosis model was established. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect the number of metabolically active  and viable cells. Immunocytochemistry analysis was applied to evaluating pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis. Total RNA and protein were extracted for real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot detection.Enhanced expression of TLR4 was observed in -induced steatotic hepatocytes. Sophocarpine suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis and reduced the expression of TLR4 in steatotic hepatocytes. Expression of TLR4 and pro-inflammatory cytokines recovered after sophocarpine was removed. Moreover, sophocarpine restrained the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathways in the anti-inflammatory process.Sophocarpine could decrease the expression of TLR4 in steatotic hepatocytes and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis. NF-κB, JNK, and ERK signaling pathways were important workable downstream pathways.© 2014 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['NASH', 'mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8314859> supplementation reduces oxidant-mediated dysfunction of cultured porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that supplementing cultured porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) with exogenous  (18:1 omega 9) alters the fatty  composition of the cells and reduces oxidant-mediated cytotoxicity. Because the mechanisms by which lipid alterations modulate oxidant susceptibility have not been defined, the ability of 18:1 to reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated PAEC dysfunction was evaluated. PAEC monolayers on polycarbonate filters were incubated for 3 h in maintenance medium supplemented with either 0.1 mM 18.1 in ethanol vehicle (ETOH) or with an equivalent volume of vehicle alone. Twenty-four hours later monolayers were treated for 30 min with 50 or 100 microM H2O2 in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) or with HBSS alone (nonoxidant control). As a functional index of PAEC monolayer , the permeability of monolayers to albumin was then measured for 3 h. Treatment with 100 microM H2O2 caused cytotoxicity and progressive increases in PAEC monolayer permeability that were attenuated by 18:1 supplementation, whereas 50 microM H2O2 caused only a transient increase in permeability without cytotoxicity. Supplementation with 18:1 also attenuated H2O2-induced reductions in PAEC adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and disruption of PAEC microfilament architecture. The ATP content of PAEC monolayers was reversibly reduced in the absence of oxidant stress by incubation with glucose-depleted medium containing deoxyglucose and antimycin A. Metabolic inhibitor-induced ATP depletion increased monolayer permeability and altered cytoskeletal architecture, alterations that resolved during recovery of PAEC ATP content. These results demonstrate that ATP depletion plays a critical role in  dysfunction and suggests that the ability of 18:1 to reduce oxidant-mediated PAEC dysfunction and injury may relate directly to its ability to preserve PAEC ATP content.</p><p>Keyword:['barrier intergrity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10423617>Effect of probucol therapy on plasma fatty  composition during postprandial lipemia in hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of probucol (PR) on fatty  composition of plasma lipids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia during the fasting and postprandial states.Open-label, single-center, 6-week treatment, baseline-controlled trial.Outpatient clinical research center.Six patients with established hypertriglyceridemia and no complicating medical conditions.Step 1 American Heart Association diet and no lipid-lowering medications for at least 4 weeks.

ApoC111 ratio (heparin-treated plasma versus precipitate) was decreased in the fasting state. (2) The saturated/unsaturated (S/U) fatty  ratios in the PL, TG, and CE fractions were elevated postprandially and increased in CE in the fasting state. In the PL fraction it was due to an increase in the percentage of myristic, palmitic, stearic, and  acids and a decrease in linolenic, eicosatrienoic, and arachidonic acids. In the TG and CE fractions the changes were not due to any particular patterns of fatty acids. The ratio of arachidonic/eicosatrienoic  was decreased postprandially in PL and CE fractions. The ratio of eicosatrienoic/linoleic  was decreased in PL and increased in CE fractions. (3) The S/U ratio in the lipoprotein (Lp) B and LP(a) lipid components decreased in PL and CE. Lp(a) was more saturated with respect to fatty acids than LpB.PR treatment for 6 weeks increased postprandial S/U fatty  ratios. This was due to a combination of an increase in saturated and monounsaturated levels and a decrease in polyunsaturated levels. The effect was most notable in the PL fraction. In those systems dependent on the pattern of fatty acids, the fatty  compositional change could modify biological responses in clinically important ways during lipid-lowering therapy. The change toward saturation of fatty acids in the postprandial state may contribute to the antioxidant properties of probucol.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6595440>Large intestinal carcinogenesis.

No evidence of benign polyp was seen, and the carcinomas in this model did arise directly from the flat mucosa. In marked contrast to the standard dose (8 mg/kg/wk) studies, low-dose AOM carcinogenesis yielded the following unusual features: a) There was a very high incidence of readily metastasizing mucinous adenocarcinomas that were extremely aggressive and easily transplantable; b) the carcinomas, microscopic and macroscopic, were localized predominantly in the proximal large intestine; c) foci of atypical early neoplastic (or so-called dysplastic) crypts as well as early carcinomas were frequently associated with the lymphoid aggregates in the intestinal wall; d) Paneth cells were commonly seen to be associated with these atypical crypts and/or early carcinomas associated with the lymphoid aggregates; and e) there was a virtual lack of the dilated, distorted, or hyperdistended crypts in noncarcinomatous epithelia.

The VLDL lipoproteins, which are the main TAG carrier, are precursors of atherogenic LDL and their increased concentration is related to the decrease of antiatherogenic HDL, increased ratio of small, dense LDL and represents one of the causes of the endothelial dysfunction. According to some authors, HTAG is one of the factors of the oxidation stress.45 patients of the studied group received 200 mg of micronized fenofibrate per day for six weeks. Before the beginning and after the end of treatment, following examinations were carried out: concentration of plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins, composition of fatty acids (FA) in main lipid plasma classes and LDL (phosphatidylcholine--PC, TAG, cholesteryl esters--CE) and lipoperoxidation in VLDL and LDL, isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation.In plasma, the treatment of HTAG led to a significant decrease of TC, TAG and apo-B concentration and to the increase of cholesterol concentration in HDL and in both HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions. In isolated LDL particles we observed a decrease of the TAG portion (by 25%) together with significant lag phase prolongation (by 33%, P < 0.05) and peak time retardation (by 24%, P < 0.05). In VLDL particles the concentration of cholesterol became smaller (by 28%), TAG (by 26%), phospholipids (by 28%) (in all groups P < 0.005) and the lag phase became significantly longer (by 16%, P < 0.01). Treatment with fenofibrate significantly reduced the linoleic  (18:2n-6) in PC and TAG plasma, CE and TG LDL, in a higher ratio of palmitoleic  (16:1n-7) in CE LDL,  (18:1n-9) in PC LDL, in significant concentration of total monoenic FA in PC and CE LDL and to a significant increase of the concentration of myristic  (14:0) in CE and myristic and stearic acids (18:0) in TAG LDL. From our results it is possible to conclude that the six-week long treatment of HTAG with micronized phenofibrate led to significant modification of LDL and VLDL composition accompanied by their lower lipoperoxidation indexes. These favourable changes in oxidability were accompanied with changes in the composition of FA in CE, TAG and PC plasma as well as LDL.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617992>Characterization of French Coriander Oil as Source of Petroselinic .</a></h2><p>Coriander vegetable oil was extracted from fruits of French origin in a 23% yield.

It is a rich source of petroselinic  (C18:1n-12), an important renewable building block, making up 73% of all  , with also significant amounts of linoleic  (14%),  (6%), and palmitic  (3%). The oil was characterized by a high unsaponifiable fraction, comprising a substantial amount of phytosterols (6.70 g/kg). The main sterol markers were β-sitosterol (35% of total sterols), stigmasterol (24%), and Δ⁷-stigmastenol (18%). Squalene was detected at an amount of 0.2 g/kg. A considerable amount of tocols were identified (500 mg/kg) and consisted mainly of tocotrienols, with γ-tocotrienol as the major compound. The phospholipid content was low at 0.3%, of which the main phospholipid classes were phosphatidic  (33%), phosphatidylcholine (25%), phosphatidylinositol (17%), and phosphatidylethanolamine (17%). About 50% of all phospholipids were non-hydratable. The β-carotene content was low at 10 mg/kg, while a significant amount of chlorophyll was detected at about 11 mg/kg. An iron content of 1.4 mg/kg was determined through element analysis of the vegetable oil.

Examination of whole cells of B(16) for their ability to oxidize various substrates revealed that oleate significantly stimulated oxygen uptake. The respiratory quotient of 0.7 implied that oleate was degraded to carbon dioxide and water. Other substrates, such as carbohydrates, alcohols, intermediates of the citric  cycle, and short-chain acids, including selected amino acids, did not stimulate endogenous respiration of whole cells. No oxygen uptake could be measured when cell-free extracts were tested with the substrates used with whole cells. Enzymatic analyses of cell-free extracts of the three strains demonstrated enzymes of the citric  cycle, enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose pathways, and the general acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase required for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Strain B(16) and the two pathogenic serotypes appeared to possess similar metabolic capabilities. Enzymatic data might also explain the apparent inability of B(16) to oxidize other substrates; kinases necessary for activation of common nonphosphorylated compounds were not detected in leptospiral extracts.

Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive  species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

To determine whether fatty acids released from lipoproteins by macrophage lipoprotein lipase (LPL) could substitute for glucose as a source of energy for phagocytosis, we cultured peritoneal macrophages from normal and LPL knockout (LPL-KO) mice that had been rescued from neonatal demise by expression of human LPL via the muscle creatine kinase promoter. Normal and LPL-KO macrophages were cultured in medium containing normal (5 mM) or low (1 mM) glucose, and were tested for their capacity to phagocytose IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes. LPL-KO macrophages maintained in 1 and 5 mM glucose phagocytosed 67 and 79% fewer IgG-opsonized erythrocytes, respectively, than macrophages from normal mice. Addition of VLDL to LPL-expressing macrophages maintained in 1 mM glucose enhanced the macrophages' phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes, but did not stimulate phagocytosis by LPL-KO macrophages. Inhibition of secreted LPL with a monoclonal anti-LPL antibody or with tetrahydrolipstatin blocked the ability of VLDL to enhance phagocytosis by LPL-expressing macrophages maintained in 1 mM glucose. Addition of  significantly enhanced phagocytosis by both LPL-expressing and LPL-KO macrophages maintained in 1 mM glucose.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis of acetyl LDL by macrophages from LPL-expressing and LPL-KO mice was similar whether the cells were maintained in 5 or 1 mM glucose, and was not augmented by VLDL.

Intracellular lipid content was determined in HepG2 cells after siRNA-mediated knockdown of PNPLA3.In vivo, mice fed a high-carbohydrate (HC) liquid diet had elevated hepatic lipid content, and PNPLA3 mRNA and protein expression, compared to chow-fed mice. Elevated expression was completely abrogated by addition of unsaturated lipid emulsion to the HC diet. By contrast, in mice with high-fat diet-induced steatosis, Pnpla3 expression did not differ compared to low-fat fed mice. In HepG2 cells, Pnpla3 expression was reversibly suppressed by glucose depletion and increased by glucose refeeding, but unchanged by addition of insulin and glucagon. Several unsaturated fatty acids each significantly decreased Pnpla3 mRNA, similar to lipid emulsion in vivo. However, Pnpla3 knockdown in HepG2 cells did not alter total lipid content in high glucose- or -treated cells.Our results provide evidence that PNPLA3 expression is an early signal/signature of carbohydrate-induced , but its expression is not associated with steatosis per se.

The main objective of this study was to determine the cholesteryl ester transfer CETP activity and its association with the lipoprotein neutral lipid composition in patients with either liver cirrhosis or cholestasis, as compared to normal controls. Lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation, lipids and apolipoproteins were measured by conventional methods, and the fatty  composition was established by gas chromatography; CETP activity in lipoprotein-deficient plasma was measured by determining the transfer of [3H]cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL. Lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities were measured in post-heparin plasma by radiochemical methods. In patients with liver cirrhosis, low levels of VLDL, HDL, apo B, and Lp(a) were observed, as well as a change in the composition of HDL particles, with increases in the relative proportion of triglyceride and free cholesterol. Respectively, the last two changes could be attributed in part to the low hepatic lipase activity observed in this study, and to the low lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity previously observed by others. In patients with cholestasis, a moderate  due to the elevation of LDL was found. In contrast, HDL and apo A-I levels were very low reflecting a low number of HDL particles, which also had altered compositions with increases in the triglyceride and free cholesterol contents relative to apo A-I and esterified cholesterol, respectively. As regards the fatty  composition of lipoprotein lipids, the two groups of patients showed, in general, a lower proportion of linoleic  and a compensating higher proportion of  as compared to the controls, changes that were observed in both cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. In contrast, the proportions of  and palmitoleic acids in phospholipids were increased, whereas that of stearic  was decreased in patients as compared to controls. In patients with liver cirrhosis, as well as in controls, no changes were observed in the fatty  compositions of cholesteryl ester, triglycerides, or phospholipids among the different lipoproteins, which probably reflects the equilibration reached by the action of CETP. In patients with cholestasis, no differences were observed in fatty  composition among the lipoprotein phospholipids but, interestingly, cholesteryl esters from VLDL had a significantly lower linoleic  content than those from HDL, whereas triglycerides from VLDL had significantly higher  and lower linoleic  contents than those from HDL. This distinct fatty  composition of the neutral lipids between lipoproteins was associated with a significant decrease (25%) in the cholesteryl ester transfer activity in patients with cholestasis. We suggest that fat malabsorption due to the biliary defect may induce a decrease in cholesteryl ester transfer protein synthesis or section, which in turn would slow the equilibration of the neutral lipids among plasma lipoproteins.</p><p>Keyword:['hyperlipedemia']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8988911>Comparison of the effects of medium-chain triacylglycerols, palm oil, and high  sunflower oil on plasma triacylglycerol fatty acids and lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in humans.</a></h2><p>Although medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs, composed of medium-chain fatty acids 8:0 and 10:0) have long been described as having neutral effects on serum cholesterol concentrations, experimental evidence supporting this claim is limited. In a randomized, crossover, metabolic-ward study, we compared the lipid effects of a natural food diet supplemented with either MCTs, palm oil, or high  sunflower oil in nine middle-aged men with mild hypercholesterolemia. Rather than having a neutral effect, MCT oil produced total cholesterol concentrations that were not significantly different from those produced by palm oil (MCT oil: 5.87 +/- 0.75 mmol/L; palm oil: 5.79 +/- 0.72 mmol/L) but significantly higher than that produced by high  sunflower oil (5.22 +/- 0.52 mmol/L). Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations paralleled those of total cholesterol.

Cells were exposed to 0.5mM of palmitate and to increasing doses of oleate (0.05, 0.25 and 0.5mM). Impacts of FA treatments on radio-labelled FA fluxes, on cellular content in diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), ceramides, acylcarnitines, on PKCθ, MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38) and NF-ΚB activation, and on -dependent Akt phosphorylation were examined. Low dose of oleate (0.05mM) was sufficient to improve palmitate complete oxidation to CO (+29%, P<0.05) and to alter the cellular acylcarnitine profile. -induced Akt phosphorylation was 48% higher in that condition vs. palmitate alone (p<0.01). Although DAG and ceramide contents were significantly decreased with 0.05mM of oleate vs. palmitate alone (-47 and -28%, respectively, p<0.01), 0.25mM of oleate was required to decrease p38 MAPK and PKCθ phosphorylation, thus further improving the  signaling (+32%, p<0.05). By contrast, increasing oleate concentration from 0.25 to 0.5mM, thus increasing total amount of FA from 0.75 to 1mM, deteriorated the  signaling pathway (-30%, p<0.01). This was observed despite low contents in DAG and ceramides, and enhanced palmitate incorporation into TAG (+27%, p<0.05). This was associated with increased incomplete FA β-oxidation and impairment of acylcarnitine profile. In conclusion, these combined data place mitochondrial β-oxidation at the center of the regulation of muscle  sensitivity, besides p38 MAPK and PKCθ.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Differential tape stripping was performed, followed by cyanoacrylate skin surface biopsies to determine the amount of caffeine in the hair follicles, and skin extraction to determine the retention of caffeine in the skin.Nanoemulsions significantly increased caffeine permeation through open and untreated skin over control (untreated: 36- and 42-fold for OA and EU, respectively; open: 40- and 49-fold). The follicular route contributed 53.7% of caffeine permeation for the OA nanoemulsion and 51% for EU when follicles were opened. Nanoemulsions promoted 4- and 3.4-fold increases in caffeine retention in open follicles, for OA and EU, respectively. Retention of caffeine in the stratum corneum and skin was almost equal in all cases.This study demonstrated effective delivery of caffeine as a hydrophilic model drug into and through hair follicles and showed that follicles and surrounding regions may be targeted by optimised formulations for specific treatments.© 2018 S.

However, the role of LDs in fish immunity remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous lipid mix (LM;  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]:linolenic  [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA, arachidonic  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We observed that Corynebacterium spp. are overrepresented in children free of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a common pediatric nasal colonizer and an important infectious agent. Corynebacterium accolens, a benign lipid-requiring species, inhibits pneumococcal growth during in vitro cocultivation on medium supplemented with human skin surface triacylglycerols (TAGs) that are likely present in the nostrils. This inhibition depends on LipS1, a TAG lipase necessary for C. accolens growth on TAGs such as triolein. We determined that C. accolens hydrolysis of triolein releases , which inhibits pneumococcus, as do other free fatty acids (FFAs) that might be released by LipS1 from human skin surface TAGs. Our results support a model in which C. accolens hydrolyzes skin surface TAGS in vivo releasing antipneumococcal FFAs. These data indicate that C. accolens may play a beneficial role in sculpting the human microbiome.Little is known about how harmless Corynebacterium species that colonize the human nose and skin might impact pathogen colonization and proliferation at these sites. We show that Corynebacterium accolens, a common benign nasal bacterium, modifies its local habitat in vitro as it inhibits growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae by releasing antibacterial free fatty acids from host skin surface triacylglycerols. We further identify the primary C. accolens lipase required for this activity. We postulate a model in which higher numbers of C. accolens cells deter/limit S. pneumoniae nostril colonization, which might partly explain why children without S. pneumoniae colonization have higher levels of nasal Corynebacterium. This work narrows the gap between descriptive studies and the needed in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microbe-microbe interactions that help shape the human microbiome. It also lays the foundation for future in vivo studies to determine whether habitat modification by C. accolens could be promoted to control pathogen colonization.Copyright © 2016 Bomar et al.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization', 'immunity', 'microbiome', 'microbiota']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27922115>Perilipin 5 fine-tunes lipid oxidation to metabolic demand and protects against lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplets (LD) play a central role in lipid homeostasis by controlling transient fatty  (FA) storage and release from triacylglycerols stores, while preventing high levels of cellular toxic lipids. This crucial function in oxidative tissues is altered in  and type 2 diabetes. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is a LD protein whose mechanistic and causal link with lipotoxicity and insulin resistance has raised controversies. We investigated here the physiological role of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle upon various metabolic challenges. We show that PLIN5 protein is elevated in endurance-trained (ET) subjects and correlates with muscle oxidative capacity and whole-body insulin sensitivity. When overexpressed in human skeletal muscle cells to recapitulate the ET phenotype, PLIN5 diminishes lipolysis and FA oxidation under basal condition, but paradoxically enhances FA oxidation during forskolin- and contraction- mediated lipolysis. Moreover, PLIN5 partly protects muscle cells against lipid-induced lipotoxicity. In addition, we demonstrate that down-regulation of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle inhibits insulin-mediated glucose uptake under normal chow feeding condition, while paradoxically improving insulin sensitivity upon high-fat feeding. These data highlight a key role of PLIN5 in LD function, first by finely adjusting LD FA supply to mitochondrial oxidation, and second acting as a protective factor against lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'insulin resistance', 'mitochondria', 'obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143381>[The profile of plasma non-esterified fatty acids in children with different terms of type 1 ].</a></h2><p>Composition and quantitative content of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were investigated in plasma samples of healthy children (12) and children with type 1  (DM1) (31) by gas chromatography (GC) after preliminary NEFA solid-phase extraction from plasma lipids.

Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are involved in this pathogenesis as they jeopardize oocyte and embryo development. Growing evidence indicates that maternal metabolic disorders can disturb epigenetic programming, such as DNA methylation, in the offspring. Oocyte maturation and early embryo development coincide with methylation changes and both are sensitive to adverse environments. Therefore, we investigated whether elevated NEFA concentrations affect establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in oocytes and embryos, subsequently altering transcriptomic profiles and developmental competence of resultant blastocysts.Bovine oocytes and embryos were exposed to different NEFA concentrations in separate experiments. In the first experiment, oocytes were matured in vitro for 24 h in medium containing: 1) physiological ("BASAL") concentrations of  (OA), palmitic (PA) and stearic (SA)  or 2) pathophysiological ("HIGH COMBI") concentrations of OA, PA and SA. In the second experiment, zygotes were cultivated in vitro for 6.5 days under BASAL or HIGH COMBI conditions. Developmental competence was evaluated by assessing cleavage and blastocyst rate. Overall gene expression and DNA methylation of resultant blastocysts were analyzed using microarray. DNA methylation data were re-evaluated by pyrosequencing. HIGH COMBI-exposed oocytes and embryos displayed a lower competence to develop into blastocysts compared to BASAL-exposed counterparts (19.3% compared to 23.2% and 18.2% compared to 25.3%, respectively) (P < 0.05). HIGH COMBI-exposed oocytes and embryos resulted in blastocysts with altered DNA methylation and transcriptomic fingerprints, compared to BASAL-exposed counterparts. Differences in gene expression and methylation were more pronounced after exposure during culture compared to maturation suggesting that zygotes are more susceptible to adverse environments. Main gene networks affected were related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cell death, immune response and metabolic disorders.Overall, high variation in methylation between blastocysts made it difficult to draw conclusions concerning methylation of individual genes, although a clear overview of affected pathways was obtained.

Among them, 7 proteins (Hmgcs2, Fabp2, Hp, B4galnt2, B3gnt6, Sap and Ca1) were proposed to be the common targeting protein group (TPG) of CMP33 and drug SASP. Particularly, some targeting proteins were CMP33-dose-specific: high-dose-specific TPG (Mtco3, Gal-6, Mptx, S100 g and Hpx) and low-dose-specific TPG (Zg16, Hexb, Insl5, Cept1, Hspb6 and Ifi27l2b), suggesting the complex acting mechanism of CMP33. GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics revealed that  and dihydrotestosterone could be the common targets of CMP33 and SASP. By integrative analysis of proteomics and metabolomics, key protein-metabolite pathways (PMP) were identified, PMP for high-dose: 2-hydroxybutyric  - (GPT, GGH) - glutathione - ALB - testosterone - TTR - dihydrotestosterone; PMP for low-dose: (PYY, FABP2, HMGCS2) -  - TTR - dihydrotestosterone.

As-prepared as well as annealed samples were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. CoNi alloys were found to be capped with -oleylamine complex even after heat treatment up to 400 °BC. XRD patterns confirm that the CoNi alloys crystallize in pure fcc phase with average crystallite sizes in the range of 8–11 nm. TEM micrographs confirm nearly spherical morphologies with narrow particle size distribution of the synthesized CoNi alloys. Average TEM particle sizes range from 7 nm to 12 nm. As-prepared as well as annealed CoNi alloys are ferromagnetic in nature at 298 K. M s values for annealed CoNi alloys are found to be in the range of 25–59.6 emu/g after correction for  fraction of capped matrix and H c values are in the range of 52–314 Oe. Observed magnetic properties have been interpreted on the basis of size effects, altered crystal anisotropies and spin canting on the surface. FC/ZFC magnetization measurements show magnetic irreversibility and superparamagnetic blocking of nanoparticles due to strong dipolar interactions and particle size distribution.

Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) identified a total of seven markers significantly associated with five seed quality traits in two experiments. To further identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for important agronomic and seed quality traits, we phenotyped a doubled haploid (DH) mapping population derived from the "YW" cross between two parents (Y-BcDH64 and W-BcDH76) representing from the two subpopulations. The YW DH population and its parents were grown in three contrasting environments; spring (Hezheng and Xining, China), semi-winter (Wuhan, China), and spring (Wagga Wagga, Australia) across 5 years for QTL mapping. Genetic bases of phenotypic variation in seed yield and its seven related traits, and six seed quality traits were determined. A total of 282 consensus QTL accounting for these traits were identified including nine major QTL for flowering time, , linolenic , pod number of main inflorescence, and seed . Of these, 109 and 134 QTL were specific to spring and semi-winter environment, respectively, while 39 consensus QTL were identified in both contrasting environments.

Male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were fed: standard diet (control, n = 8) and a sucrose rich diet (30% sucrose in water/12 weeks, SRD; n = 24). Simultaneously, SRD was subdivided into SRD-C (standard diet), and three other groups supplemented (15% w/w) with: fish oil (SRD-n3), sunflower oil (SRD-n6) and high  sunflower oil (SRD-n9). Lipid profile, free fatty acids, glucose, and insulin were measured. Isolated VLDL (d < 1.006 g ml) was characterized by chemical composition and size (size exclusion-HPLC). In comparison with SRD-C: SRD-n3 showed an improved lipoprotein profile (p < 0.01), with lower levels of insulin and HOMA-IR (p < 0.05). SRD-n6 showed increased levels of HDL-cholesterol and lower insulin levels. SRD-n9 did not exhibit differences in lipid and IR profile, and even favored  gain and visceral fat. Only SRD-n3 prevented the alterations in VLDL-TG% (54.2 ± 4.4% vs. 68.6 ± 8.2, p < 0.05) and showed lower large VLDL-% (22.5[19.7-35.6] vs. 49.1[15.5-82.0], p < 0.05), while SRD-n6 and SRD-n9 did not show effects.In IR, while n-3 PUFA showed expected favorable effects, supplementation with n-6 PUFA and n-9 MUFA did not prevent atherogenic alterations of VLDL.

We investigated the effect of the presence of horns on the metabolome of milk serum and lipidome of milk fat, to assess the physiological effect of dehorning. Milk sampling took place at low ambient temperatures of -6 to 2°C. Horned and dehorned cows were kept in a mixed herd of Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows. The hypothesis was that horned cows needed to increase their  to compensate for additional heat loss through the presence of their horns. No differences were observed in milk yield, milk solids, and somatic cell counts between horned and dehorned cows. For the milk metabolome, horned cows showed an upregulation of several glucogenic AA that could be transformed into glucose for energy supply and a downregulation of sugar intermediates and γ-glutamylcysteine compared with dehorned cows. The fatty  (FA) composition in horned cows showed a shift toward decreased odd medium-chain FA (C7:0, C9:0, and C11:0) and increased cis-vaccenic  (C18:1n-7 cis-11) and stearidonic  (C18:4n-3).

The major challenge in the prevention and intervention of this disease is the incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanism and thus lack of potent therapeutic targets due to multifaceted and interdependent disease factors. In this study, we investigated the role of a signaling adaptor protein, GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (Gab2), in fatty liver using an animal disease model. Gab2 expression in hepatocytes responded to various disease factor stimulations, and Gab2 knockout mice exhibited resistance to fat-induced , fat- or alcohol-stimulated hepatic steatosis, as well as methionine and choline deficiency-induced steatohepatitis. Concordantly, the forced expression or knockdown of Gab2 enhanced or diminished  (OA)- or ethanol-induced lipid production in hepatocytes in vitro, respectively. During lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, both fat and alcohol induced the recruitment of PI3K or Socs3 by Gab2 and the activation of their downstream signaling proteins AKT, ERK, and Stat3. Therefore, Gab2 may be a disease-associated protein that is induced by pathogenic factors to amplify and coordinate multifactor-induced signals to govern disease development in the liver. Our research provides a novel potential target for the prevention and intervention of fatty liver disease.© The Author (2016).

TFAs are formed by trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The most recognized formation mechanisms of TFAs are hydrogenation of liquid oil to form partially hydrogenated oil (PHO,) and biohydrogenation of UFAs to form TFA in ruminants. Heating oil also forms TFAs; however, the mechanism of formation, and the TFA isomers formed have not been well investigated. In this study, the trans isomerization mechanism of unsaturated fatty  formation by heating was examined using the model compounds , trioleate, linoleic , and trilinoleate for liquid plant oil. The formation of TFAs was found to be suppressed by the addition of an antioxidant and argon gas. Furthermore, the quantity of formed TFAs correlated with the quantity of formed polymer in trioleate heated with air and . These results suggest that radical reactions form TFAs from UFAs by heating. Furthermore, trans isomerization by heating  and linoleic  did not change the original double bond positions. Therefore, the distribution of TFA isomers formed was very simple. In contrast, the mixtures of TFA isomers formed from PHO and ruminant UFAs are complicated because migration of double bonds occurs during hydrogenation and biohydrogenation. These findings suggest that trans isomerization by heating is executed by a completely different mechanism than in hydrogenation and biohydrogenation.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29488634>Analysis of growth and lipid production characteristics of Chlorella vulgaris in artificially constructed consortia with symbiotic bacteria.</a></h2><p>The aim was to study the effect of artificially constructed consortia of microalgae-bacterial symbionts on growth and lipid production by Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), as well as the inter-relationship between microalgae and bacterial in a photoautotrophic system.

At 4 mM, trienes are more potent activators as compared to 18:2 and 18:1.

The metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids may be involved in the activation since the presence of antioxidants and cyclooxygenase inhibitors were found to influence the activation of PLD by polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473730>Bioconversion of cheese whey permeate into fungal oil by .</a></h2><p>Oleaginous fungi are efficient tools to convert agricultural waste streams into valuable components. The filamentous fungus  was cultivated in whey permeate, a byproduct from cheese production, to produce an oil-rich fungal biomass. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the fermentation conditions such as pH and temperature for increased biomass yield and lipid accumulation. Quantification and characterization of the fungal biomass oil was conducted.Upstream lactose hydrolysis of the whey permeate increased the biomass yield from 2.4 to 7.8 (g dry biomass/L) compared to that of non-hydrolyzed whey permeate. The combination of low pH (4.5) and pasteurization minimized microbial competition, thus favoring fungal growth. A central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the effects of temperature (22.4-33.6 °C) and a lower pH range (3.6-4.7) on biomass yield and composition. The highest biomass yield and oil content was observed at high temperature (33.6 °C), while the pH range evaluated had a less pronounced effect. The predictive model was validated at the optimal conditions of 33.6 °C and pH 4.5. The fungal biomass yield plateaued at 9 g dry cell  per liter, while the oil content and lipid yield reached a maximum of 24% dry biomass and 2.20 g/L, respectively, at 168 h. Triacylglycerides were the major lipid class (92%), which contained predominantly  (41%), palmitic (23%), linoleic (11%), and γ-linolenic  (9%).This study provided an alternative way of valorization of cheese whey permeate by using it as a substrate for the production of value-added compounds by fungal fermentation.

We describe here a strategy for a new family of photoelectrodes with upconverting nanocrystal assemblies as the photosensitizer. The assemblies consist of -capped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals that coordinate directly onto a layer of surface-bound, carboxylic -derivatized anthracenes through displacement of the  capping ligands. Steady-state emission and transient absorption measurements show that the upconverting nanocrystal assemblies, selectively excited by green light, generate singlet excitons that enable efficient charge injection into both the conduction band of TiO at the photoanode and the valence band of NiO at the photocathode. The singlet excitons form by sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation within the compact layer of anthracenes on the electrode surfaces. Density of state analysis reveals that the electronic coupling between the anthracene singlet excited states and the oxides provides a thermodynamic basis for light-induced charge transfer. The interplay between the excited-state populations at the surface-bound molecules and the assembled nanocrystals presents new design rules that can potentially overcome the limitations of previous dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells for catalytic applications.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721373>Inhibition of TRPV1 channels by a naturally occurring omega-9 fatty  reduces pain and itch.</a></h2><p>The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel is mainly found in primary nociceptive afferents whose activity has been linked to pathophysiological conditions including pain, itch and .

Enzymes diagnostic of , the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle and phosphagen metabolism were all present in significant amounts in red blood cells. In direct comparisons of 14C-labelled substrates at normal resting plasma concentrations, rates of CO2 production were in the order: glucose greater than lactate greater than alanine greater than oleate. Total CO2 production rates from these four oxidative substrates did not equal directly measured O2 consumption rates, indicating that other substrates may also be important in vivo. Oxidative pathway Km values for glucose (8.4 mmol l-1), lactate (3.3 mmol l-1) and alanine (0.8 mmol l-1) were well within the normal physiological ranges of plasma concentrations. Glucose concentration did not affect lactate oxidation rates, but there was some inhibition (27%) of glucose oxidation by high lactate concentrations (20 mmol l-1). The observed Km values and competitive interactions suggest that changes in plasma concentrations associated with environmental stresses can considerably alter the relative rates of oxidation of glucose and lactate in vivo. Considerable pentose-phosphate shunt activity was detected in red cells, as indicated by high activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and high CO2 production rates from (1-14C)-labelled glucose.

Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent.

In the pituitary glands of the 18- and 21-month-old control mice, total cholesterol content seemed higher than that of the experimental mice. Only livers of 12-month-old experimental mice showed significantly lower phospholipid content than that of the controls. Only the triglyceride content of livers from 18-month-old experimental mice was significantly higher than that of the controls. Finally, the ratio of saturated to unsaturated free fatty acids in livers of experimental mice was significantly altered from that of the control mice.</p><p>Keyword:['colon cancer']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26995125>Physicochemical evaluation of sheep milk yogurts containing different levels of inulin.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical parameters of sheep milk yogurt smoothies (SMY) containing inulin at different levels (0, 2, 4, and 6%). Titratable acidity and pH, yogurt bacteria counts,   profile, and healthy lipid indices were evaluated during 28 d of refrigerated storage. As expected for yogurts, Streptococcus thermophilus counts decreased 1 to 3 log cycles and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus counts decreased 1 to 2 cycles from d 1 to 28. The protective effect of inulin on bacteria survival and viability in the food matrix was not verified in the prebiotic SMY during storage, regardless of inulin level. Although lower post-acidification was observed in prebiotic SMY due to inulin addition, no changes were verified in short-chain   () or polyunsaturated   (PUFA). In contrast, an increase in medium- and long-chain   (MCFA and LCFA) and monounsaturated   (MUFA) was observed during storage in all SMY. The most significant levels of   in SMY were , followed by palmitic and myristic . A high positive correlation between conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and  (r=0.978) was observed. The cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer represented approximately 78% of total PUFA and 2% of total  , whereas α-linoleic  comprised about 22% PUFA and 1% of total   in SMY. The   changes during storage were associated with the metabolic activity of the starter bacteria, especially for  and cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer. Thus, the SMY represented a great source of these compounds. We observed that inulin levels did not affect  . A nonsignificant decrease in atherogenic index was observed during storage in all SMY, and a positive correlation (r=0.973) was found between atherogenic index and thrombogenic index of SMY. High correlations were observed between lauric and myristic  and saturated   (r=0.907 and r=0.894, respectively), providing evidence of their atherogenic and thrombogenic potential. A negative correlation was observed between stearic  and atherogenic index (r=-0.612) and between  and atherogenic index. Sheep milk yogurt could be characterized as a food with low atherogenic and thrombogenic risk because of its healthy lipid composition. Therefore, addition of inulin to SMY could be a good option to improve functionality of this food matrix for dairy companies wishing to enter the functional food market.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Also, the effects of these FAs were tested when the GPR120 gene was silenced.In adipocytes from non-obese subjects, palmitic and linoleic acids increased TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression (p < 0.05), and decreased IL-10 and adiponectin expression (p < 0.05). However,  and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) produced the opposite effect (p < 0.05). In adipocytes from MO subjects, all FAs used increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression (p < 0.05). Palmitic and linoleic acids decreased IL-10 and adiponectin expression (p < 0.05), but  and DHA did not have significant effects. Only  increased adiponectin expression (p < 0.05). The effects of FAs on TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and adiponectin expression in non-obese and MO subjects were significantly annulled when the GPR120 gene was silenced in visceral adipocytes differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells.FAs are capable of directly acting on visceral adipocytes to modulate differently TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and adiponectin expression, with a different and greater effect in MO subjects. These effects are largely annulled when GPR120 expression was silenced, which suggests that they could be mediated by GPR120.</p><p>Keyword:['obesity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29663407>Ground Beef High in Total Fat and Saturated  Acids Decreases X Receptor Signaling Targets in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Men and Women.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that consumption of saturated  acids in the form of high-fat ground beef for 5 weeks would depress  X receptor signaling targets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and that changes in gene expression would be associated with the corresponding changes in lipoprotein cholesterol (C) concentrations. Older men (n = 5, age 68.0 ± 4.6 years) and postmenopausal women (n = 7, age 60.9 ± 3.1 years) were assigned randomly to consume ground-beef containing 18% total fat (18F) or 25% total fat (25F), five patties per week for 5 weeks with an intervening 4-week washout period. The 25F and 18F ground-beef increased (p < 0.05) the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, palmitic , and stearic , but the 25F ground-beef increased only the intake of  (p < 0.05). The ground-beefs 18F and 25F increased the plasma concentration of palmitic  (p < 0.05) and decreased the plasma concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenic acids (p < 0.05). The interventions of 18F and 25F ground-beef decreased very low-density lipoprotein C concentrations and increased particle diameters and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 25F decreased PBMC mRNA levels for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette A, ATP binding cassette G1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and LDL receptor (LDLR) (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 18F increased mRNA levels for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p < 0.05). We conclude that the increased LDL particle size and LDL-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations following the 25F ground-beef intervention may have been caused by decreased hepatic LDLR gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30317760>[Comparison of effects of  and palmitic  on  deposition and mTOR / S6K1 / SREBP-1c pathway in HepG2 cells].</a></h2><p> To explore the effects of  and palmitic  on  deposition and mTOR/S6K1/SREBP-1c pathways in HepG2 cells.  The model of steatosis was established with induction of  and palmitic  and was intervened by rapamycin. The changes in  droplets were observed after staining the cells with oil Red O. Intracellular triglyceride (TG) contents in cells were measured by TG kit. mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c mRNA expression levels were detected using QRT-PCR. Western blot was used to determine protein expression levels of mTOR, S6K1 and SREBP-1c.  Both fatty acids increased  droplets in HepG2 cells. Fatty degeneration with elevated TG occurred with significant changes in  group lipids. Rapamycin alleviated  deposition caused by  and palmitic  and inhibited their induction of increased expression of mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c. QRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that mRNA and protein expressions of mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c in  and palmitic  group were significantly higher than the control group ( < 0.05). The increase was more pronounced in the palmitic  group ( < 0.05); however, after rapamycin intervention, the expression of mRNA and protein in the three groups were significantly lower ( < 0.05), and the change in palmitic  group was more pronounced ( < 0.05).   and palmitic  can induce  deposition in HepG2 cells and increase expression of every component of mTOR/S6K1/SREBP-1c pathway; however, -induced  deposition is more pronounced, and the mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c pathway change is more obvious in palmitic . Rapamycin has high potent inhibitory effect on palmitic -induced  deposition. These results specify that  synthesis involved in the mTOR/S6K1/SREBP-1c pathways are mainly associated to palmitic  in HepG2 cells, whereas other signaling pathway may mediate -induced  synthesis.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28832150>From Colloidal Monodisperse Nickel Nanoparticles to Well-Defined Ni/AlO Model Catalysts.</a></h2><p>In the past few decades, advances in colloidal nanoparticle synthesis have created new possibilities for the preparation of supported model catalysts. However, effective removal of surfactants is a prerequisite to evaluate the catalytic properties of these catalysts in any reaction of interest. Here we report on the colloidal preparation of surfactant-free Ni/AlO model catalysts. Monodisperse Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with mean particle size ranging from 4 to 9 nm were synthesized via thermal decomposition of a zerovalent precursor in the presence of . Five  percent Ni/AlO catalysts were produced by direct deposition of the presynthesized NPs on an alumina support, followed by thermal activation (oxidation-reduction cycle) for complete surfactant removal and surface cleaning. Structural and morphological characteristics of the nanoscale catalysts are described in detail following the propagation of the bulk and surface Ni species at the different treatment stages. Powder X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction experiments as well as infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption and magnetic measurements were conducted. The applied thermal treatments are proven to be fully adequate for complete surfactant removal while preserving the metal particle size and the size distribution at the level attained by the colloidal synthesis. Compared with standard impregnated Ni/AlO catalysts, the current model materials display narrowed Ni particle size distributions and increased reducibility with a higher fraction of the metallic nickel atoms exposed at the catalyst surface.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27483795>Bio-Diesel Production from Deoxygenation Reaction Over Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 Supported Transition Metal (Ni, Cu, Co, and Mo) Catalysts.</a></h2><p>Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 supported transition metal (Me = Ni, Cu, Co, and Mo) catalysts have been investigated to screen for the catalytic activity and selectivity for deoxygenation reaction of .

However, these reduction-responsive nanocarriers are generally trapped within endolysosomes after internalization and are subjected to unwanted disintegration, remarkably compromising the therapeutic performance. Herein, amphiphilic polyprodrugs of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-EoS)-b-PCPTM were synthesized via sequential reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, where EoS and CPTM are Eosin Y- and camptothecin (CPT)-based monomers, respectively. An oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion method was applied to self-assemble the amphiphilic polyprodrugs into hybrid vesicles in the presence of hydrophobic  (OA)-stabilized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, NaYF:Yb/Er), rendering it possible to activate the EoS photosensitizer under a near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation with the generation of singlet  (O) through the energy transfer between UCNPs and EoS moieties. Notably, the in situ generated singlet  (O) can not only exert its photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect but also disrupt the membranes of endolysosomes and thus facilitate the endosomal escape of internalized nanocarriers (i.e., photochemical internalization (PCI)). Cell experiments revealed that the hybrid vesicles could be facilely taken up by endocytosis. Although the internalized hybrid vesicles were initially trapped within endolysosomes, a remarkable endosomal escape into the cytoplasm was observed under 980 nm laser irradiation as a result of the PCI effect of O. The escaped hybrid vesicles subsequently underwent GSH-triggered CPT release in the cytosol, thereby activating the chemotherapy process. The integration of PDT module into the design of reduction-responsive nanocarriers provides a feasible approach to enhance the therapeutic performance.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032118>Nitro- protects against endotoxin-induced  and multiorgan injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Nitroalkene derivatives of nitro- (OA-NO2) are endogenous lipid products with potent anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of OA-NO2 in mice given LPS. Two days before LPS administration, C57BL/6J mice were chronically infused with vehicle (LPS vehicle) or OA-NO2 (LPS OA-NO2) at 200 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1) via osmotic minipumps; LPS was administered via a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection (10 mg/kg in saline). A third group received an ip injection of saline without LPS or OA-NO2 and served as controls. At 18 h of LPS administration, LPS vehicle mice displayed multiorgan dysfunction as evidenced by elevated plasma urea and creatinine (kidney), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; liver), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reduced ejection fraction (heart). In contrast, the severity of multiorgan dysfunction was less in LPS OA-NO2 animals. The levels of circulating TNF-alpha and renal TNF-alpha mRNA expression, together with renal mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, and with renal mRNA and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and renal cGMP and PGE2 contents, were greater in LPS vehicle vs. control mice, but were attenuated in LPS OA-NO2 animals. Similar patterns of changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators were observed in the liver. Together, pretreatment with OA-NO2 ameliorated the inflammatory response and multiorgan injury in endotoxin-induced  in mice.</p><p>Keyword:['endotoximia']</p></html>
