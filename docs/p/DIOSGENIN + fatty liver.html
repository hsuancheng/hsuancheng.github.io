Thus, the purpose of the present study was to further confirm its effects of prevention and then to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying its activity in mice. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6J mice and ob/ob mice were used as the experimental models. Serum and hepatic biochemical parameters were determined, and the mRNA and protein expression levels were detected. The results indicated that dioscin alleviated body weight and liver lipid accumulation symptoms, increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure, and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated oxidative damage, suppressed inflammation, inhibited triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis, promoted fatty acid β-oxidation, down-regulated MAPK phosphorylation levels, and induced autophagy to alleviate fatty liver conditions. Dioscin prevents diet induced  and NAFLD by increasing energy expenditure. This agent should be developed as a new candidate for  and NAFLD prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29574225>Dioscin alleviates non-alcoholic  disease through adjusting lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Dioscin, one natural product, has active effect against non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in our previous work. However, the pharmacological data are insufficient and the mechanisms have not been reported. Thus, this study aims to comprehensively investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of dioscin against NAFLD. The primary cultured hepatocytes, AML-12 and HepG-2 cells were treated with palmic acid (PA) after dioscin treatment. The mice and rats were induced by high fat diet to establish the in vivo models of NAFLD. Dioscin obviously alleviated  lipid accumulation symptoms and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters in vitro and in vivo. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated lipid metabolism via adjusting SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway to regulate the expression levels of SREBP-1c, CPT, FAS, SCD, FoxO1 and ATGL. In addition, suppression of SIRT1 by Nicotinamide or abrogation of AMPK by Compound C eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on lipid metabolism. Therefore, our findings further demonstrated that dioscin markedly prevented NAFLD through adjusting lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway, which should be developed as a new candidate for NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Diet intervention, particularly naturaceutical antioxidants have anti-diabetic potential and avert oxidative damage linked with diabetic pathogenesis. The present study investigated the effects of , a saponin from fenugreek, on the changes in lipid profile in plasma, liver, heart and brain in high-fat diet-streptozotocin (HFD-STZ)-induced diabetic rats.  was administered to HFD-STZ induced diabetic rats by orally at 60 mg kg(-1) body weight for 30 days to assess its effects on body weight gain, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids in plasma, liver, heart and brain.The levels of body weight, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, VLDL-C and LDL-C were increased significantly (P < 0.05) whereas HDL-C level decreased in the HFD/STZ diabetic rats. Administration of  to HFD-STZ diabetic rats caused a decrease in body weight gain, blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and also it modulated lipid profile in plasma and tissues.The traditional plant fenugreek and its constituents mediate its anti-diabetic potential through mitigating hyperglycaemic status, altering insulin resistance by alleviating metabolic dysregulation of lipid profile in both plasma and tissues.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23400896>Influence of different particle processing on hypocholesterolemic and antiatherogenic activities of yam (Dioscorea pseudojaponica) in cholesterol-fed rabbit model.</a></h2><p>Nanoparticle processing is implicated in enhancing bioactive or nutritional compound release from raw foods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether different particle processing might affect the lipid-lowering activity of Dioscorea pseudojaponica (DP) and to investigate whether DP could be a potential functional food for prevention of atherogenesis. Its possible molecular mechanisms were also evaluated.The results indicated that 50 mesh-size DP (50 mesh DP) particles exhibited stronger effects than nanoscale DP (nano DP) particles in terms of lowering the level of serum cholesterol as well as reducing the extent of  and aortic  streak. Moreover, both DP particle types, particularly 50 mesh DP, significantly activated AMPK (5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) and deactivated ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), as demonstrated by the increased levels of both enzymes in their phosphorylated form. Coincidently, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed a higher content (P < 0.01) of dioscin, a known lipid-lowering compound, in 50 mesh DP than in nano DP.These results suggest that improper processing conditions will lead to the decomposition of bioactive components in yam. They also demonstrate for the first time that the lipid-lowering mechanisms of DP may occur through the AMPK-ACC pathway.© 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229863>Yamogenin in fenugreek inhibits lipid accumulation through the suppression of gene expression in  acid synthesis in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Yamogenin is a diastereomer of , which we have identified as the compound responsible for the anti-hyperlipidemic effect of fenugreek. Here, we examined the effects of yamogenin on the accumulation of triacylglyceride (TG) in hepatocytes, because yamogenin is also contained in fenugreek. It was demonstrated that yamogenin also inhibited TG accumulation in HepG2 hepatocytes and suppressed the mRNA expression of  acid synthesis-related genes such as  acid synthase and sterol response element-binding protein-1c. Indeed, yamogenin also antagonized the activation of the  X receptor (LXR) in luciferase ligand assay similar to . However, yamogenin could not exert such effects in the presence of T0901713, a potent agonist of LXR. These findings indicate that the effects of yamogenin on TG accumulation would be weaker than those of , suggesting that the structural difference between yamogenin and  would be important for the inhibition of LXR activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24146112>Protective effects of dioscin against alcohol-induced  injury.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies have shown that dioscin has protective effect against  injury. However, the action of the compound against ethanol-induced  injury is still unknown. In the present paper, ethanol-induced acute and chronic  damage rat models were used, and the results showed that dioscin significantly alleviated  steatosis, reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol and malondialdehyde, and increased the levels of high-density lipoprotein, superoxide dismutase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. Transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assays showed that dioscin prevented mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations and apoptosis caused by ethanol. In addition, dioscin significantly inhibited ethanol-induced cytochrome P450 2E1 activation, down-regulated the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases phosphorylation, inhibited the expressions of nuclear factor kappa B, glucose regulated protein 78, activating transcription factor 6 and alpha subunit of translation initiation factor 2 to attenuate oxidative damage, decreased the expressions of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6, and down-regulated the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins including p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, poly (ADP-ribose)-polymerase and cytokeratin-18. Further investigation indicated that dioscin markedly increased the expressions of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α and its target genes including medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I and acyl-CoA oxidase to advance  acid β-oxidation, up-regulated the expressions of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 5, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to promote  acid metabolism, and down-regulated the expressions of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 to accelerate TG synthesis. However, dioscin had no effects on the expressions of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c,  acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 associated with  acid synthesis. In conclusion, dioscin shows excellent protective effect against ethanol-induced  injury through ameliorating ethanol-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, inflammatory cytokine production, apoptosis and  steatosis, which should be developed as a new drug for the treatment of ethanol-induced  injury in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29207101> prevents high-fat diet-induced rat non-alcoholic  disease through the AMPK and LXR signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a major public health concern worldwide.

In the past years, antitumor effects of FC have been observed in several cultural cells and animal systems. However, there was no research particular on  cancer. In this experiment, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay was used to evaluate cell viability of HepG2 cells with FC-treatment. 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, Annexin V-FITC/PI assay and DNA fragment assay were applied to observe FC-induced apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis and NMR metabolic profiles were used to identify molecular mechanisms of FC in HepG2 cells. As a result, FC inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells through inducing apoptosis and S phase arrest. Cells cultured in the presence or absence of FC was different in metabolic profiles. The treatment decreased acetate, ethanol, choline and betaine, and increased butyrate,  acids, leucine and valine in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, metabolomic analysis of the exometabolome of FC-treated HepG2 cells, together with traditional methods such as apoptosis test and cell cycle analysis provided a holistic method for elucidating mechanisms of potential anti-cancer drug, FC.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Many studies have suggested that lipid overload is the key initial factor that contributes to hepatic steatosis. Our previous study indicated that  (DSG) has a beneficial effect on energy metabolism, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.Human normal hepatocytes (LO2 cells) were incubated with palmitic acid to establish the cell model of nonalcoholic . The effects of DSG on lipid metabolism, glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress, lipid consumption and lipid synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that palmitic acid induced obvious lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular lipid content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and  acid synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing  acid β-oxidation and decreasing lipid synthesis. The above changes might be mediated by the activation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A pathway and inhibition of the SREBP-1c/FAS pathway.</p></html>
