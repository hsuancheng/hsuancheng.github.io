Potato tubers were treated under conditions of single-phase (30 μL L, 0-10 d) and dual-phase (30 μL L, 0-10 d; 30 μL L, 35-90 d) fumigation. Changes in germination rate,  loss, starch, reducing sugar, gibberellins (GA), and α-solanine were measured. The results showed that CEO fumigation could control sprouting and improve the quality of potato tubers during storage compared to the non-treated tubers. CEO treatments inhibited the degradation of starch and the increase of reducing sugar content. The production of gibberellins (GA) was suppressed, and the levels of α-solanine in the skin and flesh of potato tubers were decreased by CEO fumigation. Dual-phase CEO fumigation had a better effect on sprout suppression than single-phase fumigation, and possesses potential for postharvest application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result of the vast availability, treated B. decumbens demonstrates as a promising local material that could be utilised as an improved diet for sheep and goats. Despite the fact that the grass significantly increases weight gains in grazing farm animals, there were many reports of general ill-thrift and sporadic outbreaks of photosensitivity in livestock due to the toxic compound of steroidal saponin found in B. decumbens. Ensiling and haymaking were found to be effective in removing toxin and undesirable compounds in the grass. Biological treatments using urea, activated charcoal, polyethylene glycol, and effective microorganisms were found to be useful in anti-nutritional factor deactivation and improving the nutritive values of feedstuffs. Besides, oral administration of phenobarbitone showed some degree of protection in sheep that fed on B. decumbens pasture. In this review, we aim to determine the effect of B. decumbens toxicity and possible treatment methods on the grass to be used as an improved diet for small ruminant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28257664>Intake of total saponins and polysaccharides from Polygonatum kingianum affects the gut microbiota in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota has been reported to play a critical role in metabolic diseases, including in diabetes. Polygonatum kingianum has been used in the treatment of diabetes and related diseases in China for centuries. Total saponins (TSPK) and total polysaccharides (PSPK) were reported to be major types of active constituents of P. kingianum. This research aims at investigation of their therapeutical mechanisms on diabetes based on the regulation of gut microbiota.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) rats were induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin-injection from male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The blood biochemical indicators were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota and the contents of the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were discussed.T2D rats were treated with TSPK (0.025 and 0.1g/kg) and PSPK (0.1g/kg) for 56 days. Major biochemical indexes, such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were measured. Intestinal microbial diversities and the overall structural changes in gut microbiota were discussed based on the sequencing results on V4 region of 16S rDNA. Moreover, the contents of the SCFAs in faeces, which were fermentation products produced from gut microbiota were determined by gas chromatography (GC).Oral administration of TSPK and PSPK prevented the increase of FBG. TSPK (0.025g/kg) enhancing the content of FINS at the end of research. Furthermore, TSPK and PSPK improved the intestinal microecology by decreasing the abundances of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, and increasing that of Firmicutes. However, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H displayed discrepant regulation roles on Firmicutes. TSPK.L and PSPK significantly increased the abundance of Ruminococcaceae family and Ruminococcus genus in Firmicutes phylum, however, TSPK.H increased the abundances of Veillonellaceae family and Anaerovibrio genus. 57 Key variables, altered after treated by TSPK and PSPK, correlated to the alternations of FBG, FINS, LPS and  were identified. In addition, TSPK.L, PSPK and TSPK.H showed different adjustment on the contents of SCFAs.These results suggested that, compared to the normal rats, the structure of gut microbiota was significantly changed in diabetic rats. Oral administration with TSPK and PSPK could prevent T2D by its regulation role on the gut microbiota.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Mice model of CIA was induced by chicken collagen II and arthritis index was assessed. After suspension of dioscin (100mg/kg/d) or triptolide was intragastrically administered, the left paw swelling and  of each mouse were measured. Then tissue samples were assayed by histopathological analysis. The levels of Th1 and Th2 were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of p-STAT1, p-STAT4 and p-STAT6 was demonstrated by western blot analysis, and T-bet and GATA-3 expression was detected by RT-PCR. The paw swelling and arthritis index were decreased and  was increased in the high dose of dioscin group compared to the model group (P<0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed that the damage of synovium tissue in dioscin and triptolide group alleviated. The ratio of Th1/Th2 in the dioscin group (0.82±0.24) and triptolide group (0.99±0.44) was lower than that in the model group (1.84±0.70, P<0.05). Additionally, p-STAT4 expression was decreased, and both p-STAT6 and GATA3 expression was increased in the dioscin group than that in the model group (P<0.05). Dioscin might have some therapeutic effects on CIA through regulating the proportion of Th1/Th2 cells, which could reduce the expression of p-STAT4, increase the expression of p-STAT6 and GATA3 in the synovial tissue.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We previously reported that a new derivative of , compound 5, had significant anti-inflammatory activity superior to that of aspirin, prolonged bleeding time, and inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the in vivo efficacy and safety of compound 5 using the ferric chloride (FeCl3)-induced arterial and venous thrombosis models in rats as well as its toxicity in mice. Compared with the control rats, those treated with compound 5 showed significantly less adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time mediated by the specific regulation of factor VIII. Furthermore, compound 5 significantly reduced the average length and  of thrombi in both arteries and veins. These findings were similar to those of aspirin at the same dose. The safety evaluation revealed a much lower risk of bleeding and lesser gastric mucosal damage with compound 5 than with the same dose of aspirin. An oral dose of up to 575.5mg/kg showed no toxicity in mice. In conclusion, consistent with our in vitro findings, compound 5 exhibited an in vivo antithrombotic activity that was comparable to aspirin mainly by reducing platelet aggregation and regulating factor VIII, but with fewer side effects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the specific mechanism by which this is achieved is not clear. This study investigated the protective effects of  on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS Healthy adult male SD rats,  (b.w.) 250-280 g, were used to model ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and were administered  (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg b.w.) intragastrically for 4 consecutive weeks before surgery. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated to induce myocardial ischemia for 30 min and reperfusion for 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min while relevant indicators were detected. RESULTS Both 50 mg and 100 mg  oral administration increased left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and maximum changing rate of ventricular pressure (±dp/dtmax), decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and myocardial enzyme markers. TTC staining suggested that  reduced myocardial infarct size in the rat model. Pathological results showed that myocardial ischemia and inflammation were alleviated by . In addition, the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in serum, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in myocardium were significantly suppressed by  administration.  further inhibited the phosphorylation of transcription factor NF-κB and modulated the expression of downstream inflammatory cytokines by regulating the activation of p38-MAPK and JNK pathways.

In the present study, the antitumor activity of PPI in prostate cancer (PC) cells was evaluated. At low doses, PPI decreased proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PC cells. PPI decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), an enzyme that is critical for tumor metastasis. PPI also decreased the expression of Snail and vimentin, which are EMT-associated factors. Additionally, PPI suppressed AP-1 transcriptional activity and AP-1 binding to the MMP7 and vimentin promoters. The results demonstrated that PPI downregulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signaling‑related kinase (ERK), which is upstream modulator of AP-1. The results of the present study demonstrated that PPI may inhibit the cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A)/protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/ERK axis, downregulate the expression of MMP7, vimentin, and Snail, and suppress tumor invasion and EMT. A PC xenograft mouse model was employed and the results revealed that PPI may decrease tumor growth and weight. Additionally, PPI may inhibit proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and CIP2A/PP2A/ERK signaling pathway in PPI-treated tumors. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that PPI may suppress the growth, invasion and EMT of PC cells via inhibition of CIP2A/PP2A/ERK signaling axis. As a result, PPI may be a novel target for the treatment of PC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27155058>Dioscin reduces ovariectomy-induced bone loss by enhancing osteoblastogenesis and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies showed that dioscin can promote osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation in vitro, but its anti-osteoporosis effect in vivo and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present work, the results showed that dioscin significantly increased the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells, ALP level and alizarin red S staining area, markedly decreased the numbers of RANKL-induced TRAP-positive multinucleated cells and bone resorption pits formation, enhanced the levels of some osteogenic markers including COL1A2, ALP and OC, which suggested that dioscin clearly promoted osteoblasts proliferation and suppressed osteoclasts formation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that dioscin obviously reduced OVX-induced  increase, and improved the biochemical indexes including ALP, StrACP, OC, DPD/Cr, HOP/Cr, BMD, biomechanics and microarchitecture. Moreover, H&E, TB, TRAP staining, and fluorescent double labeling tests indicated that dioscin enhanced osteoblastogenesis and inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Further researches demonstrated that dioscin promoted osteoblastogenesis through up-regulating OPG/RANKL ratio, and inhibited osteoclastogenesis through down-regulating the levels of RANKL induced TRAF6 and the downstream signal molecules including MAPKs, Akt, NF-κB, AP-1, cathepsin K and NFATc1. In addition, dioscin also inhibited TLR4/MyD88 pathway to decrease the levels of TRAF6 and the related proteins. These findings provide new insights to elucidate the effects of dioscin against OVX-induced bone loss, which should be developed as a potential candidate for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cyclophosphamide (CP) is the most commonly used anticancer and immunosuppressant drug, which causes several toxic effects, especially on the reproductive system. Patients who need to use CP therapy exhibit reduced fertility or infertility, which impacts both physically and emotionally on the decision to use this drug, especially among young men. We hypothesized that the treatment with TT dry extract would protect the male reproductive system against CP toxicity. Mice received dry extract of TT (11 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 14 days. Saline or CP was injected intraperitoneally at a single dose (100 mg/kg) on the 14th day. Animals were euthanized 24 h after CP administration, and testes and epididymis were removed for biochemical and histopathological analysis and sperm evaluation.

Dioscin, a natural product, shows potent effect on liver protection in our previous works.This work aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of dioscin on liver regeneration.The promoting proliferation effects of dioscin on mouse hepatocytem AML12 cells, rat primary hepatocytes, rats and mice after 70% PH were evaluated.Dioscin significantly promoted proliferation of rat primary hepatocytes and AML12 cells through MTT, BrdU and PCNA staining assays. Meanwhile, dioscin rapidly recovered the liver to  ratios, declined ALT and AST levels, and relieved hepatocytes necrosis compared with 70% PH operation groups in rats and mice. Mechanistic test showed that dioscin significantly increased Notch1 and Jagged1 levels, and accelerated γ-secretase activity by up-regulating PS1 expression, leading to nuclear translocation of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1). Subsequently, the significant activation of Notch-dependent target genes (Hey1, Hes1, EGFR, VEGF), and cell-cycle regulatory proteins (CyclinD1, CyclinE1, CDK4 and CDK2) were all recognized. In addition, these results were further confirmed by Notch1 siRNA silencing and inhibition of γ-secretase by DAPT (a well-characterized γ-secretase inhibitor) in vitro.Dioscin, as a novel efficient γ-secretase activator, NICD1 nucleus translocation promoter and cell cycle regulator, markedly activated Notch1/Jagged1 pathway to promote hepato-proliferation.

However, numerous cases of toxicity outbreaks in livestock have raised concerns on safety of using these plants, especially B. decumbens. In this study, chemometric analysis of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-QTOF-MS) data has for the first time uncovered qualitative and quantitative differences between metabolomes of toxic B. decumbens and nontoxic B. brizantha. The steroidal saponin protoneodioscin was established as the main biomarker for B. decumbens when compared to B. brizantha, and therefore the key explanation for their phytochemical differentiation. Quantification of protodioscin in both plants showed no significant differences; consequently, the idea that this compound is solely responsible for toxicity outbreaks must be discarded. Instead, we propose that the added occurrence of its stereoisomer, protoneodioscin, in B. decumbens, can be considered as the probable cause of these events. Interestingly, the greatest concentrations of saponins for both species were reached during winter (B. decumbens = 53.6 ± 5.1 mg·g(-1) dry  (D.W.); B. brizantha = 25.0 ± 1.9 mg·g(-1) D.W.) and spring (B. decumbens = 49.4 ± 5.0 mg·g(-1) D.W.; B. brizantha = 27.9 ± 1.4 mg·g(-1) D.W.), although in the case of B. decumbens these values do not vary significantly among seasons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483735>Dioscin attenuates high‑fat diet‑induced insulin resistance of adipose tissue through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance, as a common metabolic disorder, may be caused by diet‑induced obesity. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of dioscin on regulating insulin resistance of adipose tissue induced by a high‑fat diet (HFD). An animal model was established successfully using C57BL/6J mice with high‑fat feeding, followed by treatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dioscin through gavage for 18 weeks, and randomly divided into a control group, a HFD model group and a dioscin group treated with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dioscin for 12 weeks. Histopathological changes in adipose tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical parameters of the serum were also monitored, including glucose, insulin, total triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) and adipose insulin resistance (Adipo‑IR) levels. Expression of the mRNA and associated proteins of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1)/phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values of mice fed with a HFD were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). However, dioscin administration significantly decreased HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.05), suggesting the effects of dioscin on attenuating insulin resistance. RT‑qPCR results indicated that the associated genes of the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway were significantly downregulated by HFD compared with the control group (P<0.05), while dioscin significantly increased the expression of those genes compared with the control group (P<0.05). Similarly, the significant increase in phosphorylated (p‑)IRS‑1/IRS‑1 (P<0.05) and p‑Akt/Akt (P<0.05) values were substantially reversed by dioscin treatment. Dioscin pronouncedly mitigated insulin resistance in adipose tissues through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway and has potential to be used as a novel therapeutic agent for the therapy of HFD‑induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30341820>Responses of the weed Bidens pilosa L. to exogenous application of the steroidal saponin protodioscin and plant growth regulators 24-epibrassinolide, indol-3-acetic acid and abscisic acid.</a></h2><p>The exogenous application of plant hormones and their analogues has been exploited to improve crop performance in the field. Protodioscin is a saponin whose steroidal moiety has some similarities to plant steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids. To test the possibility that protodioscin acts as an agonist or antagonist of brassinosteroids or other plant growth regulators, we compared responses of the weed species Bidens pilosa L. to treatment with protodioscin, brassinosteroids, auxins (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Seeds were germinated and grown in agar containing protodioscin, dioscin, brassinolides, IAA and ABA. Root apex respiratory activity was measured with an oxygen electrode. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes activities were assessed. Protodioscin at 48-240 μm inhibited growth of B. pilosa seedlings. The steroidal hormone 24-epibrassinolide (0.1-5 μm) also inhibited growth of primary roots, but brassicasterol was inactive. IAA at higher concentrations (0.5-10.0 μm) strongly inhibited primary root length and fresh weight of stems. ABA inhibited all parameters of seedling growth and also seed germination. Respiratory activity of primary roots (KCN-sensitive and KCN-insensitive) was activated by protodioscin. IAA and ABA reduced KCN-insensitive respiration. The content of MDA in primary roots increased only after protodioscin treatment. All assayed compounds increased APx and POD activity, with 24-epibrassinolide being most active. The activity of CAT was stimulated by protodioscin and 24-epibrassinolide. The results revealed that protodioscin was toxic to B. pilosa through a mechanism not related to plant growth regulator signalling. Protodioscin caused a disturbance in mitochondrial respiratory activity, which could be related to overproduction of ROS and consequent cell membrane damage.© 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27928123>Consumption of Japanese Yam Improves Lipid Metabolism in High-Cholesterol Diet-Fed Rats.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of dietary Japanese yam (Dioscorea japonica Thunb.) on lipid metabolism. Male Wistar rats (6 wk old) were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 6 wk and then supplemented with 26% of Japanese yam or 0.5% of its constituent  for a further 4 wk of high-cholesterol feeding (C6-J4 and C6-D4 groups, respectively). In the C6-J4 group,  gains significantly decreased, but skeletal muscle fiber sizes in quadriceps significantly increased compared with the other groups. Furthermore, Japanese yam supplementation resulted in the reduction of triglyceride contents in their liver, quadriceps, and intra-abdominal visceral fat.  supplementation resulted in an increase in the numbers of skeletal muscle fibers and decrease in the fat accumulations in liver and of the lipid contents in quadriceps. Although quadriceps cholesterol contents decreased concomitantly with increased serum HDL-cholesterol in both the groups, fecal bile acid, fecal cholesterol contents, and fecal  were higher in the C6-J4 group than in the C6-D4 group. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that Japanese yam inhibited micellar cholesterol solubility in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that Japanese yam is more effective than  in reducing fat accumulation and improving cholesterol metabolism during chronic consumption of a high-cholesterol diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753977>The power of hyphenated chromatography-Time of flight mass spectrometry for unequivocal identification of spirostanes in bodybuilding dietary supplements.</a></h2><p>A previously unidentified purported botanical ingredient was found in dietary supplements marketed for anabolic benefits. In an attempt to assess the 'naturalness' of a group of steroid-like compounds called laxogenins, a UHPLC-QToF method was developed. Several dietary supplements claim to contain 5α-hydroxy laxogenin, which is a derivative of a naturally occurring spirostane-type steroid, laxogenin. Although laxogenin has been isolated from the rhizomes of Smilax sieboldii, 5α-hydroxy laxogenin has not been isolated or reported from any natural source. These derivatives of laxogenins have untested anabolic properties. Due to the low UV absorbance of the spirostanes, a mass spectrometric method in positive ion mode was developed for unambiguous identification of laxogenin and closely related compounds. To show the utility of the developed method, twelve dietary supplements labeled to contain 5α-hydroxy laxogenin or laxogenin as 5α-hydroxy laxogenin were analyzed as a proof-of-concept. Five supplements did not contain any 5α-hydroxy laxogenin, whereas in the remaining seven samples, spirostane-type contaminants were identified along with the labeled 5α-hydroxy laxogenin. The identity of some of these contaminants was established based on reference standards along with mass fragmentation patterns. One of the unlabeled contaminants was identified as the phytosteroid saponin, , a common starting precursor of several steroidal drugs. Several synthetic derivatives of  were identified in the eight products. These findings indicate that the labeled 5α-hydroxy laxogenin along with other spirostanes found in supplements are synthetic and signify a lack of quality controls. Additionally, an unlabeled, anabolic androgenic steroid, arimistane, an aromatase inhibitor, was also identified in one product. Laxogenin, was not detected in any of the samples analyzed during this investigation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This anticontractile effect of PVAT is lost under conditions of obesity. The central mechanism underlying this PVAT dysfunction in obesity is likely to be an 'obesity triad' (consisting of PVAT hypoxia, inflammation and oxidative stress) that leads to the impairment of PVAT-derived vasoregulators. The production of hydrogen sulfide, NO and adiponectin by PVAT is reduced in obesity, whereas the vasodilator response to leptin is impaired (vascular leptin resistance). Strikingly, the vasodilator response to acetylcholine is reduced only in PVAT-containing, but not in PVAT-free thoracic aorta isolated from diet-induced obese mice, indicating a unique role for PVAT in obesity-induced vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, PVAT dysfunction has also been observed in small arteries isolated from the gluteal/visceral fat biopsy samples of obese individuals. Therefore, PVAT may represent a new therapeutic target for vascular complications in obesity. A number of approaches are currently being tested under experimental conditions. Potential therapeutic strategies improving PVAT function include  reduction, enhancing PVAT hydrogen sulfide release (e.g. rosiglitazone, atorvastatin and cannabinoid CB receptor agonists) and NO production (e.g. arginase inhibitors), inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inhibition of inflammation with melatonin or cytokine antagonists, activators of AMP-activated kinase (e.g. metformin, resveratrol and ) and adiponectin releasers or expression enhancers.This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

However, the low efficiency of the gene transfer technique can limit its application. Our preliminary data showed that dioscin, a glucoside saponin, could upregulate the expression of connexins Cx26 and Cx43, major components of gap junctions, in melanoma cells. We hypothesized that dioscin may increase the bystander effect of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) through increasing the formation of gap junctions. Further analysis showed that dioscin indeed could increase the gap junctional intercellular communication in B16 melanoma cells, resulting in more efficient GCV-induced bystander killing in B16tk cells. By contrast, overexpression of dominant negative Cx43 impaired the cell-cell communication of B16 cells and subsequently weakened the bystander effect of HSV-tk/GCV gene therapy. In vivo, combination treatment with dioscin and GCV of tumor-bearing mice with 30% positive B16tk cells and 70% wild-type B16 cells caused a significant reduction in tumor volume and  compared to treatment with GCV or dioscin alone. Taken together, these results demonstrated that dioscin could augment the bystander effect of the HSV-tk/GCV system through increasing connexin-mediated gap junction coupling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28779706>Aglycone solanidine and solasodine derivatives: A natural approach towards cancer.</a></h2><p>Over the past few years, it was suggested that a rational approach to treat cancer in clinical settings requires a multipronged approach that augments improvement in systemic efficiency along with modification in cellular phenotype leads to more efficient cell death response. Recently, the combinatory delivery of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs with natural compounds proved to be astonishing to deal with a variety of cancers, especially that are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The natural compounds not only synergize the effects of chemotherapeutics but also minimize drug associated systemic toxicity. In this review, our primary focus was on antitumor effects of natural compounds. Previously, the drugs from natural sources are highly precise and safer than drugs of synthetic origins. Many natural compounds exhibit anti-cancer potentials by inducing apoptosis in different tumor models, in-vitro and in-vivo. Furthermore, natural compounds are also found equally useful in chemotherapeutic drug resistant tumors. Moreover, these Phyto-compounds also possess numerous other pharmacological properties such as antifungal, antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, and hepatoprotection. Aglycone solasodine and solanidine derivatives are the utmost important steroidal glycoalkaloids that are present in various Solanum species, are discussed here. These natural compounds are highly cytotoxic against different tumor cell lines. As the molecular  is concerned; these are smaller molecular  chemotherapeutic agents that induce cell death response by initiating apoptosis through both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

High  (HF) diet-fed mice and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was used to evaluate the effect of DSG. We showed that DSG attenuated metabolic dysfunction in HF diet-fed mice, as evidenced by reduction of blood glucose level and improvement of glucose and insulin intolerance. DSG ameliorated oxidative stress, reduced body weight,  pads, and systematic  profiles and attenuated  accumulation. DSG inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and reduced adipocyte size through regulating key factors. DSG inhibited PPARγ and its target gene expression both in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and  tissues in HF diet-fed mice. Overexpression of PPARγ suppressed DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation. DSG significantly increased nuclear expression of ERβ. Inhibition of ERβ significantly suppressed DSG-exerted suppression of adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ expression. In response to DSG stimulation, ERβ bound with RXRα and dissociated RXRα from PPARγ, leading to the reduction of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of DSG on adipocyte differentiation and demonstrate that ERβ-exerted regulation of PPARγ expression and activity is critical for DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study is aimed to explore the interaction of fenugreek seed extract (FSE) and HPT (hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid) axis in context of leptin secretion which have important role in normal and type-1 diabetic subjects. FSE (confirmed to contain trigonelline, , 4 hydroxyisoleucine) was gavaged (0.25 gm/kg /day) to normal and alloxan-induced type-1 diabetic rats for 4 weeks. Expression of hypothalamic prepro-TRH (Thyrotropin releasing hormone) mRNA, serum levels of TRH, TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone), fT, fT, insulin, leptin, glucose; thyroperoxidase activity and growth of thyroid gland, food intake, adiposity index were also studied FSE significantly down regulated prepro-TRH mRNA expression; decreased serum TRH, TSH, fT, fT levels, and regressed thyroid gland in FSE-fed normal and diabetic rats than those observed in normal diet-fed control and diabetic rats. FSE decreased (p<0.005-0.001) adiposity index and leptin secretion, increased food intake and  in all FSE-fed rats. FSE improved insulin secretion, decreased glucose level but impaired HPT axis in diabetic rats, indicating insulin-independent central hypothyroidism. Results suggested that the dominant signal to hypothalamus suppressing HPT axis is the fall in leptin level which i resulted from decreased adiposity index following FSE feeding. Fenugreek simultaneously having hypoglycaemic and hypothyroidal actions raises questions whether it can be safely used to treat diabetes and/or hyperthyroidism as was suggested by many workers.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765352>Dioscin suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma tumor growth by inducing apoptosis and regulation of TP53, BAX, BCL2 and cleaved CASP3.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy of the liver, occurs frequently in the setting of chronic liver injury. Although multiple therapeutic approaches are available, the prognosis of patients with HCC remains poor. Dioscin is a natural steroid saponin that presents in various plants. The anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic effects have been extensively reported. However, the effect of dioscin on HCC remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the anti-HCC properties of dioscin in vitro and in vivo.MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay was used to analyze the growth inhibition activity of Dioscin in human cell lines, Bel-7402, HepG2, Lovo, and EAhy926. Antitumor activity through induction of apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) analysis with Hochest33342 and PI labeling, and DNA fragmentation analysis. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins tumor protein p53 (TP53), BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and Caspase 3 (CASP3) was measured by Western blot. Nude mice bearing Bel-7402 were administered intraperitoneally at different doses of dioscin and 5-FU (5-Fluorouracil) treatment was used as a control. Tumor volume and tumor  of each mouse were then measured.We demonstrated that Dioscin inhibited proliferation of HCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Dioscin also significantly induced morphological changes during death by apoptosis and increased DNA damage of Bel-7402 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that Dioscin displayed anticancer activity via up-regulating expression of TP53, BAX and CASP3 protein, as well as down-regulating BCL2 in Bel-7402 cells. Notably, the in vivo anticancer activity of Dioscin was further assessed and achieved greater inhibition efficiency at the concentration increased to 24mg/kg/day than 5-FU at dose of 10mg/kg/day in nude mice bearing Bel-7402 cells.Dioscin inhibited tumor growth via inducing apoptosis, which was accompanied by altered expression of apoptotic pathway proteins, such as TP53, BAX, BCL2 and CASP3. Our findings indicate that further evaluation of dioscin as a novel therapeutic approach for HCC is warranted.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Searching for compounds that are as equally efficient as glucocorticoids, but with less side effects, the current study compared plant steroids, namely, glycyrrhetinic acid, guggulsterone, boswellic acid, withaferin A, and  with the classical glucocorticoid, fluticasone. This was approached both  using molecular docking against glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and  in two different animal models. All tested compounds interacted with GR, but only boswellic acid and withaferin A showed docking results comparable to fluticasone, as well as similar  anti-inflammatory effects, by significantly decreasing serum levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- in cotton pellet-induced granuloma in rats. In addition, both compounds significantly decreased the percent of change in ear  in croton oil-induced ear edema in mice and the granuloma  in cotton pellet-induced granuloma in rats, to levels comparable to that of fluticasone. Both boswellic acid and withaferin A had no effect on adrenal index, but only withaferin A significantly increased the thymus index.

The present work investigated the activities of dioscin against liver fibrosis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Dioscin effectively inhibited the cell viabilities of HSC-T6, LX-2 and primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), but not hepatocytes. Furthermore, dioscin markedly increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) expression and significantly reduced a-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), collagen α1 (I) (COL1A1) and collagen α1 (III) (COL3A1) levels in vitro. Notably, dioscin inhibited HSCs activation and induced apoptosis in activated HSCs. In vivo, dioscin significantly improved  and hydroxylproline, laminin, α-SMA, TGF-β1, COL1A1 and COL3A1 levels, which were confirmed by histopathological assays. Dioscin facilitated matrix degradation, and exhibited hepatoprotective effects through the attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, in addition to exerting anti-fibrotic effects through the modulation of the TGF-β1/Smad, Wnt/β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitochondrial signaling pathways, which triggered the senescence of activated HSCs. In conclusion, dioscin exhibited potent effects against liver fibrosis through the modulation of multiple targets and signaling pathways and should be developed as a novel candidate for the treatment of liver fibrosis in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323133>[New variety breeding of Dioscorea alata, cultivar "Wenshanyao No.1].</a></h2><p>To breed a new yam cultivar of Dioscorea alata, the different and excellent germplasm resources were investigated within artificially cultivated population and some superior individuals, with a higher yield and medicinal properties, were selected.

Among the drying techniques used, air drying had the highest effect on steroidal alkaloid contents, followed by freeze drying and vacuum oven drying. There was no significant difference between the freeze dried and vacuum oven dried samples in their α-chaconine contents. However, freeze dried potato shoots and berries had significantly higher α-solanine contents (825 µg/g dry  (DW) in shoots and 2453 µg/g DW in berries) than the vacuum oven dried ones (325 µg/g dry  (DW) in shoots and 2080 µg/g DW in berries).

In this study, the blood glucose regulation activity and mechanism of total saponins from P. kingianum (TSPK) were investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats in this research.TSPK (0.025g/kg and 0.1mg/kg) was administrated by gavage to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 8 weeks. Changes of , food intakes, blood glucose, serum insulin and lipid indexes were observed. Genome-wide expression profiling was applied to explore the gene expression alternation after treated with TSPK. Expressions of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the relative transcript level of glucose kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (GK/G6P) in the liver were investigated. Meanwhile, contents of AMPK, and glucose transporter subtype-4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle, and peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) in adipose tissue were investigated.TSPK could effectively alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic rats. Genome-wide expression profiling showed that TSPK up-regulated the expression of GLUT4 while down-regulated the expression of G6P in insulin signal pathway. In the liver, the expression of AMPK and GK are increased. Further more, TSPK promoted the expressions of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, respectively.These results provide possible mechanisms for the antidiabetic effects of TSPK. TSPK could promote not only glycogenesis but also glucose utilization in peripheral tissue. Our results suggested that TSPK may be used as adjuvant therapy to control blood glucose and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic individuals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study was designed to explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of treatment with TT extracts and the involvement of androgens, the androgen receptor (AR), insulin growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1) and the IGF‑1 receptor (IGF‑1R). A total of 32 Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into groups as follows: Control; TT, treated with TT extracts, E, high intensity exercise; E+TT, high intensity exercise plus TT treatment. The rats of the E and E+TT groups underwent high intensity exercise with a progressively increasing load for 5 weeks, and TT extracts were intragastrically administered in the TT and E+TT rats 30 min prior to training. TT extract composition was analyzed using ultra‑high performance liquid chromatography‑quadrupole‑time of flight mass spectrometry. Testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels and AR, IGF‑1R and myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein levels in muscles were determined by ELISA and western blotting, respectively. The saponins tigogenin and  comprised ~71.35% of the total peak area. Compared with the E group, TT extracts increased the testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels, and AR, IGF‑1R and MHC protein levels in the gastrocnemius of rats undergoing high intensity exercise, accompanied with increased  and gastrocnemius . In conclusion, the effect of TT extracts on the performance of high intensity exercise rats may be attributed to increased levels of circulating testosterone and IGF‑1 and increased AR and IGF‑1R protein expression levels in the gastrocnemius, resulting in increased muscle  and increased MHC in the gastrocnemius. The present study provided preliminary evidence supporting the use of TT extracts as a dietary supplement for the promotion of skeletal muscle mass increase and the enhancement of athletic performance in humans performing high intensity exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174784>Development of a new certified reference material of  using mass balance approach and Coulometric titration method.</a></h2><p>Certified reference materials (CRMs) can be used as a valuable tool to validate the trueness of measurement methods and to establish metrological traceability of analytical results.  has been selected as a candidate reference material.

However, the mechanisms of  (DG) that promote cholesterol homeostasis and alleviate hypercholesterolemia remain elusive. To investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of the promotion of cholesterol metabolism by DG, a rat model of hypercholesterolemia was induced by providing a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the rats were intragastrically administered high-dose DG (0.3 g/kg/d), low-dose DG (0.15 g/kg/d) or simvastatin (4 mg/kg/d) once a day for 8 weeks. The serum and hepatic cholesterol were tested, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and the ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) transporters were measured. The results indicate that DG could reduce , decrease the serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, liver total cholesterol and free cholesterol levels compared to those in the controls. Simultaneously, liver tissue pathological morphology analyses revealed that DG could attenuate hepatic steatosis compared to that in the high-fat diet group. Further investigation demonstrated that DG significantly decreased the expression of NPC1L1 and LXR-α in the intestine and markedly increased the expression of ABCG5/G8 in the liver and intestine. Compared to the high-fat diet group, the rats in the DG-treated groups ameliorated hypercholesterolemia in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest that DG may not only inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption by downregulating NPC1L1 but also enhance cholesterol excretion by increasing the expression of ABCG5/G8. DG could be a new candidate for the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Before and After Mudabbar Process.</a></h2><p>Mudabbar/ is referred to the processes performed on the drugs to detoxify, purify, and enhance therapeutic action and to reduce its doses before making the formulations in Unani medicine. It improves quality of drugs either by optimizing its desirable characteristics or minimizing the undesirable ones; it makes drug effective, safe, and specific. There is a need of comparative evaluation to understand its significance. Tadbeer of Kharekhasak (KK) khurd ( Linn. fruit) is described by Rabban Al-Tabari in Firdausul Hikmat, Akbar Arzani in Qarabadeene Qadri, etc., during the compounding of aphrodisiac formulations. Mudabbar Kharekhasak (MKK) used in  mentioned in Al-Qarabadeene was evaluated in this work.Mudabbar/Tadbeer process was carried out by blending fresh KK. Juice with powdered dry KK and drying it under the sun. Juice used for process is thrice the  of dry KK powder. The KK before and after the process was evaluated using physicochemical tests: powder characterization, extractive value, alcohol and water soluble matter, ash value, loss on drying (LOD) at 105°C, pH, high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) fingerprinting, and  content.Powder characterizations were set in. Increase in successive and nonsuccessive extractive values in various solvents, water/alcohol-soluble content, total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-soluble ash, and sulfated ash of MKK was noted in comparison with KK. Decrease in LOD at 105°C and pH of MKK powder was observed. HPTLC fingerprinting data were developed for the identification and evaluation. Quantification of  content increased to 432.1 g/g in MKK as compared to 144.5 g/g in KK, suggesting significant increase in saponin content.Data obtained clearly indicated changes in MKK validating the classical Mudabbar process, probably to enhance/modify the action of drug. Standards for crude and MKK were established for future reference.Mudabbar process on  Linn (KK) havebeen validated.Physicochemical data for Mudabbar and non mudabbar Kharekhasak (KK) powder have been set in. content was increased significantly in mudabbar KK.
