Metformin is almost exclusively eliminated through the kidney primarily through active secretion mediated by Oct1, Oct2, and Mate1. The purpose of this study was to determine how  affects kidney transporter expression and metformin pharmacokinetics. A single oral dose of [(14)C]metformin was administered to C57BL/6J (wild type [WT]) and diabetic ob/ob mice fed either a control diet or a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Metformin plasma concentrations were slightly increased in the WT/MCD and ob/control groups, whereas plasma concentrations were 4.8-fold higher in ob/MCD mice compared with WT/control. The MCD diet significantly increased plasma half-life and mean residence time and correspondingly decreased oral clearance in both genotypes. These changes in disposition were caused by ob/ob- and MCD diet-specific decreases in the kidney mRNA expression of Oct2 and Mate1, whereas Oct1 mRNA expression was only decreased in ob/MCD mice. These results indicate that the diabetic ob/ob genotype and the MCD disease model alter kidney transporter expression and alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, potentially increasing the risk of drug toxicity.© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in the surfactant monolayer that coats and stabilizes lipid droplets within cells, and choline is required for its major biosynthetic pathway. Phosphatidylcholine-transfer protein (PC-TP), which exchanges phosphatidylcholines among membranes, is enriched in hepatocytes. PC-TP also regulates fatty acid metabolism through interactions with thioesterase superfamily member 2. We investigated the contribution of PC-TP to steatohepatitis induced by the MCD diet.  and wild-type control mice were fed the MCD diet for 5 wk and were then euthanized for histopathologic and biochemical analyses, as well as determinations of mRNA and protein expression. Whereas all mice developed steatohepatitis, plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were only elevated in wild-type mice, indicating that  mice were protected from MCD diet-induced hepatocellular injury. Reduced hepatotoxicity due to the MCD diet in the absence of PC-TP expression was further evidenced by decreased activation of c-Jun and reduced plasma concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 21. Despite similar total hepatic concentrations of phosphatidylcholines and other lipids, the relative abundance of microvesicular lipid droplets within hepatocytes was reduced in  mice. Considering that the formation of larger lipid droplets may serve to protect against lipotoxicity in , our findings suggest a pathogenic role for PC-TP that could be targeted in the management of this condition. Phosphatidylcholine-transfer protein (PC-TP) is a highly specific phosphatidylcholine-binding protein that we previously showed to regulate hepatocellular nutrient metabolism through its interacting partner thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2). This study identifies a pathogenic role for PC-TP, independent of Them2, in the methionine- and choline-deficient diet model of experimental steatohepatitis. Our current observations suggest that PC-TP promotes liver injury by mediating the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholines, thus stabilizing more pathogenic microvesicular lipid droplets.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29126873>Dual role of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in the progression and reversion of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with , and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited , NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced . Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted  compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions M2 macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during  only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In  patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in  progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or  and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895242>Hepatocellular carcinoma in a mouse model fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and represents the outcome of the natural history of chronic liver disease. The growing rates of HCC may be partially attributable to increased numbers of people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). However, details of the liver-specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the NAFLD--HCC progression remain unclear, and mouse models that can be used to explore the exact factors that influence the progression of NAFLD/ to the more chronic stages of liver disease and subsequent HCC are not yet fully established. We have previously reported a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) as a dietary  model with rapidly progressive liver fibrosis in mice. The current study in C57BL/6J mice fed CDAHFD provided evidence for the chronic persistence of advanced hepatic fibrosis in  and disease progression towards HCC in a period of 36 weeks. When mice fed CDAHFD were switched back to a standard diet, hepatic steatosis was normalized and NAFLD activity score improved, but HCC incidence increased and the phenotype of fibrosis-associated HCC development was observed. Moreover, when mice continued to be fed CDAHFD for 60 weeks, HCC further developed without severe body weight loss or carcinogenesis in other organs. The autochthonous tumours showed a variety of histological features and architectural patterns including trabecular, pseudoglandular and solid growth. The CDAHFD mouse model might be a useful tool for studying the development of HCC from NAFLD/, and potentially useful for better understanding pathological changes during hepatocarcinogenesis.© 2017 The Authors.

Additionally, it is unclear if multiple subsets of KCs are present during . Here, we characterized the liver macrophage subsets during methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced  and recovery. We observed a significant reduced contribution of Ly6CClec4FTim4KCs to the hepatic macrophage pool in MCD fed mice, which normalized during recovery. Ly6CClec4FTim4 monocyte-derived macrophages increased during MCD feeding and returned to baseline during recovery. Ly6CClec4FTim4 monocyte-derived KCs developed during initial recovery but did not self-renew as their numbers were reduced after full recovery. Initial recovery from MCD diet feeding was further characterized by increased proportions of Ki-67 proliferating KCs. In conclusion, the hepatic macrophage pool undergoes substantial albeit transient changes during  and recovery, with the KC pool being maintained by proliferation and differentiation of short-lived monocyte-derived KCs.Copyright © 2017.

To determine whether circulating fatty acids could serve as diagnostic markers of NAFLD severity and whether specific fatty acids could contribute to the pathogenesis of , we analyzed two independent NAFLD patient cohorts and used the methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD)  mouse model. We identified six fatty acids that could serve as non-invasive markers of  in patients with NAFLD. Serum levels of 15:0, 17:0 and 16:1n7t negatively correlated with NAFLD activity scores and hepatocyte ballooning scores, while 18:1n7c serum levels strongly correlated with fibrosis stage and liver inflammation. Serum levels of 15:0 and 17:0 also negatively correlated with fasting glucose and AST, while 16:1n7c and 18:1n7c levels positively correlated with AST and ferritin, respectively. Inclusion of demographic and clinical parameters improved the performance of the fatty acid panels in detecting  in NAFLD patients. The panel [15:0, 16:1n7t, 18:1n7c, 22:5n3, age, ferritin and APRI] predicted intermediate or advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with 82% sensitivity at 90% specificity [AUROC = 0.92]. 15:0 and 18:1n7c were further selected for functional studies in vivo. Mice treated with 15:0-supplemented MCD diet showed reduced AST levels and hepatic infiltration of ceroid-laden macrophages compared to MCD-treated mice, suggesting that 15:0 deficiency contributes to liver injury in . In contrast, 18:1n7c-supplemented MCD diet didn't affect liver pathology.

On the last day, the animals were sacrificed and plasma and liver tissue were collected. Serum and liver tissue biochemical analyses and histological observation were performed. The human hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 was used to build  models by culturing with conditioned medium from WRL-68 liver cells after exposure to MCD medium in vitro. Liver oxidative stress and inflammatory indices and autophagy markers were examined. The results showed that AA suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation in a  mouse model and inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines and ROS in LX-2 cells in MCD medium.

Among these is the mislocalization of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP2)/Mrp2 away from the canalicular membrane, which results in decreased transport of MRP2/Mrp2 substrates. The exact mechanism of this mislocalization is unknown, although increased activation of membrane retrieval processes may be one possibility. The current study measures the activation status of various mediators implicated in the active membrane retrieval or insertion of membrane proteins to identify which processes may be important in rodent methionine and choline deficient diet-induced . The mediators currently known to be associated with transporter mislocalization are stimulated by oxidative stressors and choleretic stimuli, which play a role in the pathogenesis of . The activation of protein kinases PKA, PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε and substrates radixin, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate, and Rab11 were measured by comparing the expression, phosphorylation, and membrane translocation between control and . Many of the mediators exhibited altered activation in  rats. Consistent with membrane retrieval of Mrp2,  rats exhibited a decreased phosphorylation of radixin and increased membrane localization of PKCδ and PKCε, thought to be mediators of radixin dephosphorylation.

C57BL/6 Gadd45a-null and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) for eight weeks and phenotypic changes examined. Gadd45a-null mice had more severe hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, higher levels of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and pro-apoptotic proteins, and greater oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress compared with WT mice. Indeed, Gadd45a mRNA was induced in response to ER stress in primary hepatocytes. Lipidomic analysis of  livers demonstrated decreased triacylglycerol (TG) in MCD-treated Gadd45a-null mice, which was associated with increased mRNAs encoding phospholipase D (Pld1/2), phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2A, and choline/ phosphotransferase 1 (Cept1), involved in the phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidic acid-diacylglycerol cycle, and decreased mRNAs encoding fatty acid (FA)-binding protein 1 (Fabp1) and FA transport protein 5. Treatment of cultured primary hepatocytes with tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β, and hydrogen peroxide led to the corresponding induction of Fabp1, Pld1/2, and Cept1 mRNAs. Collectively, Gadd45α plays protective roles against MCD-induced  likely due to attenuating cellular stress and ensuing inflammatory signaling.

Livers were harvested for histological, Western blot (α-SMA), and q-PCR analyses for expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, iNOS, ICAM-1) and pro-fibrogenic (Col1, α-SMA, TIMP-1) genes.In vitro, Flu (1-20 μM) inhibited PA-induced free-radical production, gp91 (phox) expression, and NFκB p65 translocation in HepG2 and PRHs, while CM-induced α-SMA protein expression and pro-fibrogenic gene expressions in HSC-T6 were suppressed in Flu-pretreated cells compared to those without pretreatment. Moreover, α-SMA protein expression was significantly decreased in HSC-T6 cultured with CM from PA-Flu-treated PRHs compared to those cultured with CM from PA-treated PRHs. Flu also reduced steatosis and fibrosis scores, α-SMA protein expression, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic genes in livers of CDAA rats.We demonstrated PA-induced HSC activation through paracrine effect of hepatocyte in vitro that was significantly suppressed by pre-treating HSC with Flu.

Both the in-vivo and in-vitro effects of DIM on Treg/Th17 imbalance during  progression were analyzed. The in-vivo blocking of CD25 or IL-17 was performed to respectively deplete respective function of Treg or Th17 subset. Besides, with the assistance of AhR antagonist CH223191 and anti-TLR4 neutralizing antibody, we designed the in-vitro DIM-incubation experiments to discuss the roles of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (CYP1A1, CYP1B1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on DIM's effects when shifting Treg/Th17 imbalance. Notably, in  mouse models, DIM alleviated hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and shifted the Treg/Th17 imbalance from MCD diet-induced Th17 dominance to Treg dominance. In-vitro, DIM not only significantly up-regulated the mRNAs of Foxp3 (Treg-specific) in purified spleen CD4(+) T cells, but also enhanced the immunosuppressive function of these Treg cells. Besides, DIM significantly up-regulated the proteins of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 whereas down-regulated those of TLR4 on CD4(+) T cells from MCD-diet mice. Moreover, blocking AhR attenuated while blocking TLR4 enhanced the effects of DIM when regulating Treg/Th17 imbalance. Conclusively, DIM could be used as a potential therapeutic candidate to treat  based on its dramatic induction of Treg dominance to alleviate intra-hepatic inflammation, suggesting us a clue that the dietary cruciferous vegetables (containing abundant DIM) might exist as a protective factor for patients with -related liver diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a variable in drug disposition, yet the impact on renal transport processes has yet to be fully understood. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis on the pharmacokinetics of adefovir in rats given a control or methionine and choline deficient diet to induce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Animals received a bolus dose of 7mg/kg (35μCi/kg) [(3)H] adefovir with consequent measurement of plasma and urine concentrations. Inulin clearance was used to determine glomerular filtration rate.Methionine and choline deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis prolonged the elimination half-life of adefovir. This observation occurred in conjunction with reduced distribution volume and hepatic levels of adefovir. Notably, despite these changes, renal clearance and overall clearance were not changed, despite markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Alteration of glomerular filtration rate was fully compensated for by a significant increase in tubular secretion of adefovir. Analysis of renal transporters confirmed transcriptional up-regulation of Mrp4, the major transporter for adefovir tubular secretion.This study demonstrates changes to glomerular filtration and tubular secretion that alter pharmacokinetics of adefovir in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-induced changes in renal drug elimination processes could have major implications in variable drug response and the potential for toxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial on children with biopsy-proven  based on a combinatorial nutritional approach compared with placebo. Participants were assigned to lifestyle modification plus placebo or lifestyle modification plus a mix containing docosahexaenoic acid, choline, and vitamin E (DHA-CHO-VE). Forty children and adolescents participated in the entire trial. The primary outcome was the improvement of liver hyperechogenicity. Secondary outcomes included alterations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and other metabolic parameters. Furthermore, changes of serum bile acids (BA) and plasma fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) levels were evaluated as inverse biomarkers of disease severity. At the end of the study, we observed a significant decrease in severe steatosis in the treatment group (50% to 5%, p = 0.001). Furthermore, although the anthropometric and biochemical measurements in the placebo and DHA-CHO-VE groups were comparable at baseline, at the end of the study ALT and fasting glucose levels improved only in the treatment group. Finally, we found that BA levels were not influenced whereas FGF19 levels were significantly increased by DHA-CHO-VE. The results suggest that a combination of DHA, VE, and CHO could improve steatosis and reduce ALT and glucose levels in children with .

Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), a biliary efflux transporter, exhibits increased liver mRNA expression in  patients and preclinical  models, but the impact on function is unknown. It was shown that the transport capacity of multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is decreased in . SN-38, the active irinotecan metabolite, is reported to be a substrate for Bcrp, whereas SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) is a Mrp2 substrate. The purpose of this study was to determine the function of Bcrp in  through alterations in the disposition of SN-38 and SN-38G in a  knockout (Bcrp KO) and methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) model of . Sprague Dawley [wild-type (WT)] rats and Bcrp rats were fed either a methionine- and choline-sufficient (control) or MCD diet for 8 weeks to induce . SN-38 (10 mg/kg) was administered i.v., and blood and bile were collected for quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In Bcrp rats on the MCD diet, biliary efflux of SN-38 decreased to 31.9%, and efflux of SN-38G decreased to 38.7% of control, but WT-MCD and KO-Control were unaffected. These data indicate that Bcrp is not solely responsible for SN-38 biliary efflux, but rather implicate a combined role for BCRP and MRP2. Furthermore, the disposition of SN-38 and SN-38G is altered by Bcrp and  in a gene-by-environment interaction and may result in variable drug response to irinotecan therapy in polymorphic patients.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711489>Time-course microarrays reveal early activation of the immune transcriptome in a choline-deficient mouse model of liver injury.</a></h2><p>Choline-deficient diet is extensively used as a model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we explored genes in the liver for which the expression changed in response to the choline-deficient (CD) diet.Male CD-1 mice were divided into two groups and fed a CD diet with or without 0.2% choline bitartrate for one or three weeks. Hepatic levels of choline metabolites were analyzed by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and hepatic gene expression profiles were examined by DNA microarray analysis.The CD diet lowered liver choline metabolites after one week and exacerbated fatty liver between one and three weeks. We identified >300 genes whose expression was significantly altered in the livers of mice after consumption of this CD diet for one week and showed that liver gene expression profiles could be classified into six distinct groups. This study showed that STAT1 and interferon-regulated genes was up-regulated after the CD diet consumption and that the Stat1 mRNA level was negatively correlated with liver phosphatidylcholine level. Stat1 mRNA expression was actually up-regulated in isolated hepatocytes from the mouse liver with the CD diet.This study provides insight into the genomic effects of the CD diet through the Stat1 expression, which might be involved in NAFLD development.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The traditional Chinese formula Salvia-Nelumbinis naturalis (SNN) is effectively applied to improve the symptoms of nonalcoholic simple fatty liver (NAFL) patients. Previous studies have confirmed that SNN could reduce the liver lipid deposition and serum transaminases of NAFL experimental models. This study aims to determine whether SNN is effective for murine  model and investigate the underlying pharmacological mechanisms.C57BL/6 J mice were fed with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for six weeks to induce . Simultaneously, SNN or saline was intragastrically administered daily to the mice in the SNN or model group, respectively. A standard diet was given to the control mice. Serum biochemical indices and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured. Liver histopathology was observed, and the contents of triglycerides and lipid peroxide malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver homogenates were evaluated. The hepatic expression and/or activation of genes associated with inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were determined by quantitative RT-PCR or Western blot analysis.The prominent liver steatosis displayed in the  model was prevented by SNN. The liver injury of  mice was obviously manifested by the increased levels of serum transaminases and bilirubin, as well as the lobular inflammation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated apoptosis in liver tissues. SNN administration improved the aforementioned pathological changes. The increased hepatic levels of MDA and cytochrome P450 2E1 of the model confirmed the unregulated balance of oxidative stress. The hepatic expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its target genes decreased, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in the model mice increased. Treating the mice with SNN significantly improved oxidative stress-related harmful factors.This study shows that SNN can protect the liver from severe steatosis and damage induced by MCD diet, which suggests the potential use of SNN on the treatment of  patient. The results also indicate that improving the hepatic antioxidant capability of the liver may contribute to the underlying hepatoprotective mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414763>Enhanced offspring predisposition to steatohepatitis with maternal high-fat diet is associated with epigenetic and microbiome alterations.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an important co-morbidity associated with obesity and a precursor to steatohepatitis. However, the contributions of gestational and early life influences on development of NAFLD and  remain poorly appreciated.Two independent studies were performed to examine whether maternal over-nutrition via exposure to high fat diet (HFD) leads to exacerbated hepatic responses to post-natal HFD and methionine choline deficient (MCD) diets in the offspring. Offspring of both control diet- and HFD-fed dams were weaned onto control and HFD, creating four groups.When compared to their control diet-fed littermates, offspring of HF-dams weaned onto HFD gained greater body weight; had increased relative liver weight and showed hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Similarly, this group revealed significantly greater immune response and pro-fibrogenic gene expression via RNA-seq. In parallel, 7-8 week old offspring were challenged with either control or MCD diets for 3 weeks. Responses to MCD diets were also exacerbated due to maternal HFD as seen by gene expression of classical pro-fibrogenic genes. Quantitative genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of over 1 million CpGs showed persistent epigenetic changes in key genes in tissue development and metabolism (Fgf21, Ppargc1β) with maternal HFD and in cell adhesion and communication (VWF, Ephb2) in the combination of maternal HFD and offspring MCD diets. Maternal HFD also influenced gut microbiome profiles in offspring leading to a decrease in α-diversity. Linear regression analysis revealed association between serum ALT levels and Coprococcus, Coriobacteriacae, Helicobacterioceae and Allobaculum.Our findings indicate that maternal HFD detrimentally alters epigenetic and gut microbiome pathways to favor development of fatty liver disease and its progressive sequelae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27320964>MicroRNA-21 is associated with fibrosis in a rat model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and serves as a plasma biomarker for fibrotic liver disease.</a></h2><p>Evidence indicates that hepatic fibrosis is the initial lesion of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). To induce , we fed rats a choline-deficient and iron-supplemented L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet. Histopathological examination revealed that fibrosis appeared from week 4 and progressed to bridging fibrosis from week 12. Using qRT-PCR assays, we detected increased expression of miR-21, Mmp-9, and Timp-1 in liver that peaked during week 4, when fibrosis was first detected. The expression pattern of miR-21 in plasma paralleled that in liver. Fibrosis tended to be resolved within 12 weeks of a recovery period after 12 weeks of feeding, and the expression of miR-21, Timp-1, and Mmp-9 decreased in liver. Comprehensive analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression in the liver using samples acquired at week 4 detected 16 miRNAs and 11 mRNAs that are mutually-interacting fibrosis-related factors.

In this study, we investigated the protective role of EETs in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in mice and the potential mechanisms. We used 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea(TPPU), a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, to increase the endogenous EET level in mice. Upon TPPU treatment, the liver steatosis and inflammatory damage were significantly ameliorated in mice with steatohepatitis, paralleled by the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) as well as chemokines (CXCL1, MCP-1). Compared with untreated  mice, mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and inflammation relevant adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were downregulated, whereas mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPAR-α) was elevated in TPPU-treated mice.

Gut-liver communication and microbiota composition have been identified as critical drivers of the NAFLD progression. Hence, it has been shown that microbiota depletion can ameliorate high-fat diet or western-diet induced experimental Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). However, its functional implications in the methionine-choline dietary model, remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the physiological relevance of gut microbiota in methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet induced . Experimental liver disease was induced by 8 weeks of MCD feeding in wild-type (WT) mice, either with or without commensal microbiota depletion, by continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic (AB) treatment. MCD diet induced steatohepatitis was accompanied by a reduced gut microbiota diversity, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. MCD treatment prompted macroscopic shortening of the intestine, as well as intestinal villi in histology. However, gut microbiota composition of MCD-treated mice, neither resembled human , nor did it augment the intestinal barrier integrity or intestinal inflammation. In the MCD model, AB treatment resulted in increased steatohepatitis activity, compared to microbiota proficient control mice. This phenotype was driven by pronounced neutrophil infiltration, while AB treatment only slightly increased monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) abundance. Our data demonstrated the differential role of gut microbiota, during steatohepatitis development. In the context of MCD induced steatohepatitis, commensal microbiota was found to be hepatoprotective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845295>Inhibitory action of novel hydrogen sulfide donors on bovine isolated posterior ciliary arteries.</a></h2><p>In the present study, we investigate the inhibitory effect of novel H2S donors, AP67 and AP72 on isolated bovine posterior ciliary arteries (PCAs) under conditions of tone induced by an adrenoceptor agonist. Furthermore, we examined the possible mechanisms underlying the AP67- and AP72-induced relaxations. Isolated bovine PCA were set up for measurement of isometric tension in organ baths containing oxygenated Krebs solution. The relaxant action of H2S donors was studied on phenylephrine-induced tone in the absence or presence of enzyme inhibitors for the following pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX); H2S; nitric oxide and the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel. The H2S donors,  (1 nM - 10 μM), AP67 (1 nM - 10 μM) and AP72 (10 nM - 1 μM) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine-induced tone in isolated bovine PCA. While the COX inhibitor, flurbiprofen (3 μM) blocked significantly (p < 0.05) the inhibitory response elicited by AP67, it had no effect on relaxations induced by  and AP72. Both aminooxyacetic acid (30 μM) and propargylglycine (1 mM), enzyme inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis caused significant (p < 0.05) rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve to AP67 and AP72. Furthermore, the KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide (300 μM) and the NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME (100 μM) significantly attenuated (p < 0.05) the relaxation effect induced by AP67 and AP72 on PCA. We conclude that H2S donors can relax pre-contracted isolated bovine PCA, an effect dependent on endogenous production of H2S. The inhibitory action of only AP67 on pre-contracted PCA may involve the production of inhibitory endogenous prostanoids. Furthermore, the observed inhibitory action of H2S donors on PCA may depend on the endogenous biosynthesis of NO and by an action of KATP channels.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, however, there is no established treatment for this disease. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have been used to treat patients with decompensated cirrhosis.In order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the effects of BCAAs on hepatic steatosis and disease progression, we investigated the effects of BCAA supplementation in mice fed a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHF), which induces .Male mice were divided into four groups that received (1) choline-sufficient high fat (HF) diet (HF-control), (2) HF plus 2% BCAA in drinking water (HF-BCAA), (3) CDHF diet (CDHF-control), or (4) CDHF-BCAA for 8weeks. We monitored liver injury, hepatic steatosis and cholesterol, gene expression related to lipid metabolism, and hepatic fat accumulation.Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and hepatic triglyceride (TG) were significantly elevated in CDHF-control relative to HF-control. Liver histopathology revealed severe steatosis, inflammation, and pericellular fibrosis in CDHF-control, confirming the  findings. Serum ALT levels and hepatic TG and lipid droplet areas were significantly lower in CDHF-BCAA than in CDHF-control. Gene expression and protein level of fatty acid synthase (FAS), which catalyzes the final step in fatty acid biosynthesis, was significantly decreased in CDHF-BCAA than in CDHF-control (P<0.05). Moreover, hepatic total and free cholesterol of CDHF-BCAA was significantly lower than those of CDHF-control.BCAA can alleviate hepatic steatosis and liver injury associated with  by suppressing FAS gene expression and protein levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been investigated extensively in the context of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of mTORC1 in  remains largely unknown.mTORC1 activity in macrophages in human mild and severe  liver was compared. Mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) subunit and littermate controls were fed a high-fructose, palmitate, and cholesterol diet for 24 weeks or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet for 4 weeks to develop .We report that in human beings bearing , macrophage mTORC1 activity was lower in livers experiencing severe vs mild  liver. Moreover, macrophage mTORC1 disruption exacerbated the inflammatory response in 2 diet-induced  mouse models. Mechanistically, in response to apoptotic hepatocytes (AHs), macrophage polarization toward a M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype was inhibited in Raptor-deficient macrophages. During the digestion of AHs, macrophage mTORC1 was activated and coupled with dynamin-related protein 1 to facilitate the latter's phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium release. Ionomycin or A23187, calcium ionophores, prevented Raptor deficiency-mediated failure of lysosome acidification and subsequent lipolysis. Blocking dynamin-related protein 1-dependent mitochondria fission impaired lysosome function, resulting in reduced production of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukins 10 and 13.Persistent mTORC1 deficiency in macrophages contributes to the progression of  by causing lysosome dysfunction and subsequently attenuating anti-inflammatory M2-like response in macrophages during clearance of AHs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a risk factor for HCC. In mice that are fed with a methionine-choline deficient diet for two weeks to induce advanced murine , we do see increased hepatic levels of TUBA8 protein. In animals given a high-fat diet for 14 weeks or an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks, hepatic TUBA8 is unchanged. TUBA8 is highly expressed in human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and co-localizes with the HSC marker desmin in the murine liver. Inflammatory (TNF, LPS, IL-6) and profibrotic mediators (TGF-beta) do not regulate TUBA8 in HepG2 cells, primary HSC and the HSC cell line LX-2, when stimulated for 24 h. Agonists of the farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, which are nuclear receptors involved in  and HCC pathophysiology, have no effect on TUBA8 in HepG2 and LX-2 cells. In human HCC tissues of 18 patients TUBA8 is significantly upregulated when compared to the corresponding non-tumorous tissues. Compared to non-transformed hepatocytes, TUBA8 protein is strongly expressed in transformed cells. Thus, TUBA8 is a marker of HSC whose cell number is increased in , while higher levels in HCC may be related to induction of TUBA8 in parenchymal cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27357826>MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis is associated with alterations in asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and its transporters.</a></h2><p>Using an experimental model of  induced by a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, we investigated whether changes occur in serum and tissue levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Male Wistar rats underwent  induced by 8-week feeding with an MCD diet. Serum and hepatic biopsies at 2, 4 and 8 weeks were taken, and serum enzymes, ADMA and nitrate/nitrite (NOx), were evaluated. Hepatic biopsies were used for mRNA and protein expression analysis of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) and protein methyltransferases (PRMT-1), enzymes involved in ADMA metabolism and synthesis, respectively, and ADMA transporters (CAT-1, CAT-2A and CAT-2B). Lipid peroxides (TBARS), glutathione, ATP/ADP and DDAH activity were quantified. An increase in serum AST and ALT was detected in MCD animals. A time-dependent decrease in serum and tissue ADMA and increase in mRNA expression of DDAH-1 and PRMT-1 as well as higher rates of mRNA expression of CAT-1 and lower rates of CAT-2A and CAT-2B were found after 8-week MCD diet. An increase in serum NOx and no changes in protein expression in DDAH-1 and CAT-1 and higher content in CAT-2 and PRMT-1 were found at 8 weeks. Hepatic DDAH activity decreased with a concomitant increase in oxidative stress, as demonstrated by high TBARS levels and low glutathione content. In conclusion, a decrease in serum and tissue ADMA levels in the MCD rats was found associated with a reduction in DDAH activity due to the marked oxidative stress observed. Changes in ADMA levels and its transporters are innovative factors in the onset and progression of hepatic alterations correlated with MCD diet-induced .</p></html>
