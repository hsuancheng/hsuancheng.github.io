Src-associated in mitosis of 68 kDa (Sam68) is potentially significant, because knockout (KO) of Sam68 leads to markedly reduced adiposity. In the present study, we sought to determine the mechanism by which Sam68 regulates adiposity and energy homeostasis. We first found that Sam68 KO mice have a significantly reduced body weight as compared to controls, and the difference is explained entirely by decreased adiposity. Interestingly, these effects were not mediated by a difference in food intake; rather, they were associated with enhanced physical activity. When they were fed a high-fat diet, Sam68 KO mice gained much less body weight and fat mass than their WT littermates did, and they displayed an improved glucose and insulin tolerance. In Sam68 KO mice, the brown adipose tissue (BAT), inguinal, and epididymal depots were smaller, and their adipocytes were less hypertrophied as compared to their WT littermates. The BAT of Sam68 KO mice exhibited reduced lipid stores and expressed higher levels of Ucp1 and key thermogenic and fatty acid oxidation genes. Similarly, depots of inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) in Sam68 KO mice appeared browner, their multilocular Ucp1-positive cells were much more abundant, and the expression of Ucp1, Cidea, Prdm16, and Ppargc1a genes was greater as compared to WT controls, which suggests that the loss of Sam68 also promotes WAT browning. Furthermore, in all of the fat depots of the Sam68 KO mice, the expression of  macrophage markers was up-regulated, and that of M1 markers was down-regulated. Thus, Sam68 plays a crucial role in controlling thermogenesis and may be targeted to combat obesity and associated disorders.© 2015 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26573796>Obesity Contributes to Ovarian Cancer Metastatic Success through Increased , Enhanced Vascularity, and Decreased Infiltration of M1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy, with high mortality attributable to widespread intraperitoneal metastases. Recent meta-analyses report an association between obesity, ovarian cancer incidence, and ovarian cancer survival, but the effect of obesity on metastasis has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to use an integrative approach combining in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies to test the hypothesis that obesity contributes to ovarian cancer metastatic success. Initial in vitro studies using three-dimensional mesomimetic cultures showed enhanced cell-cell adhesion to the lipid-loaded mesothelium. Furthermore, in an ex vivo colonization assay, ovarian cancer cells exhibited increased adhesion to mesothelial explants excised from mice modeling diet-induced obesity (DIO), in which they were fed a "Western" diet. Examination of mesothelial ultrastructure revealed a substantial increase in the density of microvilli in DIO mice. Moreover, enhanced intraperitoneal tumor burden was observed in overweight or obese animals in three distinct in vivo models. Further histologic analyses suggested that alterations in lipid regulatory factors, enhanced vascularity, and decreased M1/ macrophage ratios may account for the enhanced tumorigenicity. Together, these findings show that obesity potently affects ovarian cancer metastatic success, which likely contributes to the negative correlation between obesity and ovarian cancer survival.©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29434927>Upregulation of pyruvate kinase  expression by fatty acid synthase contributes to gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancer types. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a multifunctional protein homodimer that can convert acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl-CoA into palmitate, thus regulating . FASN overexpression has also been shown to cause resistance to gemcitabine, a chemotherapy treatment for pancreatic cancer; however, the mechanism by which this happens is unclear. Analysis of gene expression of FASN and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) in pancreatic cancer was performed using Oncomine microarray gene expression datasets, which demonstrated that FASN and PKM2 were upregulated in pancreatic cancer compared with normal tissue. Specifically, it was demonstrated that FASN enabled the upregulation of PKM2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, increasing the glucose consumption rate in pancreatic cancer cells. The present study also revealed that decreased levels of FASN reduced resistance to gemcitabine treatment, which was induced by PKM2 overexpression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, FASN may represent a novel therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26450946>Effect of Aging on Adipose Tissue Inflammation in the Knee Joints of F344BN Rats.</a></h2><p>The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) secretes inflammatory mediators in osteoarthritic knees, but the effect of aging on IFP inflammation is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that aging increases basal and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated IFP inflammation in 10-, 20-, and 30-month-old male F344BN F1-hybrid rats. IFPs were cultured ex vivo for 24 hours and treated ±1ng/mL IL-1β to simulate injury-induced inflammation. IFP inflammation was evaluated by measuring secreted cytokine concentrations and by quantitative expression of immunoregulatory and pro- and anti-adipogenic genes. With age, osteoarthritis pathology increased and IFP mass decreased. Although adipocyte size did not change with age, variation in adipocyte size was positively associated with synovial thickness independent of age whereas associations with cartilage damage were age dependent. In the absence of IL-1β, aging was associated with a significant increase in IFP secretion of tumor necrosis factor α by 67% and IL-13 by 35% and a reduction in the expression of immunoregulatory  macrophage genes. However, following an IL-1β challenge,  markers decreased and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines increased independent of age. The lone exception was leptin, which decreased >70% with age. Thus, although aging promotes osteoarthritis risk by increasing basal inflammation, our findings also revealed a potentially protective effect of aging by decreasing IL-1β-stimulated leptin production.© The Author 2015.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) stimulate lipid biosynthesis through transcriptional activation of lipogenic enzymes. However, SREBPs' roles and potential interacting partners in cancer cells are not fully defined. Using a biochemical approach, we found here that pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) physically interacts with the nuclear form of SREBP-1a (nBP1a), by binding to amino acids 43-56 in nBP1a. We also found that PKM2 activates SREBP target gene expression and lipid biosynthesis by stabilizing nBP1a proteins. Using a competitive peptide inhibitor to block the formation of the SREBP-1a/PKM2 complex, we observed that this blockade inhibited lipogenic gene expression. Of note, nBP1a phosphorylation at Thr-59 enhanced the binding to PKM2 and promoted cancer cell growth. Moreover, we show that PKM2 phosphorylates Thr-59  Lastly, in human patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, nBP1a phosphorylation at Thr-59 was negatively correlated with clinical outcomes. Together, our results reveal that nBP1a/PKM2 interaction activates lipid metabolism genes in cancer cells and that Thr-59 phosphorylation of SREBP-1a plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625338>Metformin delays AKT/c-Met-driven hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating signaling pathways for de novo lipogenesis and ATP generation.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy with few effective options for therapeutic treatment in its advanced stages. Metformin, a first-line oral agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, exhibits efficacy in metabolic reprogramming fueling changes in cell growth and proliferation for multiple cancer types, including HCC. However, the molecular mechanism by which metformin delays hepatocarcinogenesis in individuals with hepatic steatosis remains rare. Here, we investigate the preventive efficacy of metformin in a rapid AKT/c-Met-triggered HCC mouse model featuring excessive levels of steatosis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, Oil Red O staining and immunoblotting were applied for mechanistic investigations. Pharmacological and biochemical strategies were employed to illuminate molecular evidence for HCC cell lines. The results show that metformin obstructs the malignant transformation of hepatocytes in AKT/c-Met mice. Mechanistically, metformin reduces the expression of phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and two forms of proto-oncogenes, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, in AKT/c-Met mice. Moreover, metformin ameliorates FASN-mediated aberrant lipogenesis and HK2/PKM2-driven ATP generation in vivo. Furthermore, metformin represses the expression of FASN and HK-2 by targeting c-Myc in an AMPK-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, metformin is effective at inhibiting PKM2 expression in the presence of an AMPK inhibitor compound C, suggesting that its functioning in PKM2 is AMPK-independent. Our study experimentally validates a novel molecular mechanism by which metformin alleviates enhanced lipogenesis and high energy metabolism during hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that metformin may serve as an agent for the prevention of HCC in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 is used clinically for skeletal repair, but in vivo administration can induce abnormal, adipose-filled, poor-quality bone. We demonstrate that NELL-1 combined with BMP2 significantly optimizes osteogenesis in a rodent femoral segmental defect model by minimizing the formation of BMP2-induced adipose-filled cystlike bone. In vitro studies using the mouse bone marrow stromal cell line -10B4 and human primary bone marrow stromal cells have confirmed that NELL-1 enhances BMP2-induced osteogenesis and inhibits BMP2-induced . Importantly, the ability of NELL-1 to direct BMP2-treated cells toward osteogenesis and away from  requires intact canonical Wnt signaling. Overall, these studies establish the feasibility of combining NELL-1 with BMP2 to improve clinical bone regeneration and provide mechanistic insight into canonical Wnt pathway activity during NELL-1 and BMP2 osteogenesis. The novel abilities of NELL-1 to stimulate Wnt signaling and to repress  may highlight new treatment approaches for bone loss in osteoporosis.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The protein structure consists of a single polypeptide chain containing two carbohydrate-recognition domains joined by a linker region. Galectin-12 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, but is also detected in macrophages and other leukocytes. Downregulation of galectin-12 in mouse 3T3-L1 cells impairs their differentiation into adipocytes. Conversely, overexpression of galectin-12 in vitro induces cell cycle arrest in G1 and apoptosis. Upregulation of galectin-12 and initiation of G1 cell cycle arrest are associated with driving pre-adipocytes toward terminal differentiation. Galectin-12 deficiency increases insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in obese animals. Galectin-12 inhibits macrophage polarization to the  population, enhancing inflammation and decreasing insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. Galectin-12 also affects myeloid differentiation, which is associated with chemotherapy resistance. In addition to highlighting the above-mentioned aspects, this review also discusses the potential clinical applications of modulating the function of galectin-12.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25555214>Metabolically normal obese people are protected from adverse effects following weight gain.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and increased intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content, both of which are key risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, a subset of obese people does not develop these metabolic complications. Here, we tested the hypothesis that people defined by IHTG content and insulin sensitivity as "metabolically normal obese" (MNO), but not those defined as "metabolically abnormal obese" (MAO), are protected from the adverse metabolic effects of weight gain.Body composition, multiorgan insulin sensitivity, VLDL apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) kinetics, and global transcriptional profile in adipose tissue were evaluated before and after moderate (~6%) weight gain in MNO (n = 12) and MAO (n = 8) subjects with a mean BMI of 36 ± 4 kg/ who were matched for BMI and fat mass.Although the increase in body weight and fat mass was the same in both groups, hepatic, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity deteriorated, and VLDL apoB100 concentrations and secretion rates increased in MAO, but not MNO, subjects. Moreover, biological pathways and genes associated with adipose tissue  increased in MNO, but not MAO, subjects.These data demonstrate that MNO people are resistant, whereas MAO people are predisposed, to the adverse metabolic effects of moderate weight gain and that increased adipose tissue capacity for  might help protect MNO people from weight gain-induced metabolic dysfunction.ClinicalTrials.gov .This work was supported by NIH grants UL1 RR024992 (Clinical Translational Science Award), DK 56341 (Nutrition and Obesity Research Center), DK 37948 and DK 20579 (Diabetes Center Grant), and UL1 TR000450 (KL2 Award); a Central Society for Clinical and Translational Research Early Career Development Award; and by grants from the Longer Life Foundation and the Kilo Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797572>Chronic phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition has beneficial effects on subcutaneous adipose tissue plasticity in type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>Different adipose tissue (AT) depots are associated with multiple metabolic risks. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is involved in adipocyte physiology and PDE5 inhibition may affect  and ameliorate white AT quality. The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of AT and the composition of the stroma-vascular fraction (SVF) of subcutaneous AT (SAT) in type 2 diabetic mice after prolonged treatment with a PDE5 inhibitor, Sildenafil. 18 db/db mice were treated with Sildenafil or vehicle for 12 weeks. AT distribution was monitored and SAT was processed for isolation of SVF by flow cytometry. Sildenafil induced an overall reduction in AT, mainly in visceral AT (VAT), compared with SAT. In Sildenafil-treated mice, the mean change in body weight from baseline positively correlated with VAT, but not with SAT. Characterization of SVF of SAT showed an increase in the frequency of  macrophages and endothelial cells in treated mice.

Two different types of macrophages exist in the fat tissue: the classically activated macrophage (M1) and the alternatively activated macrophage (). In this study, we investigated whether M1/ macrophages play distinct roles in adipogenic differentiation of PDGFRα preadipocytes.Mouse preadipocytes and macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6 male mice of 6-8 weeks. The culture supernate of M1 and  macrophages was collected and co-cultured with the PDGFRα preadipocytes. After 3 days, Oil Red O staining was used to evaluate to adipogenic differentiation of PDGFRα preadipocytes and the expression of adipogenic-related transcription factors (C/EBP-α, PPARγ) were also tested.The results showed that when cultured in vitro, M1 macrophages could significantly suppress the  of PDGFRα preadipocytes as well as the C/EBP-α and PPARγ expression, but  macrophages did not have significant influence on the  of PDGFRα preadipocytes nor on C/EBP-α and PPARγ expression compared with the control group.M1 macrophages significantly suppress PDGFRα preadipocyte  which provides a possible way to improve  and fat retention after fat-free grafting by mitigating acute inflammation and manipulating M1 macrophage levels.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

In addition, both interventions increased hepatic mitochondrial markers (citrate synthase activity and fatty acid oxidation) and suppressed markers of de novo  (fatty acid synthase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, Elovl fatty acid elongase 6, and steroyl CoA desaturase-1), whereas only MOD EX increased hepatic mitochondrial Beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (β-HAD) activity and hepatic triglyceride export marker apoB100 and lowered fatty acid transporter CD36 compared with O-SED. Moreover, whereas total hepatic macrophage population markers (CD68 and F4/80 mRNA) did not differ among groups, MOD EX and VIG EX lowered M1 macrophage polarization markers (CD11c, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α mRNA) and MOD EX increased  macrophage marker, CD206 mRNA, compared with O-SED.The accumulation of 15 min·d(-1) of VIG EX for 12 wk had similar effectiveness as 60 min·d(-1) of MOD EX in the management of NAFLD in OLETF rats.

The mechanisms that trigger involution of hemangioma into fibro-fatty tissue remain unknown. We report a novel mechanism by which M1-polarized macrophages induce endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and promote hemangioma regression. M1- but not -polarized macrophages induced EndMT in ECs. Tumor necrosis factor-α and, to a lesser extent, IL-1β and interferon-γ were the most potent cytokines produced by the M1 macrophages that induce in vitro EndMT. Western blot analysis and gene expression profiling showed that ECs treated with M1 macrophages, tumor necrosis factor-α, or IL-1β decreased the expression of endothelial markers, whereas mesenchymal markers increased concomitantly. Immunohistochemical staining of patient samples revealed that a significant perivascular infiltration of M1, but not , macrophages coincides with endothelial expression of the critical EndMT transcription factors Snail/Slug in involuting hemangiomas. Most strikingly, M1 macrophage-treated ECs isolated from patient hemangiomas (HemECs) but not untreated HemECs readily differentiated into adipocytes on adipogenic induction. Thus, in vitro EndMT and  of HemECs have, in part, recapitulated the natural history of hemangioma regression. In conclusion, our findings indicate that EndMT induced by M1 macrophages promotes infantile hemangioma regression and may lead to novel therapeutic treatments for this vascular tumor.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

As NAFLD progresses, triglycerides increase within hepatocytes, causing typical vacuoles that resemble adipocytes. However, whether these morphological changes in hepatocytes indicate potential functional changes is unclear. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) containing 42% fat. Markers for adipocytes in the liver were measured using real-time PCR, Western blot, and double immunofluorescent labeling. Cytokines in cell culture supernatants were quantified with ELISA. To determine the macrophage phenotype, hepatic classical M1 markers and alternative  markers were analyzed. After a 24-week feeding period, adipocyte markers aP2 and PPARγ increased at both the mRNA and protein level in the liver of HFD-fed mice. FITC-labeled aP2 and rhodamine-labeled albumin were both stained in the cytoplasm of steatotic hepatocytes as observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cell membrane-bound E-cadherin and albumin expression were reduced in steatotic hepatocytes compared to controls. However, hepatic adiponectin and adiponectin receptor-2 expression decreased with upregulation of hepatic CD36, suggesting impaired adiponectin activity in livers of HFD-fed mice. Moreover, steatotic primary hepatocytes not only released pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-18, but also could activate macrophages when co-cultured in vitro. In vivo, hepatic expression of M1 genes such as iNOS and TNFα was markedly increased in HFD-fed mice. In contrast, hepatic expression of  genes such as Arg1 and CD206 was significantly reduced. Specifically, the ratio of TNFα to CD206 in HFD-fed mice was notably upregulated. Overexpression of adipocyte-specific genes in hepatocytes and their secretory function and epithelial phenotype impairment in NAFLD cause functional changes in steatotic hepatocytes aside from morphological changes. This suggests that adipogenic changes in hepatocytes are involved in pathogenesis of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29133512>Exosomes From Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Attenuate Adipose Inflammation and Obesity Through Polarizing  Macrophages and Beiging in White Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) play critical roles in controlling obesity-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders. Exosomes from ADSCs exert protective effects in several diseases, but their roles in obesity and related pathological conditions remain unclear. In this study, we showed that treatment of obese mice with ADSC-derived exosomes facilitated their metabolic homeostasis, including improved insulin sensitivity (27.8% improvement), reduced obesity, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. ADSC-derived exosomes drove alternatively activated  macrophage polarization, inflammation reduction, and beiging in white adipose tissue (WAT) of diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, exosomes from ADSCs transferred into macrophages to induce anti-inflammatory  phenotypes through the transactivation of arginase-1 by exosome-carried active STAT3. Moreover,  macrophages induced by ADSC-derived exosomes not only expressed high levels of tyrosine hydroxylase responsible for catecholamine release, but also promoted ADSC proliferation and lactate production, thereby favoring WAT beiging and homeostasis in response to high-fat challenge. These findings delineate a novel exosome-mediated mechanism for ADSC-macrophage cross talk that facilitates immune and metabolic homeostasis in WAT, thus providing potential therapy for obesity and diabetes.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29106032>The effects of conditioned media generated by polarized macrophages on the cellular behaviours of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Macrophages (Mφs) are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological events including wound healing and tissue regeneration, in which they play both positive and negative roles depending on their polarization state. In this study, we investigated the cellular behaviours of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) after incubation in different conditioned media (CMs) generated by unpolarized Mφs (M0) or polarized Mφs (M1 and ). Mφ polarization was induced by stimulation with various cytokines, and CMs were obtained from in vitro Mφ cultures termed CM0, CM1 and CM2 based on each Mφ phenotype. We found that CM1 supported the proliferation and adipogenic differentiation of BMMSCs, whereas CM0 had a remarkable effect on cell osteogenic differentiation. To a certain degree, CM2 also facilitated BMMSC osteogenesis; in particular, cells incubated with CM2 exhibited an enhanced capacity to form robust stem cell sheets. Although incubation with CM1 also increased production of extracellular matrix components, such as fibronectin, COL-1 and integrin β1during sheet induction, the sheets generated by CM2-incubated cells were thicker than those generated by CM1-incubated cells (P < 0.001). Our data suggest that each Mφ phenotype has a unique effect on BMMSCs. Fine-tuning Mφ polarization following transplantation may serve as an effective method to modulate the therapeutic potential of BMMSCs.© 2017 The Authors.

We previously demonstrated that treatment with a β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) agonist triggers brown/beige  in gonadal white adipose tissue following adipocyte death and clearance by tissue macrophages. The close physical relationship between adipocyte progenitors and tissue macrophages suggested that the macrophages that clear dying adipocytes might generate proadipogenic factors. Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages from mice treated with CL 316,243 identified a subpopulation that contained elevated lipid and expressed CD44. Lipidomic analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated macrophages demonstrated that CD44+ macrophages contained four- to five-fold higher levels of the endogenous peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligands 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), and 13-HODE compared with CD44- macrophages. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ADRB3 agonist treatment upregulated expression of ALOX15, the lipoxygenase responsible for generating 9-HODE and 13-HODE. Using an in vitro model of adipocyte efferocytosis, we found that IL-4-primed tissue macrophages accumulated lipid from dying fat cells and upregulated expression of Alox15. Furthermore, treatment of differentiating adipocytes with 9-HODE and 13-HODE potentiated brown/beige .

Clinical studies have demonstrated an association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and both inflammation and fibrosis in NASH, but the mechanism has not been identified. In this study, we use  modeling to examine the impact of intermittent hypoxia on the liver. Hepatocyte, stellate cell, and macrophage cell lines were exposed to intermittent or sustained hypoxia. Candidate genes associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and  were analyzed. Circulating cytokines were assessed in human serum of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Intermittent hypoxia results in significant induction of interleukin (IL)-6 expression in both hepatocytes and macrophages. The increase in IL-6 expression was independent of hypoxia inducible factor 1 induction but appeared to be in part related to antioxidant response element and nuclear factor kappa B activation. Mature microRNA 365 (miR-365) has been demonstrated to regulate IL-6 expression, and we found that miR-365 expression was decreased in the setting of intermittent hypoxia. Furthermore, macrophage cell lines showed polarization to an M1 but not  phenotype. Finally, we found a trend toward higher circulating levels of IL-6 in patients with OSA and NASH. : Intermittent hypoxia acts as a potent proinflammatory stimulus, resulting in IL-6 induction and M1 macrophage polarization. Increased IL-6 expression may be due to both induction of antioxidant response element and nuclear factor kappa B as well as inhibition of miR-365 expression. Higher levels of IL-6 were observed in human samples of patients with OSA and NASH. These findings provide biological insight into mechanisms by which obstructive sleep apnea potentiates inflammation and fibrosis in patients with fatty liver disease.

In this study, we hypothesized that DWJ504, an extract of O ficus-indica seed, would ameliorate hepatic steatosis and inflammation by regulating hepatic de novo  and macrophage polarization against experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Mice were fed a normal diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. DWJ504 (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) were orally administered for the last 4 weeks of the 10-week HFD feeding period. DWJ504 treatment remarkably attenuated HFD-induced increases in hepatic lipid content and hepatocellular damage. DWJ504 attenuated increases in sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein expression and a decrease in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Although DWJ504 augmented peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α protein expression, it attenuated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression. Moreover, DWJ504 promoted hepatic  macrophage polarization as indicated by attenuation of the M1 marker genes and enhancement of  marker genes. Finally, DWJ504 attenuated expression of toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor κB, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon β, and interferon β levels. Our results demonstrate that DWJ504 prevented intrahepatic lipid accumulation, induced  macrophage polarization, and suppressed the toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway.

Recent studies have proposed metabolic disorders can be attenuated by counteracting certain inflammatory signal pathways. In this study, we examined whether intervention with G31P, an antagonist of CXCL8, could attenuate tissue inflammation and development of metabolic disorders in db/db mice. The db/m and db/db mice were injected with G31P or equivalent normal saline for six weeks. The physical and metabolic parameters, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid accumulation, and inflammation markers were measured. G31P improved hepatic insulin sensitivity by modulating expression of genes related to  and phosphorylated AKT level. The expressions of several genes encoding proteins involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) were decreased in G31P-treated db/db mice. Meanwhile, immune cells infiltration and cytokines release were attenuated in db/db mice with G31P treatment. G31P also improved the ratio of pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory  macrophages. Furthermore, G31P ameliorates inflammation-associated metabolic disorders via inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 pathways. These data suggest the selective inhibition of CXC chemokines may have therapeutic effect on inflammation and its related metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455376>HSPA12A Is a Novel Player in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis via Promoting Nuclear PKM2-Mediated M1 Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Macrophage-mediated inflammation plays a critical role in NASH pathogenesis; however, optimum therapies for macrophage activation and NASH remain elusive. HSPA12A encodes a novel member of the HSP70 family. Here, we report that NASH patients showed increased hepatic HSPA12A expression and serum HSPA12A contents. Intriguingly, knockout of HSPA12A ( ) in mice attenuated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and injury. HFD-induced macrophage polarization toward an M1 phenotype and inflammatory responses in the liver of  mice were also attenuated. Loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed that the de novo  in hepatocytes was regulated by the paracrine effects of macrophage HSPA12A rather than by hepatocyte HSPA12A. In-depth molecular analysis revealed that HSPA12A interacted with the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in macrophages and increased its nuclear translocation, thereby promoting M1 polarization and secretion of proinflammatory M1 cytokines; this led, ultimately, to hepatocyte steatosis via paracrine effects. Taken together, these findings show that HSPA12A acts as a novel regulator of M1 macrophage polarization and NASH pathogenesis by increasing nuclear PKM2. Strategies that inhibit macrophage HSPA12A might be a potential therapeutic intervention for NASH.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248792>Crocin alleviates coronary atherosclerosis via inhibiting lipid synthesis and inducing  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease arising from an imbalance in lipid levels and the accumulation of cholesterol-laden macrophages in the artery wall. Crocin is an active ingredient of Crocus sativus L. This study established a rat coronary atherosclerosis model induced by vitamin D3 (VD3), to explore the effect of Crocin on lipid metabolism, macrophage polarization and the activity of inflammatory proteins. The results revealed that Crocin decreased blood lipid levels by decreasing the levels of endothelin (ET), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceridelow (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), elevating the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterin (HDL-c). Crocin also inhibited  by suppressing the expression of -related proteins and elevating lipid catabolism-related proteins. Moreover, Crocin effectively alleviated inflammation by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines. We further found that Crocin promoted macrophage polarization to the  phenotype by reducing M1 markers (CD40 and CD11c) and elevating  markers (CD68 and CD206). Finally, Crocin strongly inhibited the expression of NF-κB p65 and its translocation into the nucleus. Crocin partially counteracted nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) p65 expression and the nuclei accumulation caused by NF-κB p65 overexpression. Taken together, our research indicated that Crocin inhibited  and alleviated the inflammation in a VD3-induced rat coronary atherosclerosis model by promoting  macrophage polarization and maybe by inhibiting NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. This study implicates Crocin as a potential therapeutic strategy for coronary atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Immune molecules, including some cytokines, have a close relationship with metabolism. Interleukin (IL)-25 is a member of the IL-17 cytokine family that can regulate macrophages and alleviate some metabolic dysfunction; however, its role and mechanisms in lipid metabolism remain to be extensively clarified. Human serum and liver biopsy specimens, high-fat diet-induced obesity mice and DB/DB (Lepr-/-) animal models were used to examine IL-25 expression in obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). To observe the role of IL-25 in lipid metabolism, model mice were administered with IL-25 or adoptively transferred with IL-25-educated macrophages in vivo, whereas bone marrow-derived macrophages, the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and adipocytes differentiated from 3T3-L1 were used in vitro. IL-25 was decreased in NAFLD patients and obese mice. In addition, IL-25 reduced body weight gain and lipid accumulation, enhanced lipid uptake by macrophages and increased the expression of lipolysis and β-oxidation enzymes via alternatively activating macrophages. IL-25 also promoted lipolysis and suppressed  in adipocytes co-cultured with the IL-25-educated macrophages. Furthermore, IL-25 improved the mitochondrial respiratory capacity and oxygen consumption rate of macrophages and produced more NAD/NADH and ATP. In conclusion, IL-25 can stimulate  macrophage polarization and thereby promote lipolysis and mitochondrial respiratory capacity, highlighting the potential for IL-25 to be used as a therapeutic agent against obesity and associated metabolic syndromes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29701774>Associations Between Plasma Chemerin Concentrations and Bone Quality in Adults From the General Population.</a></h2><p>Chemerin is an adipokine associated with parameters of inflammation and the metabolic syndrome. Small observational studies suggested that high circulating chemerin levels are also related to bone erosion. We aimed to determine whether plasma chemerin levels are related to bone quality in the general population and to investigate the influence of body mass index (BMI) on that relation. For our analyses, we obtained data from 3583 adults who participated in the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania-Trend. The participants were divided into three groups according to their BMI: lean (<25 kg/), overweight (25 to 30 kg/), and obese (≥30 kg/). Chemerin concentrations were determined in EDTA plasma. Bone quality was assessed using quantitative ultrasound at the heel. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS), stiffness index, and osteoporotic fracture risk were derived from this measurement. Sex- and BMI-specific linear regression models revealed inverse associations between chemerin levels and BUA in obese men. In obese women, inverse relations between chemerin levels and SOS or stiffness index were found. Logistic regression models revealed positive associations between chemerin levels and osteoporotic fracture risk. In lean or overweight subjects, no statistically significant associations were found. Our sex- and BMI-specific analyses showed that inverse associations between chemerin levels and bone quality are restricted to obese men and women. The observed association may be due to a chemerin-induced negative affect on bone metabolism, possibly due to abrogation of osteoblastogenesis or stimulation of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293080>-like macrophages serve as a niche for adipocyte progenitors in adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) is composed not only of adipocytes, but also of macrophages, endothelial cells and preadipocytes. Macrophages are an important component of AT, and are involved in tissue homeostasis, tissue repair and fibrosis. AT-resident macrophages are categorized into two subtypes, the M1-like and -like macrophages. -like macrophages are reported to play anti-inflammatory roles, and to be involved in clearing and removal of dying/dead adipocytes, and recruiting adipocyte progenitors (APs). -like macrophages are also reported to be involved in the promotion of fibrosis in a transforming growth factor-β-dependent manner. However, the precise roles of -like macrophages in the AT have not yet been clearly delineated. Recently, we generated genetically engineered transgenic mice in which CD206 -like macrophages can be conditionally depleted. Unexpectedly, we found that the depletion of CD206 -like macrophages resulted in the enhanced generation of smaller adipocytes, improved insulin sensitivity and proliferation of APs. We further clarified that the CD206 -like macrophages directly interact with the APs to regulate their growth/differentiation and adipogenesis, thereby controlling adiposity and systemic insulin sensitivity. In the present review, we discuss how CD206 -like macrophages provide a niche for APs and maintain glucose homeostasis.© 2019 The Authors.

We retrospectively studied the potential interactions between iron and AT during an experimental overfeeding in participants without obesity.Twenty-six participants (mean body mass index ± SD, 24.7 ± 3.1 kg/) underwent a 56-day overfeeding (+760 kcal/d). Serum iron biomarkers (ELISA), subcutaneous AT (SAT) gene expression, and abdominal AT distribution assessed by MRI were analyzed at the beginning and the end of the intervention.Before intervention: SAT mRNA expression of the iron transporter transferrin (Tf) was positively correlated with the expression of genes related to  (lipin 1, ACSL1) and lipid storage (SCD). SAT expression of the ferritin light chain (FTL) gene, encoding ferritin (FT), an intracellular iron storage protein, was negatively correlated to SREBF1, a gene related to . Serum FT (mean, 92 ± 57 ng/mL) was negatively correlated with the expression of SAT genes linked to lipid storage (SCD, DGAT2) and to  (SREBF1, ACSL1). After intervention: Overfeeding led to a 2.3 ± 1.3-kg weight gain. In parallel to increased expression of lipid storage-related genes (mitoNEET, SCD, DGAT2, SREBF1), SAT Tf, SLC40A1 (encoding ferroportin 1, a membrane iron export channel) and hephaestin mRNA levels increased, whereas SAT FTL mRNA decreased, suggesting increased AT iron requirement. Serum FT decreased to 67 ± 43 ng/mL. However, no significant associations between serum iron biomarkers and AT distribution or expansion were observed.In healthy men, iron metabolism gene expression in SAT is associated with lipid storage and  genes expression and is modulated during a 56-day overfeeding diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473995>Chronic inflammation in skeletal muscle impairs satellite cells function during regeneration: can physical exercise restore the satellite cell niche?</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation impairs skeletal muscle regeneration. Although many cells are involved in chronic inflammation, macrophages seem to play an important role in impaired muscle regeneration since these cells are associated with skeletal muscle stem cell (namely, satellite cells) activation and fibro-adipogenic progenitor cell (FAP) survival. Specifically, an imbalance of M1 and  macrophages seems to lead to impaired satellite cell activation, and these are the main cells that function during skeletal muscle regeneration, after muscle damage. Additionally, this imbalance leads to the accumulation of FAPs in skeletal muscle, with aberrant production of pro-fibrotic factors (e.g., extracellular matrix components), impairing the niche for proper satellite cell activation and differentiation. Treatments aiming to block the inflammatory pro-fibrotic response are partially effective due to their side effects. Therefore, strategies reverting chronic inflammation into a pro-regenerative pattern are required. In this review, we first describe skeletal muscle resident macrophage ontogeny and homeostasis, and explain how macrophages are replenished after muscle injury. We next discuss the potential role of chronic physical activity and exercise in restoring the M1 and  macrophage balance and consequently, the satellite cell niche to improve skeletal muscle regeneration after injury.© 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29703762>New links between lipid accumulation and cancer progression.</a></h2><p>Individuals with elevated lipid levels are at risk for developing cardiovascular disease as well as cancer.

A key class of lipid-derived signalling molecules involved in inflammation are the prostaglandins. In this study, we aimed to determine how obesity affects the levels of prostaglandins within white adipose tissue (WAT) and determine which cells within adipose tissue produce them. To avoid the effects of cellular stress on prostaglandin levels, we developed a multivariate statistical approach in which metabolite concentrations and transcriptomic data were integrated, allowing the assignment of metabolites to cell types.Eicosanoids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and mRNA levels using real-time PCR. Eicosanoid levels and transcriptomic data were combined using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering in order to associate metabolites with cell types. Samples were obtained from C57Bl/6 mice aged 16 weeks. We studied the ob/ob genetically obese mouse model and diet-induced obesity model. We extended our results in mice to a cohort of morbidly obese humans undergoing bariatric surgery.Using our modelling approach, we determined that prostglandin D₂ (PGD₂) in adipose tissue was predominantly produced in macrophages by the haematopoietic isoform of prostaglandin D synthase (H-Pgds). Analysis of sub-fractionated WAT confirmed that H-Pgds was expressed in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Furthermore, H-Pgds expression in ATMs isolated from lean and obese mice was consistent with it affecting macrophage polarisation. Functionally, we demonstrated that H-PGDS-produced PGD₂ polarised macrophages toward an , anti-inflammatory state. In line with a potential anti-inflammatory role, we found that H-PGDS expression in ATMs was positively correlated with both peripheral insulin and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in humans.In this study, we have developed a method to determine the cellular source of metabolites within an organ and used it to identify a new role for PGD₂ in the control of ATM polarisation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237848>IL-17 axis accelerates the inflammatory progression of obese in mice via TBK1 and IKBKE pathway.</a></h2><p>Obesity mediates immune inflammatory response and induces IL-17 expression. Adipgenesis can be regulated by IL-17 and it causes TBK1 activation. The inhibition of TBK1 and the inhibition of I IKBKE reduces inflammatory response and improves obesity. It is hypothesized that IL-17 deficiency inhibits obesity progression and inflammation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated in vitro and treated with IL-17. RAW264.7 cells and differentiated 3T3-L1 were pretreated with TBK1 inhibitor and then stimulated with IL-17. Wild-type and IL-17 knock out mice were fed with high-fat diet. IL-17 inhibits adipocyte differentiation from mouse-derived 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and reduces mRNA expression of proadipogenic transcription factors and adipokines in adipocyte cells. IL-17 also showed up-regulation of mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in RAW cells. The inhibitor of TBK1 and IKBKE attenuates the effect of IL-17. Loss of IL-17 deficiency improves diet-induced obesity, fatty liver, glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. The expression of TBK1 and IKBKE decreased in the spleen and liver of IL-17 deficiency mice. Moreover, the inflammatory response within the visceral adipose tissue and Th1 cells were inhibited, however,  macrophage and Th2 cells increased in IL-17 deficiency mice. IL-17 inhibits  where a lack of IL-17 ameliorates glucose metabolism. As well, the inhibition of TBK1 reduces inflammation induced by IL-17. Therefore, IL-17 may be involved in the development of obesity and metabolic dysfunction in a TBK1-dependent manner.Copyright © 2017 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

Despite its increased global incidence, very few promising treatments for NASH are available. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent used to treat pulmonary fibrosis; it suppresses the pulmonary influx of T cells and macrophages. Here, we investigated the effect of pirfenidone in a mouse model of lipotoxicity-induced NASH via a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet. After 12 weeks of feeding, pirfenidone administration attenuated excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and peroxidation by reducing the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis and enhancing the expression of those related to fatty acid oxidation. Flow cytometry indicated that pirfenidone reduced the number of total hepatic macrophages, particularly CD11cCD206(M1)-type macrophages, increased the number of CD11cCD206()-type macrophages, and subsequently reduced T-cell numbers, which helped improve insulin resistance and steatohepatitis. Moreover, pirfenidone downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA expression of M1 marker genes and upregulated IL-4-induced  marker genes in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophages. Importantly, pirfenidone reversed insulin resistance, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with pre-existing NASH.

Here, we demonstrate that TACI-deficient mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) are protected from weight gain and dysregulated glucose homeostasis. Resistance to HFD-induced metabolic changes in TACI-deficient mice does not involve TACI-mediated . Instead, accumulation of  macrophages (Mϕs), eosinophils, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is implicated in the protection from obesity-induced assaults. In support of this hypothesis, adoptively transferred TACI-deficient peritoneal or adipose tissue Mϕs, but not B cells, can improve glucose metabolism in the obese host. Interestingly, the transferred TACI-deficient Mϕs not only home to host VAT but also trigger the accumulation of host  Mϕs and eosinophils in VAT. The increase in host  Mϕs in VAT is likely a result of eosinophil recruitment in response to eotaxin-2 produced by TACI-deficient Mϕs. Insulin signaling experiments revealed that IL-10 secreted by TACI-deficient Mϕs is responsible for maintaining adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Thus, the adoptive transfer experiments offer a model where TACI-deficient Mϕs accumulate in VAT and protect against metaflammation and obesity-associated dysregulation of glucose metabolism.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28642037>Testosterone regulates 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation and epididymal fat accumulation in mice through modulating macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p>Low testosterone levels are strongly related to obesity in males. The balance between the classically M1 and alternatively  polarized macrophages also plays a critical role in obesity. It is not clear whether testosterone regulates macrophage polarization and then affects adipocyte differentiation. In this report, we demonstrate that testosterone strengthens interleukin (IL) -4-induced  polarization and inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 polarization, but has no direct effect on adipocyte differentiation. Cellular signaling studies indicate that testosterone regulates macrophage polarization through the inhibitory regulative G-protein (Gαi) mainly, rather than via androgen receptors, and phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, testosterone inhibits pre-adipocyte differentiation induced by M1 macrophage medium. Lowering of serum testosterone in mice by injecting a luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) peptide increases epididymal white adipose tissue. Testosterone supplementation reverses this effect. Therefore, our findings indicate that testosterone inhibits pre-adipocyte differentiation by switching macrophages to  polarization through the Gαi and Akt signaling pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the postnatal brain, where sufficient oxygen for energy metabolism is scrupulously maintained, neural progenitors nevertheless metabolize glucose to lactate and prioritize lipid synthesis over fatty acid oxidation. Medulloblastoma, a cancer of neural progenitors that is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, recapitulates the metabolic phenotype of brain progenitor cells. During the physiologic proliferation of neural progenitors, metabolic enzymes generally associated with malignancy, including Hexokinase 2 (Hk2) and Pyruvate kinase  (PkM2) configure energy metabolism to support growth. In these non-malignant cells, expression of Hk2 and PkM2 is driven by transcriptional regulators that are typically identified as oncogenes, including N-myc. Importantly, N-myc continues to drive Hk2 and PkM2 in medulloblastoma. Similarly E2F transcription factors and PPARγ function in both progenitors and medulloblastoma to optimize energy metabolism to support proliferation. These findings show that the "metabolic transformation" that is a hallmark of cancer is not specifically limited to cancer. Rather, metabolic transformation represents a co-opting of developmental programs integral to physiologic growth. Despite their physiologic origins, the molecular mechanisms that mediate metabolic transformation may nevertheless present ideal targets for novel anti-tumor therapy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Our group is the first to report that B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) is produced from adipocytes and functions as a proinflammatory adipokine. Here, we investigated how loss of BAFF influenced diet-induced obesity in mice by challenging BAFF(-/-) mice with a high-fat diet for 10 weeks. The results demonstrated that weight gain in BAFF(-/-) mice was >30% than in control mice, with a specific increase in the fat mass of the subcutaneous region rather than the abdominal region. Expression of lipogenic genes was examined by quantitative real-time PCR, and increased  was observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), whereas  in the epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) was reduced. A significant decrease in EAT mass resulted in the downregulation of inflammatory gene expression in EAT, and more importantly, overall levels of inflammatory cytokines in the circulation were reduced in obese BAFF(-/-) mice. We also observed that the macrophages recruited in the enlarged SAT were predominantly  macrophages. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured with adipose tissue conditioned media (ATCM), demonstrating that EAT ATCM from BAFF(-/-) mice contains antilipogenic and anti-inflammatory properties.

Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), adrenic acid (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05).

Here, we first investigated the influence of macrophages on the differentiation of MSCs in vitro. We found that RAW246.7 macrophages cocultured with MSCs strongly blocked the differentiation progress and inhibited the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) during . Coculture with MSCs mainly induced macrophages toward  polarization. In addition, the expression of CXCL1 and its receptor, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2, CXCR2 are high during adipogenic differentiation of MSCs and not in mature adipocytes. Although CXCL1 had no effect on , treatment with a specific CXCR2 inhibitor, SB225002, hampered the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs. Blocking CXCR2 decreased p38 and Elk1 phosphorylation but increased the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation at the initial stage of , which suppressed the phosphorylation of p38/ERK-Elk1 at the late stage. Inhibition of ERK had similar effects on  and Elk1 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that MSCs interact with macrophages during adipogenic differentiation. CXCR2 regulates the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs by altering the activation of the p38/ERK-Elk1 signaling pathway.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593824>Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ Knockdown Impairs Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2-Induced Critical-Size Bone Defect Repair.</a></h2><p>The Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical dose (1.5 mg/mL) of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) has been reported to induce significant adverse effects, including cyst-like adipose-infiltrated abnormal bone formation. These undesirable complications occur because of increased , at the expense of osteogenesis, through BMP2-mediated increases in the master regulatory gene for , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Inhibiting PPARγ during osteogenesis has been suggested to drive the differentiation of bone marrow stromal/stem cells toward an osteogenic, rather than an adipogenic, lineage. We demonstrate that knocking down PPARγ while concurrently administering BMP2 can reduce , but we found that it also impairs BMP2-induced osteogenesis and leads to bone nonunion in a mouse femoral segmental defect model. In addition, in vitro studies using the mouse bone marrow stromal cell line -10B4 and mouse primary bone marrow stromal cells confirmed that PPARγ knockdown inhibits BMP2-induced ; attenuates BMP2-induced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and osteogenesis; and escalates BMP2-induced cell apoptosis. More important, BMP receptor 2 and 1B expression was also significantly inhibited by the combined BMP2 and PPARγ knockdown treatment. These findings indicate that PPARγ is critical for BMP2-mediated osteogenesis during bone repair. Thus, uncoupling BMP2-mediated osteogenesis and  using PPARγ inhibition to combat BMP2's adverse effects may not be feasible.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Understanding the mechanisms of cell metabolic reprogramming may present a new basis for liver cancer treatment. In our previous study, we reported that a novel oncogene eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) promotes tumorigenesis under hypoxic condition. Here, we aim to investigate the role of EIF5A2 in cell metabolic reprogramming during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. In this study, we reported that the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of EIF5A2 was upregulated in 59 of 105 (56.2%) HCC clinical samples (P = 0.015), and EIF5A2 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter survival time of patients with HCC (P = 0.021). Ectopic expression of EIF5A2 in HCC cell lines significantly promoted cell growth and accelerated glucose utilization and  rates. The high rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion conferred by EIF5A2 revealed an abnormal activity of aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells. Several key enzymes involved in glycolysis including glucose transporter type 1 and 2, hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase liver type, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase  isoform, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A were upregulated by overexpression of EIF5A2. Moreover, EIF5A2 showed positive correlations with FASN and ACSS2, two key enzymes involved in the fatty acid de novo biosynthetic pathway, at both protein and mRNA levels in HCC. These results indicated that EIF5A2 may regulate fatty acid de novo biosynthesis by increasing the uptake of acetate. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EIF5A2 has a critical role in HCC cell metabolic reprogramming and may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for liver cancer treatment.© The Author 2016.

Here, we compared the immunophenotypic profile of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) from lean and obese individuals, and explored its relationship with the apparent altered plasticity of hASCs. We also hypothesized that persistent hypoxia treatment of cultured hASCs may be necessary but not sufficient to drive significant changes in mature adipocytes. hASCs were obtained from subcutaneous adipose tissue of healthy, adult, female donors undergoing abdominal plastic surgery: lean (n=8; body mass index [BMI]: 23±1 kg/) and obese (n=8; BMI: 35±5 kg/). Cell surface marker expression, proliferation and migration capacity, and adipogenic differentiation potential of cultured hASCs at two different oxygen conditions were studied. Compared with lean-derived hASCs, obese-derived hASCs demonstrated increased proliferation and migration capacity but decreased lipid droplet accumulation, correlating with a higher expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II and cluster of differentiation (CD) 106 and lower expression of CD29. Of interest, adipogenic differentiation modified CD106, CD49b, HLA-ABC surface protein expression, which was dependent on the donor's BMI. Additionally, low oxygen tension increased proliferation and migration of lean but not obese hASCs, which correlated with an altered CD36 and CD49b immunophenotypic profile. In summary, the differences observed in proliferation, migration, and differentiation capacity in obese hASCs occurred in parallel with changes in cell surface markers, both under basal conditions and during differentiation. Therefore, obesity is an important determinant of stem cell function independent of oxygen tension.The obesity-related hypoxic environment may have latent effects on human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) with potential consequences in mature cells. This study explores the immunophenotypic profile of hASCs obtained from lean and obese individuals and its potential relationship with the altered plasticity of hASCs observed in obesity. In this context, an altered pattern of cell surface marker expression in obese-derived hASCs in both undifferentiated and differentiated stages is demonstrated. Differences in proliferation, migration, and differentiation capacity of hASCs from obese adipose tissue correlated with alterations in cell surface expression. Remarkably, altered plasticity observed in obese-derived hASCs was maintained in the absence of hypoxia, suggesting that these cells might be obesity conditioned.©AlphaMed Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26288359>Macrophages Contribute to the Progression of Infantile Hemangioma by Regulating the Proliferation and Differentiation of Hemangioma Stem Cells.</a></h2><p>Macrophage infiltration has been implicated in infantile hemangioma (IH), the most common tumor of infancy. However, the exact role of macrophages in IH remains unknown. This study aims to clarify the functional significance of macrophages in the progression of IH. The distribution of macrophages in human IH was analyzed, and our results revealed that polarized macrophages were more prevalent in proliferating IHs than in involuting IHs, which was consistent with the increased macrophage-related cytokines in proliferating IHs. In vitro results further demonstrated that polarized macrophages effectively promoted the proliferation of hemangioma stem cells (HemSCs) and suppressed their  in an Akt- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2)-dependent manner. Moreover, - but not M1-polarized macrophages promoted the endothelial differentiation of HemSCs. Furthermore, mixing macrophages in a murine hemangioma model elevated microvessel density and postponed fat tissue formation, which was concomitant with the activation of Akt and Erk1/2 signals. Cluster analysis revealed a close correlation among the macrophage markers, Ki67, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), p-Akt, and p-Erk1/2 in human IH tissues. Collectively, our results suggest that macrophages in IH contribute to tumor progression by promoting the proliferation and endothelial differentiation while suppressing the  of HemSCs. These findings indicate that targeting the infiltrating macrophages in IH is a promising therapeutic approach to accelerate IH regression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating /M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut Microbiota Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues. Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit  via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It seems that results from single tissue are not enough to explain how changes affect humans as a complex biological system.The aim of this study was to compare, from obesity subjects, PBMC and white adipose tissue gene expression that regulates  (perilipin 1 [PLIN1], adrenoreceptor beta 3 [ADRB3] and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPARG2]) and the energy metabolism (uncoupling protein UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3) process.This study enrolled 35 obese patients, with a body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/ (obesity group [OG]), and ten eutrophic health subjects, 18 > BMI > 24.9 kg/ (control group [CG]). Anthropometric and body composition data were assessed at recruitment using standardized protocols. Samples of peripheral blood and subcutaneous adipose tissue (biopsy) were collected to analyze gene expression by RT-qPCR technique. For statistical analysis, we used the Shapiro-Wilk test and Wilcoxon tests by the SPSS software version 20.0; a p < 0.05 significance level was adopted.There were significant differences of PLIN1, ADRB3, PPARG2 and UCP3 expression between blood against adipose tissue samples, showing that these genes are upregulated in adipose tissue. UCP2 expression was upregulated in PBMC.The PLIN1, ADRB3, PPARG2 and UCP3 genes were preferentially expressed in adipose tissue. However, UCP2 was upregulated in PBMC, suggesting that this gene may be assessed in a peripheral blood cell, which is easily accessible, safe and practical.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462349>BMP4 facilitates beige fat biogenesis via regulating adipose tissue macrophages.</a></h2><p>Thermogenic beige fat improves metabolism and prevents obesity. Emerging evidence shows that the activation of  macrophages stimulates beige , whereas the activation of M1 macrophages, which play a major role in inflammation, impedes beige . Thus, the identification of factors that regulate adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) will help clarify the mechanism involved in beiging. Here, we found that one of the secreted proteins in adipose tissue, namely, BMP4, alters the ATM profile in subcutaneous adipose tissue by activating  and inhibiting M1 macrophages. Mechanistically, the BMP4-stimulated p38/MAPK/STAT6/PI3K-AKT signalling pathway is involved. Meanwhile, BMP4 improved the potency of  macrophages to induce beige fat biogenesis. Considering that the overexpression of BMP4 in adipose tissue promotes the beiging of subcutaneous adipose tissue and improves insulin sensitivity, these findings provide evidence that BMP4 acts as an activator of beige fat by targeting immuno-metabolic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30382157>A reduced M1-like/-like ratio of macrophages in healthy adipose tissue expansion during SGLT2 inhibition.</a></h2><p>The adipose tissue includes various stromal cells, such as preadipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells, which are involved in adipose tissue functions. We previously reported that, in obese mice, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) promoted the expansion of the epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) with increase of serum ketone body concentration. The Ipra-induced adipose tissue expansion did not deteriorate adipose inflammation, or systemic glucose/lipid metabolism, referred to as "healthy adipose tissue expansion." Here we found that Ipra promoted healthy adipose tissue expansion with a reduced ratio of pro-inflammatory M1-like adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) to anti-inflammatory -like ATMs. Ipra downregulated the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-15 (Il15) in stromal cells of Epi. IL-15 inhibited  in 3T3-L1 cells associated with downregulation of the lipogenic gene. Ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate suppressed Il15 gene induction in M1-polarized cultured macrophages, and a ketogenic diet reproduced the adipose tissue expansion without deteriorating systemic glucose metabolism in mice. Our data indicate that the phenotypic switch of ATMs could mediate healthy adipose tissue expansion by treatment with Ipra, and it may offer new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adipose tissue expansion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323935>Association of In Vivo Adipose Tissue Cellular Kinetics With Markers of Metabolic Health in Humans.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) expansion occurs by hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Impaired hyperplasia, or , has been associated with obesity-related diseases.We examined how in vivo  in the subcutaneous abdominal (scABD) and femoral (scFEM) depots (via 8-week incorporation of deuterium) correlates with markers of metabolic health.Data from 52 women with obesity [27 black and 25 white; 29.7 ± 5.5 years; body mass index (BMI) 32.2 ± 2.8 kg/; 44.3% ± 4.0% body fat] were analyzed at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.A linear repeated measure model was used to assess the fraction of new adipose cells and the associated covariates. Akaike information criterion determined the covariates that best described the data. Simple associations were examined using Spearman's correlation.The covariates that were associated with adipose kinetics included BMI, visceral AT/total abdominal AT (VAT/TAT) ratio, and the Matsuda index. Simple correlations demonstrated that adipocyte and preadipocyte formation in scABD (P = 0.02 and P = 0.16, trend, respectively) and scFEM (P = 0.01 and P = 0.24, trend, respectively) depots correlated positively with VAT/TAT. Preadipocyte and adipocyte formation in the scABD (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively) and scFEM (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively) was negatively associated with insulin sensitivity.Our results challenge the AT expandability hypothesis and suggest that higher in vivo adipose cell turnover is positively associated with BMI and VAT/TAT and negatively associated with insulin sensitivity, all correlates of impaired metabolic health.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036059>Acyl Glucuronide Metabolites of 6-Chloro-5-[4-(1-hydroxycyclobutyl)phenyl]-1 H-indole-3-carboxylic Acid (PF-06409577) and Related Indole-3-carboxylic Acid Derivatives are Direct Activators of Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK).</a></h2><p>Studies on indole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as direct activators of human adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α1β1γ1 isoform have culminated in the identification of PF-06409577 (1), PF-06885249 (2), and PF-06679142 (3) as potential clinical candidates.

We evaluated the effect of glycine on metabolic steatohepatitis in genetically obese, diabetic KK-A mice. Male KK-A mice were fed a diet containing 5% glycine for 4 wk, and liver pathology was evaluated. Hepatic mRNA levels for lipid-regulating molecules, cytokines/chemokines, and macrophage M1/ markers were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Hepatic expression of natural killer (NK) T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Body weight gain was significantly blunted and development of hepatic steatosis and inflammatory infiltration were remarkably prevented in mice fed the glycine-containing diet compared with controls. Indeed, hepatic induction levels of molecules related to  were largely blunted in the glycine diet-fed mice. Elevations of hepatic mRNA levels for TNFα and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 were also remarkably blunted in the glycine diet-fed mice. Furthermore, suppression of hepatic NK T cells was reversed in glycine diet-fed KK-A mice, and basal hepatic expression levels of NK T cell-derived cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, were increased. Moreover, hepatic mRNA levels of arginase-1, a marker of macrophage  transformation, were significantly increased in glycine diet-fed mice. In addition, dietary glycine improved glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia in KK-A mice. These observations clearly indicate that glycine prevents maturity-onset obesity and metabolic steatohepatitis in genetically diabetic KK-A mice. The underlying mechanisms most likely include normalization of hepatic innate immune responses involving NK T cells and  transformation of Kupffer cells. It is proposed that glycine is a promising immunonutrient for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome-related nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25903417>Immune Cells and Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Low-grade inflammation in the obese AT (AT) and the liver is a critical player in the development of obesity-related metabolic dysregulation, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Myeloid as well as lymphoid cells infiltrate the AT and the liver and expand within these metabolic organs as a result of excessive nutrient intake, thereby exacerbating tissue inflammation. Macrophages are the paramount cell population in the field of metabolism-related inflammation; as obesity progresses, a switch takes place within the AT environment from an -alternatively activated macrophage state to an M1-inflammatory macrophage-dominated milieu. M1-polarized macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines like TNF in the obese AT; such cytokines contribute to insulin resistance in adipocytes. Besides macrophages, also CD8+ T cells promote inflammation in the AT and the liver and thereby the deterioration of the metabolic balance in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Other cells of the innate immunity, such as neutrophils or mast cells, interfere with metabolic homeostasis as well. On the other hand, eosinophils or T-regulatory cells, the number of which in the AT decreases in the course of obesity, function to maintain metabolic balance by ameliorating inflammatory processes. In addition, eosinophils and -polarized macrophages may contribute to "beige"  under lean conditions; beige adipocytes are located predominantly in the subcutaneous AT and have thermogenic and optimal energy-dispensing properties like brown adipocytes. This chapter will summarize the different aspects of the regulation of homeostasis of metabolic tissues by immune cells.</p></html>
