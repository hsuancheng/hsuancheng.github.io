Untrained, university students (N = ) completed two graded exercise tests in counterbalanced, randomised order. One test was preceded by restful viewing of a documentary video (control); the other by a stop-signal task. Cardiorespiratory functions and perceived exertion were monitored during exercise. Peak power output (W) was lower following the stop-signal task (M = 240.03, SD = 53.37) compared to control (M = 246.03, SD = 52.60), P = .002, η = .493, as was [Formula: see text] (P = .042, Cohen's d = .55). Perceived exertion was significantly higher at 50% (d = .77) and 75% (d = .83) of iso-time following the cognitive task ( ≤ .01). Results are consistent with research showing negative carryover effects of cognitively demanding tasks on whole-body endurance performance. Results also support the psychobiological model of exercise as performance of the cognitive task did not affect perceived exertion when exercise task demands were lower, but lead to greater perceived exertion and earlier withdrawal of effort at higher levels of exercise task demand.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) consists of the use of a nontoxic photosensitizer (), light, and . This combination produces reactive  species and singlet , which can alter cellular structures. Methylene blue (MB) is a substance from the phenothiazine class often used as a . In this work, to facilitate the  contact within the wounds, we have used Design of Experiments 2(3) plus central point to develop functional polymeric systems. The formulations were composed by poloxamer 407 [., 17.5, or 20.% (w/w)], Carbopol 934P [., .20, or .25% (w/w)], and MB [.25, .50, or .75% (w/w)]. The sol-gel transition temperature, flow rheometry, in vitro MB release, and ex vivo study of MB cutaneous permeation and retention were investigated. Moreover, the evaluation of photodynamic activity was also analyzed by in vitro degradation of tryptophan by singlet  and using Artemia salina. The determination of the gelation temperature displayed values within the range of 25-37 °C, and the systems with better characteristics were subjected to rheological analysis and in vitro release profiling. The 20/./.25 formulation showed the best release profile (42.57% at 24 h). This system displayed no significant skin permeation (.38% at 24 h), and the photooxidation of tryptophan test showed the production of reactive species of . The toxicity test using A. salina revealed that the MB associated with the light increased the mortality rate by 61.29%. Therefore, investigating the PDT efficacy of the functional polymeric system containing MB will be necessary in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29714913>[Induction of Apoptosis of Human Cisplatin-resistance Lung Cancer Cells with MPPa-photodynamic Therapy].</a></h1><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.Despite the development and use of several targeting drugs for lung cancer therapy,the five-year survival rate has remained as low as %for the past three decades.Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is considered the first-line therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.However,developments of chemoresistance is a major obstacle for the successful treatment.Therefore,the development of novel therapy against cisplatin-resistance lung cancer is imperative.Photodynamic therapy(PDT),which is a non-invasive combinatorial therapeutic modality using light,photosensitizer()and ,may provide an unprecedented tool to develop more effective treatments.To provide experimental basis for its application in cisplatin-resistance lung cancer,we will discuss the biological effects of MPPa-photodynamic therapy in human cisplatin-resistance lung cancer cells in this article.Human cisplatin-resistance lung cancer cells A549/DDP were co-cultured with MPPa(,1,2,4,8,16μmol/L)and exposed to light(,.6,1.2,2.4,3.6,4.8J/cm2),and cell viability was determined with CCK-8assay.Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis,DCFH-DA staining was employed to observe reactive  species(ROS),and Western blot was used to detect the expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2(Bcl-2)protein and Bcl-2associated X protein(Bax).The proliferation of A549/DDP cells was suppressed by PDT.The apoptotic rate in the PDT group was significantly higher than that in the control,MPPa or light group(P<.05).The level of ROS was increased.The expression of Bax was increased,and that of Bcl-2was decreased.MPPa-photodynamic therapy can significantly suppress cell viability,and induce apoptosis in human cisplatin-resistance lung cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288171>Impacts of polystyrene microplastics on the behavior and metabolism in a marine demersal teleost, black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii).</a></h1><p>After nano- (.5 μm) or micro- ( μm) polystyrene () microplastics exposure, the behavior, metabolism and energy reserve in marine demersal fish (Sebastes schlegelii) were evaluated. The behavior of fish was accurately recorded by video behavior tracking technology. Results showed that changes in behavior (e.g. cluster, the reduction of swimming speed and range of movement) were significantly greater in -μm -exposed fish, which may affect hunting behavior and exploration competence.  consumption and ammonia excretion of fish was significantly greater in -μm  treatment than in .5-μm  treatment, suggesting respiration and metabolism stress. Moreover, the abnormal behavior, respiration and ammonia excretion of -exposed fish had recovered modestly. In addition, abnormal symptoms of bile, liver and lumen of intestine were detected in -μm  exposure. Importantly, the growth and gross energy of fish were reduced in -μm  exposure than .5-μm  exposure. Both .5-μm and -μm  exposures led to significantly lower protein and lipid contents, suggesting energy reserve and nutrition quality reduction of fish. Overall, microplastics had the negative impact at greater levels than nanoplastics. Altered behavior, energy reserve and nutritional quality of fish indicated the potential risk on biological functions, the development of fishery and food safety.Copyright © 2019.

An observational study.</a></h1><p>There is emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise training to improve exercise capacity for individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold standard measure of exercise capacity; however this laboratory test has limitations for use in research and clinical practice. Alternative field walking tests are the six-minute walk test (6MWT), incremental-shuttle walk test (ISWT) and endurance-shuttle walk test (ESWT); however there is limited information about their clinimetric properties in NSCLC.In NSCLC to determine the 1) criterion validity of the 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT against CPET; 2) construct validity of the 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT against measures of function, strength, respiratory function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and 3) clinical applicability of the tests.Twenty participants (40 % male, mean ± SD age 66.1 ± 6.5 years) with stage I-IIIb NSCLC completed the 6MWT, ISWT, ESWT and CPET within six months of treatment. Testing order was randomised. Additional measures included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance-Status (ECOG-, function), respiratory function, hand-grip dynamometry and HRQoL. Correlations and regression analyses were used to assess relationships.The ISWT demonstrated criterion validity with a moderate relationship between ISWT distance and CPET peak  consumption (r = .61, p = .007). Relationships between CPET and six minute walk distance (6MWD) (r = .24, p = .329) or ESWT time (r = .02, p = .942) were poor. Moderate construct validity existed for the 6MWD and respiratory function (forced vital capacity % predicted r = .53, p = .019; forced expiratory volume in the first second % predicted r = .55, p = .015). There were no relationships between the walking tests and measures of function, strength or HRQoL. The ESWT had a ceiling effect with 18 % reaching maximum time. No floor effects were seen in the tests. The mean ± SD time required to perform the individual 6MWT, ISWT and ESWT was 12.8 ± 2.5, 14.7 ± 3.7 and 16.3 ± 5. min respectively; in comparison to CPET which was 51.2 ± 12.7 min. Only one assessor was required to perform all field walking tests and no adverse events occurred.The ISWT is a promising measure of functional exercise capacity in lung cancer. Findings need to be confirmed in a larger sample prior to translation into practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27442986>Mineralization of naphtenic acids with thermally-activated persulfate: The important role of .</a></h1><p>This study reports on the mineralization of model naphtenic acids (NAs) in aqueous solution by catalyst-free thermally-activated persulfate () oxidation. These species are found to be pollutants in oil sands process-affected waters. The NAs tested include saturated-ring (cyclohexanecarboxylic and cyclohexanebutyric acids) and aromatic (2-naphthoic and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acids) structures, at 50mgL(-1)starting concentration. The effect of  dose within a wide range (10-100% of the theoretical stoichiometric) and working temperature (40-97°C) was investigated. At 80°C and intitial pH=8 complete mineralization of the four NAs was achieved with 40-60% of the stoichiometric  dose. This is explained because of the important contribution of , which was experimentally verified and was found to be more effective toward the NAs with a single cyclohexane ring than for the bicyclic aromatic-ring-bearing ones. The effect of chloride and bicarbonate was also checked. The former showed negative effect on the degradation rate of NAs whereas it was negligible or even positive for bicarbonate. The rate of mineralization was well described by simple pseudo-first order kinetics with values of the rate constants normalized to the  dose within the range of .062-.099h(-1). Apparent activation energy values between 93.7-105.3kJmol(-1) were obtained.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Modifying temperature, hematocrit (Hct) and cardiac index (CI) during CPB are primary techniques which aid in this effort. Based upon surgeon preference, the study institution employs differing perfusion strategies () during congenital cardiac surgery requiring CPB. One method utilizes a 2.4 L/min/m CI and nadir Hct of 28% (PS1) and the other a 3. L/min/m CI with a nadir Hct of 25% (PS2).Cardiopulmonary bypass cases during which the PS1 or PS2 strategies were applied were retrospectively examined, finding no significant difference in pre-CPB lactate, maximum lactate on CPB or maximum change in lactate on CPB.While the post-CPB lactate was statistically significantly higher in the PS2 group (p=.024), the magnitude of difference (. mmol/L) was small.This study illustrates that, when  delivery or tissue perfusion is suspected as the primary cause of lactate production during CPB, increasing the CI to a 3. rather than a 2.4 CI may be more advantageous than packed red blood cell administration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28167409>Activation of persulfates by natural magnetic pyrrhotite for water disinfection: Efficiency, mechanisms, and stability.</a></h1><p>This study introduces natural occurring magnetic pyrrhotite (NP) as an environmentally friendly, easy available, and cost-effective alternative catalyst to activate persulfate () of controlling microbial water contaminants. The E. coli K-12 inactivation kinetics observed in batch experiments was well described with first-order reaction. The optimum inactivation rate (k = .47 log/min) attained at a NP dose of 1 g/L and a  dose of 1 mM, corresponding to total inactivation of 7 log cfu/mL cells within  min. Measured k increased > 2-fold when temperature increased from 20 to 50 °C; and > 4-fold when pH decreased from 9 to 3. Aerobic conditions were more beneficial to cell inactivation than anaerobic conditions due to more reactive  species (ROS) generated. ROS responsible for the inactivation were identified to be SO > OH > HO based on a positive scavenging test and in situ ROS determination. In situ characterization suggested that  effectively bind to NP surface was likely to form charge transfer complex (≡Fe(II)⋯OSOOSO), which mediated ROS generation and E. coli K-12 oxidation. The increased cell-envelope lesions consequently aggravated intracellular protein depletion and genome damage to cause definite bacterial death. The NP still maintained good physiochemical structure and stable activity even after 4 cycle. Moreover, NP/ system also exhibited good E. coli K-12 inactivation efficiency in authentic water matrices like surface water and effluents of secondary wastewater.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Fourteen subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury (ASIA level C or D; mean age = 46 years) participated in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover, and placebo-controlled study. Subjects received either 60 mg oral prednisolone or a matching placebo, 1 hour before administration of AIH (, 60-second hypoxic exposures; fraction of inspired  [FO] = .09). Changes in voluntary ankle strength, lower extremity electromyograms (EMG), and serum inflammatory biomarkers were quantified. . Maximal ankle plantarflexion torque was significantly higher following prednisolone + AIH versus placebo + AIH (mean difference [MD] 9, 11, and 7 newton meter [N∙m] at 30, 60, and 120 minutes post-AIH, respectively; all s <.02). Soleus surface EMG during maximal voluntary contraction was also significantly increased following prednisolone + AIH (MD 3.5,  = .02 vs placebo + AIH), while activity of other leg muscles remained unchanged. Individuals had significantly higher levels of the anti-inflammatory serum biomarker interleukin-10 after prednisolone versus placebo ( = .004 vs placebo + AIH). .

A new amphiphilic porphyrin, 5-(4-octadecanamidophenyl)-10,,20-tris(N-methylpyridinium-3-yl)porphyrin trichloride (5) was synthesised and characterised by (1)H NMR, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and by MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometry. In vitro photodynamic activity of 5 was evaluated on HeLa cell lines and compared to the activity of the hydrophilic 5-(4-acetamidophenyl)-10,,20-tris(N-methylpyridinium-3-yl)porphyrin trichloride (7). Low fluence rate (2mWcm(-2)) of red light (643nm) was used for the activation, and both porphyrins showed a drug dose-response as well as a light dose-response relationship, but the amphiphilic porphyrin was presented with significantly lower IC50 values. The obtained IC50 values for 5 were 1.4μM at 15min irradiation time and .7μM when the time of irradiation was 30min, while for 7 these values were 37 and 6 times higher, respectively.

Forty-five sedentary adolescent boys (13-14 years old) were separated in three groups according to the percentage of fat mass as follows:  normal-weight (NW) (body fat: 16. ± 1.9%),  overweight (OW) (body fat: 24. ± 1.6%), and  obese (OB) (body fat: 31. ± 3.%). All groups completed an incremental cycle exercise to exhaustion in which energy consumption (E, W), ME (%), lipid oxidation rate (LO, %), plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were determined consecutively at rest and at three intensity levels corresponding to 50 and 75% of each participant's maximal heart rate (50%HRmax and 75%HRmax) and peak  consumption (  O). During the incremental cycle exercise test, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine responses as well as ME determined at 50%HRmax, 75%HRmax, and at VO stages were significantly lower in OB compared to NW and OW individuals ( < .01). Multiple linear regressions showed that body weight (ß = -.64,  < .001), energy consumption (ß = -.24,  < .05) and lipid oxidation (ß = .69,  < .01) were significant predictors of ME at 50%HRmax. However, at 75%HRmax and  O, significant predictors of ME were epinephrine (ß = .34, ß = .49, respectively,  = .01), norepinephrine (ß = .26, ß = .60, respectively,  < .05) and power output (ß = .62, ß = .71, respectively,  < .01). These findings suggest that excess in body weight exerts a negative effect on ME at a low intensity by increasing energy consumption for obese and overweight adolescent boys, while at higher intensities (75%HRmax and VO) the lower ME could be better explained by the lower power output and catecholamine responses that were attenuated among obese and overweight adolescent boys.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29984994>Physical Properties of (NaK )NbO Thin Film Grown at Low Temperature Using Two-Dimensional CaNbO Nanosheet Seed Layer.</a></h1><p>A monolayer CaNbO (CNO) nanosheet was deposited on a Pt/Ti/SiO/Si substrate using the Langmuir-Blodgett method.

Optimal use of PET in proton therapy requires in situ acquisition of the relatively strong ()O signal due to its relatively short half-life (~2 min) and high  content in biological tissues, enabling shorter scans that are less sensitive to biological washout. This paper presents the first performance tests of a scaled-down in situ time-of-flight (TOF) PET system based on digital photon counters (DPCs) coupled to Cerium-doped Lutetium Yttrium Silicate (LYSO:Ce) crystals, providing quantitative results representative of a dual-head tomograph that complies with spatial constraints typically encountered in clinical practice (2  ×  50°, of 360°, transaxial angular acceptance). The proton-induced activity inside polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene (PE) phantoms was acquired within beam pauses (in-beam) and immediately after irradiation by an actively-delivered synchrotron pencil-beam, with clinically relevant 125.67 MeV/u, 4.6  ×  10(8) protons s(-1), and 10(10) total protons. 3D activity maps reconstructed with and without TOF information are compared to FLUKA simulations, demonstrating the benefit of TOF-PET to reduce limited-angle artefacts using a 382  full width at half maximum coincidence resolving time. The time-dependent contributions from different radionuclides to the total count-rate are investigated. We furthermore study the impact of the acquisition time window on the laterally integrated activity depth-profiles, with emphasis on 2 min acquisitions starting at different time points. The results depend on phantom composition and reflect the differences in relative contributions from the radionuclides originating from carbon and . We observe very good agreement between the shapes of the simulated and measured activity depth-profiles for post-beam protocols. However, our results also suggest that available experimental cross sections underestimate the production of (10)C for in-beam acquisitions, which in PE results in an overestimation of the predicted activity range by 1.4 mm. The uncertainty in the activity range measured in PMMA using the DPC-based TOF-PET prototype setup equals .2 mm-.3 mm.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30387062>The efficacy and cytotoxicity of iron oxide-carbon black composites for liquid-phase toluene oxidation by persulfate.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the oxidation of toluene (TOL) by persulfate () in aqueous solution in the presence of a FeO-carbon black (CB) composite oxidant system generating sulfate radicals.

All the foams were thin and flexible and could easily be handled and cut to fit a potential wound. Fast disintegration were observed for dry foams in water or phosphate buffered saline, while in Hanks' balanced salt solution the foams absorbed liquid without losing their integrity. All the foams had a similar THPP load of .12-.13% w/w. The presence of βCD-derivatives improved THPP release, however, no differences were observed between the different types of βCD-derivatives evaluated.

Both PSs are highly water-soluble, provide only very limited luminescence emission at 580-680 nm following excitation at 530 nm, and demonstrate high photostability with less than 50% photobleaching at radiant exposures H = 275 J cm(-2) (530 nm irradiation). It was previously shown that these two photosensitizers exhibit a large singlet  ((1)O2) quantum yield (Φ (Δ) ∼.99 in acetonitrile). Their photon-mediated efficacy to cause cell death (λ = 530 nm, H = 45 J cm(-2)) was tested in vitro in colon and glioma cancer cell lines (CT26.WT, CT26.CL25, F98, and U87) and demonstrated a strong photodynamic effect with complete cell death at concentrations as low as 4 and 1 μM for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. Notably, dark toxicity was negligible at concentrations less than 25 and 10 μM for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. The ability of the PSs to initiate Type I photoreactions was tested by exposing -treated U87 cells to light under hypoxic conditions (pO2 < .5%), which resulted in a complete loss of the PDT effect. In vivo, the maximum tolerated doses 50 (MTD50) were determined to be 36 mg kg(-1) (TLD1411) and 103 mg kg(-1) (TLD1433) using the BALB/c murine model. In vivo growth delay studies in the subcutaneous colon adenocarcinoma CT26.WT murine model were conducted at a photosensitizer dose equal to .5 and .2 MTD50 for TLD1411 and TLD1433, respectively. 4 hours post  injection, tumours were irradiated with continuous wave or pulsed light sources (λ = 525-530 nm, H = 192 J cm(-2)). Overall, treatment with continuous wave light demonstrated a higher tumour destruction efficacy when compared to pulsed light. TLD1433 mediated PDT resulted in statistically significant longer animal survival compared to TLD1411. Two-thirds of TLD1433-treated mice survived more than 100 days (p < .01) whereas TLD1411-treated mice did not survive longer than 20 days. Here we present evidence that two novel PSs have very potent photo-biological properties and are able to cause PDT-mediated cell death in both in vitro cell culture models and in vivo tumour regression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043519>Photophysical Characterization and in Vitro Phototoxicity Evaluation of 5,10,,20-Tetra(quinolin-2-yl)porphyrin as a Potential Sensitizer for Photodynamic Therapy.</a></h1><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a selective and minimally invasive therapeutic approach, involving the combination of a light-sensitive compound, called a photosensitizer (), visible light and molecular . The interaction of these per se harmless agents results in the production of reactive species. This triggers a series of cellular events that culminate in the selective destruction of cancer cells, inside which the photosensitizer preferentially accumulates. The search for ideal PDT photosensitizers has been a very active field of research, with a special focus on porphyrins and porphyrin-related macrocycle molecules. The present study describes the photophysical characterization and in vitro phototoxicity evaluation of 5,10,,20-tetra(quinolin-2-yl)porphyrin (2-TQP) as a potential PDT photosensitizer. Molar absorption coefficients were determined from the corresponding absorption spectrum, the fluorescence quantum yield was calculated using 5,10,,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) as a standard and the quantum yield of singlet  generation was determined by direct phosphorescence measurements. Toxicity evaluations (in the presence and absence of irradiation) were performed against HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cancer cells. The results from this preliminary study show that the hydrophobic 2-TQP fulfills several critical requirements for a good PDT photosensitizer, namely a high quantum yield of singlet  generation (Φ∆ .62), absence of dark toxicity and significant in vitro phototoxicity for concentrations in the micromolar range.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26726437>Photodynamic Anticancer Activity of CoFe2O4 Nanoparticles Conjugated with Hematoporphyrin.</a></h1><p>This work reports the synthesis and the characterization of water-soluble and biocompatible photosensitizer ()-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles composed of a cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) magnetic core coated with a biocompatible hematoporphyrin (HP) shell. The photo-functional cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoparticles (CoFe2O4@HP) were uniform in size, stable against  leaching, and highly efficient in the photo-generation of cytotoxic singlet  under visible light. With the CoFe2O4@HP, we acquired in vitro MR images of cancer cells (PC-3) and confirmed good biocompatibility of the CoFe2O4@HP in both normal and cancer cells. In addition, we confirmed the potential of the CoFe2O4@HP as an agent for photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. The photodynamic anticancer activities in 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL of CoFe2O4@HP were measured and found to exceed 99% (99., 99.4, and 99.5%) (p < .002). The photodynamic anticancer activity was 81.8% (p < .003). From these results, we suggest that our CoFe2O4@HP can be used safely as a type of photodynamic cancer therapy with potential as a therapeutic agent having good biocompatibility. Moreover, these photo-functional magnetic nanoparticles are highly promising for applications in versatile imaging diagnosis and as a therapy tool in biomedical engineering.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25829908>Comparison between general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia in attenuation of stress response in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A randomized prospective trial.</a></h1><p>Laparoscopy though minimally invasive produces significant hemodynamic surge and neuroendocrine stress response. Though general anesthesia (GA) is the conventional technique, now-a-days, regional anesthesia has been accepted for laparoscopic diagnostic procedures, and its use is also being extended to laparoscopic surgeries.The aim was to compare the hemodynamic surge and neuroendocrine stress response during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) under GA and spinal anesthesia (SA) in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)  1 patients.Thirty ASA physical status I patients, aged 18-65 years were randomly allocated into two equal groups of  each. Group A received GA with controlled ventilation. Patients were preoxygenated for 5 min with 100/5 , premedicated with midazolam .03 mg/kg intravenous (i.v), fentanyl 2 mcg/kg i.v; induction was done with thiopentone 3-5 mg/kg i.v; intubation was achieved after muscle relaxation with .5 mg/kg atracurium besylate i.v. Anesthesia was maintained with 1-2% sevoflurane and N2O:O2 (60:40) and intermittent i.v injection of atracurium besylate. Group B SA with .5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25 μg fentanyl along with local anesthetic instillation in the subdiaphragmatic space. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR),  saturation, end tidal carbon-dioxide were recorded. Venous blood was collected for cortisol assay before induction and 30 min after pneumoperitoneum. All data were collected in Microsoft excel sheet and statistically analyzed using SPSS software version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All numerical data were analyzed using Student's t-test and paired t-test. Any value <.05 was taken as significant.Mean arterial pressure and mean HR and postpneumoperitoneum cortisol level were lower in group B than group A though the difference was not statistically significant in hemodynamic parameters but significant in case of cortisol.Spinal anesthesia administered for LC maintained comparable hemodynamics compared to GA and did not produce any ventilatory depression. It also produced less neuroendocrine stress response as seen by reduction in the level of serum cortisol in ASA  1 patients put for LC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034459>Reliability and Validity of a Pool-Based Maximal  Uptake Test to Examine High-Intensity Short-Duration Freestyle Swimming Performance.</a></h1><p>Nagle, EF, Nagai, T, Beethe, AZ, Lovalekar, MT, Zera, JN, Connaboy, C, Abt, JP, Beals, K, Nindl, BC, Robertson, RJ, and Lephart, SM. Reliability and validity of a pool-based maximal  uptake test to examine high-intensity short-duration freestyle swimming performance. J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1208-1215, 2019-A modality-specific swimming protocol to assess maximal  uptake (V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw) is essential to accurately prescribe and monitor swimming conditioning programs. Consequently, there is a need for a reliable and valid graded intensity swimming pool test to accurately assess V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw using indirect calorimetry. The purpose of this study was to assess (a) reliability of an intensity self-regulated swimming pool test of V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw and (b) validity of a V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw test using performance swim () time as the criterion. Twenty-nine men (n = ) and women (n = 14) (age, 23 ± 6.4 years; body mass index, 23.5 ± 3. kg·m) performed 2 swimming pool V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw trials (V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw A and V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw B), and 2  tests (45.7 m [31.20 ± 4.5 seconds] and 182 m [159.2 ± 25.5 seconds]). For test-retest reliability (trials A vs. B), strong correlations (p < .05) were found for V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw (ml·kg·min) (r = .899), O2 pulse (ml O2·beat) (r = .833), and maximum expired ventilatory volume (L·min) (r = .785). For performance validity, moderately strong correlations (p < .05) were found between V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw A and 45.7-m (r = -.543) and 182-m (r = -.486) swim times. The self-regulated graded intensity swimming pool protocol examined presently is a reliable and valid test of V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw. Studies should consider the suitability of a V[Combining Dot Above]O2maxsw test for military personnel, clinical populations, and injured athletes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29701222>Progressive cationic functionalization of chlorin derivatives for antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation and related vancomycin conjugates.</a></h1><p>It is known that multiple cationic charges are required to produce broad-spectrum antimicrobial photosensitizers () for photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) or photodynamic therapy of bacteria and fungi. In the present study we describe the synthesis and aPDI testing of a set of derivatives prepared from the parent pheophytin molecule with different numbers of attached side arms (1-3) each consisting of five quaternized cationic groups (pentacationic), producing the corresponding [Zn2+]pheophorbide-a-N(C2N+C1C3)5 (Zn-Phe-N5+, 5 charges), [Zn2+]chlorin e6-[N(C2N+C1C3)5]2 (Zn-Chl-N10+, 10 charges) and [Zn2+]mesochlorin e6-[N(C2N+C1C3)5]3 (Zn-mChl-N15+,  charges). Moreover, a conjugate between Zn-Phe-N5+ and the antibiotic vancomycin called Van-[Zn2+]-m-pheophorbide-N(C2N+C1C3)5 (Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+) was also prepared. The aPDI activities of all compounds were based on Type-II photochemistry (1O2 generation). We tested these compounds against Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and the fungal yeast Candida albicans. All three compounds were highly active against MRSA, giving eradication (≥6 logs of killing) with <1. μM and 10 J cm-2 of 415 nm light. The order of activity was Zn-Phe-N5+ > Zn-Chl-N10+ > Zn-mChl-N15+. In the case of E coli the activity was much lower (eradication was only possible with 50 μM Zn-mChl-N15+ and 20 J cm-2). The order of activity was the reverse of that found with MRSA (Zn-mChl-N15+ > Zn-Chl-N10+ > Zn-Phe-N5+). Activity against C. albicans was similar to E. coli with Zn-mChl-N15+ giving eradication. The activity of Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+ was generally lower than that of Zn-Phe-N5+ (except for E. coli). Red (660 nm) light was also effective as might be expected from the absorption spectra. An initial finding that Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+ might have higher activity against vancomycin resistant Enterococcus fecium (VRE) strains (compared to vancomycin sensitive strains) was disproved when it was found that VRE strains were also more sensitive to aPDI with Zn-Phe-N5+. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of Van-Zn-mPhe-N5+ were higher than those of Van alone, showing that the antibiotic properties of the Van moiety were lessened in the conjugate. In conclusion, Zn-Phe-N5+ is a highly active  against Gram-positive species and deserves further testing. Increasing the number of cationic charges increased aPDI efficacy on C. albicans and Gram-negative E. coli.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269047>Polysomnographic correlates of endothelial function in children with obstructive sleep apnea.</a></h1><p>To evaluate endothelial function in a large cohort of children clinically referred for suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and to identify risk factors contributing to the presence of endothelial dysfunction (ED).Habitually snoring children (age range, 3-11 years) were recruited. All participants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG). Endothelial function test used peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) to derive the reactive hyperemia index (RHI). Subjects were then divided into mild OSA, moderate-severe OSA and primary snorers (), according to their obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI).A total of 355 subjects were recruited. There were no differences in age, gender, or BMI z score among the three groups. Both mild and moderate-severe OSA groups had lower RHI than  (P < .001, P = .001, respectively). Linear regression analysis revealed that RHI was positively correlated with age (r = .17, P = .002), BMI z score (r = .14, P = .008) and  saturation nadir (r = ., P = .006), but negatively correlated with  desaturation index (ODI; r = -.19, P = .001) and respiratory-related arousal index (ArI-resp) (r = -.24, P < .001). In stepwise regression analysis, age, BMI z score, and ArI-resp were independently associated with endothelial function (r = .34, P < .001).Children with OSA are at increased risk for abnormal endothelial function than habitually snoring children. Furthermore, in addition to age and BMI, which are well-established factors affecting endothelial function, both intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation during sleep also emerge as candidate risk factors contributing to endothelial dysfunction in snoring children.Follow up of  and OSAHS in Chinese children, https://clinicaltrials.gov/, Clinical number: .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To improve the stability, we synthesized silica-coated PQDs (SPQDs) by an improved ligand-assisted reprecipitation method through simply mixing and stirring under room temperature in air without adding water and catalyst, the whole process took only a few seconds. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the SPQDs can be tuned continuously from 460 to 662 nm via adjusting the composition proportion of precursors. The highest PL quantum yields (PLQYs) of blue-, green-, and red-emissive SPQDs are 56, 95, and 70%, respectively. The SPQDs show remarkably improved environmental and thermal stability compared to the naked PQDs because of effective barrier created by the coated silica between the core materials and the ambience. Furthermore, it is found that different light-emitting SPQDs can maintain their original PL properties after mixing of them and anion-exchange reactions have not happened. These attributes were then used to mix green- and yellow-emissive SPQDs with polystyrene () to form color-converting layers for the fabrication of white light-emitting devices (WLEDs). The WLEDs exhibit excellent white light characteristics with CIE 1931 color coordinates of (.31, .34) and color rendering index (CRI) of 85, demonstrating promising applications of SPQDs in lighting and displays.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358151>L-Carnitine inhibits eryptosis induced by uremic serum and the related mechanisms.</a></h1><p>To investigate whether L-carnitine (LC) inhibits eryptosis induced by uremic serum and the related mechanism.One percent erythrocyte suspension was cultured by three kinds of mediums in vitro, which was included in the control group (Group C, phosphate buffered saline [PBS]), the uremic serum group (Group U, 30% uremic serum + 70% PBS) and the LC group (Group L, 30% uremic serum + 70% PBS + 200 umol/L LC), respectively.

The compounds 5,10,,20-tetrakis-(4-pyridylbenzamide)porphyrin (A.2), 5,10,,20-tetra[N-(pyridine-4-yl)benzamidium] porphyrin (A.3), 5-mono-(4-pyridyl)-10,,20-tris-(4-pyridylbenzamide)porphyrin (B.2) and 5-mono-(4-methylpyridinium)-10,,20-tris-(4-pyridiniumbenzamide)porphyrin (B.3) were synthesised. The compounds were successfully characterised through UV-Vis, Emission, H NMR, and ESI-HRMS techniques. To evaluate the effect of this combination of directly conjugated and non-conjugated pyridyl/cationic pyridinium groups on the porphyrin macrocycle, the efficacy of the synthesised compounds was compared to a known standard 5,10,,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP). These compounds show better efficacy (IC's ranging between .66±.04μM to 3.71±1.01μM) against A549 (human epithelial adenocarcinoma lung cancer) cell line under in vitro photodynamic conditions in comparison to MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) (IC's ranging between 3.7±.087μM to 12.1±.12μM) and Pa-1 (ovarian cancer) (IC's ranging between 17.9±.01μM to 42.45±.02μM) cell lines. It was found that B.3, having a pyridinium group attached to the meso-position of the macrocycle along with three distal cationic pyridinium groups, independent of the porphyrinic electron delocalisation cycle, showed better photocytotoxic efficacy (IC=.66±.04μM, A549 lung cancer cell line) and higher potential to promote apoptosis and hence better efficacy as  towards cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT).

The mesoporous FeO is firstly prepared using polymeric micelles made of an asymmetric triblock copolymer poly(styrene-b-acrylic acid-b-ethylene glycol) (-b-PAA-b-PEG). Owing to its unique porous structure and large surface area (87. m g), the as-prepared mesoporous FeO can be loaded with a considerably higher amount of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) (7.9 wt%) compared to the commercial FeO powder (.8 wt%). Following the Au loading, the mesoporous FeO structure is still well-retained and Au NPs with varying sizes of 3-10 nm are dispersed throughout the mesoporous support. When evaluated for CO oxidation, the Au-loaded mesoporous FeO catalyst shows up to 20% higher CO conversion efficiency compared to the commercial Au/FeO catalyst, especially at lower temperatures (25-150 °C), suggesting the promising potential of this catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation. Furthermore, the Au-loaded mesoporous FeO catalyst also displays a higher catalytic activity for NH oxidation with a respectable conversion efficiency of 37.4% compared to the commercial Au/FeO catalyst (.6%) at 200 °C. The significant enhancement in the catalytic performance of the Au-loaded mesoporous FeO catalyst for both CO and NH oxidation may be attributed to the improved dispersion of the Au NPs and enhanced diffusivity of the reactant molecules due to the presence of mesopores and a higher  activation rate contributed by the increased number of active sites, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554072>Polymer-lipid-PEG hybrid nanoparticles as photosensitizer carrier for photodynamic therapy.</a></h1><p>Polymer-lipid-PEG hybrid nanoparticles were investigated as carriers for the photosensitizer (), 5,10,,20-Tetrakis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-21H,23H-porphine (pTHPP) for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT). A self-assembled nanoprecipitation technique was used for preparing two types of core polymers poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) with lipid-PEG as stabilizer. The resulting nanoparticles had an average particle size of 88.5±3.4nm for PLGA and 215.±6.3nm for PHBV. Both nanoparticles exhibited a core-shell structure under TEM with high zeta potential and loading efficiency. X-ray powder diffraction analysis showed that the encapsulated pTHPP molecules in polymeric nanoparticles no longer had peaks of free pTHPP in the crystalline state. The pTHPP molecules encapsulated inside the polymeric core demonstrated improved photophysical properties in terms of singlet  generation and cellular uptake rate in a FTC-133 human thyroid carcinoma cell line, compared to non-encapsulated pTHPP. The pTHPP-loaded polymer-lipid-PEG nanoparticles showed better in vitro phototoxicity compared to free pTHPP, in both time- and concentration-dependent manners. Overall, this study provides detailed analysis of the photophysical properties of pTHPP molecules when entrapped within either PLGA or PHBV nanoparticle cores, and demonstrates the effectiveness of these systems for delivery of photosensitizers. The two polymeric systems may have different potential benefits, when used with cancer cells. For instance, the pTHPP-loaded PLGA system requires only a short time to show a PDT effect and may be suitable for topical PDT, while the delayed photo-induced cytotoxic effect of the pTHPP-loaded PHBV system may be more suitable for cancer solid tumors. Hence, both pTHPP-encapsulated polymer-lipid-PEG nanoparticles can be considered promising delivery systems for PDT cancer treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
