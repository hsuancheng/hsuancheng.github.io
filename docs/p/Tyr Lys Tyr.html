We examined CKP with respect to specific chemotactic and capping responses, the presence of the N-formyl-peptide chemotactide receptor, and evidence of respiratory burst activity and compared them with CB-cytoplasts, which are fragments created by the centrifugation of cytochalasin B (CB)-treated PMN at high speeds. Under agarose, CKP responded chemotactically to both N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp) and zymosan-activated serum; CB-cytoplasts responded to neither chemoattractant. Despite the functional differences, both fragments retained N-formyl-peptide receptors as measured by affinity labeling with N-formyl-norleu-leu-phe-norleu-125I- and autoradiography of dried SDS-PAGE gels. For studies of capping we used a murine monoclonal antibody, PMN7C3, which binds a specific, widely distributed membrane component of intact PMN, and on warming, promptly induces capping of ligand-receptor complexes. Rhodamine-conjugated PMN7C3 at 4 degrees C labeled the surface of CKP homogeneously. As the CKP warmed to 37 degrees C, label became concentrated in small fluorescent caps at the rear of migrating fragments. Although CB-cytoplasts also bound the fluorochromed antibody homogeneously in the cold, on warming they were unable to concentrate the label normally. With respect to respiratory burst activity, the situation in the two fragments was reversed: CKP did not generate superoxide anion when stimulated either with phorbol myristate acetate or with fmlp after pretreatment with CB; CB-cytoplasts, as noted earlier by other investigators, did. These two types of cytoplasts with markedly different capabilities have complementary roles in the analysis of PMN function.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052459>PEG-Peptide Inhibition of Scavenger Receptor Uptake of Nanoparticles by the Liver.</a></h2><p>PEGylated polylysine peptides represent a new class of scavenger receptor inhibitors that may find utility at inhibiting DNA nanoparticle uptake by Kupffer cells in the liver. PEG-peptides inhibit scavenger receptors in the liver by a novel mechanism involving in situ formation of albumin nanoparticles. The present study developed a new in vivo assay used to explore the structure-activity-relationships of PEG-peptides to find potent scavenger receptor inhibitors. Radio-iodinated PEG-peptides were dosed i.v. in mice and shown to saturate liver uptake in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibition potency (IC) was dependent on both the length of a polylysine repeat and PEG molecular weight. PEG-Cys- was confirmed to be a high molecular weight (33.5 kDa) scavenger receptor inhibitor with an IC of 18 μM. Incorporation of multiple Leu residues improved potency, allowing a decrease in PEG MW and Lys repeat, resulting in PEG-Cys--(Leu-Lys)-Leu-Lys that inhibited scavenger receptors with an IC = 20 μM. A further decrease in PEG MW to 2 kDa increased potency further, resulting in a low molecular weight (4403 g/mol) PEG-peptide with an IC of 3 μM. Optimized low molecular weight PEG-peptides also demonstrated potency when inhibiting the uptake of radio-iodinated DNA nanoparticles by the liver. This study demonstrates an approach to discover low molecular weight PEG-peptides that serve as potent scavenger receptor inhibitors to block nanoparticle uptake by the liver.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16737969>Comparative structural analysis of the Erbin PDZ domain and the first PDZ domain of ZO-1. Insights into determinants of PDZ domain specificity.</a></h2><p>We report a structural comparison of the first PDZ domain of ZO-1 (ZO1-PDZ1) and the PDZ domain of Erbin (Erbin-PDZ). Although the binding profile of Erbin-PDZ is extremely specific ([D/E][T/S]WV(COOH)), that of ZO1-PDZ1 is similar ([R/K/S/T][T/S][W/Y][V/I/L](COOH)) but broadened by increased promiscuity for three of the last four ligand residues. Consequently, the biological function of ZO-1 is also broadened, as it interacts with both  and adherens  proteins, whereas Erbin is restricted to adherens junctions. Structural analyses reveal that the differences in specificity can be accounted for by two key differences in primary sequence. A reduction in the size of the hydrophobic residue at the base of the site(0) pocket enables ZO1-PDZ1 to accommodate larger C-terminal residues. A single additional difference alters the specificity of both site(-1) and site(-3). In ZO1-PDZ1, an Asp residue makes favorable interactions with both (-1) and /Arg(-3). In contrast, Erbin-PDZ contains an Arg at the equivalent position, and this side chain cannot accommodate either (-1) or /Arg(-3) but, instead, interacts favorably with Glu/Asp(-3). We propose a model for ligand recognition that accounts for interactions extending across the entire binding site but that highlights several key specificity switches within the PDZ domain fold.</p><p>Keyword:['tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134998>Peptide identification from a Porphyra dioica protein hydrolysate with antioxidant, angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory activities.</a></h2><p>A Porphyra dioica protein extract was enzymatically hydrolysed and then fractionated using semi-preparative reverse-phase high performance chromatography. The hydrolysate and its fractions were tested for their  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) along with their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activities.

Recently, we have reported that two heptapeptides (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp, KP6) coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) through the ε-amino group of N-terminus Lys in the absence/presence of 6-amino-n-caproic acid (AC) linker to FITC-(FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6-can be useful as fluorescent probes for the specific detection of ox-LDL. In this study, to develop the fluorescent peptides with high plasma stability for the specific detection of ox-LDL, we investigated the interaction of (FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6 substituted with D-Lys at the N-terminus-(FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6-with ox-LDL, and the in vitro stability of these peptides in mouse plasma. (FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6 bound with high specificity to ox-LDL in a dose-dependent manner, and also to ox-LDL in the mouse plasma. Furthermore, (FITC)dKP6 was more stable than (FITC)KP6 in mouse plasma (102.1% versus 69.0% remained after 1 h). These findings strongly suggest that (FITC)dKP6 and (FITC-AC)dKP6 may be effective fluorescent probes with higher plasma stability than (FITC)KP6 and (FITC-AC)KP6 for the specific detection of ox-LDL.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902001>New Insights into the Inhibition Mechanism of Betulinic Acid on α-Glucosidase.</a></h2><p>Betulinic acid (BA), an important pentacyclic triterpene widely distributed in many foods, possesses high antidiabetic activity.

Because the peptide contains a tyrosine moiety, it can be readily labeled with a radioactive iodine. In this study, we investigated the possibility of abscess localization by i.v. administration of this radioiodinated CP. The peptide was iodinated with 125I using chloramine-T and purified using Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography. The final preparation had a purity of 88.5 +/- 3.8% (n = 6) and a specific radioactivity of 600-800 ci/mM. The iodinated CP bound to rabbit neutrophils specifically; its binding could be prevented by non-labeled CP. When 4-6 ng of 125-I-CP per kg body weight was injected into abscess-bearing rabbits, there was an immediate, but transient neutropenia, followed by a rebound neutrophilia. The abscess to muscle (A/M) ratio was 11.6 +/- 1.1 at 6 hrs and 11.0 +/- 4.7 at 24 hrs after injection; while the abscess to blood (A/B) ratio was 0.9 +/- 0.2 and 3.7 +/- 0.6 at 6 and 24 hrs post injection, respectively. Control animals injected with Na125I revealed an A/M ratio of 2.9 +/- 0.2 and an A/B ratio of 0.9 +/- 0.3 at 6 hrs after injection. Analysis of the radioactivity in the blood after 125I-CP administration, revealed that the majority (less than 87%) of the radioactivity was present as 125I-CP in the plasma fraction. Our results suggest that radioiodinated synthetic CP shows promise for abscess localization. However, further refinement of the method is required.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868105>Structure of iridoid synthase in complex with NADP(+)/8-oxogeranial reveals the structural basis of its substrate specificity.</a></h2><p>Iridoid synthase (IS), as a vegetal enzyme belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, produces the ring skeletons for downstream alkaloids with various pharmaceutical activities, including the commercially available antineoplastic agents, vinblastine and vincristine. Here, we present the crystal structures of IS in apo state and in complex with NADP(+)/8-oxogeranial, exhibiting an active center that lacks the classical /Lys/Ser triad spatially conserved in SDRs, with only the catalytically critical function of triad tyrosine remained in Tyr178. In consistent, mutation of Tyr178 to a phenylalanine residue significantly abolished the catalytic activity of IS. Within the substrate binding pocket, the linear-shaped 8-oxogeranial adopts an entirely extended conformation with its two aldehyde ends hydrogen-bonded to Tyr178-OH and Ser349-OH, respectively. In addition, the intermediate carbon chain of bound substrate is harbored by a well-ordered hydrophobic scaffold, involving residues Ile145, Phe149, Leu203, Met213, Phe342, Ile345 and Leu352. Mutagenesis studies showed that both Ser349 and the hydrophobic residues around are determinant to the substrate specificity and, consequently, the catalytic activity of IS. In contrast, the Gly150-Pro160 loop previously proposed as a factor involved in substrate binding might have very limited contribution, because the deletion of residues Ile151-His161 has only slight influence on the catalytic activity. We believe that the present work will help to elucidate the substrate specificity of IS and to integrate its detailed catalytic mechanism.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in  and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for the permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (3). Several families of MMPs are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (4-7). MMP expression is highly regulated in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. Elevated levels of MMPs have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (8). The peptide Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val-Arg-NH (GPLGVR) was found to be a MMP2/9 substrate and is cleaved between the Gly (G) and Val (V) residues (9). Chuang et al. (10) linked a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) group to the N-terminus of Cys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val--Lys (CRSGPLGVYKK) and a hydrophobic tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) molecule to the C-terminus Lys (K) residue to form PEG-CRSGPLGVYKK-TMR (PEG-peptide-TMR) for optical imaging of protease activity . Upon MMP cleavage, the lipophilic VYKK-TMR is released and accumulated at the sites (cell surface) of protease activity. The accumulation was most likely attributed to the binding of the lipophilic VYKK-TMR to the cell membrane non-specifically. PEG-peptide-TMR accumulated in HT1080 tumors (with high MMP2 expression) but not in MCF-7 tumors (with low MMP2 expression), as determined with optical imaging in nude mice.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22573843>Triennial Lactation Symposium: Mammary metabolism of amino acids in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met, Phe (+), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, Ile, Leu, , , and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of Phe+ uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling Phe supply did not result in mammary oxidation of Phe+ and either limited or no contribution of peptides to Phe and  mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (Ile, Leu, Val, and ) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing  supply decreased  U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and , does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the  U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than energy supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for energy provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as  and energy supply, in other tissues to support lactation.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23792041>An endothelin-3-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide as a novel inhibitor of platelet-activating factor.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent proinflammatory mediator, is involved in many inflammatory diseases. We recently reported that synthetic biotinylated peptides having a -Asp-Gly sequence inhibit PAF-induced  by directly binding to PAF. In this study, we investigated the effect of two synthetic biotinylated peptides, both of which have a sequence similar to -Asp-Gly-an endothelin-3 (ET-3)-related biotinylated pentapeptide (-Asp-Lys-Glu, BPET3) and a scavenger receptor CD36-related biotinylated tetrapeptide (-Gly-Lys, BPCD36)-on PAF-induced  by using a rat model of hind paw oedema. BPET3 markedly inhibited PAF-induced oedema in a dose-dependent manner, and the dose that caused 50% inhibition was estimated to be approximately 2.64 nmol/paw. The inhibitory effect of BPCD36 on PAF-induced paw oedema was less than that of BPET3, while a synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Lys-Lys--Asp-Glu) shuffling amino acid sequence of BPET3, an ET-1-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Leu-Met-Asp-Lys-Glu), or an ET-2-related synthetic biotinylated pentapeptide (Trp-Leu-Asp-Lys-Glu) did not inhibit PAF-induced paw oedema. Furthermore, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence studies demonstrated that ET-3 specifically interacted with both PAF and its metabolite/precursor lyso-PAF. These results provide evidence that the -Asp region in both ET-3 and BPET3 is essential for marked inhibition of the peptide on PAF-induced , and strongly suggest that BPET3 may be useful as a novel anti-inflammatory drug targeting PAF.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αβ integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, , osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of the αβ integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. The αβ antagonists are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents and the agonists are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9). The peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has been identified as a recognition motif used by extracellular matrix proteins (vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen) to bind to a variety of integrins, including αβ. Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Most of the cyclic RGD peptides are composed of five amino acids. Various cyclic RGD peptides exhibit selective inhibition of binding to αβ (50% inhibition concentration (IC), 7–40 nM) but not to αβ (IC, 600–4,000 nM) or αβ (IC, 700–5,000 nM) integrins (11). Various radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides and peptidomimetics have been found to have high accumulation in tumors in mice (12, 13). From these developments, [F]galacto-c(RGDfK) has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies for the imaging of αβ in cancer patients (14-18). Knetsch et al.

The Stern-Volmer equations, along with spectroscopic observations, were used to determine the quenching and binding parameters.

Domain I of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (cCPE) binds to the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of a subset of claudins, e.g. Cld3/4 and influences   formation. We aimed to identify interacting interfaces and to alter claudin specificity of cCPE. Mutagenesis, binding assays, and molecular modeling were performed. Mutation-guided ECL2 docking of Cld3/4 onto the crystal structure of cCPE revealed a common orientation of the proposed ECL2 helix-turn-helix motif in the binding cavity of cCPE: residues Leu(150)/Leu(151) of Cld3/4 bind similarly to a hydrophobic pit formed by (306), (310), and (312) of cCPE, and Pro(152)/Ala(153) of Cld3/4 is proposed to bind to a second pit close to Leu(223), Leu(254), and Leu(315). However, sequence variation in ECL2 of these claudins is likely responsible for slightly different conformation in the turn region, which is in line with different cCPE interaction modes of Cld3 and Cld4. Substitutions of other so far not characterized cCPE residues lining the pocket revealed two spatially separated groups of residues (Leu(223), Asp(225), and Arg(227) and Leu(254), lle(258), and Asp(284)), which are involved in binding to Cld3 and Cld4, albeit differently. Involvement of Asn(148) of Cld3 in cCPE binding was confirmed, whereas no evidence for involvement of (156) or Arg(157) was found. We show structure-based alteration of cCPE generating claudin binders, which interact subtype-specific preferentially either with Cld3 or with Cld4.

Environmentally responsive and switchable polymer brush systems have a great potential to create such smart biointerfaces. This study focuses on the bioconjugation of cell-instructive peptides, containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide sequence (RGD motif), onto well-defined polymer brush films. Herein, the highly tailored end-grafted homo polymer brushes are either composed of the polyelectrolyte poly(acrylic) acid (PAA), providing the reactive carboxyl functionalities, or of the temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm). Of particular interest is the preparation of grafted-to binary brushes using both polymers and their subsequent conversion to RGD-biofunctionalized PNIPAAm-PAA binary brushes by a carbodiimide conjugation method. The bioconjugation process of two linear RGD-peptides Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Lys and one cyclic RGD-peptide cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-) is comparatively investigated by complementary analysis methods. Both techniques, in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and the in situ spectroscopic ellipsometric analysis, describe changes of the brush surface properties due to biofunctionalization. Besides, the bound RGD-peptide amount is quantitatively evaluated by ellipsometry in comparison to high performance liquid chromatography analysis data. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations of the RGD-peptides themselves allow a better understanding of the bioconjugation process depending on the peptide properties. The significant influence on the bioconjugation result can be derived, on the one hand, of the polymer brush composition, especially from the PNIPAAm content, and, on the other hand, of the peptide dimension and its reactivity.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8392528>Effects of monomethylfumarate on human granulocytes.</a></h2><p>Monomethylfumarate (MMF) is the most active metabolite of the new antipsoriasis drug Fumaderm. Because granulocytes play an important role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, the effects of this drug on the functional activities of these cells were investigated. MMF stimulated polarization and elastase release, and enhanced the intracellular killing of bacteria by granulocytes. This compound suppressed the formyl-Met-Nle-Phe (FMLP)-stimulated respiratory burst in these cells. MMF and dimethylfumarate but not its stereoisomer dimethylmaleate, fumaric acid, or dimethylmalate stimulated polarization of and elastase release by granulocytes, indicating that methylated fumarate derivatives interact with granulocytes in a specific fashion. MMF did not affect the binding of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein isothiocyanate to the FMLP receptor on granulocytes. This compound induced an increase in the intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) and cyclic adenosine monophsphate concentration. The agonistic effects of MMF on granulocytes are thought to be mediated by the rise in the [Ca++]i and the antagonistic effects by the increase in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration.

De novo design of antibodies binding specific epitopes could greatly accelerate discovery of therapeutics as compared to conventional immunization or synthetic library selection strategies. Here, we employed de novo complementarity determining region (CDR) design to engineer targeted antibody-antigen interactions using previously described in silico methods. CDRs predicted to bind the minimal FLAG peptide (Asp--Asp) were grafted onto a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) acceptor framework. Fifty scFvs comprised of designed heavy and light or just heavy chain CDRs were synthesized and screened for peptide binding by phage ELISA. Roughly half of the designs resulted in detectable scFv expression. Four antibodies, designed entirely in silico, bound the minimal FLAG sequence with high specificity and sensitivity. When reformatted as soluble antigen-binding fragments (Fab), these clones expressed well, were predominantly monomeric and retained peptide specificity. In both formats, the antibodies bind the peptide only when present at the amino-terminus of a carrier protein and even conservative peptide amino acid substitutions resulted in a complete loss of binding.

The experimental design was a split plot, with cow as the whole plot, treatment as the whole-plot factor and days in milk (DIM) as the subplot factor. Cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control or infusion of 1,500 g/d of glucose into the abomasum from the day of calving to 29 DIM. Cows were sampled prepartum and at 4, 15, and 29 DIM. Postpartum dry matter intake increased at a lower rate with infusion compared with the control. Arterial concentrations of all essential AA (EAA) were lower with infusion compared with the control. Net portal fluxes of His, Ile, Leu, , Met, Phe, , Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and  were lower with infusion compared with the control and the net portal fluxes of these AA showed positive correlations with dry matter intake, whereas the net portal fluxes of Asp, Glu, and Gln were unaffected by treatment. Net hepatic fluxes of EAA were not affected by treatment but increased as lactation progressed with both treatments. On a net basis, all EAA were removed by the liver prepartum and at 4 DIM, whereas Met, Phe, and  were the only EAA being removed at 29 DIM. Except for Ala, AA removed by the liver might be used primarily for noncatabolic processes, as exemplified by the 16% of hepatic Gly uptake accounted for as urinary hippurate. The measured hepatic uptake of glucogenic precursors (glucogenic AA, volatile fatty acids, lactate, and glycerol) accounted for 50 to 90% of the hepatic release of glucose. The hepatic urea output accounted for more than 100% of the hepatic ureagenic precursor uptake, indicating that the glucogenic precursors unaccounted for are nonnitrogen-containing compounds. In conclusion, an increased exogenous glucose supply to the small intestine did not seem to affect the amount of EAA and non-EAA available for peripheral tissues in early lactation, and the study did not indicate an AA-sparing effect of small intestinal glucose absorption. In periparturient dairy cows, hepatic catabolism of AA was not driven by the increased whole-body demand for glucose, and Ala was the only AA that contributed substantially to hepatic .

However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low fluorescence background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals (4, 5). Fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals made of CdSe/CdTe-ZnS with radii of 1–10 nm (6-8). They can be tuned to emit light in a range of wavelengths by changing their sizes and composition, thus providing broad excitation profiles and high absorption coefficients. They have narrow and symmetric emission spectra with long excited-state lifetimes (20–50 ns) compared with fluorescent dyes (1–10 ns). QDs possess good quantum yields of 40–90% and high extinction coefficients, and they are more photo-stable than conventional organic dyes. They can be coated and capped with hydrophilic materials for additional conjugations with biomolecules, such as peptides, antibodies, nucleic acids, and small organic compounds, which are tested  and  (8-12). Although many cells have been labeled with QDs  with little cytotoxicity, there are only limited studies of long-term toxicity of QDs in small animals (13-21), and little is known about the toxicity and the mechanisms of clearance and metabolism of QDs in humans.

Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (Asp, Glu, , and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, , and Phe, and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, Val, Ile, Cys, Gly, Ser, and . The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order glycolysis and  with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively). Cladistic analysis of the structure of biochemical pathways makes hypotheses in biochemical evolution explicit and parsimonious.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9250579>Vasoactive intestinal peptide supports induced migration of human keratinocytes and their  of an artificial polyurethane matrix.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of the neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), (D-Phe2)-VIP, (-Pro-Arg-)-VIP and the VIP fragment (1-12) on induced migration and  in vitro.

A more generic kit radiolabeling procedure accommodating Ga-68 from different generators was developed for NOTA-RGD and evaluated for its versatile use and safety in subsequent in vivo applications. The [Ga]NOTA-RGD kit was further verified for its expected biodistribution and pharmacokinetics in nonhuman primates and its clinical sensitivity to detect solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) in cancer patients.Single vial kits containing 28-56 nmol of NOTA-cyclo-Arg-Gly-Asp-d- (NOTA-RGD) and sodium acetate trihydrate buffer were formulated. Versatility of the NOTA-RGD radiolabeling performance and adaption to a TiO- and a SnO-based generator type, characterization and long-term storage stability of the kits were carried out. The blood clearance and urine recovery kinetics as well as the image-guided biodistribution of [Ga]NOTA-RGD was studied in a vervet monkey model. [Ga]NOTA-RGD kits were further tested clinically to target solitary pulmonary nodules.The kits could be successfully formulated warranting integrity over 3-4 months with a good [Ga]NOTA-RGD radiolabeling performance (radiochemical purity >95 %, decay corrected yield 76-94 %, specific activity of 8.8-37.9 GBq/μmol) The kits met all quality requirements to be further tested in vivo. [Ga]NOTA-RGD cleared rapidly from blood and was majorly excreted via the renal route. The liver, spleen, heart and intestines showed initial uptake with steadily declining tissue activity concentration over time. In addition, the [Ga]NOTA-RGD kit allowed for delineation of SPN from non-malignant lung tissue in humans.A more versatile radiolabeling procedure using kit-formulated NOTA-RGD and different generator types was achieved.

This peptide may be considered a C-terminally extended version of f-Met-Leu-Phe which carries a fluorescent cargo into cells. By analogy to other peptide hormones for which we have evaluated epitope-tagged agonists as carriers of antibody cargoes, we have designed and evaluated f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--myc, C-terminally extended with the 10-residue myc tag. This peptide is as potent as f-Met-Leu-Phe to compete for f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--FITC uptake by PLB-985 cells, but did not mediate (10-1000nM) the internalization of the fluorescent anti-myc monoclonal antibody 4A6 added to the extracellular fluid at ~7nM (microscopy). The nonfluorescent version of the antibody (28nM) acts as a pre-receptor antagonist of f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--myc, but not of f-Met-Leu-Phe (superoxide release assay in differentiated PLB-985 cells). A further prolonged analog, f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--(Asn-Gly)5-myc, designed to decrease the possible steric hindrance between FPR1 and the bound anti-myc antibody, has little affinity for the receptor, precluding a direct assessment of this issue. Thus, the relatively low-affinity anti-myc antibody used at a high concentration functionally behaves as a selective pre-receptor antagonist of the agonist f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--myc.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Since prior studies suggested that cultured bovine endothelial cells express high affinity binding sites for the neutrophil chemotactic oligopeptide formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe), we sought to further characterize the interaction between formyl peptide chemoattractants and human vascular endothelial cells. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and peripheral blood neutrophils specifically bound f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe, whereas specific binding to cultured fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells was negligible. Endothelial cells expressed 3.6 +/- 0.7 X 10(5) binding sites/cell with a Kd of 210 +/- 31 nM. Although the hexapeptide formyl norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-norleucyl- (f-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-) and the tetrapeptide f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys completed with f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe for binding to endothelial cells, specific binding of 125I-f-Nl-Leu-Phe- or f-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein to endothelial cells was not observed, suggesting that steric constraints on formyl peptide binding differ between endothelial cells and leukocytes. At 37 degrees C, cell-associated f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe greatly exceeded that bound at 0 degrees C and was incorporated predominantly into a nondisplaceable compartment. Release of f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe or radioactive breakdown products from this compartment was time- and temperature-dependent with a t1/2 of approximately equal to 20 min at 37 degrees C. Resolution of the radioactive products released from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells by thin layer chromatography indicated that greater than or equal to 57% of the released material co-migrated with intact f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe. Degradative release was blocked by agents that interfere with lysosomal acidification. The radioactive material released from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells bound specifically to neutrophils. This binding was inhibited 50.2 +/- 6.4% by a greater than or equal to 10(3)-fold excess of nonradioactive f-Met-Leu-Phe whereas binding of authentic f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe was inhibited 89.4 +/- 3.0%. Supernatant obtained from f-Met-Leu-[3H]Phe-loaded endothelial cells elicited a rise in neutrophil cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) measured by quin2 fluorescence. The change in neutrophil [Ca2+]i depended on ligand binding to the neutrophil formyl peptide receptor since endothelial supernatants were devoid of activity in the presence of the f-Met-Leu-Phe antagonist, tert-butoxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27394940>Isolation and characterization of anti-inflammatory peptides derived from whey protein.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to isolate and characterize anti-inflammatory peptides from whey protein hydrolysates using alcalase.

Rhenium complexes Re-1 through Re-3 were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically, and receptor binding affinity was demonstrated for Re-3 in SSTR-expressing cells (AR42J, IC = 91 nM). Radiolabeled complexes [Tc]Tc/[Re]Re-1/2 and [Tc]Tc-3 were prepared in high radiochemical yield (>90%, determined by radio-HPLC) by reacting [Tc]/[Re][Tc/Re(OH)(CO)] with 1-3 and correlated well with the respective Re-1 through Re-3 standards in comparative HPLC studies. All radiotracers remained intact through 24 h (Tc-labeled complexes) or 48 h (Re-labeled complexes) against 1 mM l-histidine and 1 mM l-cysteine (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Similarly, rat serum stability studies displayed no decomposition and low nonspecific binding of 9-24% through 4 h. Biodistribution of [Tc]Tc-3 in healthy CF-1 mice demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Rapid clearance was observed within 1 h post-injection, predominantly via the renal system (82% of the injected dose was excreted in urine by 1 h), with low kidney retention (% ID/g: 11 at 1 h, 5 at 4 h, and 1 at 24 h) and low nonspecific uptake in other organs/tissues.

They process good quantum yields of 40%–90% and possess high extinction coefficients. They are more photo-stable than conventional organic dyes.

The predictor variables tested included average body weight (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, Thr:Lys, Leu:Thr, Ile:Thr, Val:Thr, BCAA:Thr, (Phe+):Lys, Leu:(Phe+), Ile:(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the WEIGHT statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × Ile:Lys) - (0.1479 × Ile:Lys × Ile:Lys) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

The 27-peptide MCF-III-6 (Leu-Glu-His-Leu-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Gln-Met-Ile-Leu-Asn-Gly-Ile-Asn-Asn-- -Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu-Thr-Arg-Met-Leu) that comprises the region 14-40 from the IL-2 amino acid sequence was synthesized and used for immunization of rabbits. Resulting anti-MCF-III-6 polyvalent rabbit antibodies reacted specifically in EIA up to dilution of 10(-7) with the MCF-III-6 peptide used for immunization as well as with 16-peptide I-16 (Cys-Nle-Gly-Ile-Asn-Asn--Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu-Thr-Arg-Met-Leu) that comprises the region 27-40 from the IL-2 amino acid sequence. The anti-MCF-III-6 antibody reacted also with human recombinant IL-2 preparations obtained from three producers (Cetus, Riga and Amersham), to the concentration of 0.1 ng/ml, and with various human lymphoid IL-2 preparations. Direct correlation was observed between quantitative measurements of human lymphoid IL-2 by EIA and by CTLL bioassay. It can be concluded that utilization of synthetic IL-2 peptides provides a suitable and comparatively unexpensive immunogen for the production of IL-2 antibodies and that the solid phase EIA using such antibodies can be employed as a rapid, reproducible, and sensitive method for quantitative examination of both recombinant and lymphoid IL-2 preparations.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6603438>Phenol coupling initiated by one-electron oxidation of tyrosine units in peptides and histone.</a></h2><p>Phenoxyl radicals generated pulse radiolytically by the reaction of N.3 with Gly- decay biomolecularly (2k = 4.7 X 10(8)M-1 s-1) with efficient formation of 2,2'-dimers, which enolize rapidly (k = 2.7 X 10(4) s-1) to produce the 2,2'-biphenolic product.

The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the in vitro and in vivo performance of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)---Cys)D--NH2), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist 64Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys--D-Trp---Cys)). In vitro studies demonstrated Kd values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist 64/natCu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist 64/natCu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas 64Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to >80% tumor blocking. 64Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient in vivo stability. PET studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6774048>Heterogeneity of human serum amyloid A proteins.</a></h2><p>Serum amyloid A proteins (SAA), presumed precursors of the tissue amyloid A proteins (AA) characteristic of secondary amyloidosis, have been isolated from the plasma high-density lipoproteins (HDL) of normals after etiocholanolone-induced  and from patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and Goodpasture's syndrome. At least six polymorphic forms of SAA wer identified among the low molecular weight proteins of HDL, and these comprosed up to 27% of the total HDL protein. Gel and ion-exchange chromatography permitted isolation of the SAA polymorphs in homogeneous form. Their amino acid compositions were very similar, they were indistinguishable in cationic and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems, and each had the terminal sequency COOH--Phe-. Charge heterogeneity in anionic-urea polyacrylamide gel electropherograms was unaffected by neuaminidase treatment, and none of the SAA protein bands stained with the periodate-Schiff reagent. The two major SAA polymorphs, designated SAA4 and SAA5 according to their order of elution from DEAE-cellulose, had different NH2-terminal sequences. Manual Edman degradation demonstrated NH2-arg-ser-phe-phe- for SAA4 and NH2-ser-phe-phe- for SAA5. This NH2-terminal heterogeneity corresponds to that most frequently reported for AA and suggests that microheterogeneity in SAA may underlie that already documented in AA. Sufficient quantitites of the other SAA polymorphs were not available for similar analyses, but the amino acid compositions do not indicate that NH2-terminal heterogeneity accounts for all of the observed polymorphism. Artifactual polymorphism also appears unlikely, and the heterogeneiy of SAA may reflect origin from more than one cell type with or without posttranslational modificaton. We calculate from quantitative COOH-terminal analyses that SAA is of 11,000-11,900 mol wt. Primary structure studies have shown AA t be a single chain protein of 76 residues, and SAA, therefore, appears to contain a peptide of 33 amino acids that is missing from AA.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28751674>Honokiol suppresses formyl peptide-induced human neutrophil activation by blocking formyl peptide receptor 1.</a></h2><p>Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) mediates bacterial and mitochondrial N-formyl peptides-induced neutrophil activation. Therefore, FPR1 is an important therapeutic target for drugs to treat septic or sterile inflammatory diseases. Honokiol, a major bioactive compound of Magnoliaceae plants, possesses several anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we show that honokiol exhibits an inhibitory effect on FPR1 binding in human neutrophils. Honokiol inhibited superoxide anion generation, reactive oxygen species formation, and elastase release in bacterial or mitochondrial N-formyl peptides (FPR1 agonists)-activated human neutrophils. Adhesion of FPR1-induced human neutrophils to cerebral endothelial cells was also reduced by honokiol. The receptor-binding results revealed that honokiol repressed FPR1-specific ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein binding to FPR1 in human neutrophils, neutrophil-like THP-1 cells, and hFPR1-transfected HEK293 cells. However, honokiol did not inhibit FPR2-specific ligand binding to FPR2 in human neutrophils. Furthermore, honokiol inhibited FPR1 agonist-induced calcium mobilization as well as phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK in human neutrophils. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that honokiol may have therapeutic potential for treating FPR1-mediated inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22362402>Sphingomyelinase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus in mouse diaphragm muscle fibers.</a></h2><p>Diseases that result in muscle weakness, e.g., heart failure, are characterized by elevated sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity. In intact muscle, SMase increases oxidants that contribute to diminished muscle force. However, the source of oxidants, specific processes of muscle contraction that are dysfunctional, and biochemical changes underlying the weakness elicited by SMase remain unknown. We tested three hypotheses: 1) SMase-induced depression of muscle force is mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2) SMase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, and 3) SMase promotes oxidation and phosphorylation of myofibrillar proteins. Our experiments included intact muscle bundles, permeabilized single fibers, and isolated myofibrillar proteins. The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant d-Arg-2',6'-dimethyl--Phe-NH(2), decreased cytosolic oxidants and protected intact muscle bundles from weakness stimulated by SMase. SMase depressed maximal calcium-activated force by 20% in permeabilized single fibers (in kN/m(2): control 117 ± 6; SMase 93 ± 8; P < 0.05). Calcium sensitivity of permeabilized single fibers decreased from 5.98 ± 0.03 (control) to 5.91 ± 0.02 (SMase; P < 0.05). Myofibrillar protein nitrotyrosines, carbonyls, and phosphorylation were unaltered by SMase. Our study shows that the fall in specific force of intact muscle elicited by SMase is mediated by mitochondrial ROS and can be attributed largely to dysfunction of the contractile apparatus.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7758002>The laminin alpha 1 chain Ile--Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV)-containing peptide promotes liver  by human colon cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Laminin, a major basement membrane-specific glycoprotein, promotes the attachment, migration, and invasion of a variety of tumor cells. Since laminin is present in the perisinusoidal matrix of the liver, we studied its effects on liver  by human colon cancer cells (HM7, LiM6) previously shown to have liver-metastasizing ability in athymic mice. These malignant cells expressed high levels of a 32-kDa laminin-binding protein on Western blot analysis when compared to the low metastatic parental cell line. Coinjection of laminin alpha chain-derived peptides which contain the amino acid sequence Ile--Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV) significantly stimulated liver  as determined by liver weight (P < 0.005) and number of tumor nodules (P < 0.02) 3 weeks after splenic-portal inoculation into nude mice. No stimulation was seen with a control peptide containing the same amino acids but in a scrambled sequence. In contrast, the -Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg peptide from the laminin beta 1 chain significantly inhibited HM7 liver . These differences were not due to alterations in the number of cells initially reaching the liver as determined by injection of [125I]iododeoxyuridine-labeled tumor cells, but retention in the liver was stimulated by the IKVAV-containing peptides. Flow analysis indicated that the IKVAV peptide may act, in part, by stimulating homotypic adhesion of tumor cells. These data suggest that interactions of colon cancer cells with the IKVAV site on laminin may play a role in the formation of metastatic foci in the liver through cell-cell or cell-substratum interactions which promote metastasis.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641948>Acetyl-lys-lys-lys-lys-lys-cys-gly-cys-gly-gly-pro-leu--lys-ile-ile-lys-lys-leu-leu-glu-ser-heparin-[Tc] .</a></h2><p>Because of their ability to accumulate at sites of infection and , the leukocyte and monocyte components of the white blood cell (WBC) have often been labeled under  conditions with radioisotopes such as indium (In), meta-stable technetium (Tc), or radioactive compounds such as Tc-gluceptate, [Ga]gallium citrate, and Tc-labeled antibodies, etc (1). Radiolabeling of leukocytes or monocytes involves the isolation of these cells from the WBC pool, a process that is slow and expensive, involves the handling of blood, and can lead to contamination of the samples. In addition, the labeled cells have a slow clearance from circulation and may be imaged up to 24 h after administration to allow time for accumulation at the site of infection or . Also, these imaging agents usually have a low signal-to-noise ratio, especially during the early time points, and show a high intestinal uptake that interferes with diagnostic imaging of the abdominal area (2). Radioactively labeled monoclonal antibodies have been used for the imaging of infections, but these radiopharmaceuticals have limited application because they also have a slow clearance from circulation and are not always sensitive enough to detect pulmonary or bone infections (3, 4). In addition, labeled antibodies have been shown to induce transient neutropenia and the formation of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) (4, 5). The HAMA response can limit the repeat use of the antibodies because it neutralizes and alters the biodistribution of the agent (6). The use of peptides to detect sites of infection or  is an attractive option because these compounds are cheap and easy to synthesize, can be modified to suit target requirements, and show rapid clearance from circulation (7, 8).

Moyer et al. identified and developed a heparin-binding peptide, P483, for the imaging of infections (9). The sequence of this peptide was based on the platelet factor-4 heparin-binding region. The peptide comprises 23 amino acids, was modified to contain a lysine-rich region to allow rapid renal clearance, and could be labeled with Tc. The peptide was complexed with heparin and labeled with Tc to generate Tc-P483H, a peptide that targets leukocytes (9). Conjugation of the peptide with heparin enhanced the binding of the labeled peptide to WBC. The labeled peptide was evaluated for the imaging of infections in a rabbit model and also in humans (9, 10).</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9921265>[Identification of biologically active sites in laminin an extracellular matrix protein].</a></h2><p>Laminin-1, a major component of basement membranes, has multiple biological activities including promotion of cell adhesion, spreading, migration, growth, neurite outgrowth and tumor metastasis. Several active sites on laminin-1 have been identified previously. We modified these biologically active peptides to enhance their activities. The multimeric YIGSR (-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg) peptides assembled on a branched lysine core were found to strongly enhance the activity of YIGSR in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. We also found the all-D-configuration peptide segment containing the IKVAV (Ile--Val-Ala-Val) sequence had similar biological activities to the native all-L-peptide in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that these modified compounds are potentially useful for clinical applications. We have identified new active sequences from the laminin alpha 1 chain carboxyl-terminal globular domain (G domain). Using a systematic screening for cell binding sites with 113 overlapping synthetic peptides, we found five peptides (AG-10, AG-22, AG-32, AG-56, and AG-73) showed cell attachment activities with cell-type specificities. AG-10 and AG-32 were found to interact with integrins. AG-73 caused metastases of B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells to the liver  in mice. Additionally AG-73 was found to promote neurite outgrowth. Moreover, this peptide inhibited laminin mediated acinar-like development of a human submandibular gland cell line.

In the present study, to develop a novel fluorescent peptide for specific detection of ox-LDL, we investigated the interaction (with ox-LDL) of an undecapeptide corresponding to positions 41 to 51 of a potent antimicrobial protein (royalisin, which consists of 51 residues; from royal jelly of honeybees), conjugated at the N-terminus to FITC in the presence of 6-amino-n-caproic acid (AC) linker, (FITC-AC)-royalisin P11, which contains both sequences, Phe-Lys-Asp and Asp-Lys-, similar to -Asp in (FITC)KP6. The (FITC-AC)-royalisin P11 bound with high specificity to ox-LDL in a dose-dependent manner, through the binding to major lipid components in ox-LDL (lysophosphatidylcholine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine). In contrast, a (FITC-AC)-shuffled royalisin P11 peptide, in which sequences Phe-Lys-Asp and Asp-Lys- were modified to Lys-Phe-Asp and Asp-, respectively, hardly bound to LDL and ox-LDL. These findings strongly suggest that (FITC-AC)-royalisin P11 may be an effective fluorescent probe for specific detection of ox-LDL and that royalisin from the royal jelly of honeybees may play a role in the treatment of atherosclerosis through the specific binding of the region at positions 41 to 51 to ox-LDL.Copyright © 2018 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11087333>Experimental pretargeting studies of  with a humanized anti-CEA x murine anti-[In-DTPA] bispecific antibody construct and a (99m)Tc-/(188)Re-labeled peptide.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to localize (99m)Tc and (188)Re radionuclides to tumors, using a bispecific antibody (bsMAb) in a two-step approach where the radionuclides are attached to novel peptides incorporating moieties recognized by one arm of the bsMAb. A chemically cross-linked human/murine bsMAb, hMN-14 x 734 (Fab' x Fab'), anti-carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] x anti-indium-DTPA was prepared as a prelude to constructing a fully humanized bsMAb for future clinical application. N,N'-o-Phenylenedimaleimide was used to cross-link the Fab' fragments of the two antibodies at their hinge regions. This construct was shown to be >92% pure and fully reactive with CEA and a divalent (indium)DTPA-peptide. For pretargeting purposes, a peptide, IMP-192 [Ac-Lys(In-DTPA)-(In-DTPA)-Lys(TscG-Cys-)-NH(2) ¿TscG = 3-thiosemicarbazonylglyoxyl¿], with two indium-DTPAs and a chelate for selectively binding (99m)Tc or (188)Re, was synthesized.

Both bsMAbs maintained their integrity and dual binding specificity in vivo, but the hMN-14 x m734 was cleared more rapidly from the blood. This coincided with an increased uptake of the hMN-14 x m734 bsMAb in the liver and spleen, suggesting an active reticuloendothelial cell recognition mechanism of this mixed species construct in naive mice. Animals bearing GW-39 human   xenografts were injected with bsMAb (15 microg) and after allowing 24 or 72 h for the bsMAb constructs to clear from the blood (hMN-14 and murine F6 x 734, respectively), [(188)Re]IMP-192 (7 microCi) or [(99m)Tc]IMP-192 (10 microCi) was injected at a bsMAb:peptide ratio of 10:1.

Integrins consist of an α and a β subunit and are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. The αβ integrin is the most prominent receptor affecting tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, metastasis, tumor-induced angiogenesis, , osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (2-7). Expression of the αβ integrin is strong on tumor cells and activated endothelial cells, whereas expression is weak on resting endothelial cells and most normal tissues. Antagonists of αβ are being studied as antitumor and antiangiogenic agents, and the agonists of αβ are being studied as angiogenic agents for coronary angiogenesis (6, 8, 9).

Various radiolabeled antagonists have been introduced for imaging of tumors and tumor angiogenesis (10). Most cyclic RGD peptides are composed of five amino acids. Haubner et al.

The tendency to form a bend was evaluated by assessing the probability of beta-turn occurrence; the highest probability was found in the tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu, occupying the positions 33-36 of the IL-2 molecule.

Ligated formyl peptide receptors, and to a lesser extent CR3, accumulated at the sites of target internalization for all forms of phagocytosis examined. However, Fc gamma RIIIB, uPAR, IL-8, Con A, and the FPR antagonist FBoc-PLPLP were not polarized on cells during phagocytosis. These data suggest that agonist-labeled formyl peptide receptors may play a broader role in leukocyte function than previously suggested, including possible participation in phagocytosis.</p><p>Keyword:['immunity']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23670191>Propofol inhibits superoxide production, elastase release, and chemotaxis in formyl peptide-activated human neutrophils by blocking formyl peptide receptor 1.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils play a critical role in acute and chronic inflammatory processes, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, sepsis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Binding of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) by N-formyl peptides can activate neutrophils and may represent a new therapeutic target in either sterile or septic . Propofol, a widely used i.v. anesthetic, has been shown to modulate immunoinflammatory responses. However, the mechanism of propofol remains to be established. In this study, we showed that propofol significantly reduced superoxide generation, elastase release, and chemotaxis in human neutrophils activated by fMLF. Propofol did not alter superoxide generation or elastase release in a cell-free system. Neither inhibitors of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors nor an inhibitor of protein kinase A reversed the inhibitory effects of propofol. In addition, propofol showed less inhibitory effects in non-FPR1-induced cell responses. The signaling pathways downstream from FPR1, involving calcium, AKT, and ERK1/2, were also competitively inhibited by propofol. These results show that propofol selectively and competitively inhibits the FPR1-induced human neutrophil activation. Consistent with the hypothesis, propofol inhibited the binding of N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein, a fluorescent analog of fMLF, to FPR1 in human neutrophils, differentiated THP-1 cells, and FPR1-transfected human embryonic kidney-293 cells. To our knowledge, our results identify, for the first time, a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of propofol by competitively blocking FPR1 in human neutrophils. Considering the importance of N-formyl peptides in inflammatory processes, our data indicate that propofol may have therapeutic potential to attenuate neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases by blocking FPR1.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334786>Analysis of in situ and ex vivo αVβ3 integrin expression during experimental carotid atherogenesis.</a></h2><p>Mural  has been shown to contribute to the development of plaque, with the α(V)β(3) integrin highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques. We herein examined α(V)β(3) integrin expression as a function of carotid atherosclerosis formation in the apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse.Constrictive collars were placed around the left common carotid arteries of apo E(-/-) mice maintained on a high-fat diet (n = 14). Before and 21 days following collar placement, in vivo serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of the carotid aortic diameter were performed using a 7T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Near- infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging was performed (n = 6) using an in vivo imaging system 0-24 hours following administration of 1.0 nmol c(RGDyK)-Cy5.5 via the tail vein. A competition experiment was performed by the co-injection of a saturating dose of bicyclic RGD peptide H-Glu[cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-)]2 (n = 3). Following image acquisition and sacrifice at 24 hours after injection, carotid arteries were harvested for histological analyses. Neointima formation and arterial remodeling in the carotid arteries of apoE(-/-) mice were induced by the placement of a constrictive collar. Significantly greater fluorescent signals were obtained from constrictive collar left common carotid arteries as compared to uninvolved aortic segments in constrictive collar mice. Binding to stenotic lesions was efficiently blocked in competition experiments. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of mural α(V)β(3) integrin expression in macrophages in the neointima. Signal intensity increased in a macrophage density-dependent fashion in the stenotic segments.Mural α(V)β(3) integrin expression, as determined using RGD-Cy5.5 near-infrared optical imaging, was increased in carotid arteries with constrictive collars in experimental mice.

The inflammatory response is brought about by the binding of N-formyl peptide to formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), specific signaling receptors expressed on myeloid as well as non-myeloid cells involved in the inflammatory process. N-formyl peptides conjugated with fluorochromes, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) are increasingly experimentally used to identify tissues involved in . Hypothesizing that the process of FITC-conjugation may transfer formyl peptide to a ligand that is efficiently cleared from the circulation by the natural powerful hepatic scavenging regime we studied the biodistribution of intravenously administered FITC-fNLPNTL (Fluorescein-isothiocyanate- N-Formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-) in mice. Our findings can be summarized as follows: i) In contrast to unconjugated fNLPNTL, FITC-fNLPNTL was rapidly taken up in the liver; ii) Mouse and human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes express formyl peptide receptor 1 (FRP1) on both mRNA (PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels; iii) Immunohistochemistry showed that mouse and human liver sections expressed FRP1 in LSECs and hepatocytes; and iv) Uptake of FITC-fNLPNTL could be largely blocked in mouse and human hepatocytes by surplus-unconjugated fNLPNTL, thereby suggesting that the hepatocytes in both species recognized FITC-fNLPNTL and fNLPNTL as indistinguishable ligands. This was in contrast to the mouse and human LSECs, in which the uptake of FITC-fNLPNTL was mediated by both FRP1 and a scavenger receptor, specifically expressed on LSECs. Based on these results we conclude that a significant proportion of FITC-fNLPNTL is taken up in LSECs via a scavenger receptor naturally expressed in these cells. This calls for great caution when using FITC-fNLPNTL and other chromogen-conjugated formyl peptides as a probe to identify cells in a liver engaged in . Moreover, our finding emphasizes the role of the liver as an important neutralizer of otherwise strong inflammatory signals such as formyl peptides.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24055926>Common mechanism in endothelin-3 and PAF receptor function for anti-inflammatory responses.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent lipid mediator that is implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases. Under inflammatory conditions, PAF is biosynthesized through the remodelling pathway and elicits many inflammatory responses through binding to its specific PAF receptor. Endogenous bioactive endothelins (ETs: ET-1, -2, and -3) are also considered potent inflammatory mediators that play a critical role in many inflammatory diseases. In this perspective, we provide a brief overview of possible common mechanisms in ETs and PAF receptor function for inflammatory responses. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that ET-3, but not ET-1 and ET-2, can attenuate PAF-induced  through direct binding of the -Asp (YKD) region in the peptide to PAF and its metabolite/precursor lyso-PAF, followed by inhibition of binding between PAF and its receptor. Additionally, YKD sequence-containing peptides may be useful as a novel type of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting this mechanism. These findings should lead to new treatment strategies for numerous inflammatory diseases by targeting the common mechanism in ET and PAF receptor function.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is a G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor expressed mainly on leukocytes. Surprisingly, aging Fpr1(-/-) mice develop spontaneous lens degeneration without  or infection (J.-L. Gao et al., manuscript in preparation). Therefore, we hypothesized that FPR1 is functionally expressed directly on lens epithelial cells, the only cell type in the lens. Consistent with this, the human fetal lens epithelial cell line FHL 124 expressed FPR1 mRNA and was strongly FPR1 protein-positive by Western blot and FACS. Competition binding using FPR1 ligands N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle- (Nle = Norleucine), formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, and peptide W revealed the same profile for FHL 124 cells, neutrophils, and FPR1-transfected HEK 293 cells. Saturation binding with fluorescein-labeled N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle- revealed ~2500 specific binding sites on FHL-124 cells (K(D) ~ 0.5 nm) versus ~40,000 sites on neutrophils (K(D) = 3.2 nm). Moreover, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine induced pertussis toxin-sensitive Ca(2+) flux in FHL 124 cells, consistent with classic G(i)-mediated FPR1 signaling. FHL 124 cell FPR1 was atypical in that it resisted agonist-induced internalization. Expression of FPR1 was additionally supported by detection of the intact full-length open reading frame in sequenced cDNA from FHL 124 cells. Thus, FHL-124 cells express functional FPR1, which is consistent with a direct functional role for FPR1 in the lens, as suggested by the phenotype of Fpr1 knock-out mice.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22593944>Polyethylene glycol-Cys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val--[F]fluorobenzoyl-Lys-Lys-tetramethylrhodamine.</a></h2><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (1). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in  and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for the permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (3). Several families of MMPs are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (4-7). MMP expression is highly regulated in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. Elevated levels of MMPs have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (8). The peptide Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val-Arg-NH (GPLGVR) was found to be a MMP2/9 substrate and is cleaved between the Gly (G) and Val (V) residues (9). Chuang et al. (10) linked a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) group to the N-terminus of Cys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val--Lys (CRSGPLGVYKK) and a hydrophobic tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) molecule to the C-terminus Lys (K) residue to form PEG-CRSGPLGVYKK-TMR (PEG-peptide-TMR) for optical imaging of protease activity . Upon MMP cleavage, the lipophilic VYKK-TMR was released and accumulated at the sites (cell surface) of protease activity. The accumulation was most likely attributed to the binding of the lipophilic VYKK-TMR to the cell membrane non-specifically. For positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the other Lys residue in PEG-peptide-TMR was labeled with 4-[F]fluorobenzoate to form PEG-peptide-[F]-TMR. PEG-peptide-[F]-TMR accumulated in HT1080 tumors (with high MMP2 expression) but not in MCF-7 tumors (with low MMP2 expression), as determined with optical imaging in nude mice.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2413110>Fine specificity of antigen recognition by T cell hybridoma clones specific for poly-18: a synthetic polypeptide antigen of defined sequence and conformation.</a></h2><p>Antigen-specific T cell blasts to poly-18, a polypeptide antigen of defined sequence and conformation, were generated from lymph nodes of antigen-primed BALB/cCr mice. These blasts were fused with the BW5147 thymoma to obtain anti-poly-18-reactive T cell hybridomas. All of the hybridomas were IAd-restricted and secreted IL2 in the presence of IAd/poly-18. On the basis of fine specificity analysis, these hybridomas were classified into two groups. Group A hybridomas recognized a minimal peptide sequence of Glu--(Glu--Ala)3-Glu-, whereas Group B needed the sequence Glu--Ala-(Glu--Ala)3-Glu-/Ala for activation. Three critical residues were identified in Group A hybridomas: the alanine residue at position 9, the carboxy terminal lysine, and the lysine at position 3. In Group B hybridomas, the alanine at position 3 was found to be the critical residue.

Similarly, microparticles releasing MIP-3alpha were able to attract mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Strikingly, prolonged attraction of DCs from distances up to 500 microm from the source to the point of contact with individual microspheres was observed.

Recently, we reported that a heptapeptide (Lys-Trp--Asp-Gly-Asp, KP6) coupled through the ε-amino group of N-terminus Lys to fluorescein isothiocyanate, (FITC)KP6, bound to ox-LDL but not to LDL. In the present study, we investigated whether (FITC)KP6 could be used as a fluorescent probe for the specific detection of MM-LDL and ox-LDL. Results from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and surface plasmon resonance proved that (FITC)KP6 could efficiently bind to MM-LDL as well as ox-LDL in a dose-dependent manner and with high affinity (K D = 3.16 and 3.54 ng/mL protein for MM-LDL and ox-LDL, respectively).
