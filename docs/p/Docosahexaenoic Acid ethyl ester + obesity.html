<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26780261>Mechanisms increasing n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids in the heart.</a></h2><p>Due to ambiguous findings on cardiovascular benefits of systemic omega-3 fatty  therapy, endogenous mechanisms contributing to local organ-specific concentrations of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) were examined. Using gas chromatography, 43 fatty acids were analyzed in atrial and ventricular myocardium and in pericardial fluid of male Wistar rats. To examine the endogenous fatty  metabolism, precursors were administered into the pericardial sac. Pro- and anti-inflammatory actions were induced by talc or fenofibrate, respectively. Physical exercise and a sedentary obese state were used for increased beta-oxidation. DHA (22:6n-3) was increased in ventricular when compared with atrial myocardium (9.0 ± 2.1% vs. 4.7 ± 1.0%, p < 0.001). Intrapericardial EPA (20:5n-3) application lead to an increase of the succeeding tetracosapentaenoic  (24:5n-3) in atrial myocardium, which is a key precursor of DHA. In contrast, proinflammatory stimulation of the n-6 HUFA pathway did not influence the n-3 metabolism. Exercise- and -induced increased beta-oxidation, the finalizing step of DHA synthesis, was associated with increased ventricular DHA concentrations (6.7 ± 1.0% vs. 8.4 ± 1.2%, p < 0.01). It is concluded that the endogenous metabolism contributes markedly to myocardial HUFA concentrations. The findings are supposed to influence the efficacy of oral HUFA treatment and provide a rationale for divergent findings of previous trials on omega-3 therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606094>Effect of ω-3 fatty   esters on apolipoprotein B-48 kinetics in obese subjects on a weight-loss diet: a new tracer kinetic study in the postprandial state.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated chylomicron metabolism may account for hypertriglyceridemia and increased risk of cardiovascular disease in obese subjects. Supplementation with ω-3 fatty    (FAEE) decreases plasma triglyceride. However, its effect on postprandial chylomicron metabolism in obese subjects on a weight-loss diet has not yet been investigated.We aimed to examine the effect of ω-3 FAEE supplementation on apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 kinetics in obese subjects on a weight-loss diet.We carried out a 12-week, randomized trial of a hypocaloric diet plus 4 g/d ω-3 FAEE supplementation (46% eicosapentaenoic  and 38%  ) (n = 13) compared with a hypocaloric diet alone (n = 12) on postprandial apoB-48 kinetics in obese subjects after ingestion of an oral load. The apoB-48 kinetics were determined using stable isotope tracer kinetics and multicompartmental modeling.We evaluated plasma total and incremental apoB-48 0- to 10-hour area under the curves (AUCs) as well as apoB-48 secretion and fractional catabolic rate.Weight loss with or without ω-3 FAEE supplementation significantly reduced body weight, total fat mass, homeostasis model assessment score, fasting triglyceride concentration, postprandial triglyceride AUC, and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (P < .05 in all). Compared with weight loss alone, weight loss plus ω-3 FAEE significantly (all P < .05) decreased fasting triglyceride (-11%), apoB-48 (-36%) concentrations, postprandial triglyceride (-21%), and apoB-48 (-22%) total AUCs, as well as incremental postprandial triglyceride AUCs (-32%). The ω-3 FAEE also significantly decreased apoB-48 secretion in the basal state, without a significant effect during the postprandial period (3-6 hours). The fractional catabolic rate of apoB-48 increased with both interventions with no significant independent effect of ω-3 FAEE supplementation.Addition of ω-3 FAEE supplementation to a moderate weight-loss diet in obese subjects can significantly improve chylomicron metabolism by independently decreasing the secretion of apoB-48.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24299019>Atorvastatin plus omega-3 fatty    decreases very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride production in insulin resistant obese men.</a></h2><p>To test the effect of atorvastatin (ATV) and ATV plus ω-3 FAEEs on VLDL-TG metabolism in obese, insulin resistant men.We carried out a 6-week randomized, placebo-controlled study to examine the effect of ATV (40 mg/day) and ATV plus ω-3 FAEEs (4 g/day) on VLDL-TG metabolism in 36 insulin resistant obese men. VLDL-TG kinetics were determined using d5 -glycerol, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compartmental modelling.Compared with the placebo, ATV significantly decreased VLDL-TG concentration (-40%, p < 0.001) by increasing VLDL-TG fractional catabolic rate (FCR) (+47%, p < 0.01). ATV plus ω-3 FAEEs lowered VLDL-TG concentration to a greater degree compared with placebo (-46%, p < 0.001) or ATV monotherapy (-13%, p = 0.04). This was achieved by a reduction in VLDL-TG production rate (PR) compared with placebo (-32%, p = 0.008) or ATV (-20%, p = 0.03) as well as a reciprocal increase in VLDL-TG FCR (+42%, p < 0.05) compared with placebo.In insulin resistant, dyslipidaemic, obese men, ATV improves VLDL-TG metabolism by increasing VLDL-TG FCR. The addition of 4 g/day ω-3 FAEE to statin therapy provides further TG-lowering by lowering VLDL-TG PR.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26453247>Effects of switching from omega-3-  esters to icosapent  in a statin-treated patient with elevated triglycerides.</a></h2><p>In patients with dyslipidemia, elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, or TG-rich lipoproteins, and cardiovascular risk may remain despite statin therapy. Prescription omega-3 fatty  formulations containing the  esters of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) plus   (DHA) (omega-3-  esters; Lovaza®) or high-purity EPA   (icosapent ; Vascepa®) are TG-lowering treatments that may be administered in addition to statins. Here we describe the effects of switching from omega-3-  esters to icosapent  in a 44-year-old obese man with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient was receiving stable treatment with medications, including atorvastatin 40 mg/day and extended-release niacin 1000 mg/day. Owing to persistently elevated TG levels and other cardiovascular risk factors, the patient was initiated on omega-3-  esters 4 g/day. After approximately 2 years on omega-3-  esters, his total cholesterol (TC) level was 184 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 81 mg/dL, TG level was elevated at 307 mg/dL despite statin therapy, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) level was 144 mg/dL. After the switch to icosapent , TC level decreased by 34% to 121 mg/dL, LDL-C level decreased by 28% to 58 mg/dL, TG level decreased by 41% to 180 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C level decreased by 44% to 81 mg/dL. Switching from omega-3-  esters containing both EPA and DHA to icosapent  containing high-purity EPA resulted in beneficial and substantial changes in the lipid profile with a notable reduction of TG levels along with additional reductions in LDL-C levels in a statin-treated obese patient with persistently high TG levels. Treatment with icosapent  was well tolerated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24285691>Wax esters from the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus reduce diet-induced  and -related metabolic disorders in mice.</a></h2><p>We showed previously that dietary supplementation with oil from the marine zooplankton Calanus finmarchicus (Calanus oil) attenuates , inflammation, and glucose intolerance in mice. More than 80% of Calanus oil consists of wax esters, i.e., long-chain fatty alcohols linked to long-chain fatty acids. In the present study, we compared the metabolic effects of Calanus oil-derived wax esters (WE) with those of purified eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) +   (DHA)  esters (E/D) in a mouse model of diet-induced . C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet (HFD; 45% energy from fat). After 7 wk, the diet was supplemented with either 1% (wt:wt) WE or 0.2% (wt:wt) E/D. The amount of EPA + DHA in the E/D diet was matched to the total amount of n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the WE diet. A third group was given an unsupplemented HFD throughout the entire 27-wk feeding period. WE reduced body weight gain, abdominal fat, and liver triacylglycerol by 21%, 34%, and 52%, respectively, and significantly improved glucose tolerance and aerobic capacity. In abdominal fat depots, WE reduced macrophage infiltration by 74% and downregulated expression of proinflammatory genes (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), whereas adiponectin expression was significantly upregulated. By comparison, E/D primarily suppressed the expression of proinflammatory genes but had less influence on glucose tolerance than WE. E/D affected  parameters, aerobic capacity, or adiponectin expression by <10%. These results show that the wax  component of Calanus oil can account for the biologic effects shown previously for the crude oil. However, these effects cannot exclusively be ascribed to the content of n-3 PUFAs in the wax  fraction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19148125>Prevention and reversal of  and glucose intolerance in mice by DHA derivatives.</a></h2><p>The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and   (DHA), exert hypolipidemic effects and prevent development of  and insulin resistance in animals fed high-fat diets. We sought to determine the efficacy of alpha-substituted DHA derivatives as lipid-lowering, antiobesity, and antidiabetic agents. C57BL/6 mice were given a corn oil-based high-fat (35% weight/weight) diet (cHF), or cHF with 1.5% of lipids replaced with alpha-methyl DHA   (Substance 1), alpha- DHA   (Substance 2), alpha,alpha-di-methyl DHA   (Substance 3), or alpha-thioethyl DHA   (Substance 4) for 4 months. Plasma markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, glucose tolerance, morphology, tissue lipid content, and gene regulation were characterized. The cHF induced , hyperlipidemia, impairment of glucose homeostasis, and adipose tissue inflammation. Except for Substance 3, all other substances prevented weight gain and Substance 2 exerted the strongest effect (63% of cHF-controls). Glucose intolerance was significantly prevented (~67% of cHF) by both Substance 1 and Substance 2. Moreover, Substance 2 lowered fasting glycemia, plasma insulin, triacylglycerols, and nonesterified fatty acids (73, 9, 47, and 81% of cHF-controls, respectively). Substance 2 reduced accumulation of lipids in liver and skeletal muscle, as well as adipose tissue inflammation associated with . Substance 2 also induced weight loss in dietary obese mice. In contrast to DHA administered either alone or as a component of the EPA/DHA concentrate (replacing 15% of dietary lipids), Substance 2 also reversed established glucose intolerance in obese mice. Thus, Substance 2 represents a novel compound with a promising potential in the treatment of  and associated metabolic disturbances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25089906>Addition of omega-3 carboxylic acids to statin therapy in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia has grown alongside that of . Statin therapy has been widely recommended for the treatment of dyslipidemias. Omega-3 (OM3) fatty  concentrates are commonly prescribed concurrently with statins in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia for additional lowering of triglyceride and non-HDL cholesterol. The bioavailability of currently available OM3   drugs is limited by their need for hydrolysis by pancreatic lipases, largely stimulated by dietary fat, prior to intestinal absorption. This review will discuss the chemistry, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of a novel OM3 carboxylic  drug that provides polyunsaturated  and eicosapentaenoic acids in the free fatty  form, which is readily absorbed by the intestine. This drug was approved in May 2014 as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adults with severe (≥500 mg/dl) hypertriglyceridemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24378016>Treatment with omega-3 fatty  - alters fatty  composition of lipoproteins in overweight or obese adults with insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>The effects of dietary fatty  supplementation on lipoprotein fatty  composition have rarely been described.Sixty-one overweight and obese adults with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance were randomized to placebo, 2g/day extended-release nicotinic  (ERN), 4g/day prescription omega-3 fatty    (P-OM3), or combination therapy for 16 weeks. Lipoprotein fatty  composition was analyzed by gas chromatography pre- and post-treatment.Treatment with P-OM3 or combination, but not ERN, increased proportions of eicosapentaenoic ,  , and docosapentaenoic , and reduced those for arachidonic  in all lipoprotein fractions, with greatest impact in the high-density lipoprotein fraction. P-OM3-induced changes in eicosapentaenoic  within low-density lipoproteins and very low-density lipoproteins were associated with beneficial effects on mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure.P-OM3 supplementation, with or without ERN, was associated with differentially altered lipoprotein fatty  composition and improved blood pressure parameters.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
