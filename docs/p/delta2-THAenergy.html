By changing the synthetic sequence, S-NG significantly increases the electron transport rate of the sensor and the electrocatalytic ability compared to NG, SG and N-SG due to the optimal proportion of doping element content and suitable N- and S-bonding configurations. The origin of the synergistic effect of N and S co-doped graphene is confirmed. Traces of S doping greatly enhance the electrochemical performance. The large volume of S-Ox groups may prevent the analytes approaching the catalytic sites of the sensing materials due to a steric hindrance effect. S-NG, which possesses less S-Ox groups, exhibits better performance than that of N-SG. Pyridinic N plays an important role in enhancing the electrochemical activity and conductivity. The simultaneous determination of aniline (AN), p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and nitrobenzene (NB) as typical toxic pollutants is performed by employing the S-NG nanoarchitecture. The detection limits (S/N = 3) for AN, PPD and NB are 0.023, 0.051, 0.216 μM, respectively. In addition, the S-NG sensors also have excellent anti-interference, stability and reproducibility. The precise control and synthesis of multi-heteroatoms into graphene represent a promising strategy to enhance the electrocatalytic performance in  and environmental fields.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671708>Broadband Near-Infrared Absorber Based on All Metallic Metasurface.</a></h1><p>Perfect broadband absorbers have increasingly been considered as important components for controllable thermal emission,  harvesting, modulators, etc. However, perfect absorbers which can operate over a wide optical regime is still a big challenge to achieve. Here, we propose and numerically investigate a perfect broadband near-infrared absorber based on periodic array of four isosceles trapezoid prism (FITP) unit cell made of titanium (Ti) over a continuous silver film. The structure operates with low quality (Q) factor of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) because of the intrinsic high loss, which is the foundation of the broadband absorption. The high absorption of metal nanostructures mainly comes from the power loss caused by the continuous electron transition excited by the incident light inside the metal, and the resistance loss depends on the enhanced localized electric field caused by the FITP structure. Under normal incidence, the simulated absorption is over 90% in the spectrum ranging from 895 nm to 2269 nm. The absorber is polarization-independent at normal incidence, and has more than 80% high absorption persisting up to the incident angle of ~45° at TM polarization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671907>Research on Data Fusion Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks with Combined Improved LEACH and Compressed Sensing.</a></h1><p>There are a lot of redundant data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). If these redundant data are processed and transmitted, the node  consumption will be too fast and will affect the overall lifetime of the network. Data fusion technology compresses the sampled data to eliminate redundancy, which can effectively reduce the amount of data sent by the node and prolong the lifetime of the network. Due to the dynamic nature of WSNs, traditional data fusion techniques still have many problems. Compressed sensing (CS) theory has introduced new ideas to solve these problems for WSNs. Therefore, in this study we analyze the data fusion scheme and propose an algorithm that combines improved clustered (ICL) algorithm low  adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and CS (ICL-LEACH-CS). First, we consider the factors of residual , distance, and compression ratio and use the improved clustered LEACH algorithm (ICL-LEACH) to elect the cluster head (CH) nodes. Second, the CH uses a Gaussian random observation matrix to perform linear compressed projection (LCP) on the cluster common (CM) node signal and compresses the N-dimensional signal into M-dimensional information. Then, the CH node compresses the data by using a CS algorithm to obtain a measured value and sends the measured value to the sink node. Finally, the sink node reconstructs the signal using a convex optimization method and uses a least squares algorithm to fuse the signal. The signal reconstruction optimization problem is modeled as an equivalent -norm problem. The simulation results show that, compared with other data fusion algorithms, the ICL-LEACH-CS algorithm effectively reduces the node's transmission while balancing the load between the nodes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673043>Directed assembly of magnetic and semiconducting nanoparticles with tunable and synergistic functionality.</a></h1><p>The ability to fabricate new materials using nanomaterials as building blocks, and with meta functionalities, is one of the most intriguing possibilities in the area of materials design and synthesis. Semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are co-dispersed in a liquid crystalline (LC) matrix and directed to form self-similar assemblies by leveraging the host's thermotropic phase transition. These co-assemblies, comprising 6 nm CdSe/ZnS QDs and 5-20 nm FeO MNPs, bridge nano- to micron length scales, and can be modulated in situ by applied magnetic fields <250 mT, resulting in an enhancement of QD photoluminescence (PL). This effect is reversible in co-assemblies with 5 and 10 nm MNPs but demonstrates hysteresis in those with 20 nm MNPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and  dispersive spectroscopy reveal that at the nanoscale, while the QDs are densely packed into the center of the co-assemblies, the MNPs are relatively uniformly dispersed through the cluster volume. Using Lorentz TEM, it is observed that MNPs suspended in LC rotate to align with the applied field, which is attributed to be the cause of the observed PL increase at the micro-scale. This study highlights the critical role of correlating multiscale spectroscopy and microscopy characterization in order to clarify how interactions at the nanoscale manifest in microscale functionality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672361>A new pseudo-partition coefficient based on a weather-adjusted multicomponent model for mushroom uptake of pesticides from soil.</a></h1><p>In this study, a weather-based multicomponent model was developed based on the unique biostructures and metabolic processes of mushrooms to evaluate their uptake of pesticides from soils, and the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the bioaccumulation of pesticides in mushrooms was comprehensively quantified. Additionally, a new pseudo-partition coefficient between mushrooms and soils was introduced to assess the impacts of different physiochemical properties on the pesticide uptake process. The results indicate that, in general, the pseudo-partition coefficient increases as the relative humidity increases for both the air and soil according to Fick's law of gas diffusion and the spatial competition of molecules, respectively. Meanwhile, the effect of temperature on the pesticide bioaccumulation process is more complex. For most pesticides (e.g., atrazine), the pseudo-partition coefficient that was computed from the transpiration component had a maximum value at a specific temperature due to the temperature dependency of the transpiration and biodegradation processes. For some pesticides (e.g., ethoprophos), the pseudo-partition coefficient of the air-deposition component had a maximum value at a certain temperature that was caused by the ratio of the soil-air internal transfer  and degradation activation  of the pesticide. It was also concluded that for relatively low-volatility pesticides, transpiration dominated the bioaccumulation process; this was mainly determined from the pesticide water solubility. For nonbiodegradable pesticides (e.g., lindane), the computed coefficient values were relatively low due to their insolubility in water, which inhibits bioaccumulation in mushrooms and is one of the main reasons for their long-term persistence in soils.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Together with the procurement targets and strategies, the transportation of resources acquired while foraging is strongly influenced by the sex of the foragers. In hunter-gatherer societies, women, despite their smaller body size, usually carry heavier burdens than males. In this study, whether those behavioral differences can be explained by a different economy of load-carriage by sex, irrespective of the body mass of the individuals, is investigated.The  expenditure of a sample of 48 volunteers (21 females, 27 males) during a set of locomotion and burden transport trials was monitored. Two indexes were computed to compare the increment in the cost of locomotion relative to the load carried by sex.The results demonstrate that both males and females, carrying the same relative loads, experience the same increment over the cost of their unloaded locomotion. Therefore, apart from obvious differences in body mass, there is no evidence of a dissimilar economy favoring one sex over the other that would explain the differences in load-carriage activities observed among current foraging populations.These outcomes provide new conclusions about the constraints of the behavioral ecology of burden transport activities, and highlight the necessity to reevaluate, from an evolutionary perspective, the ideas about the sexual division of subsistence labor in hunter-gatherer and agriculturalist populations.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674103>Identification of catalytic sites for oxygen reduction in metal/nitrogen-doped carbons with encapsulated metal nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>The development of metal-N-C materials as efficient non-precious metal (NPM) catalysts for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as alternatives to platinum is of significance for the practical implementation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, the high structural heterogeneity of metal-N-C materials that often consist of metal-N x sites and graphene-encapsulated metal nanoparticle simultaneously, as a result of their high-temperature synthesis method, makes it extremely challenging to identify the predominant active structure of metal-N-C catalysts for ORR. Here, we report a low-temperature NH 4 Cl-treatment strategy to efficiently etch out graphene-encapsulated nanoparticles from metal-N-C catalysts without destruction of co-existed atomically dispersed metal-N x sites. We observe a much enhanced catalytic activity upon selective removal of metallic nanoparticles from metal-N-C materials. Accordingly, we definitely elucidate the spectator role of graphene-encapsulated nanoparticles and the pivotal role of metal-N x sites in the metal-N-C materials for ORR in the acidic medium.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For this purpose, we employ generalized electronic collective variables to carry out biased molecular dynamics simulations in the framework of quantum chemical methods that explore the desired property manifold. We illustrate our method on the example of the "biradicality landscapes", which we explore by introducing the natural orbital occupation numbers (NOONs) as the electronic collective variable driving the dynamics. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on the simulation of p-xylylene and [8]annulene allowing to automatically extract the biradical geometries. In the case of [8]annulene the ASQPM metadynamics leads to the prediction of biradical scaffolds that can be stabilized by a suitable chemical substitution, leading to the design of novel functional molecules exhibiting biradical functionality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675745>On the application of fracture mechanics mixed-mode models of sliding with friction and adhesion.</a></h1><p>As recently suggested in an interesting and stimulating paper by Menga, Carbone & Dini (MCD), applying fracture mechanics  concepts for the case of a sliding adhesive contact, imposing also the shear stress is constant at the interface and equal to a material constant (as it seems in experiments), leads to a increase of contact area which instead is never observed. We add that the MCD theory also predict a size effect and hence a distortion of the JKR curve during sliding which is also not observed in experiments. Finally, a simpler example with the pure mode I contact case, leads in the MCD theory to an unbounded contact area, rather than a perhaps more correct limit of the Maugis-Dugdale solution for the adhesive sphere when Tabor parameter is zero, that is DMT's solution. We discuss that the MCD theory doesn't satisfy equilibrium, and we propose some more correct formulations, although they may be rather academic: recent semi-empirical models, with an appropriate choice of the empirical parameters, seem more promising and robust in modelling actual experiments.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673322>Achieving high performance poly(vinylidene fluoride) dielectric composites  polymerization of polypyrrole nanoparticles on hydroxylated BaTiO particles.</a></h1><p>Polymer dielectric composites have widespread applications in many fields ranging from  storage, microelectronic devices, and sensors to power driven systems,  and attract much attention of researchers. However, it is still challenging to prepare advanced polymer dielectric composites with a high dielectric constant ('), low dielectric loss (tan ) and simultaneously high breakdown strength ( ). In this work, conductive polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles were  synthesized in a reaction system containing the common barium titanate (BaTiO, BT) or hydroxylated BaTiO (BTOH) particles, and then the PPy@BT and PPy@BTOH composite particles were incorporated into poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to prepare the composites. The morphologies and microstructures of the PPy@BT and PPy@BTOH composite particles and the corresponding PVDF composites were comparatively investigated. The results showed that the PPy@BTOH composite particles had a 'mulberry'-like morphology with a rough surface and the self-assembled structure could be maintained in the PVDF composites, which was apparently different from the PVDF/PPy@BT composites, in which most of the PPy nanoparticles dissociatively dispersed in the PVDF matrix. Electrical conductivity measurements showed that at high particle content (≥20 wt%), the PPy@BTOH composite particles endowed the composites with lower electrical conductivity compared with the PPy@BT composite particles. Dielectric property measurements showed that the 'mulberry'-like PPy@BTOH composite particles endowed the PVDF composites with extremely high ', ultralow tan  and high   compared with the PVDF/PPy@BT composites with dissociatively dispersed PPy nanoparticles and BaTiO particles. The polarization and loss mechanisms of the composites were then proposed based on the morphologies and the microstructures of the composites.

Here, we first reveal that the weak Pb-I bond in I-based perovskite is prone to breakage under UV photocatalysis, leading to serious degradation of the SnO/perovskite interface. We introduced a chlorine-rich mixed-halide perovskite interlayer (ClMPI), which possesses an excellent tolerance to photocatalysis owing to the strong Pb-Cl bond, between the SnO and I-based perovskite. The ClMPI-based device achieves an enhanced efficiency of up to 21.01% (certified 20.17%). Most importantly, the resultant devices can maintain >94% of their initial performance after 180 h under outdoor solar irradiation, >80% after 500 h under UV irradiation, and 500 h under continuous full spectrum illumination at their maximum power points.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,5-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of obesity, acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue. Pt (5 µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, -dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance. Given the lack of known side effects of Pt, this study strengthens the candidacy of this natural phenol as an anti-obesity nutraceutical.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674075>Duplication and diversification of trehalase confers evolutionary advantages on lepidopteran insects.</a></h1><p>Gene duplication provides a major source of new genes for evolutionary novelty and ecological adaptation. However, the maintenance of duplicated genes and their relevance to adaptive evolution has long been debated. Insect trehalase (Treh) plays key roles in  metabolism, growth, and stress recovery. Here, we show that the duplication of Treh in Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) is linked with their adaptation to various environmental stresses. Generally, two Treh genes are present in insects: Treh1 and Treh2. We report three distinct forms of Treh in lepidopteran insects, where Treh1 was duplicated into two gene clusters (Treh1a and Treh1b). These gene clusters differ in gene expression patterns, enzymatic properties, and subcellular localizations, suggesting that the enzymes probably underwent sub and/or neo-functionalization in the lepidopteran insects. Interestingly, selective pressure analysis provided significant evidence of positive selection on duplicate Treh1b gene in lepidopteran insect lineages. Most positively selected sites were located in the alpha-helical region, and several sites were close to the trehalose binding and catalytic sites. Subcellular adaptation of duplicate Treh1b driven by positive selection appears to have occurred as a result of selected changes in specific sequences, allowing for rapid reprogramming of duplicated Treh during evolution. Our results suggest that gene duplication of Treh and subsequent functional diversification could increase the survival rate of lepidopteran insects through various regulations of intracellular trehalose levels, facilitating their adaptation to diverse habitats. This study provides evidence regarding the mechanism by which gene family expansion can contribute to species adaptation through gene duplication and subsequent functional diversification.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672362>Arsenic enrichment in groundwater and associated health risk in Bari doab region of Indus basin, Punjab, India.</a></h1><p>Contaminated groundwater is considered as one of the most important pathways of human exposure to the geogenic contaminants. Present study has been conducted in a part of Indus basin to investigate the presence and spatial distribution of arsenic (As) and other trace metals in groundwater. The As concentration varies from bdl-255.6 μg/L and 24.6% of the 73 collected groundwater samples have As above world health organization (WHO) guideline of 10 μg/L. High concentration of As is found along the newer alluvium of Ravi River. As is found with high bicarbonate (HCO) and Iron (Fe) and low nitrate (NO) indicating reductive dissolution of Fe bearing minerals. However, silicate weathering along with high sulphate (SO) and positive oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) indicates mixed redox conditions. Weathering of minerals along with other major hydrogeochemical process are responsible for composition of groundwater. With 31.5% of the samples, sodium bicarbonate (Na-HCO) is the major water facies followed by magnesium bicarbonate (Mg-HCO) in 30% of samples. As, Fe and other trace metals including copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn) were used to calculate the health risk for children and adults in the region. Out of 73 samples, 58% has high Fe, 32.8% has high Zn, and 4.1% has high Cd which are above the prescribed limits of WHO guidelines. Health risk of the population has been assessed using chronic dose index (CDI), hazardous quotients (HQ) and hazardous index (HI) for children and adults. The mean CDI values follows the order as Fe > Zn > Cu > As > Cr > Cd, while the HQ values indicates high As hazards for both children and adults. 43.8% of the groundwater samples have high HI for adults, however, 49.3% has high HI for children indicating higher risk for children compared to adults. A large-scale testing should be prioritized to test the wells for As and other trace metals in the study region to reduce health risks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the strain WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and the root dry weight in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 μM KHPO) when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12% NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and  sources. It produces catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl, formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC deaminase. Meanwhile,  WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble phosphates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674277>Reversible photochromic photocatalyst BiO/TiO/AlO with enhanced visible photoactivity: application toward UDMH degradation in wastewater.</a></h1><p>1,1-Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and its by-products were considered carcinogenic toxins and represent a serious health hazard to the population once present in water under natural conditions without treatment. The conventional degradation method suffers from incomplete removal of intermediate products (especially -nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)), the powdery catalysis being difficult to recover and results in high  consumption. In this study, a series of BiO/TiO/AlO (BTA) photocatalysts have been successfully synthesized by a simple dry mixing method with powder material followed by their immobilization. It was evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of UDMH present in wastewater, which can be recovered by rapid filtration and utilizes only solar . The catalyst exhibited markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of UDMH wastewater compared with conventional TiO/AlO (TA) catalysts under UV, visible and solar irradiation. Besides, the intermediate NDMA was gradually completely degraded. The photocatalysts were extensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy,  dispersive spectrometry, specific surface area (BET), X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photo-electrochemical - curves evaluation. The results revealed that all the BTA composites exhibited high stability and stronger absorbance in visible light. In addition, the BTA exhibited a reversible photochromic property that can effectively expand the range of light absorption and enhance the photocatalytic activity. The reversible photochromic properties of BTA explained in the proposed mechanism model are expected to be useful for detecting and sensing UDMH or other organic contaminants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675183>2D-layered Ni-MgO-Al2O3 nano-sheets for integrated capture and methanation of CO2.</a></h1><p>CO2 capture is an enabling technology for carbon conversion and storage, however high cost of the process hindered its large-scale application.

Resulting thickness of the sediment layer and sound speed are consistent with the geoacoustic models obtained earlier by other means.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675024>Revised values for the X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals.</a></h1><p>We present revised reference values for cell volumes and lattice energies for the widely used X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals by including the effect of thermal expansion. For this purpose, thermally-expanded structures were calculated via the quasi-harmonic approximation utilizing three dispersion-inclusive density-functional approximations. Experimental unit-cell volumes were back-corrected for thermal and zero-point  effects, allowing now a direct comparison with lattice relaxations based on electronic energies. For the derivation of reference lattice energies, we utilized harmonic vibrational contributions averaged over four density-functional approximations. In addition, the new reference values also take the change in electronic and vibrational  due to thermal expansion into account. This is accomplished by either utilizing experimentally determined cell volumes and heat capacities, or by relying on the quasi-harmonic approximation. The new X23b reference values obtained this way will enable a more accurate benchmark for the performance of computational methods for molecular crystals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672993>Plasticity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis respiratory chain and its impact on tuberculosis drug development.</a></h1><p>The viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on  generated by its respiratory chain. Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type-2 NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces lesion-associated inflammation, but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty acids. The Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2. These results demonstrate the intrinsic plasticity of Mtb's respiratory chain, and highlight the challenges associated with targeting the pathogen's respiratory enzymes for tuberculosis drug development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675568>New insights on cytostatic drug risk assessment in aquatic environments based on measured concentrations in surface waters.</a></h1><p>Cytostatic drugs are compounds used to treat cancer, one of the deadliest diseases worldwide with a rising yearly incidence. However, the occurrence and concentrations of a large number of cytostatics in waters and wastewaters are unknown. Thus, this study sought to analyze the concentrations of these compounds in different aquatic environments worldwide to assess the risk that these compounds pose to aquatic organisms. The top five most monitored cytostatics in aquatic environments are fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. Risk quotients (RQs) based on maximum reported measured concentrations revealed that mycophenolic acid and tamoxifen pose a high risk to aquatic organisms (RQ ≥ 1) at concentrations observed in surface waters. Moreover, methotrexate and tegafur were categorized as moderate risk compounds, and bicalutamide was found to pose a low risk. Importantly, the available analytical methodologies for the quantification of some cytostatics (e.g., cisplatin, fluorouracil, daunorubicin, imatinib, and mycophenolic acid) in water could not rule out potential risk to aquatic biota, since estimated risks for these compounds using the lowest method detection limits reported in the literature (RQ MDL) were all ≥0.01 (i.e., low risk or higher). Moreover, risks based on predicted concentrations (RQ PEC) were consistently lower than those based on measured concentrations, highlighting the importance of risk assessment based on measured values. Thus, accurate and sensitive analytical methods are crucial to identify and quantify cytostatic exposure in aquatic ecosystems in order to preserve biodiversity and ensure a safer environment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The liquid-liquid transition and the dynamical crossover from the fragile (super-Arrhenius) to strong (Arrhenius) glass forming behavior have been studied, by taking into account the system polymorphism in both the liquid and amorphous solid phases. The interest is focused in the low  region of the DOS ( E < 10 meV) and the data are discussed in terms of the  landscape (local minima of the potential ) approach. In this latest research, we consider a unit scale  (EC) linked to the water local order governed by the hydrogen bonding (HB). All the measured spectra, scaled according to such , evidence a universal power law behavior with different exponents ( γ ) in the strong and fragile glass forming regions, respectively.

An electronic database search was performed to identify studies relevant to the research question. Assessment of the quality of evidence in all relevant studies was performed with the help of the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine guide.

The stepwise amide bond formation mechanism involves two transition states, namely, TS1, in initial stage and TS2, in final stage of reaction pathway. The potential  surfaces obtained from IRC calculations on transition state geometries are subjected to reaction force and reaction work calculations. The estimated reaction works of structural and electronic activities in the progress of reaction reflect the unfavorable formation of diol intermediate and preferential formation of formamide. While 91% of the activation  comes from structural changes in preparative region of TS1 path, the structural and electronic rearrangements respectively, share 57.6% and 42.4% of total activation  of TS2 pathway. The atomic resolution of IRC pathways and natural charge analysis reveal the importance of hydrogen atom of catalyst in TS1 path and the oxygen of water molecule in TS2 path in the progress of reaction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In order to circumvent the limitations and bridge the gap in the literature, this paper combines cointegration and linear and nonlinear Granger causality in multivariate settings to investigate the long-run equilibrium, short-run impact, and dynamic causality relationships among economic growth, CO emissions, and fossil fuel consumption in China from 1965-2016. Using the combination of the newly developed econometric techniques, we obtain many novel empirical findings that are useful for policy makers. For example, cointegration and causality analysis imply that increasing CO emissions not only leads to immediate economic growth, but also future economic growth, both linearly and nonlinearly. In addition, the findings from cointegration and causality analysis in multivariate settings do not support the argument that reducing CO emissions and/or fossil fuel consumption does not lead to a slowdown in economic growth in China. The novel empirical findings are useful for policy makers in relation to fossil fuel consumption, CO emissions, and economic growth. Using the novel findings, governments can make better decisions regarding  conservation and emission reductions policies without undermining the pace of economic growth in the long run.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671874>Theoretical Study of the Effect of Different π Bridges Including an Azomethine Group in Triphenylamine-Based Dye for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells.</a></h1><p>Ten molecules were theoretically calculated and studied through density functional theory with the M06 density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The molecular systems have potential applications as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. Three molecules were taken from the literature, and seven are proposals inspired in the above, including the azomethine group in the π-bridge expecting a better charge transfer. These molecular structures are composed of triphenylamine (donor part); different combinations of azomethine, thiophene, and benzene derivatives (π-bridge); and cyanoacrylic acid (acceptor part). This study focused on the effect that the azomethine group caused on the π-bridge. Ground-state geometry optimization, the highest occupied molecular orbital, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and their  levels were obtained and analyzed. Absorption wavelengths, oscillator strengths, and electron transitions were obtained via time-dependent density functional theory using the M06-2X density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The free  of electron injection (ΔG) was calculated and analyzed. As an important part of this study, chemical reactivity parameters are discussed, such as chemical hardness, electrodonating power, electroaccepting power, and electrophilicity index. In conclusion, the inclusion of azomethine in the π-bridge improved the charge transfer and the electronic properties of triphenylamine-based dyes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673044>Stimulation of indigenous microbes by optimizing the water cut in low permeability reservoirs for green and enhanced oil recovery.</a></h1><p>Low permeability oil reservoirs are a widespread petroleum reservoir type all over the world. Therefore, methods to recover these reservoirs efficiently are of importance to guarantee  supply. Here we report our novel stimulation of indigenous microbes by optimizing the water cut in low permeability reservoirs for green and enhanced oil recovery. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of indigenous bacterial communities with changes in water cut in reservoirs by high-throughput sequencing technology, and reveal the mechanism and characteristics of the crude oil biotreatment under different crude oil-water ratio conditions and the optimum activation time of indigenous functional microbial groups in reservoirs. The indigenous microbial metabolism products were characterized by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results showed that Acinetobacter (47.1%) and Pseudomones (19.8%) were the main functional genus of crude oil degradation at the optimal activation time, and can reduce the viscosity of crude oil from 8.33 to 5.75 mPa·s. The dominant bacteria genus for oil recovery after activation of the production fluids was similar to those in the reservoirs with water cut of 60-80%. Furthermore seven mechanism pathways of enhancing oil recovery by the synergistic of functional microbial groups and their metabolites under different water cut conditions in low permeability reservoirs have been established.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675033>Mechanism of highly enhanced hydrogen storage by two-dimensional 1T' MoS.</a></h1><p>Hydrogen  is a high-efficiency and clean , but the problem of storage still prevents its extensive use. Large-surface-area, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have an advantage in hydrogen storage applications. Monolayer MoS2 is a typical 2D material that has been widely studied recently. And the 1T' phase of MoS2 is a focus especially for studies concerning hydrogen. Here, first-principles calculations are carried out to investigate the adsorption behaviors of hydrogen molecules on 1T' MoS2. Comparing with other MoS2-based materials, such as doped or decorated 2H-MoS2, 1T' MoS2 has even better performance in hydrogen adsorption, and its preparation is easier. In multiple hydrogen molecule adsorption, the material shows good stability and appropriate adsorption  while adsorbing hydrogen molecules.

Herein we report a sodium rich disordered birnessite (NaMnO) for aqueous sodium-ion electrochemical storage with a much-enhanced capacity and cycling life (83 mAh g after 5000 cycles in full-cell). Neutron total scattering and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements show that both structural water and the Na-rich disordered structure contribute to the improved electrochemical performance of current cathode material. Particularly, the co-deintercalation of the hydrated water and sodium-ion during the high potential charging process results in the shrinkage of interlayer distance and thus stabilizes the layered structure.

Lithium metal is a promising candidate as the anode material due to its high theoretical specific capacity, negative electrochemical potential and favorable density. However, during cycling, low and uneven lithium ion concentration on the surface of anode usually results in uncontrolled dendrite growth, especially at high current densities. Here we tackle this issue by using lithiophilic montmorillonite as an additive in the ether-based electrolyte to regulate the lithium ion concentration on the anode surface and thus facilitate the uniform lithium deposition. The lithiophilic montmorillonite demonstrates a pumping feature that improves the self-concentrating kinetics of the lithium ion and thus accelerates the lithium ion transfer at the deposition/electrolyte interface. The signal intensity of TFSI shows negligible changes via in situ Raman tracking of the ion flux at the electrochemical interface, indicating homogeneous ion distribution, which can lead to a stable and uniform lithium deposition on the anode surface. Our study indicates that the interfacial engineering induced by the lithiophilic montmorillonite could be a promising strategy to optimize the lithium deposition for next-generation lithium metal batteries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673495>A toxicity profile of the Pheroid® technology in rodents.</a></h1><p>The Pheroid® drug delivery system is now on the threshold of progressing into human clinical trials for various patented pharmaceutical applications and a systematic investigation of its toxicological properties  and  is thus a priority. Colloidal dispersions (nano- and microemulsions) demonstrate the ability to be adapted to accommodate either lipophilic, hydrophilic or amphiphilic drug molecules. The colloidal dispersions investigated during this evaluation has a general size of 200 nm - 2 μm, a zeta-potential of -25 mV and the main ingredient was ethyl esters of essential fatty acids. The Ames mutagenicity assay was performed on selected  strains TA98, TA100 and TA102. The Ames assay included S9 metabolic activation and no mutagenicity was present during the assay. The effect of acute and subchronic administration on a biological system was investigated in two species of rodent (BALB/c mice and Sprague-Dawley rats). Observations focused on the physical condition, blood biochemical analysis and the haematological profiles. Gross necropsy was performed on all the test animals. Organ weights followed by histopathology of selected organ tissues were recorded. During the acute evaluation animals showed tolerance of the maximum prescribed dose of 2000 mg/kg (according to OECD guidelines) in two rodent species after intravenous administration (absolute bioavaibility). The oral formulation was tolerated without incidents in both acute and subchronic studies. Although valuable baseline safety data was obtained regarding the Pheroid® system, future studies with the entrapped active pharmaceutical ingredients is necessary to provide a definitive safety profile.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671719>Remote Sensing Greenness and Urbanization in Ecohydrological Model Analysis: Asia and Australasia (1982-2015).</a></h1><p>Linking remote sensing information and ecohydrological models to improve understanding of terrestrial biosphere responses to climate and land use change has become the subject of increased interest due to the impacts of current global changes and the effect on the sustainability of human lifestyles.

In the present study, we show that tau can accumulate spontaneously in aged transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Tau pathology is abundant around Aβ deposits, and further characterized by accumulation of Gallyas and thioflavin-S-positive inclusions, which were detected in the APP/PS1 brain at 18 months of age. Age-dependent increases in argyrophilia correlated positively with binding levels of the paired helical filament (PHF) tracer [F]Flortaucipir, in all brain areas examined. Sarkosyl-insoluble PHFs were visualized by electron microscopy. Quantitative proteomics identified sequences of hyperphosphorylated and three-repeat tau in transgenic mice, along with signs of RNA missplicing, ribosomal dysregulation and disturbed  metabolism. Tissue from the frontal gyrus of human subjects was used to validate these findings, revealing primarily quantitative differences between the tau pathology observed in AD patient vs. transgenic mouse tissue. As physiological levels of endogenous, 'wild-type' tau aggregate secondarily to Aβ in APP/PS1 mice, this study suggests that amyloidosis is both necessary and sufficient to drive tauopathy in experimental models of familial AD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674098>Conjugated Copper-Catecholate Framework Electrodes for Efficient  Storage.</a></h1><p>Herein, a new conjugated copper(II)-catecholate based metal-organic framework (namely Cu-DBC) was prepared using a D2 symmetric redox-active ligand in a copper-bis(dihydroxy) coordination geometry.

Xanthophyll cycle-related NPQ depends principally on xanthophyll cycle pigments composition and their effective involvement in non-photochemical quenching. Xanthophyll cycle-related NPQ is tightly controlled by environmental conditions in a species/strain specific manner. These features are especially relevant in microalgae living in a complex and highly variable environment. The goal of this study was to perform a comparative assessment of non-photochemical quenching ecophysiologies across microalgal taxa in order to underline specific involvement of non-photochemical quenching in growth adaptations and strategies. We used both published results and data acquired in our laboratory to understand the relationships between growth conditions (irradiance, temperature and nutrient availability), xanthophyll cycle composition and xanthophyll cycle pigments quenching efficiency in microalgae from various taxa. We found that in diadinoxanthin-containing species, the xanthophyll cycle pigment pool is controlled by  pressure in all species. At any given  pressure, however, the diatoxanthin content is higher in diatoms than in other diadinoxanthin-containing species. XC pigments quenching efficiency is species-specific and decreases with acclimation to higher irradiances. We found a clear link between the natural light environment of species/ecotypes and quenching efficiency amplitude. The presence of diatoxanthin or zeaxanthin at steady state in all species examined at moderate and high irradiances suggests that cells maintain a light-harvesting capacity in excess to cope with potential decrease in light intensity.© 2019 Phycological Society of America.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672991>Practical and stereoselective electrocatalytic 1,2-diamination of alkenes.</a></h1><p>The 1,2-diamine motif is widely present in natural products, pharmaceutical compounds, and catalysts used in asymmetric synthesis.

The faces of the hydrate cages are most often pentagonal because the square and hexagonal faces produce appreciable strains on the hydrogen bonds. However, taking into account the specific arrangement of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the hydrogen bonds complicates the picture. The pentagonal rings are inferior to square and hexagonal rings in the number of stronger types of bonds corresponding to energetically more favorable mutual orientations of H-bonded molecules. The proton configurations with a large number of energetically preferable bonds can be computed during combinatorial optimization on the base of simplified topological models. A more accurate topological model for polyhedral water clusters allows us to find a class of proton configurations that are optimal in the number of energetically favorable H-bonds, taking into account the interaction between the second and third neighbors in the network. These topological models give preference to water polyhedra and clathrate hydrate structures without pentagonal faces. We show that the geometric stability factor (tetrahedrality) is decisive for proton-disordered systems. At that time, the topological factor (maximum number of preferred H-bond types) is often dominant when searching for the lowest- proton configurations. The  minimization is carried out using different molecular interaction potentials and the Tinker molecular modeling package.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673325>A cruciform phthalocyanine pentad-based NIR-II photothermal agent for highly efficient tumor ablation.</a></h1><p>Photothermal therapy in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) exhibits a significant advantage over the first near-infrared window (NIR-I, 650-950 nm) in terms of both maximum permissible exposure (MPE) and penetration depth.

The calculated in-plane piezoelectric coefficients of Janus monolayers (d11 = 3.09-5.67 pm/V) are demonstrably enhanced with respect to the pristine monolayers (d11 = 0.41-3.04 pm/V). Meanwhile, the yielding additional out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients range from 0.11 to 0.34 pm/V. Interestingly, O-participated Janus monolayers display distinctive properties: dipole direction flipping from O to S/Se, high stabilities and moderate direct-band-gaps. Particularly, Ga2OSe monolayer was found to have the largest piezoelectric coefficient of 5.67 pm/V, which can be ascribed to the highly imbalanced charge distribution on O and Se as well as the largest bond length differences between Ga-O and Ga-Se. Our study revealed that the Janus Ga2XY monolayers, especially O-related systems, could be pretty promising as candidates in optoelectronic, piezoelectric sensors and  conversion devices.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675519>Ensiling characteristics, physicochemical structure and enzymatic hydrolysis of steam-exploded hippophae: Effects of calcium oxide, cellulase and Tween.</a></h1><p>To find a comprehensive way to enhance the utilizability of steam-exploded hippophae, calcium oxide (CaO) preimpregnation, cellulase-added storage and saccharification with addition of Tween 20 were investigated in this study. Both CaO preimpregnation and cellulase addition promoted the ensiling fermentation of anaerobically stored steam-exploded hippophae indicated by lower cellulose proportion and higher organic acids content, but led to the decrease of saccharification yield by 11.83% and 46.77-51.22%, respectively. When taking into account of organic acids being utilizable  source, storing with addition of cellulase enhanced the utilizability of the materials in whole. Moreover, the addition of Tween 20 enhanced saccharification yield of the steam-exploded hippophae by 26.69-45.25%. Additionally, FTIR and XRD spectra clearly illustrated the structural alteration during storage. It is concluded that storing with addition of cellulase and hydrolyzing with addition of Tween 20 can enhance the utilizability of steam-exploded hippophae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The Zn-MOF is a 3D framework with six-nuclear clusters and possesses remarkable water stability and pH stability. Interestingly, complex 1 can sensitively and selectively sense Fe(iii), Cr(iii), Cr(vi), Mn(vii) and the pesticide 2,6-Dich-4-NA with low detection limits in aqueous solution. Moreover, complex 1 also exhibits selectivity for 2,6-Dich-4-NA detection in real samples including carrot, grape and nectarine extracts, and its detection ability is almost unchanged in the presence of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The possible mechanisms of luminescence quenching have been explained by the weak affinity of nitrogen atoms, resonance  transfer, and photoinduced electron transfer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a MOF-based multiresponsive fluorescent probe for the simultaneous detection of Fe(iii), Cr(iii/vi), Mn(vii) and the pesticide 2,6-Dich-4-NA in aqueous solution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673197>Periphytic algae decouple fungal activity from leaf litter decomposition via negative priming.</a></h1><p>1. Well-documented in terrestrial settings, priming effects describe stimulated heterotrophic microbial activity and decomposition of recalcitrant carbon by additions of labile carbon. In aquatic settings, algae produce labile exudates which may elicit priming during organic matter decomposition, yet the directions and mechanisms of aquatic priming effects remain poorly tested. 2. We tested algal-induced priming during decomposition of two leaf species of contrasting recalcitrance,  and , in experimental streams under light or dark conditions. We measured litter-associated algal, bacterial, and fungal biomass and activity, stoichiometry, and litter decomposition rates over 43 days. 3. Light increased algal biomass and production rates and increased bacterial abundance 141-733% and fungal production rates 20-157%. Incubations with a photosynthesis inhibitor established that algal activity directly stimulated fungal production rates in the short-term. 4. Algal-stimulated fungal production rates on both leaf species were not coupled to long-term increases in fungal biomass accrual or litter decomposition rates, which were 154-157% and 164-455% greater in the dark, respectively. The similar patterns on fast- vs. slow-decomposing  and , respectively, indicated that substrate recalcitrance may not mediate priming strength or direction. 5. In this example of negative priming, periphytic algae decoupled fungal activity from decomposition, likely by providing labile carbon invested toward greater fungal growth and reproduction instead of recalcitrant carbon degradation. If common, algal-induced negative priming could stimulate heterotrophy reliant on labile carbon yet suppress decomposition of recalcitrant carbon, modifying  and nutrients available to upper trophic levels and enhancing organic carbon storage or export in well-lit aquatic habitats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673020>3D Porous Graphene Based Aerogel for Electromagnetic Applications.</a></h1><p>Lightweight multifunctional electromagnetic (EM) absorbing materials with outstanding thermal properties, chemical resistance and mechanical stability are crucial for space, aerospace and electronic devices and packaging. Therefore, 3D porous graphene aerogels are attracting ever growing interest. In this paper we present a cost effective lightweight 3D porous graphene-based aerogel for EM wave absorption, constituted by a poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix filled with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and we show that the thermal, electrical, mechanical properties of the aerogel can be tuned through the proper selection of the processing temperature, controlled either at 65 °C or 85 °C. The produced GNP-filled aerogels are characterized by exceptional EM properties, allowing the production of absorbers with 9.2 GHz and 6.4 GHz qualified bandwidths with reflection coefficients below -10 dB and -20 dB, respectively. Moreover, such aerogels show exceptional thermal conductivities without any appreciable volume change after temperature variations. Finally, depending on the process parameters, it is shown the possibility to obtain water repellent aerogel composites, thus preventing their EM and thermal properties from being affected by environmental humidity and allowing the realization of EM absorber with a stable response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671637>Insights into the Interaction Mechanisms of the Proviral Integration Site of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (Pim) Kinases with Pan-Pim Inhibitors PIM447 and AZD1208: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation and MM/GBSA Calculation Study.</a></h1><p>Based on the up-regulation of the proviral integration site of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim) kinase family (Pim1, 2, and 3) observed in several types of leukemias and lymphomas, the development of pan-Pim inhibitors is an attractive therapeutic strategy. While only PIM447 and AZD1208 have entered the clinical stages. To elucidate the interaction mechanisms of three Pim kinases with PIM447 and AZD1208, six Pim/ligand systems were studied by homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free  calculation. The residues of the top group (Leu44, Val52, Ala65, Lys67, and Leu120 in Pim1) dominated the pan-Pim inhibitors binding to Pim kinases. The residues of the bottom group (Gln127, Asp128, and Leu174 in Pim1) were crucial for Pims/PIM447 systems, while the contributions of these residues were decreased sharply for Pims/AZD1208 systems. It is likely that the more potent pan-Pim inhibitors should be bound strongly to the top and bottom groups. The residues of the left, right and loop groups were located in the loop regions of the binding pocket, however, the flexibility of these regions triggered the protein interacting with diverse pan-Pim inhibitors efficiently. We hope this work can provide valuable information for the design of novel pan-Pim inhibitors in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673592>Drag force as a function of cross section and angle of attack.

The traditional circular pinhole is replaced by two orthogonal slits, which lowers the intensity at the spatial filter plane by up to two orders of magnitude, and by using reflective optics we reduce spatial dispersion and eliminate B-integral effects. A ray trace model of the spatial filter shows excellent transmitted wavefront, but also indicates aberrations at the foci from using cylindrical optics at 45°. It is expected that the use of off-axis parabolic mirrors would mitigate this issue but comes at the cost of more complicated, expensive optics and more complex alignment. We created a numerical model based on Fourier optics to explain this effect and guide design requirements to mitigate it. High-quality imaging and filtering capabilities are demonstrated experimentally.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673790>A self-powered photoelectrochemical aptamer probe for oxytetracycline based on the use of a NiO nanocrystal/g-CN heterojunction.</a></h1><p>A self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptamer probe is presented for the determination of oxytetracycline (OTC). The assay is based on the use of g-CN and NiO nanocrystals (NCs) which form a heterojunction. The latter was prepared by two-step hydrothermal pyrolysis by using the ionic liquid 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazole chloride which functions as a morphological template to form NiO NCs. The heterojunction exhibits much better electronic conductivity, wider absorption range, higher electron-hole-separation productivity, and stronger photocurrent compared to plain g-CN. The heterojunction was adopted to construct a self-powered PEC aptamer probe for OTC detection. An OTC-binding aptamer was immobilized on the heterojunction and the probe was constructed. The aptamer on the probe binding with OTC can form steric hindrance for transmitting of electrons and cause the PEC signal change depending on the OTC concentration. The photocurrent decreases with increasing OTC concentration in the 0.01 to 100 nM concentration range and its detection limit is 4 pM (at S/N = 3). Graphical abstract Schematic representation of a self-powered photochemical aptamer probe. The probe performs enhanced ability for oxytetracycline (OTC) determination due to the formation of NiO nanocrystals/g-CN (NiO NCs/g-CN) heterojunction and the specification recognition of the aptamer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672317>Protein intake and amino acid supplementation regulate exercise recovery and performance through the modulation of mTOR, AMPK, FGF21, and immunity.</a></h1><p>Exercise is considered to be the best approach to improve quality of life, and together with a healthy and adequate dietary pattern, exercise represents the best strategy to reduce the risk of chronic metabolic and inflammatory diseases, such as those related to obesity. The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the  status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

CFV of draw solution was optimized, followed by the impact assessment of three CFVs on feed solution (FS) stream and periodic injection of air scouring into the side-stream module. Overall, the OMBR system exhibited high and stable performance with initial water flux of approximately 15 LMH, high removal efficiencies of bulk organic matter and nutrients. While FS's CFVs insignificantly affected the performance and membrane fouling, regular air scouring showed substantial impact with better performance and high efficiency in mitigating membrane fouling. These results indicated that periodic air scouring can be applied into the side-stream membrane module for efficient fouling mitigation without interruption the operation of the OMBR system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

They provide a unique opportunity to control  and charge dynamics via the independent tunability of the  levels within the perovskite and the organic spacer for various optoelectronic applications. In the perovskite layer alone, one can replace the Pb (Sn), the halide (X=I,Br,Cl), the organic component, and the number of layers between the organic spacer layers. In addition, there are many possibilities for organic spacer layers between the perovskite layers, making it difficult for experimental methods to comprehensively explore such extensive combinatorial space. Of particular technological interest is alignment of electronic levels between the perovskite layer and the organic spacer layer, leading to desired transfer of  or charge carriers between perovskite and organic components. For example, as band edge absorption is almost entirely attributed to the perovskite layer, one way to demonstrate  transfer is to observe triplet emission from organic spacers. State-of-the-art computational chemistry tools can be used to predict the properties of many stoichiometries in search for LHOPs that have the most promising electronic structure features. In this first principles study, we survey a group of π-conjugated organic spacer candidates for use in triplet light emitting LHOPs. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT, we calculate the first singlet (S) and triplet (T) excitation  in the ground-state geometry and the first triplet excitation  in the excited triplet state relaxed geometry (T*). By comparing these energies to the known lowest exciton  level of PbX perovskite layers (X=I, Br, Cl), organic spacer and perovskite layer pairings can be identified for possible transfer of Wannier excitons from the inorganic perovskite lattice to spin-triplet Frenkel excitons located on the organic cation. We successfully identify ten organic spacer candidates for possible pairing with perovskite layers of specific halide composition to achieve triplet light emission across the visible  range. Molecular dynamics simulations predict that finite temperatures and perovskite environment have little influence on the excitation energies of the two common organic spacers naphthylethylammonium (NEA) and phenelethylammonium (PEA). We find significant thermal broadening up to 0.5 eV of the optical excitation energies appearing due to finite temperature effects. The findings herein provide insights into alignment of electronic levels of conjugated organic spacer with perovskite layer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673627>A 2-yr, School-Based Resistance Exercise Pilot Program Increases Bone Accrual in Adolescent Girls.</a></h1><p>The current analysis evaluates cumulative benefits after year two (Y2) of a school-based resistance training intervention.Adolescent girls were enrolled and measured at the beginning of 6 grade (baseline, BL) and again at 1 follow-up (FU1: Y1 end) and 2 follow-up (FU2: Y2 end). School gym classes met alternate school days. Site 1 had standard gym classes (CON). Site 2 gym classes included 8-12 minutes of resistance training (INT); INT girls were categorized based on observed participation effort and time (LO, HI). Measurements included: 1) height and weight; 2) questionnaires to assess extracurricular exercise and diet (calcium, vitamin D); 3) dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy). Whole body less head (SUB) scans yielded bone mineral content (BMC) and body composition. Lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck (FN) scans yielded BMC and areal bone mineral density (BMD); radius scans yielded ultradistal and 1/3 BMD. ANCOVA compared group means for percent gains from BL to FU2, accounting for biological maturity, BL height, height change, inter-scan interval, organized activity, calcium and vitamin D.In 62 girls (21 CON, 41 INT), intention to treat analyses detected INT vs. CON advantages for L1-L4 BMC and BMD (4.1%, 5.6%: p<0.05). HI effort participants (n=19) demonstrated advantages for BMC and BMD at L1-L4 and FN (5.7% to 8.2%, p<0.01) vs. CON.Over two school years, this resistance intervention yielded lumbar spine advantages; enthusiastic participation (HI) yielded lumbar spine and femoral neck advantages.

The  (γ) of the terminal surface having only Ba cations, indicated the surface to be the most stable (γ = 6.7 kJ mol-1 Å-2) as compared to the other surfaces. MD simulations elaborated on the cation disorder in the near surface region where Ba cations in the subsurface region were observed to migrate towards the surface. This led to a disruption in cation ordering with a propensity to form multiphases in the near surface region. In the near surface zone, oxygen anion diffusivity was observed to be reduced by an order of magnitude (D = 1.6 × 10-11 cm2 s-1 at 873 K) as compared to the bulk oxygen anion diffusivity value (D = 1.96 × 10-10 cm2 s-1 at 873 K). A novel idea was then proposed to control the degree of surface segregation of Ba cations by applying nanostructuring of the GBCO material in the form of nanoparticles. MD simulations elucidated that the near surface region having a high degree of cation disorder in the nanostructured GBCO may regain back the oxygen anion diffusivity value (D = 3.98 × 10-10 cm2 s-1, at 873 K) comparable to the bulk core region (D = 2.51 × 10-10 cm2 s-1, at 873 K). A proof of concept experiment was setup to test this hypothesis. The electrochemical performance of the electrode, fabricated using GBCO nanoparticles, was measured to improve by 15% as compared to the electrode synthesized with a bulk size GBCO material. This was attributed to the control in Ba-cation segregation, obtained on nanostructuring which resulted in higher oxygen anion transport in the near-surface region of the electrode material. XPS characterization of the surface of the nanostructured GBCO materials supported this assertion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675452>Bone Marrow and Muscle Fat Infiltration are Correlated Among Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis: the AMBERS Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Bone and muscle have shown to interact, but little is known about fat within bone and muscle. Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily  expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

Herein, we report that cycling performance of Zn metal anode can be improved significantly by utilizing monolayer graphene (Gr) as the electrodeposition substrate. Utilizing microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate that electrodeposited Zn on Gr substrate has a compact, uniform and non-dendritic character. The Gr layer due to its high lattice compatibility with Zn provide low nucleation overpotential sites for Zn electrodeposition. Atomistic calculations indicate that Gr has strong affinity to Zn (binding  of 4.41 eV for Gr with four defect sites), leading to uniform distribution of Zinc adatoms all over Gr surface. This synergistic compatibility between Gr and Zn promotes subsequent homogeneous and planar Zn deposits with low interfacial  (0.212 J/m2) conformal with the current collector surface.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671807>Fabrication of Hydrophobic Ni Surface by Chemical Etching.</a></h1><p>Hydrophobic surfaces were successfully fabricated on pure nickel substrates by a one-step chemical etching process with different acidic solutions. The static water contact angle (SCA) of the etched Ni surfaces reached higher than 125°, showing excellent hydrophobicity. The examination of surface chemical compositions implied that there were almost no polar moieties on the surface after chemical etching, except part of the surface was oxidized. After chemical etching, the nickel surfaces became much rough with packed terrace-/crater-/thorn-like clusters. According to the analysis of surface composition and morphology, the hydrophobicity was evidently attributed to the rough microstructures on the etched Ni surface. The best hydrophobicity on Ni surface was produced with the SCAs as high as 140.0° by optimizing the etching time and etchants. The results demonstrate that it is possible to construct hydrophobic surfaces on hydrophilic substrates by tailoring the surface microstructure using a simple chemical etching process without any further hydrophobic modifications by low surface  materials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675309>Wavelet Analysis of the Temporal Dynamics of the Laser Speckle Contrast in Human Skin.</a></h1><p>Spectral analysis of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) signals has been widely used in studies of physiological vascular function regulation. An alternative to LDF is the laser speckle contrast imaging method (LSCI), which is based on the same physical principle. In contrast to LDF, LSCI provides non-scanning full-field imaging of a relatively wide skin area and offers high spatial and temporal resolutions, which allows visualization of microvascular structure. This circumstance, together with a large number of works which had shown the effectiveness of temporal LSCI analysis, gave impetus to experimental studies of the relation between LDF and LSCI used to monitor the temporal dynamics of blood flow.Continuous wavelet transform was applied to construct a time-frequency representation of a signal.Analysis of 10 minute LDF and LSCI output signals recorded simultaneously revealed rather high correlation between oscillating components. It was demonstrated for the first time that the spectral  of oscillations in the 0.01-2 Hz frequency range of temporal LSCI recordings carries the same information as the conventional LDF recordings and hence it reflects the same physiological vascular tone regulation mechanisms.The approach proposed can be used to investigate speckle pattern dynamics by LSCI in both normal and pathological conditions.The results of research on the influence of spatial binning and averaging on the spectral characteristics of perfusion monitored by LSCI are of considerable interest for the development of LSCI systems optimized to evaluate temporal dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671635>Oscillating U-Shaped Body for Underwater Piezoelectric  Harvester Power Optimization.</a></h1><p>Vibration  harvesting (VeH) techniques by means of intentionally designed mechanisms have been used in the last decade for frequency bandwidth improvement under excitation for adequately high-vibration amplitudes. Oil, gas, and water are vital resources that are usually transported by extensive pipe networks. Therefore, wireless self-powered sensors are a sustainable choice to monitor in-pipe system applications. The mechanism, which is intended for water pipes with diameters of 2-5 inches, contains a piezoelectric beam assembled to the oscillating body. A novel U-shaped geometry of an underwater  harvester has been designed and implemented. Then, the results have been compared with the traditional circular cylinder shape. At first, a numerical study has been carried at Reynolds numbers Re = 3000, 6000, 9000, and 12,000 in order to capture as much as kinetic  from the water flow. Consequently, unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)-based simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamic forces under different conditions. In addition, an Adaptive Differential Evolution (JADE) multivariable optimization algorithm has been implemented for the optimal design of the harvester and the maximization of the power extracted from it.

With formulas for dissipation and radiation powers, we demonstrate that a coherent superposition of incident waves extrinsically interferes with the targeted channels in a desirable way.

Higher physical activity and high or adequate protein intake are thought to be beneficial in preventing the loss of skeletal muscle mass in the elderly. We aimed to investigate the relationships between physical activity, protein intake, and FFM in older people with mild disability. Total  expenditure (TEE) under free-living conditions was assessed using the doubly-labelled water (DLW) method, and physical activity was measured using a triaxial accelerometer. Dietary intake was assessed using a self-recorded food intake diary during the DLW period. Percent FFM was significantly positively correlated with protein intake and physical activity level (PAL) after adjustment for age and sex (protein intake r = 0.652,  < 0.001, PAL r = 0.345,  = 0.011). In multiple linear regression analysis, when PAL, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), or protein intake were included, 31%, 32%, and 55%, respectively, of the variation in %FFM was explained. Moreover, the addition of both PAL/MVPA and protein intake explained 61%/60%, respectively, of the variation in %FFM.

Precise information about bauxite mineralogical composition is challenging and crucial for efficient aluminum extraction and for the determination of its appropriateness for different industrial applications. For the qualitative and quantitative analysis of bauxite ore, we performed laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in conjunction with x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), scanning electron microscopy coupled with  dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Analysis of the acquired optical emission spectrum revealed the presence of Si, Al, Fe, K, Ti, Ca, Mg, Na, Cr, and Sr. The plasma temperature and electron number density values estimated using Boltzmann plot and Stark-broadening line profile methods were 5600 K and 7.65×10  cm, respectively. In the present study we show that a calibration-free LIBS method presents a powerful solution, enabling quantitative analysis of multi-element bauxite ore better than traditional analytical techniques. The bauxite quantification obtained using CF-LIBS under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium and optically thin plasma was Si=47.31%, Al=31.90%, Fe=16.54%, K=2.45%, Ti=1.64%, and Ca=0.16%, and its comparison with the outcome from XRD, XRF, SEM-EDS, and FTIR not only assisted but potentially enhanced the mineralogical composition understanding of bauxite ore in the present study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674349>Investigating directional reflection characteristics of anisotropic machined surfaces using a self-designed scatterometer.</a></h1><p>The directional reflection characteristics of anisotropic surfaces play an important role in the precise modeling of radiative heat transfer and target detection. Nevertheless, the directional reflection characteristics of anisotropic machined surfaces have not been fully understood. In this work, an accurate automated scatterometer was built to investigate the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of anisotropic machined surfaces produced by various kinds of machining methods, including plain milling, planer processing, and flat grinding. The effects of the incident angle, machining method, and surface roughness on the bidirectional reflectance properties were studied. The results indicate that the incident azimuthal angle affects the BRDF of a plain-milling surface in a vitally different way compared to planer processing and flat grinding. When the plane of incidence orients parallel to the macroscopic surface strips, the plain-milling surface displays diffuse dominated reflection (reflected  distributed over 90°), whereas the other two show mirror-like properties, only distributed about 4° around the specular direction. Under the same surface roughness, the plain-milling surface shows the weakest reflected intensity, while the flat-grinding surface has the strongest.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674615>Thermally reduced fluorographenes as efficient electrode materials for supercapacitors.</a></h1><p>There is an urgent need for a simple and up-scalable method for the preparation of supercapacitor electrode materials due to increasing global  consumption worldwide. We have discovered that fluorographene exhibits great potential for the development of new kinds of supercapacitors aimed at practical applications. We have shown that time control of isothermal reduction of fluorographite at 450 °C under a hydrogen atmosphere led to the fine-tuning of fluorine content and electronic properties of the resulting fluorographene derivatives. Charge transfer resistances (Rct) of the thermally reduced fluorographenes (TRFGs) were decreased with respect to the pristine fluorographene; however, the Rct vs. time-of-reduction plot showed a v-shaped profile. The specific capacitance vs. time-of-reduction of TRFG followed the v-shaped trend, which could be the result of the decreasing content of sp3 carbons and increasing content of structural defects. An optimized material exhibited values of specific capacitance up to 539 F g-1 recorded at a current density of 0.25 A g-1 and excellent cycling durability with 100% specific capacitance retention after 1500 cycles in a three-electrode configuration and 96.7% of specific capacitance after 30 000 cycles in a two-electrode setup.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675245>Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs) levels in spermatozoa of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men.</a></h1><p>Interest in the role of male factor in infertility continues to mount with defects related to sperm movement considered as one of the more severe forms of subfertility. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) primarily regulates the expression of target genes involved in  control as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. Although the pivotal roles of these receptors on female fertility have been reported, there are limited studies addressing PPARs role(s) in the male. This study was designed to determine and compare  and  mRNA expression in sperm cells of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men. In addition, flow cytometric analyses, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to evaluate PPARγ protein levels in spermatozoa. We have compared the sperm  mRNA relative expression in 27 normozoospermic and 28 asthenozoospermic samples and monitored sperm PPARγ protein levels in 39 normozoospermic and 40 asthenozoospermic samples using flow cytometry. We have also assessed in a sub-group of seven normozoospermic and eight asthenozoospermic samples, PPARγ protein levels by western blotting. Relative expression of PPARγ mRNA in normozoospermic men was found to be significantly higher (P = 0.004) than in asthenozoospermic men while  and  relative expression was similar in the two groups. Likewise,  showed a positive correlation with motility (r = 0.34; P < 0.05), sperm concentration (r = 0.33) and the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa (r = 0.31). In agreement with the mRNA behavior, sperm PPARγ protein levels as measured by flow cytometry (P = 0.066) and western blot (P = 0.089) showed a tendency to be higher in normozoospermic than asthenozoospermic men. The present study proposes a link between PPARγ gene expression level and motility in human sperm.

We hypothesized that low dietary Mg intake may alter sPTH response to s25OHD in a population with excess body weight, thereby leading to a worsening of cardiometabolic health. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study on adults who were either overweight or obese (owt/ob). Dietary Mg intake was measured using a Mg food frequency questionnaire (MgFFQ). Body composition information was measured using Dual  X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Blood samples were obtained for all biochemical analyses. A total of 57 participants, 22 to 65 years of age, with a body mass index between 25 to 45 kg/m were divided into 3 groups, according to dietary Mg intake percentiles (Low Mg Group = <33 percentile, Medium Mg Group = 33 to 66 percentile, High Mg Group = >66 percentile). Higher s25OHD was negatively associated with lower sPTH in the High Mg Intake group (r = -0.472, P = .041), but not in other groups. A positive relationship between s25OHD and serum high-molecular weight adiponectin concentrations was observed in the High Mg Group (r = 0.532, r = 0.022), but not in other groups. Serum Interleukin-6 concentrations were negatively associated with s25OHD (r = -0.316, P = .017) for the entire study group. Based on these results, our study demonstrated that a low dietary Mg intake may alter PTH response to 25OHD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, insulin resistance, obesity and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate metabolism to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical pathways and  metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism during inflammatory conditions. This review summarizes current evidence for the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by iNOS during inflammation, and argues for the role of iNOS as a metabolic enzyme in immune and non-immune cells.Copyright © 2019.

High-quality FBGs are inscribed in different types of small-core single-mode fibers (SMFs) by the use of femtosecond laser point-by-point technology in order to investigate the effect of the fiber core diameter on the grating inscription efficiency and on the short-wavelength loss. A lower laser pulse  is required to achieve the same grating reflectivity in a smaller-core fiber than in a large-core fiber. The short-wavelength loss of the small-core FBG is lower than that of the large-core FBG with the same reflectivity. Furthermore, a series of FBGs with a low short-wavelength loss are inscribed in a small-core SMF along the fiber axis to achieve so-called series-integrated FBGs (SI-FBGs). Finally, the effect of the input light direction on the reflection peak of the SI-FBGs is investigated to reduce the influence of the grating short-wavelength loss in the sensing and communication applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675655>Effect of carbamylation on the molecular recognition action of amino benzothiazole by carrier protein.</a></h1><p>Increasing benzothiazole derivatives containing amino or N-acyl structures in position 2 have been largely developed as pesticides and medicines. However, the structure-function relationship of 2-substituted benzothiazole derivatives has seldom been illustrated from the perspective of their albumin-binding nature. Herein, to probe the influence of carbamylation on the albumin-binding nature of benzothiazole derivatives, formyl group was introduced to the amine group of 2-amino benzothiazole (ABT) to yield a novel modified ABT (MABT). Their protein-binding properties were systematically deciphered by spectroscopy, molecular modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The interaction mechanisms, recognition thermodynamics and binding geometry were investigated and compared. The structural alteration of human serum albumin was explored using synchronous fluorescence emission and circular dichroism spectrum technologies. Based on experimental results, the structures of protein complex with MABT and ABT were revealed by molecular docking method. The differences in  transfer efficiency and molecular orientation of ABT and MABT in new complexes were tentatively explained by DFT calculations. The work was expected to help to understand the impact of different substituents on the bioactivity of benzothiazole derivatives and guide for structural designs of new compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By taking into account that storage is a key factor in the effective use of renewable , the present article is an overview about storage systems which are appropriate for BIPV and BIPVT applications. The literature review shows that there are multiple storage solutions, based on different kinds of materials (batteries, Phase Change Material (PCM) components, etc.). In terms of BIPV and BIPVT with batteries or PCMs or water tanks as storage systems, most of the installations are non-concentrating, façade- or roof-integrated, water- or air-based (in the case of BIPVT) and include silicon-based PV cells, lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries, paraffin- or salt-based PCMs. Regarding parameters that affect the environmental profile of storage systems, in the case of batteries critical factors such as material manufacturing, accidental release of electrolytes, inhalation toxicity, flammable elements, degradation and end-of-life management play a pivotal role. Regarding PCMs, there are some materials that are corrosive and present fire-safety issues as well as high toxicity in terms of human health and ecosystems. Concerning water storage tanks, based on certain studies about tanks with volumes of 300 L and 600 L, their impacts range from 5.9 to 11.7 GJ and from 0.3 to 1.0 t CO. Finally, it should be noted that additional storage options such as Trombe walls, pebble beds and nanotechnologies are critically discussed. The contribution of the present article to the existing literature is associated with the fact that it presents a critical review about storage devices in the case of BIPV and BIPVT applications, by placing emphasis on the environmental profile of certain storage materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-foci axial intensity distribution generated by a phase pattern displayed on a spatial light modulator irradiates silica, causing ablation and its internal modification. The following wet etching step defines the diameter r, while the radius of curvature R (hence, the focal length f) is maintained the same. As a result, the numerical aperture NA=r/f changes from 0.2 to 0.4 for the same pulse  (but different number of multi-foci) during ablation. An isotropic wet etching of silica becomes highly anisotropic for the initial stages of etching following the irradiated pattern. Subsequent evolution of the shape is governed by an isotropic silica etch and forms a spherical lens. This method can be extended to other materials and geometries of micro-optical elements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674990>Visible blue-to-red 10  GHz frequency comb via on-chip triple-sum-frequency generation.</a></h1><p>A broadband visible (VIS) blue-to-red, 10 GHz repetition rate frequency comb is generated by combined spectral broadening and triple-sum-frequency generation in an on-chip silicon nitride waveguide. Ultra-short pulses of 150 pJ pulse , generated via electro-optic modulation of a 1560 nm continuous-wave laser (CW), are coupled to a silicon nitride waveguide giving rise to a broadband near-infrared (NIR) supercontinuum. Modal phase matching inside the waveguide allows direct triple-sum-frequency transfer of the NIR supercontinuum into the VIS wavelength range covering more than 250 THz from below 400 to above 600 nm wavelength.

Trapping for adults was conducted in Italy with novel live (or lethal) traps consisting of aggregation pheromone-baited cylinders with a wind vane, with the upwind end covered by mesh and the downwind end sealed by a removable entry-only mesh cone, admitting the attracted bugs. The novel traps caught up to 15-times more adult  than identically-baited sticky panels in two weeks of daily checking (n = 6 replicates) (the new live traps were, in Run 1, 5-, 9-, 15-, 13-, 4-, 12-, 2-fold; and in Run 2, 7-, 1-, 3-, 7-, 6-, 6-, and 5-fold better than sticky traps, daily). The maximum catch of the new traps was 96 live adults in one trap in 24 h and the average improvement was ~7-fold compared with sticky panels. The rotating live traps, which exploit a mesh funnel facing the plume downwind that proved useful for collecting adults, could also be used to kill bugs. We expect that commercially-available traps could replace the crude prototypes we constructed quickly from local materials, at low cost, as long as the principles of a suitable plume structure were observed, as we discuss. The traps could be useful for the sterile insect technique, supporting rearing colonies, or to kill bugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674370>Simulation of the interaction of a high  laser beam with the sea surface in the short wavelength infrared.</a></h1><p>The knowledge of the interaction of a high  laser beam with a dynamic sea surface is of great practical interest in maritime environments. The components transmitted into the sea and reflected at the sea surface have to be considered. The calculation of  transfer into the sea is fundamental to the prediction of upper-ocean heating and temperature-dependent optical properties of the sea, which in turn influence its reflectance characteristics. In addition, the spatial  (or power) distribution of the laser beam reflected at the dynamic sea surface is also of high significance. For the estimation of the laser light  reflected into a specific spatial direction, several parameters need to be considered, e.g., wind speed, wind direction, and fetch. The calculated amount of light  reflected into a specific direction varies statistically and depends largely on the dynamics of the wavy sea surface. A 3D simulation of a dynamic sea surface is presented interacting with a high  laser beam in the short wavelength infrared spectral band. The simulation computes the upper-ocean heating, the temperature-dependent Fresnel reflectances, and the absorption in seawater considering the laser geometric configuration. For the reflectance calculations, a bistatic configuration of the laser source and receiver is regarded, where the receiver positions are on a virtual hemisphere having the laser spot center as the center point. The specular reflection of the laser beam at the sea surface is modeled by an analytical statistical bidirectional reflectance distribution function of the sea surface. The simulation is restricted to sea surfaces heated to the boiling point to avoid complex phase transition effects between water and gas. For a high  laser beam focused on a small laser spot on the evolving wavy sea surface, the maximum expected reflected laser power is calculated for the specular forward- and back-reflection direction for glints. The probability of occurrence and temporal occurrence of those glint events is estimated for both directions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672924>Criterion Validity of the Sedentary Behavior Question From the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire in Older Adults.</a></h1><p>To assess the validity of the single question to determine sedentary behavior (SB) by using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) in older adults.The sample included 163 participants (96 women) aged 65-92 years. Self-reported SB was obtained from the GPAQ. Objectively measured SB was assessed using the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity. Participants wore the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity continuously during 2 consecutive days while following their daily routine. The relative validity was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (ρ), and the agreement was examined using mean bias and 95% limit of agreement with the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity as reference.The results showed small correlations (ρ = .291, P < .001) between the SB from the GPAQ and the objective measures, and ranged from ρ = .217 to ρ = .491 depending on the potential moderator. Similarly, the GPAQ underestimates the SB for approximately 2 hours per day in older adults (limit of agreement = -7.3 to 3.4 h/d).The GPAQ may not be the most suitable questionnaire for measuring SB in this population and should be used with caution because those studies that use this questionnaire in older adults may have an inaccurate measurement of SB levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673838>Dual- CT for routine imaging of the abdomen and pelvis: radiation dose and image quality.</a></h1><p>To assess the radiation dose and image quality of routine dual  CT (DECT) of the abdomen and pelvis performed in the emergency department setting, compared with single  CT (SECT).Seventy-five consecutive routine contrast-enhanced SECT scans of the abdomen and pelvis meeting inclusion criteria were compared with 75 routine contrast-enhanced DECT scans matched by size and patient weight (within 10 lbs), performed on the same dual-source DECT scanner. Cohorts were compared in terms of radiation dose metrics of CT dose index (CTDI) and dose length product (DLP), objective measurements of image quality (signal, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio of a variety of anatomical landmarks), and subjective measurements of image quality scored by two emergency radiologists.Demographics and patient size were not statistically different between DECT and SECT cohorts. Both average scans CTDI and DLP were significantly lower with DECT than with SECT. Average scan CTDI for SECT was 14.7 mGy (± 6.6) and for DECT was 10.9 mGy (± 3.8) (p < 0.0001). Average scan DLP for SECT was 681.5 mGy cm (± 339.3) and for DECT was 534.8 mGy cm (± 201.9) (p < 0.0001). For objective image quality metrics, for all structures measured, noise was significantly lower and SNR was significantly higher with DECT compared with SECT. For subjective image quality, for both readers, there was no significant difference between SECT and DECT in subjective image quality for soft tissues and vascular structures, or for subjective image noise.DECT was performed with decreased radiation dose when compared with SECT, demonstrated improved objective measurements of image quality, and equivalent subjective image quality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673031>Estimation of material parameters based on precipitate shape: efficient identification of low-error region with Gaussian process modeling.</a></h1><p>In this study, an efficient method for estimating material parameters based on the experimental data of precipitate shape is proposed. First, a computational model that predicts the energetically favorable shape of precipitate when a d-dimensional material parameter (x) is given is developed. Second, the discrepancy (y) between the precipitate shape obtained through the experiment and that predicted using the computational model is calculated. Third, the Gaussian process (GP) is used to model the relation between x and y. Finally, for identifying the "low-error region (LER)" in the material parameter space where y is less than a threshold, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy, wherein the estimated GP model suggests the subsequent candidate x to be sampled/calculated. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the estimation of interface  and lattice mismatch between MgZn ([Formula: see text]) and α-Mg phases in an Mg-based alloy. The result shows that the number of computational calculations of the precipitate shape required for the LER estimation is significantly decreased by using the proposed method.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674986>Oxychloride glass with low phonon  as a choice for infrared laser materials.</a></h1><p>Recently, rare-earth-doped infrared (IR) luminescent glasses have drawn massive attention due to their potential applications in military, medical, and communications fields. In this Letter, we present a system of oxychloride Si-Ge-O-Cl glasses, suitable for rare-earth doping, which has been developed as a new, to the best of our knowledge, choice for IR luminescent materials. Raman spectra show a looser glass network because of the decreased phonon  and density compared to the one in heavy-metal oxide glasses.

While physical activity and intake of both calcium and vitamin D benefit BMD in older children, there is limited research on the determinants of good bone health in early childhood. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the impact of diet, physical activity, and body composition on BMD at five years of age. Dietary intakes and physical activity levels were measured through questionnaires. Whole body BMD was measured by dual- X-ray absorptiometry in 102 children. Child weight, height, circumferences, skinfolds and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were assessed. There was no association between BMD and dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, 25OHD, physical activity, or sedentary behaviour. Several measures of body composition were significantly positively associated with BMD; however, neither fat mass nor lean body mass was associated with BMD.Conclusion: Although we found no association between self-reported dietary and lifestyle factors and bone health in early years, increased body size was linked with higher BMD. These findings are important as identifying modifiable factors that can improve bone health at a young age is of utmost importance. What is Known: • Bone health is extremely important in early childhood, as children with low bone mineral density (BMD) are at greater risk of bone fractures. • Physical activity has been found to be beneficial for bone health in adolescents, and body composition has also been associated with BMD in teenage years. • Limited research on the determinants of good bone health in early childhood. What is New: • No association between self-reported lifestyle and dietary factors with bone health in early childhood. • Increased body size was associated with higher BMD at five years of age.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672893>Barely porous organic cages for hydrogen isotope separation.</a></h1><p>The separation of hydrogen isotopes for applications such as nuclear fusion is a major challenge. Current technologies are  intensive and inefficient. Nanoporous materials have the potential to separate hydrogen isotopes by kinetic quantum sieving, but high separation selectivity tends to correlate with low adsorption capacity, which can prohibit process scale-up. In this study, we use organic synthesis to modify the internal cavities of cage molecules to produce hybrid materials that are excellent quantum sieves. By combining small-pore and large-pore cages together in a single solid, we produce a material with optimal separation performance that combines an excellent deuterium/hydrogen selectivity (8.0) with a high deuterium uptake (4.7 millimoles per gram).Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

To better mitigate against the impact of airgun pulses on marine mammals, safety criteria are defined to ensure marine mammals are not exposed to high levels of acoustic . Accurate prediction of the sound received levels away from the airguns is required for conducting effective marine mammal monitoring. In this study, measurements by a horizontal hydrophone array towed by the R/V Marcus G. Langseth behind a seismic source array have been used to characterize short-range propagation of airgun pulses and predict the acoustic  radiated from a seismic source. Data from the Cascadia Open-Access Seismic Transects seismic reflection survey are used to train a linear regression (LR) and a random forest (RF) model to estimate sound exposure levels (SELs) in short ranges from the airguns. Results show that the LR model does not account for all the variance in data. However, the RF model is able to estimate the SELs with a high coefficient of determination and a low mean squared error. Results from the LR model show that the rate at which SELs decrease in deep water does not match either of the cylindrical or spherical spreading models. Simulations are undertaken to understand this inconsistency as well as the effect of hydrophone group-averaging on data recorded by a seismic hydrophone array.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671747>Integrated Process for Sequential Extraction of Bioactive Phenolic Compounds and Proteins from Mill and Field Olive Leaves and Effects on the Lignocellulosic Profile.</a></h1><p>The extraction of bioactive compounds in a biorefinery context could be a way to valorize agri-food byproducts, but there is a remaining part that also requires attention. Therefore, in this work the integrated extraction of phenolic compounds, including the bioactive oleuropein, and proteins from olive mill leaves was addressed following three schemes, including the use of ultrasound. This affected the total phenolic content (4475.5-6166.9 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g), oleuropein content (675.3-1790.0 mg/100 g), and antioxidant activity (18,234.3-25,459.0 µmol trolox equivalents/100 g). No effect was observed on either the protein recovery or the content of sugars and lignin in the extraction residues. Concerning the recovery of proteins, three operational parameters were evaluated by response surface methodology. The optimum (63.1%) was achieved using NaOH 0.7 M at 100 °C for 240 min. Then, the selected scheme was applied to olive leaves from the field, observing differences in the content of some of the studied components. It also changed the lignocellulosic profile of the extraction residues of both leaf types, which were enriched in cellulose.

A thin layer of poly 2-anilinoethanol (2-AE) was formed to coat the boronate-affinity hollow SnO surface through self-polymerization, it has strong hydrophilicity and limited residual boric acid content, avoiding non-specific binding. The hollow structure could bind to target molecules effectively and facilitate the removal of template molecules. The Bh@SnO-FMIPs were used to extract three cis-diol polyphenols containing catechin, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in tea and juice samples. Combination with seven characterizations of the material confirmed the successful preparation. Effecting the imprinting conditions and extraction efficiency parameters were optimized separately. Selective and competitive adsorption experiments indicated that the materials could specific recognition polyphenols. Using solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography method, the detection limits were 0.005-0.046 μg mL and the recoveries were between 82.3-104.3%. The improved adsorption performance may be assigned to the synergistic effects among boronate-affinity, hollow SnO, and 2-AE self-polymerization. It may enhance binding cavities, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility of adsorbent material, and prevent the aggregation of Sn during the preparation processes.Copyright © 2019.

Methodologies for developing DNA lattices (formed by synthetic double-crossover (DX) tiles) and DNA layers (used by natural salmon) doped with V3+ and an understanding of the physical characteristics of V3+-doped DNA nanostructures are essential in practical applications in interdisciplinary research fields. Here, DNA lattices and layers doped with V3+ are constructed through substrate-assisted growth and drop-casting methods. In addition, enhanced physical characteristics such as band gap , dielectric constant, and susceptibility of V3+-doped DNA nanostructures with varying V3+ concentration ([V3+]) were investigated. The critical concentration ([V3+]C) at a given amount of DNA was predicted based on an analysis of the phase transition of DNA lattices from crystalline to amorphous with specific [V3+]. Generally, the [V3+]C provided crucial information on the structural stability and extremum physical characteristics of V3+-doped DNA nanostructures due to optimum incorporation of V3+ into DNA. We obtained optical absorption spectra for  band gap estimation; Raman spectra for identifying the preferential coordination sites of V3+ in DNA; and X-ray photoelectron spectra to examine the chemical state, chemical composition, and functional groups. In addition, we addressed electrical properties (i.e., current, capacitance, dielectric constant, and storage ) and magnetic properties (magnetic field-dependent and temperature-dependent magnetizations and susceptibility) of DNA layers in the presence of V3+. The development of biocompatible materials with specific optical, electrical, and magnetic properties is required for future applications because they must have designated functionality, high efficiency, and affordability.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674418>Comparison of femtosecond and nanosecond two-photon-absorption laser-induced fluorescence of krypton.</a></h1><p>Two-photon-absorption laser-induced fluorescence of Kr was explored using both nanosecond- and femtosecond-duration laser excitation sources.

This study aims to develop a gold nanoparticle (GNP)-based nanoprobe, which could simultaneously induce and monitor the apoptosis of melanoma cells in situ and realize a precise control of photothermal therapeutic dose. The GNS-TAT-Cy5 nanoprobe was obtained through the formation of Au-S bonds between GNS-TAT and Cy5-tagged caspase-3 specific peptides (Cy5-DEVD). The fluorescence of Cy5 was quenched by the GNS due to the nanosurface  transfer effect. Upon laser irradiation, activated caspase-3 cleaved the substrate peptide and Cy5 was released from the nanoprobe, leading to a significant fluorescence turn on signal for sensitive and continuous analysis of caspase 3 activity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the GNS-TAT-Cy5 nanoprobe can serve as a precise theranostic platform via regulating the photothermal dose and achieved regulation and detection of apoptosis related to caspase-3 for melanoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674430>Three-dimensional nonparaxial characterization of physical point sources.</a></h1><p>Optical point sources are considered theoretical idealizations.

The prepared compounds were also tested for their inhibition potential on photosynthetic electron transport (PET) in spinach () chloroplasts. In fact, some of the newly prepared molecules revealed comparable or even better inhibitory activities compared to the marketed drugs (rivastigmine or galanthamine) and commercially applied pesticide Diuron, respectively. Generally, most compounds exhibited better inhibition potency towards AChE; however, a wider activity span was observed for BChE. Notably, benzyl -[()-2-[(-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]-carbamate () and benzyl -[()-2-[(-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]-carbamate () were characterized by fairly high selective indexes. Specifically, compound  was prescribed with the lowest IC value that corresponds quite well with galanthamine inhibition activity, while the inhibitory profiles of molecules  and benzyl--[()-2-[(-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]carbamate () are in line with rivastigmine activity. Moreover, a structure-activity relationship (SAR)-driven similarity evaluation of the physicochemical properties for the carbamates examined appeared to have foreseen the activity cliffs using a similarity-activity landscape index for BChE inhibitory response values. The 'indirect' ligand-based and 'direct' protein-mediated in silico approaches were applied to specify electronic/steric/lipophilic factors that are potentially valid for quantitative (Q)SAR modeling of the carbamate analogues.

A total of 144 volunteers were randomized to a 16-week intervention with two hypocaloric diets: either a Mediterranean diet (MED) moderate in fat (37% total  as fat) or the Central European diet (CED) moderate in carbohydrates (55% total  as carbohydrates). The associations between FTO and PPARG polymorphism on the baseline body mass, body composition, blood pressure, lipid and non-lipid parameters, and their changes after the trial were analyzed. None of the examined baseline outcomes differed in the rs9939609 FTO subgroups; abdominal fat was higher in the minor (G) allele carriers of the PPARG rs1801282. After the intervention, in the CED group, the PPARG G allele carriers showed greater reductions in weight (-6.58 ± 0.61 vs -9.58 ± 0.83; P < .01), lean mass (-0.38 ± 0.29 vs -1.79 ± 0.38; P < .05) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (-0.46 ± 0.77 vs -5.25 ± 1.49; P < .01) than the CC homozygotes, and the TT individuals of the rs9939609 FTO had greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure (-9.03 ± 1.78 vs. -7.58 ± 1.50; P < .05).

Thymol acts via its potential to enhance productive and reproductive performance, and by improving bioavailability of nutrients in fish. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with these phenomena remain poorly understood, although recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the phosphotransfer network and antioxidant status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the improvement of the antioxidant/oxidant status and the phosphoryl transfer network may be involved in enhanced growth performance in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with various levels of thymol (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed). Thymol-supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) produced higher body weight and weight gain for 60-day post-feeding compared to the control group. Specific growth rate was higher; while feed conversion ratio was lower in fish that consumed 100 mg of thymol/kg compared to other groups. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity and lipid peroxidation levels were lower in the thymol-supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group, while reactive oxygen species were lower in all supplemented groups than in the control group. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (300 mg/kg feed) and glutathione peroxidase (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed) activities, as well as antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (100 mg/kg feed) were higher in these groups than in the control group. Based on these data, we conclude that 100 mg thymol/kg dietary supplementation increased growth performance of fingerling grass carp. Finally, hepatic adenylate kinase activity was lower in the thymol supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group. Thymol supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) improved hepatic  metabolism, while practically all tested concentrations of thymol enhanced hepatic antioxidant status, all of which may be pathways involved in increased growth performance in fingerling grass carp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672849>Heparan Sulfate Structure Affects Autophagy, Lifespan, Responses to Oxidative Stress, and Cell Degeneration in Mutants.</a></h1><p>Autophagy is a catabolic process that provides cells with  and molecular building blocks during nutritional stress. Autophagy also removes misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, a critical mechanism for cellular repair. Earlier work demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans, an abundant class of carbohydrate-modified proteins found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, suppress basal levels of autophagy in several cell types during development in In studies reported here, we examined the capacity of heparan sulfate synthesis to influence events affected by autophagy, including lifespan, resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress, and accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in the brain. Compromising heparan sulfate synthesis increased autophagy-dependent processes, evident by extended lifespan, increased resistance to ROS, and reduced accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in the brains of ROS exposed adults. The capacity of altering heparan sulfate biosynthesis to protect cells from injury was also evaluated in two different models of neurodegeneration, overexpression of Presenilin and mutants. Presenilin overexpression in the retina produces cell loss, and compromising heparan sulfate biosynthesis rescued retinal patterning and size abnormalities in these animals.  is the fly homolog of human, one of the genes responsible for juvenile onset Parkinson's Disease. Parkin is involved in mitochondrial surveillance and compromising function results in degeneration of both flight muscle and dopaminergic neurons in Altering heparan sulfate biosynthesis suppressed flight muscle degeneration and mitochondrial dysmorphology, indicating that activation of autophagy-mediated removal of mitochondria (mitophagy) is potentiated in these animals. These findings provide in vivo evidence that altering the levels of heparan sulfate synthesis activates autophagy and can provide protection from a variety of cellular stressors.Copyright © 2019, G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674579>Interplay of pulse duration, peak intensity, and particle size in laser-driven electron emission from silica nanospheres.</a></h1><p>We present the results of a systematic study of photoelectron emission from isolated dielectric nanoparticles (SiO) irradiated by intense 25 fs, 780 nm linearly polarized laser pulses as a function of particle size (20 nm to 750 nm in diameter) and laser intensity. We also introduce an experimental technique to reduce the effects of focal volume averaging. The highest photoelectron energies show a strong size dependence, increasing by a factor of six over the range of particles sizes studied at a fixed intensity. For smaller particle sizes (up to 200 nm), our findings agree well with earlier results obtained with few-cycle, ∼4 fs pulses. For large nanoparticles, which exhibit stronger near-field localization due to field-propagation effects, we observe the emission of much more energetic electrons, reaching energies up to ∼200 times the ponderomotive . This strong deviation in maximum photoelectron  is attributed to the increase in ionization and charge interaction for many-cycle pulses at similar intensities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674960>All-fiber passively mode-locked ultrafast laser based on a femtosecond-laser-inscribed in-fiber Brewster device.</a></h1><p>We report on an in-fiber Brewster device with a 45° tilted fiber grating (TFG) directly written by a plane-by-plane femtosecond laser inscription method. Up to 10 dB polarization-dependent loss was achieved, proving effective polarizing functionality. Furthermore, we employ it as an in-line polarizer to successfully mode lock a fiber laser through the nonlinear polarization rotation technique. A stable soliton pulse train has been generated at 1563.64 nm with a pulse width of 624 fs and pulse  of 0.42 nJ. With proper polarization adjustment, the laser also can operate in a noise-like regime. The parameters of this kind of 45°-TFG can be flexibly customized owing to the high flexibility and controllability of the femtosecond laser-inscription approach.

The presence of microplastics have been recorded in the tissues of many wild fish species, and laboratory studies have demonstrated that microplastics can exert adverse health effects. To further investigate the biological mechanisms underlying microplastics toxicity we applied an integrated approach, analyzing the effects of microplastics at transcriptomic, histological and behavioral level. Adult zebrafish have been exposed to two concentrations of high-density polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics for twenty days. Transcriptomic results indicate alterations in the expression of immune system genes and the down-regulation of genes correlated with epithelium integrity and lipid metabolism. The transcriptomic findings are supported by tissue alterations and higher occurrence of neutrophils observed in gills and intestinal epithelium. Even the daily rhythm of activity of zebrafish appears to be affected, although the regular pattern of activity is recovered over time. Considering the transcriptomic and histological findings reported, we hypothesize that the effects on mucosal epithelium integrity and immune response could potentially reduce the organism defense against pathogens, and lead to a different utilization of  stores.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673766>Thermal energetics and behaviour of a small, insectivorous marsupial in response to the interacting risks of starvation and predation.</a></h1><p>Central to understanding animal ecology is how prey cope with the interacting risks of starvation and predation. This trade-off is modulated by the  requirements of prey, yet relatively few studies have incorporated physiological mechanisms for  savings when considering the behavioural response of prey to predation risk. In our study, we aimed to determine individual variation in behaviour, resting metabolism, body temperature and response to 24-h starvation within a captive population of fat-tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata; 15-g insectivorous marsupials), and then, using semi-outdoor enclosures, test whether foraging effort and thermal energetics are adjusted in response to manipulation of ground cover, which for small mammals can simulate predation risk. We found that, under the low cover (high predation risk) treatment, dunnarts consumed less food and employed a greater daily reduction in body temperature between their active and rest phase. This result supports the hypothesis that rest-phase thermoregulatory  savings are employed, even when food is available, if predation risk is perceived to increase the cost of foraging. Individuals exhibited correlated variation along two orthogonal axes incorporating the measured behavioural and metabolic variables, but these differences were not correlated with responses to starvation and predation risk. Our experiment demonstrates that flexibility in daily  requirements provided by heterothermy can have important consequences for how small mammals respond to both starvation and predation risks. Such challenges are amplified in degraded habitat with introduced predators, making the capacity for heterothermy an even more important mechanism for survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674141>Can intensity in strength training change caloric expenditure? systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Strength training (ST) is considered an important strategy for maintaining body weight, as it promotes an increase in total  expenditure (EE). However, the combination and manipulation of variables (intensity and volume) allow for different training adaptations.This review aimed to investigate the effect of ST on EE in adults using a systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis.The search was performed on the electronic databases using the following keywords: strength training (resistance training; strength training; strength training method) and  expenditure ( metabolism;  expenditure; caloric expenditure, caloric cost) with "AND" and "OR" combination. Manual searches of references were also conducted for additional relevant studies. After evaluating the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the selected studies were analyzed according to strength training methods and the training variables used to measure EE.We identified two ST methods from the literature review: circuit training (CT) and traditional training (TT). Meta-analysis showed a significant effect on EE increase, which favor TT when compared with CT (-0.99 [95%CI: -1.96, -0.02], p < 0.01) with I of 89% (p < 0.01). After adjusting for bias risk, no significant differences were found in EE associated with intensity (-0.40, 95% CI [0.98, 0.18], p = 0.18).The present review and meta-analysis indicated that the intensity of exercise does not seem to be associated with an increase of EE in ST.© 2019 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

The medium of interest is concrete, but the approach also applies to other types of inhomogeneous media. The theoretical basis of the work is first presented through a one-dimensional point-scatterer model that considers the wavefield set up by multiple distinct scatterers. More complex scattering scenarios are then investigated using numerical simulation. The numerical models consider two types of scatterers: elliptic large-scale particles distributed throughout a medium, and small-sized cracks localized within a damage zone. The theoretical and numerical analyses show that forward propagating waves undergo distinct scattering behavior within the crack damaged zone: non-propagating resonance-like oscillatory fields are set up within the cracked zone, and are distinct from the scatter caused by the large-scale particles. Frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain analyses to extract the  of non-propagating oscillatory fields and thus to detect and locate zones of distributed cracking are employed. The proposed approach is evaluated using numerical simulation and experimental data collected from concrete specimens that contain simulated distributed cracks. The results demonstrate that the location of distributed crack zones in discrete random media, such as concrete, can be successfully detected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674633>Rotational characterization of SF chalcogen bonds in the complex of 2,2,4,4-tetrafluoro-1,3-dithietane and difluoromethane.</a></h1><p>Sulfur chalcogen bonds (ChBs) play important roles in fields ranging from protein science to molecular self-assembly and organic conductor materials.

Experimental results and quantum chemical calculations clearly support the formation of SF ChB in the complex. The uncovered structure also shows the existence of two C-HF and two C-FF-C contacts.

The highly metabolically active cells of the renal tubule also pair their energetic needs to the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including  generation, antioxidant responses, autophagy and mitochondrial quality control. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential not only for the harvesting of  from substrates but also for an array of regulatory reactions that determine cellular health. In acute kidney injury (AKI), substantial decreases in the levels of NAD impair  generation and, ultimately, the core kidney function of selective solute transport. Conversely, augmentation of NAD may protect the kidney tubule against diverse acute stressors. For example, NAD augmentation can ameliorate experimental AKI triggered by ischaemia-reperfusion, toxic injury and systemic inflammation. NAD-dependent maintenance of renal tubular metabolic health may also attenuate long-term profibrotic responses that could lead to chronic kidney disease.

Due to the effects of particle agglomeration and dependent scattering, the radiative transfer problem will become more complex with the increase of particle volume fraction. In this study, the scattering properties and radiative transfer characteristics of densely packed optically soft particle systems, with consideration of the effects of dependent scattering and particle agglomeration, are investigated. The dependent scattering properties of densely packed silicon-dioxide spherical particles embedded in water are calculated by using the Lorenz-Mie theory and Percus-Yevick sticky hard-sphere model. The directional-hemispherical reflectance of the dispersed plane-parallel layer is obtained by using the Monte Carlo method. The results show that dependent scattering and particle agglomeration have significant influence on the scattering properties of particles. With the increase of particle agglomeration degree, the scattering coefficients and asymmetry factors of the particles increase obviously, which can be even larger than the results for independent scattering under certain circumstances. Due to the combined interaction of multiple scattering, dependent scattering, and particle agglomeration, for different size particles, the variation tendency of the hemispherical reflectance is obviously different with increasing particle agglomeration degree.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674425>Finite- Airy-Lorentz-Gaussian beam and its paraxial propagation.</a></h1><p>We theoretically propose a new form of laser beam, named the finite- Airy-Lorentz-Gaussian (ALG) beam, which can be decomposed into an exponentially modified Airy function in the  direction and a Lorentz-Gaussian function in the  direction.

The sensors' spatially modulated arrangement of a micropolarization array results in loss of spatial resolution and instantaneous field-of-overview errors. Polarization demosaicking (PDM) methods are often utilized to address these drawbacks and achieve the goal of recovering missing polarization information. In this paper, we propose minimized Laplacian polarization residual interpolation for PDM. The Laplacian  is introduced to improve the interpolation accuracy. We employ interchannel correlation and a guided filter to generate precise tentative estimates and the interpolation performed in the residual domain, where the residuals are the differences between observed values and tentative estimates.

However, the key application components of the mass transfer operations and diffusion coefficient have not been determined. In this study, a modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model was mathematically developed containing a constant related to the radius of the adsorbent particle and the fractional attainment of adsorption. The adsorption experiments were conducted under various initial Pb(II) concentrations ranging from 60 mg L to 100 mg L. The results suggested that the modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model was more applicable to the experimental data than the original Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model. The average value of the diffusion coefficient (λD¯) obtained from the modified finite bath diffusion control model was 1.63 × 10 cm s indicating the effective diffusivity in the adsorption of Pb(II) on MOMC-NP. Overall, the modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model exhibited the precise description and simulation of the mass transfer kinetics for Pb(II) adsorption onto MOMC-NP. Therefore, the modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model could be effectively used to investigate the mass transfer kinetics of the adsorption process.Copyright © 2019.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in  and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

While the force has been investigated extensively for two-bubble systems, the modulation of the force by nearby bubbles remains unclear. This problem is investigated in this paper by theoretical analyses and numerical simulations of a three bubble system. For weak oscillations, the third bubble is found to have strong effects when its radius is close to the resonant radius. The equilibrium distance between the bubble pair is reduced when the radius of the third bubble is smaller than the resonant threshold, and increased when it is larger. For strong oscillations of bubbles with radii of a few microns, the third bubble reduces the magnitude of the force, hence increasing the equilibrium distance. The modulation effects depend strongly on the relative sizes of the bubbles. Stronger effects can be produced when the third bubble is placed closer to the smaller bubble in the bubble pair. The findings highlight the need for a more accurate parametrization of the secondary Bjerknes force in the simulation and manipulation of bubble clusters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A systematic strategy was used to search the health science, social science and marketing databases to identify peer-reviewed literature on food and non-alcoholic beverage company sponsorship of sport published in English from 2015 to 2019.Sixteen discrete studies were identified: six content analyses, two qualitative studies, four cross-sectional surveys and four experimental studies. Findings indicate sports sponsorship is widely used to promote unhealthy foods through professional and community sport, prompting increased awareness and preference for sponsor products. Most studies assessed self-reported responses to sponsorship, with a lack of behavioural data on food purchasing and consumption. Sports sponsorship by unhealthy food brands achieves vast population reach and exposure, promoting increased brand awareness and preference for sponsor products. Research is needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between food and beverage sponsorship and  intake. Research evaluating the efficacy of strategies to reduce spectator's exposure to unhealthy sports sponsorship is also needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673771>Prevalence of inadequate intake of folate after mandatory fortification: results from the first National Dietary Survey in Brazil.</a></h1><p>Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of folate inadequacy (POFI) according to life stage, socio-economic status, and geographical regions after the mandatory fortification of wheat and maize flour in Brazil.This was a population-based study. Data from two non-consecutive food records from the National Dietary Survey/Household Budget Survey 2008-2009 were used to estimate the usual dietary folate intake in µg dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The National Cancer Institute method was used to account for within-person variance and the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-point method was used to calculate the POFI. The survey included 32,749 individuals, 15,700 males and 17,049 females, over 10 years old. Pregnant women, lactating women, and individuals with unreliable  intake data were excluded.Overall POFI was 31.5% and mean dietary folate intake was 411.1 µg DFE. The lowest POFI occurred in the youngest age group of 10-13 years in both sexes, while the highest POFI was observed in the group ≥ 71 years. In women of childbearing age, POFI was around 32%. The lowest income strata had the highest POFI. The most developed regions (South and Southeast) had the lowest POFI compared to less developed regions.Our data show that folate inadequacy is still prevalent in Brazil mainly in low-income groups and less developed regions. Actions need to be taken to ensure that women of childbearing age, who presented a high prevalence of inadequate folate intake, achieve the recommended daily intake of 400 µg DFEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674181>Size-controlled growth of silver nanoparticles onto functionalized ordered mesoporous polymers for efficient CO2 upgrading.</a></h1><p>Highly dispersed metallic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are promising heterogeneous catalysts for carboxylative coupling of terminal alkynes with CO2 under mild conditions. Yet their size-controlled synthesis is very challenging due to the high surface . Here we prepared a series of amino-functionalized ordered mesoporous polymers as hosts for anchoring AgNPs. Control experiments and computations showed that electron-rich amines confined in mesochannels with varying electron density and steric hindrance, creating "localized active zones (LAZ)" to control the growth of AgNPs. The particle size of AgNPs grows along with the increased volume of LAZ around nitrogen species. We also revealed that the catalytic activity of Ag-based catalysts is size-dependent and increases with decreasing particle size. Building on these findings, we report a facile one-pot synthesis strategy for preparing amine-incorporated ordered mesoporous polymer (NOMP) with a high specific surface area, small LAZ volume, and uniform amine sites with controllable loading. These features result in the formation of ultrasmall and monodispersed Ag nanoparticles. Remarkably, Ag@NOMP gave a quantitive target yield under the conditions of 1 atm CO2 pressure and 50 °C, showing superior catalytic activity in the CO2 carboxylation compared to other mesoporous analogs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675738>Morphologies controlled ZnO for inactivation of multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in solar light.</a></h1><p>The different morphology and size of the zinc oxide (ZnO) were synthesized by a co-precipitation process via variation of calcination temperature from 400 oC to 900 oC. The nanorod, flower, hexagon, pentagon, and microflambeau morphologies were obtained. Flower morphology of ZnO tends to inactivate multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) completely within 45 min under solar light irradiation than other morphologies due to efficient separation electron-hole pairs. The prevention of charge recombination was confirmed by transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy suggests that O2¯•, OH•, and h+ are responsible for P. aeruginosa inactivation in solar light. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa inactivation was confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, DNA fragmentation (gel electrophoresis) and protein degradation (Bradford assay). The TEM mapping illustrates the damaging of bacteria by active species but not the releasing of Zn2+ ions in bacteria cell. So, this work provides a detail investigation of morphology/size dependent photocatalytic inactivation of multidrug resistant pathogen in solar light.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674422>High-repetition-rate laser ultrasonic generation in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics excited by a 3.2-3.4  μm ZGP master oscillator power amplifier system.</a></h1><p>In this paper, we demonstrate 1-kHz-repetition-rate laser ultrasound in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs).

In contrast to most circular nanotubes, in the present work, we demonstrate that the holey phenine nanotubes have polygonal cross sections with diameter-dependent number of sides. The non-circular cross section is attributed to the high twistability of the continuous C-C chains in the phenine nanotube. Consequently, the phenine nanotube forest has a square lattice structure rather than the regular hexagonal lattice of the carbon nanotube forest, resulting in a smooth buckling process under biaxial compression. The buckling pattern of the phenine nanotube forest is highly ordered with the orientation determined by the initial dislocation that frequently appears in the phenine nanotube forest.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671994>Void fraction, number density of acoustic cavitation bubbles, and acoustic frequency: A numerical investigation.</a></h1><p>The present paper consists of a numerical study attempting to characterize the bubble population within a sonochemical reactor through modeling and simulating the number density of bubbles and the void fraction. In a first step, both previous parameters were estimated under 1.52 bar and various acoustic frequencies ranging from 20 to 1000 kHz in function of normalized time. The results showed that the average number density of bubbles, varying within the interval 2.810-1.4 × 10 bubbles dm, follows a clear monotonous evolving trend as the frequency increases, while the average void fraction, comprised between 9.05 × 10 and 1.95 × 10, demonstrates no dependency of acoustic conditions. In a second step, an  analysis was performed at microscopic and macroscopic scales, which led the authors to figure out that the evolution of the number density of bubbles in function of acoustic frequency is mainly governed by the  required to maintain oscillating the single cavitation bubble.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671638>Evidence for Adaptive Selection in the Mitogenome of a Mesoparasitic Monogenean Flatworm .</a></h1><p>Whereas a majority of monogenean flatworms are ectoparasitic, i.e., parasitize on external surfaces (mainly gills) of their fish hosts,  species (subfamily Ancyrocephalinae) are mesoparasitic, i.e., parasitize in the stomach of the host. As there are numerous drastic differences between these two environments (including lower oxygen availability), we hypothesized that this life-history innovation might have produced adaptive pressures on the  metabolism, which is partially encoded by the mitochondrial genome (OXPHOS). To test this hypothesis, we sequenced mitochondrial genomes of two Ancyrocephalinae species: mesoparasitic  and ectoparasitic . The mitogenomic architecture of  is mostly standard for monogeneans, but that of  exhibits some unique features: missing  gene, very low AT content (60%), a non-canonical start codon of the  gene, and exceptionally long tandem-repeats in the non-coding region (253 bp). Phylogenetic analyses produced paraphyletic Ancyrocephalinae (with embedded Dactylogyrinae), but with low support values. Selective pressure (PAML and HYPHY) and protein structure analyses all found evidence for adaptive evolution in  and  genes of the mesoparasitic . These findings tentatively support our hypothesis of adaptive evolution driven by life-history innovations in the mitogenome of this species. However, as only one stomach-inhabiting mesoparasitic monogenean was available for this analysis, our findings should be corroborated on a larger number of mesoparasitic monogeneans and by physiological studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674768>Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic Modeling of the Effects of Pesticides on Growth of .</a></h1><p>Ecological risk assessment is carried out for chemicals such as pesticides before they are released into the environment. Such risk assessment currently relies on summary statistics gathered in standardized laboratory studies. However, these statistics extract only limited information and depend on duration of exposure. Their extrapolation to realistic ecological scenarios is inherently limited. Mechanistic effect models simulate the processes underlying toxicity and so have the potential to overcome these issues. Toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models operate at the individual level, predicting the internal concentration of a chemical over time and the stress it places on an organism. TK-TD models are particularly suited to addressing the difference in exposure patterns between laboratory (constant) and field (variable) scenarios. So far, few studies have sought to predict sublethal effects of pesticide exposure to wild mammals in the field, even though such effects are of particular interest with respect to longer term exposure. We developed a TK-TD model based on the dynamic  budget (DEB) theory, which can be parametrized and tested solely using standard regulatory studies. We demonstrate that this approach can be used effectively to predict toxic effects on the body weight of rats over time. Model predictions separate the impacts of feeding avoidance and toxic action, highlighting which was the primary driver of effects on growth. Such information is relevant to the ecological risk posed by a compound because in the environment alternative food sources may or may not be available to focal species. While this study focused on a single end point, growth, this approach could be expanded to include reproductive output. The framework developed is simple to use and could be of great utility for ecological and toxicological research as well as to risk assessors in industry and regulatory agencies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673007>Effect of shell structure of Ti-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography core-shell magnetic particles for phosphopeptide enrichment.</a></h1><p>Magnetic materials in sample preparation for shotgun phosphoproteomics offer several advantages over conventional systems, as the enrichment can be achieved directly in solution, but they still suffer from some drawbacks, due to limited stability and selectivity, which is supposed to be affected by the hydrophilicity of the polymeric supports used for cation immobilization. The paper describes the development of an improved magnetic material with increased stability, thanks to a two-step covering of the magnetic core, for the enrichment of phosphopeptides in biological samples. Four materials were prepared featuring a polymeric shell with tunable hydrophilicity, obtained by "grafting from" polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate with 0-8.3% of polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGMA), the latter used to modulate the hydrophilicity of the material surface. Finally, the materials were functionalized with iminodiacetic acid for Ti ion immobilization. The materials were analyzed for their composition by a combination of CHN elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, also hyphenated to gas chromatography and mass spectrometric detection. Surface characteristics were evaluated by water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive X-ray spectrometry. These materials were applied to the enrichment of phosphopeptides from yeast protein digests. Peptides were identified by proteomics techniques using nano-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Qualitatively the peptides identified by the four systems were comparable, with 1606-1693 phosphopeptide identifications and a selectivity of 47-54% for all materials. The physico-chemical features of the identified peptides were also the same for the four materials. In particular, the grand average of hydropathy index values indicated that the enriched phosphopeptides were hydrophilic (ca. 90%), and only some co-enriched non-phosphorylated peptides were hydrophobic (21-28%), regardless of the material used for enrichment. Peptides had a pI ≤ 7, which indicated a well-known bias for acidic peptides binding, attributed to the interaction with the metal center itself. The results indicated that the enrichment of phosphopeptides and the co-enrichment of non-phosphorylated peptides is mainly driven by interactions with Ti and does not depend on the amount of PEGMA chains in the polymer shell.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675476>Native void space for maximum volumetric capacity in silicon-based anodes.</a></h1><p>Volumetric  density is considered a primary factor in developing high- batteries. Despite its significance, less efforts have been devoted to its improvement. Silicon-based materials have emerged as next-generation anodes for lithium-ion batteries due to their high specific capacity. However, their volumetric capacities are limited by volume expansion rate of silicon, which restricts mass loading in the electrodes. To address this challenge, we introduce porous silicon templated from earth-abundant minerals with native internal voids, capable of alleviating volumetric expansion during repeated cycles.  TEM analysis allows the precise determination of the expansion rate of silicon, thus presenting an analytical model for finding the optimal content in silicon/graphite composites. The inner pores in silicon reduce problems associated with its expansion and allow higher silicon loading of 42% beyond the conventional limitations of 13-14%. Consequently, the anode designed in this work can deliver a volumetric capacity of 978 mAh cc. Thus, suppressing volume expansion with natural abundant template-assisted materials opens new avenues for cost effective fabrication of high volumetric capacity batteries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672899>Reversible epitaxial electrodeposition of metals in battery anodes.</a></h1><p>The propensity of metals to form irregular and nonplanar electrodeposits at liquid-solid interfaces has emerged as a fundamental barrier to high-, rechargeable batteries that use metal anodes. We report an epitaxial mechanism to regulate nucleation, growth, and reversibility of metal anodes. The crystallographic, surface texturing, and electrochemical criteria for reversible epitaxial electrodeposition of metals are defined and their effectiveness demonstrated by using zinc (Zn), a safe, low-cost, and -dense battery anode material. Graphene, with a low lattice mismatch for Zn, is shown to be effective in driving deposition of Zn with a locked crystallographic orientation relation. The resultant epitaxial Zn anodes achieve exceptional reversibility over thousands of cycles at moderate and high rates. Reversible electrochemical epitaxy of metals provides a general pathway toward -dense batteries with high reversibility.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In this paper, the idea is explored to vary the spectral power distribution at different positions in the illuminated scene, in order to tailor the color appearance of objects. For this, a spatially variable, laser diode based illumination system is considered with three primaries and large color gamut. The color rendering performance of the illumination system is quantified via the IES TM-30-2018 method. It is shown that it is possible to reach the maximal color gamut score that is theoretically allowed by the corresponding color fidelity score. This is a unique property of an illumination system with a spatially variable spectral power distribution. The radiant flux requirements of this laser diode based illumination system are theoretically investigated for various color rendering settings, showing reduced power requirements for higher color gamut. The possibility to tune color rendering is also experimentally demonstrated with a set-up that consists of a commercially available laser projector with a hyperspectral camera. By including a feedback optimization algorithm, it is possible to reach the targeted color rendering performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671822>Food Security and Obesity among Mexican Agricultural Migrant Workers.</a></h1><p>Mexican migrant farm workers are one of the poorest and most marginalized social groups within the country.

However, the activities of these pathways in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and  production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

However, the immature techniques for device fabrication hamper severely their further progress and application. To overcome such a challenge, the abundant processing technology used in semiconductor electronics is worth considering. Herein, a device prototype is fabricated based on band engineering to enable flexible control of QTN probability (TP) within a III-V semiconductor multilayer. While the initial heights of all barriers are set to obtain similar TPs under no bias, the conduction band slopes of InGaSb and AlSb barriers are modulated to a state where their TPs vary reversely under electric fields. On this basis, revealed by in situ bias electron holography, a unidirectional accumulation of electrons has been realized inside the multilayer structure. Moreover, the inevitable element segregation/diffusion during device growth plays a key role in band structure optimization, which is confirmed by strain analysis.

The proposed method can decompose the full-waveform echo into a series of components, each of which can be assumed as essentially Gaussian. The original full-waveform echo is decomposed into the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a final residual by using the EMD first. Then, the average period (¯) and corresponding  densities (EDs) of all IMFs are calculated. A suitable IMF is selected based on the relationship between the EDs of IMFs and the white-noise theoretical spread lines of the 99% confidence-limit level. The components in the full-waveform echo can be detected according to the positions of the maxima of the selected IMF. The initial parameters are estimated by using local-LM fitting. The initial parameters are fitted by global-LM fitting. Compared to the traditional (zero-crossing) ZC method, the proposed method has strong anti-noise performance. It can precisely detect the components and estimate the initial parameters of the components.

Herein, self-supported three-dimensional flexible carbon cloth covered with lithiophilic silicon nanowire array is constructed as host for loading of molten Li to achieve the C/SiNW/Li composite anode. The electrode component of carbon cloth provides the flexible and conductive substrate to accommodate the volume change during the stripping/plating of Li and facilitate more efficient electrons transport, while silicon nanowires improve the wettability of carbon host to liquefied Li and render uniform Li deposition on the surface of composite electrode.

The catalytic quinone half-cell of the Zn-quinone battery, mediates proton coupled electron transfer with molecular oxygen during its chemical regeneration thereby pairing peroxide electrosynthesis with electricity generation. Hydrogen peroxide synthesizing Zn-quinone battery (HPSB) demonstrated a peak power density of ~90 mW/cm at a peak current density of ~145 mA/cm while synthesizing ~230 mM of HO. HPSB offers immense opportunities as it distinctly couples electric power generation with peroxide electrosynthesis which in-turn transforms  conversion in batteries truly multifunctional.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size analysis also confirmed that these bacterial pathogens were significantly abundant in the wastewater treatment systems. Further, the results of this study highlighted that the presence of bacterial pathogens in treated effluent pose a potential contamination risk, transmitted through soil, agriculture, water, or sediments.

In this work, the structures of seventeen molecules with eight new coordinating functionalities and varying size have been determined by this method, four of which are complex molecules being crystallized for the first time. The chirality of the MOF backbone not only enables enantioselective crystallization of chiral small molecules from a racemic mixture, but also imposes diastereoselective incorporation upon achiral molecules. Crystallographic studies assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the stereoselectivity of MOF-520 not exclusively comes from the steric confinement of the chiral pore environment but also from asymmetric chemical bonding of the target molecules with the framework that is able to provide sufficient  difference between possible coordination configurations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675460>Calculating dose from a 2.5 MV imaging beam using a commercial treatment planning system.</a></h1><p>Patient dose from 2.5 MV images on the TrueBeam linear accelerator is not easily quantified, primarily because this beam  is not normally modeled by commercial treatment planning systems. In this work we present the feasibility of using the Eclipse® treatment planning system to model this beam. The Acuros XB and the AAA dose calculation algorithms were tested. Profiles, PDDs, and output factors were measured for the 2.5 MV unflattened imaging beam and used for beam modeling. The algorithms were subsequently verified using MPPG 5.a guidelines. Calculated doses with both algorithms agreed with the measurement data to within the following criteria recommended for conventional therapeutic MV beams: 2% local dose-difference in the high-dose region, 3% global difference in the low-dose region, 3 mm distance to agreement in the penumbra, and a gamma pass rate of >95% for 3%/3 mm criteria. Acuros was able to accurately calculate dose through cork and bone-equivalent heterogeneities. AAA was able to accurately calculate dose through the bone-equivalent heterogeneity but did not pass within the recommended criteria for the cork heterogeneity. For the 2.5 MV imaging beam, both the AAA and Acuros algorithms provide calculated doses that agree with measured results well within the 20% criteria for imaging beams recommended by AAPM TG-180.© 2019 The Authors.

We propose an improved method to straightforwardly derive the surface  of porous membrane from contact angles with the interference effect corrected. A linearized model was established combining the Young-Dupré and Cassie-Baxter equations, from which the surface  (Lifshitz-van der Waals and Lewis acid/base components) and roughness index (surface area difference) can be solved simultaneously at a given porosity using contact angles measured with a set of standard polar/nonpolar test liquids. The model solution was examined using hydrophilic microfiltration membranes with different pore morphologies (including perforated plate-like PCTE, irregular particulate bed-like PVDF and fibrous mesh-like PTFE membranes), with the robustness of the results evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation. In comparison with the verified results of the model solution, it was found that the Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis acid and base  values for the tested membranes would deviate by 50-87%, 30-160% and 52-97% respectively if surface roughness and porosity were neglected in the calculation. The profound effect of roughness and porosity on surface  determination was further confirmed via theoretical analysis of the Young-Dupré and Cassie-Baxter relationships. This improved approach may apply to the surface  characterization of hydrophilic rough porous membranes (e.g. hydrophilic microfiltration membranes).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671799>Buckling and Post-Buckling Behavior of Uniform and Variable-Density Lattice Columns Fabricated Using Additive Manufacturing.</a></h1><p>Lattice structures are known for their high strength-to-weight ratio, multiple functionalities, lightweight, stiffness, and  absorption capabilities and potential applications in aerospace, automobile, and biomedical industry. To reveal the buckling (global and local) and post-buckling behavior of different lattice morphologies, both experimental and simulation-based studies were carried out. Additionally, a variable-density lattice structure was designed and analyzed to achieve the optimal value of critical buckling load. Latticed columns were fabricated using polyamide 12 material on multi jet fusion 3D printer. The results exhibited that the buckling in lattice columns depends on the distribution of mass, second moment of inertia I, diameter and position of vertical beams, number of horizontal or inclined beams, and location and angle of the beams that support the vertical beams. The number of horizontal and inclined beams and their thickness has an inverse relation with buckling; however, this trend changes after approaching a critical point. It is revealed that vertical beams are more crucial for buckling case, when compared with horizontal or inclined beams; however, material distribution in inclined or horizontal orientation is also critical because they provide support to vertical beams to behave as a single body to bear the buckling load. The results also revealed that the critical buckling load could be increased by designing variable density cellular columns in which the beams at the outer edges of the column are thicker compared with inner beams. However, post-buckling behavior of variable density structures is brittle and local when compared with uniform density lattice structures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674187>Tuning the potential  landscape to suppress Ostwald Ripening in surface-supported catalyst systems.</a></h1><p>Rational control of nanoparticle (NP) size distribution during operation is crucial to improve catalytic performance and noble metal sustainability. Herein, we explore the Ostwald ripening (OR) of metal atoms on zeolite surfaces by a coupled theoretical-experimental approach. Zeolites with the same structure (ZSM-5) but different concentrations of aluminum doped into the matrix were observed to yield systematic differences in supported nanoparticle size distributions. Our first-principles simulations suggest that NP stability at high temperature is governed by both geometric constraints and the roughness of the energetic landscape. Calculated adatom migration paths across the zeolite surface and desorption paths from the supported NPs lend insight to the modified OR sintering processes with the emergence of different binding configurations as the aluminum concentration increases from pristine to heavily-doped ZSM-5.

Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or immunity), which may altogether affect adult metabolism. All these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult metabolism has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on RMR (resting metabolic rate, measured in thermoneutrality, 25°C) and TMR (thermoregulatory metabolic rate, measured in cold challenging condition, 5°C) in the House sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood when their metabolism was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of metabolism was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an -saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.© 2019.

The results show that the passing beam achieves the target light distribution with multiple light patterns superimposed by reflectors, and can meet the four segment light types under the regulations: Class C, Class V, Class E, and Class W. With the structural design method of the reflector, a cutoff line is formed under the structure without a visor to reduce the  waste caused by the shielding structure, so that the maximum luminosity of the passing beam under the road section can reach 75,980.7 cd and the simulated maximum photometric value can reach 69,705.9 cd under Class W. The driving beam uses the total internal reflection (TIR) lens design to find the optimal 36° angle of the lens to effectively achieve the straightening and brightness enhancement of the light, and then uses the response surface methodology to optimize the optical divergence of the parameters of the microlenticular lens structure on the TIR lens to adjust the width and flatness of the light type. Among them, the radius of curvature, the thickness of the lens, and the length of the single lens are selected as the factors. Using the experimental design method of the reaction surface, the optimal solution of the driving beam design is found. The optimal solution is combined into a radius of curvature of 14.99 mm in the X direction and 25.22 mm in the Y direction, the overall thickness is 1.5 mm, and the length of a single curved surface is 2.43.

The specific objectives were to (i) investigate the major AhR-active fractions of organic extracts of sediments by using H4IIE-luc in vitro bioassay (4 h and 72 h exposures), (ii) quantify known AhR agonists, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and styrene oligomers (SOs), (iii) identify unknown AhR agonists by use of gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOFMS), and (iv) determine contributions of AhR agonists to total potencies measured by use of the bioassay. FSA was conducted on fractions F2.6 and F2.7 (aromatics with log K 5-7) in extracts of sediment from Siheung Creek (industrial area). Those fractions exhibited significant AhR-mediated potency as well as relatively great concentrations of PAHs and SOs. FSA detected 461 and 449 compounds in F2.6 and F2.7, respectively. Of these, five tentative candidates of AhR agonist were selected based on NIST library matching, aromatic structures and numbers of rings, and available standards. Benz[b]anthracene, 11H-benzo[a]fluorene, and 4,5-methanochrysene exhibited significant AhR-mediated potency in the H4IIE-luc bioassay, and relative potencies of these compounds were determined. Potency balance analysis demonstrated that these three newly identified AhR agonists explained 1.1% to 67% of total induced AhR-mediated potencies of samples, which were particularly great for industrial sediments. Follow-up studies on sources and ecotoxicological effects of these compounds in coastal environments would be required.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

It is a unique example of an immune deficiency that is linked to dysfunctional mitochondrial  metabolism and caused by adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) deficiency. It is characterized by an early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage, impaired lymphoid maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, a novel AK2 homozygous mutation, c.622 T > C [p.Ser208Pro], was identified in an Old Order Amish patient through whole exome sequencing. Functional studies showed that the patient's cells have no detectable AK2 protein, as well as low oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and proton production rate (PPR). An increased production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and mitochondrial mass, and decreased ATP production, were also observed. The results confirm the pathogenicity of the AK2 mutation and demonstrate that reticular dysgenesis should be considered in Amish individuals presenting with immune deficiency.

Results were analyzed using two-sample t tests and linear mixed effects model. Analysis was repeated for different age categories and trended over time.Patients receiving SCIG reported statistically significant higher  fatigue scores (+ 9 points, p < 0.001) but lower perceived role limitations due to physical health scores (- 14 points, p < 0.001). These differences were only observed in patients > 36 years of age. There were no differences in the composite SF-36 score for patients receiving SCIG versus IVIG (+ 1, p = 0.66). Immunoglobulin-naïve patients all improved their hrQOL, but a larger improvement was seen in those initiating SCIG versus IVIG.Patients with PIDD on home IVIG versus SCIG have similar composite hrQOL scores as measured by the SF-36. In the adult population, initiating immunoglobulin replacement with SCIG may result in more hrQOL improvement compared with IVIG, although personal preferences should also be considered.Patients with PIDD on home IVIG versus SCIG have similar composite health-related quality of life scores as measured by the SF-36.

Herein, an innovative multistage anaerobic hythane reactor (MAHR) was reported via integrating two-stage fermentation into one reactor. MAHR was constructed using an internal down-flow packed bed reactor and an external up-flow sludge blanket to enhance microbial enrichment and thermodynamic feasibility of the associated bioreactions. The performance of MAHR was investigated for 160 d based on biogas production, metabolic flux and microbial structure in comparison to a typical anaerobic high-rate reactor (up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)). A biohythane production with an optimized hydrogen volume ratio (10-20%) and a high methane content (75-80%) was achieved in the hythane zone (M) and methane zone (M) in MAHR, respectively. In addition, MAHR showed a stronger capability to accommodate a high organic loading rate (120 g COD/L/d), and it enhanced the conversion of organics leading to a methane production rate 66% higher than UASB. Thermodynamic analysis suggested that hydrogen extraction in M significantly decreased the hydrogen partial pressure (<0.1% vol) which favored acetogenesis in M Metabolic flux and microbial function analysis further supported the superior performance of MAHR over UASB, which was primarily attributed to enhanced acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) are classified as slow-adapting (SA) or rapid-adapting (RA) based on whether or not they spike repetitively during sustained tactile stimulation; the former are subclassified as type 1 or 2 based on the regularity of their spiking. Recording  from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice, we observed irregular- and regular-spiking units consistent with SA1 and SA2 LTMRs, but some units, which we labeled "semi-regular", did not fit cleanly into the existing classification scheme. Analysis of their spiking revealed integer-multiple patterning - spike trains comprised a fundamental interspike interval and multiples thereof. Integer-multiple-patterned spiking was reproduced by randomly removing spikes from an otherwise regular spike train, suggesting that semi-regular units represent SA2 units in which some spikes are "missing". We hypothesized that missing spikes arose from intermittent failure of spikes to initiate or to propagate. Intermittent failure of spike initiation was ruled out by several observations: integer-multiple-patterned spiking was not induced by intradermal lidocaine, was independent of stimulus modality (mechanical vs. optogenetic), and could not be reproduced in a conductance-based model neuron given constant input. On the other hand, integer-multiple-patterned spiking was induced by application of lidocaine to the DRG, thus pinpointing intermittent failure of spike propagation as the basis for integer-multiple-patterned spiking. In fact, half of all SA2 units exhibited some missing spikes, mostly at low rate (<5%), which suggests that axons are efficient in using the lowest safety factor capable of producing near-perfect propagation reliability.The impedance mismatch at axon branch points can impede spike propagation. Reliability of spike propagation across branch points remains an open question, and is especially important for primary afferents whose spikes must cross a T-junction in order to reach the CNS. Past research on propagation reliability has relied almost entirely on simulations and  experiments. Here, recording , we linked a distinctive pattern of spiking to the intermittent failure of spike propagation at the T-junction. The rarity of failures argues that safety factor is high under physiological conditions, yet the occurrence of such failures argues that safety factor is  high enough to ensure -perfect reliability, consistent with a good balance between propagation reliability and  efficiency.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675016>A novel Mn/Co dual nanoparticle decorated hierarchical carbon structure derived from a biopolymer hydrogel as a highly efficient electro-catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.</a></h1><p>A Mn/Co dual nanoparticle-decorated hierarchical carbon structure was derived from a Zn/Mn/Co/chitosan composite hydrogel.

The synthesis of binary DOEs is based on a combination of the method of carrier spatial frequencies and binary coding with a variable fill factor. Unlike various methods of multiplication, the method of carrier spatial frequencies is characterized by great flexibility and versatility. It allows us to not only form the given field distributions in arbitrary diffraction orders, but also to give them arbitrary weight ratio ( distribution in orders). As a rule, such universality leads to the need to form a complex amplitude-phase distribution in the input plane. To avoid this, in this paper it is proposed to use binary coding with a variable level. The effect of such coding is studied in detail both theoretically and numerically. It is shown that the level variation makes it possible to change the set of the observed diffraction orders. The positions and orders of the optical vortices formed are uniquely determined by the values of the carrying spatial frequencies and the topological charges of the vortices in the basic order.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency,  deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

In northwestern Iberia, D. acuminata has a long growing season, from spring to early autumn, and populations develop as soon as shallow stratification forms when the upwelling season begins. In contrast, D. acuta blooms in late summer, when the depth of the pycnocline is maximal and upwelling pulses are moderate. In situ observations on the hydrodynamic regimes during the two windows of opportunity for Dinophysis species led us to hypothesize that D. acuta should be more sensitive to turbulence than D. acuminata. To test this hypothesis, we studied the response of D. acuminata and D. acuta to three realistic turbulence levels low (LT), ε ≈ 10 m s; medium (MT), ε ≈ 10  m s and high (HT), ε ≈ 10 m sgenerated by Turbogen, a highly reproducible, computer-controlled system. Cells of both species exposed to LT and MT grew at rates similar to the controls. Marked differences were found in the response to HT: D. acuminata grew slowly after an initial lag phase, whereas D. acuta cell numbers declined. Results from this study support the hypothesis that turbulence may play a role in shaping the spatio-temporal distribution of individual species of Dinophysis. We also hypothesize that, in addition to cell disturbance affecting division, sustained high shear generated by microturbulence may cause a decline in Dinophysis numbers due to decreased densities of ciliate prey.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, autophagy represents a pro-survival stress response in the majority of cases. However, the role of autophagy in cell survival and cell death decisions is highly dependent on its extent, duration, and on the respective cellular context. An alternative pro-death function of autophagy has been consistently observed in different settings, in particular, in developmental cell death of lower organisms and in drug-induced cancer cell death. This cell death is referred to as autophagic cell death (ACD) or autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD), a type of cellular demise that may act as a backup cell death program in apoptosis-deficient tumors. This pro-death function of autophagy may be exerted either via non-selective bulk autophagy or excessive (lethal) removal of mitochondria via selective mitophagy, opening new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of autophagy/mitophagy in cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671845>Dietary Supplementation with the Red Seaweed  Protects against DNA Damage and Pre-Malignant Dysplastic Skin Lesions in HPV-Transgenic Mice.</a></h1><p>Some diet profiles are associated with the risk of developing cancer; however, some nutrients show protective effects.  is widely consumed, having a balanced nutritional profile; however, its potential for cancer chemoprevention still needs comprehensive studies. In this study, we incorporated  into the diet of mice transgenic for the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), which spontaneously develop pre-malignant and malignant lesions, and determined whether this seaweed was able to block lesion development. Forty-four 20-week-old HPV and HPV mice were fed either a base diet or a diet supplemented with 10% seaweed. At the end of the study, skin samples were examined to classify HPV16-induced lesions. The liver was also screened for potential toxic effects of the seaweed.

We are investigating a hydrocarbon pathway from mixed sugars via 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural intermediates. To achieve this goal, we must first convert glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural in favorable yields. Current processes to produce HMF/furfural generally involve the use of acid catalysts in biphasic systems or solvents such as ionic liquids. However, the yield from transforming glucose to HMF is lower than the yield of furfural from xylose.In this study, we present an efficient chemical pathway simultaneously transforming glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural via ketose intermediates, i.e., fructose and xylulose, which were generated from glucose and xylose via enzymatic isomerization. In the enzymatic isomerization, by adding sodium borate to complex with the ketoses, xylose conversion reached equilibrium after 2 h with a conversion of 91% and glucose conversion reached 84% after 4 h. By enzymatically isomerizing the aldoses to ketoses, the following dehydration reactions to HMF and furfural could be performed at low process temperatures (i.e., 110-120 °C) minimizing the side reactions of the sugars and limiting the degradation of furfurals to humins and carboxylic acids. At 120 °C, pH 0.5, and 15 min reaction time, mixed ketose sugars were converted to HMF and furfural in yields of 77% and 96%, respectively (based on starting aldose concentrations).Taken together, our results demonstrate that this combined biological and chemical process could be an effective pathway to simultaneously convert biomass-derived glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural, for use as intermediates in the production of hydrocarbons.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h1><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674082>Scalable Synthesis of One-Dimensional Mesoporous ZnMnO3 Nanorods with Ultra-Stable and High-Rate Capability for Efficient Lithium Storage.</a></h1><p>The cost-efficiency ZnMnO 3 has attracted increasing attention as a prospective anode candidate for advanced lithium ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its resourceful abundance, large Li + -storage capacity and low operating voltage. However, its practical application is still seriously limited by the modest cycling and rate performances. Herein, we first report a facile design to scalably synthesize the unique one-dimensional (1D) mesoporous ZnMnO 3 nanorods (ZMO-NRs) composed of nanoscale particles (~11 nm). The 1D mesoporous structure and nanoscale building blocks of the ZMO-NRs effectively promote the transport of ions/electrons, accommodate severe volume changes, and expose more active sites for lithium storage. Benefiting from these appealing structural merits, the obtained ZMO-NRs anode exhibits excellent rate behavior (~454 mAh g -1 at 2 A g - 1 ) and ultra-long term cyclic performance (~949.7 mAh g - 1 even over 500 cycles at 0.5 A g - 1 ) for efficient lithium storage. Besides, the LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 //ZMO-NRs full cell presents a practical  density (~192.2 Wh kg -1 ) and impressive cyclability with ~91% of capacity retention over 110 cycles.

The electrical resistivity of Pd-Ag vs. the temperature presents the characteristic S-shaped curve with a minimum and a maximum of the resistivity in different positions for the tests in hydrogen and deuterium. The results have been related to: (1) the different isotope ratios, H/M and D/M, and (2) their position in the Pd-Ag lattice. The behavior of the electrical resistivity is discussed in details by considering the hydrogen and deuterium uploading into the alloy, its effect on the conduction electrons, and the scattering of the isotopes atoms into the metal lattice. Measurements carried out in hydrogen with slow temperature ramping between 25-250 °C evidenced a hysteresis effect that can be explained by the different  levels of isotopes in O-sites and T-sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675217>Stability, Crystal Chemistry, and Magnetism of UNiB and NbNiB and the Role of Uranium in the Formation of the Quaternary UNbNiB and UNbNiB Systems.</a></h1><p>We investigated the U-Ni-B and Nb-Ni-B systems to search for possible new heavy fermion compounds and superconducting materials. The formation, crystal chemistry, and physical properties of UNiB and NbNiB [ternary derivatives of the cubic CrC-type (116, 3̅)] have been studied; the formation of the hypothetical "UNiB" and "NbNiB" has been disproved. UNiB [ = 10.6701(2) Å] crystallizes in the ordered WCrC-type, whereas NbNiB [ = 10.5842(1) Å] adopts the MgNiB-type. Ni in UNiB can be substituted by U, leading to the solid solution UNiB (0 ≤  ≤ 0.3); oppositely, Nb in NbNiB is partially replaced by Ni, forming the solution NbNiB (0 ≤  ≤ 0.5), none of them reaching the limit corresponding to the hypothetically ordered "UNiB" and "NbNiB". These results prompted us to investigate quaternary compounds UNbNiB and UNbNiB: strong competition in the occupancy of the 4 and 8 sites by U, Nb, and Ni atoms has been observed, with the 4 site occupied by U/Ni atoms only and the 8 site filled by U/Nb atoms only. UNiB, UNiB, and NbNiB are Pauli paramagnets. Interestingly, NbNiB shows ferromagnetism with  ≈ 11 K; the Curie-Weiss fit gives an effective magnetic moment of 2.78 μ/Ni, suggesting that all Ni atoms in the formula unit contribute to the total magnetic moment. The () data at 2 K further corroborate the ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation moment of 10 μ/fu (≈0.49 μ/Ni). The magnetic moment of Ni at the 4 site induces a moment in all of the Ni atoms of the whole unit cell (32 and 48 sites), with all atoms ordering ferromagnetically at 11 K. Density functional theory (DFT) shows that the formation of UNiB and NbNiB is energetically preferred.

While great strides have been made in EM data collection and data processing, sample preparation is still performed using decades-old techniques. Those sample preparation methods rely on extensive macroscale purification and concentration to achieve homogeneity suitable for high-resolution analyses. Noting that relatively few bioparticles are needed to generate high-quality protein structures, this work uses microfluidics that can accurately and precisely manipulate and deliver bioparticles to grids for imaging. The use of microfluidics enables isolation, purification, and concentration of specific target proteins at these small scales and does so in a relatively short period of time (minutes). These capabilities enable imaging of more dilute solutions and obtaining pure protein images from mixtures. In this system, spatially isolated, purified, and concentrated proteins are transferred directly onto electron microscopy grids for imaging. The processing enables imaging of more dilute solutions, as low as 5 × 10 g/ml, with small total amounts of protein (<400 pg, 900 amol). These levels may be achieved with mixtures and, as proof-of-principle, imaging of one protein from a mixture of two proteins is demonstrated.Copyright © 2019 Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675001>Long-pulse 4.4-4.6 μm laser oscillations of Fe ions in a ZnMnSe (x = 0.3) crystal pumped by a 1940 nm Tm fiber laser through Cr → Fe  transfer.</a></h1><p>Millisecond-pulse laser operation of Fe ions at 78 K is demonstrated in the ZnMnSe:Fe,Cr (x=0.3) crystal under a Tm fiber 1940 nm laser pumping through a Cr→Fe  transfer process for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.

Herein, we found that the reaction of precursors containing both nitrogen and oxygen atoms with Ni(II) under 500°C can generate a N/O mixing coordinated Ni-N3O SAC, in which the oxygen atom can be gradually removed under high temperature due to weaker Ni-O interaction, resulting in a vacancy-defect Ni-N3-V SAC at Ni site under 800°C. While the reaction of Ni(II) with the precursor simply containing nitrogen atoms can only obtain a none-vacancy-defect Ni-N4 SAC. Both the results of experimental and DFT calculations reveal that the presence of a vacancy-defect in Ni-N3-V SAC can dramatically boost the electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, with extremely high CO2 reduction current density of 65 mA/cm2 and high Faradaic efficiency over 90% at -0.9 V vs RHE, as well as a record high turnover frequency of 1.35×105 h-1, much higher than those of Ni-N4 SAC, and being one of the best reported electrocatalysts for CO2-to-CO conversion to date.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To determine SLN protein expression in human skeletal muscle and its relationship with adiposity, resting  expenditure (REE), and performance, SLN was assessed by Western blot in 199 biopsies from two previous studies. In one study, 15 overweight volunteers underwent a pre-test followed by four days of caloric restriction and exercise (45min one-arm cranking + 8h walking), and three days on a control diet. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the trained and non-exercised deltoid, and vastus lateralis (VL). In another study, 16 men performed seven sessions of 4-6x30-sec all-out sprints on the cycle ergometer with both limbs, and their VL and triceps brachii biopsied pre- and post-training. SLN expression was two-fold and 44% higher in the VL than in the deltoids and triceps brachii, respectively. SLN was associated neither with adiposity nor REE, and was not altered by a severe  deficit (5,500 kcal/d). SLN and cortisol changes after the  deficit were correlated (r=0.38, P=0.039). SLN was not altered by low-intensity exercise in the overweight subjects, whereas it was reduced after sprint training in the other group. The changes in SLN with sprint training were inversely associated with the changes in gross efficiency (r=-0.59, P=0.016). No association was observed between aerobic or anaerobic performance and SLN expression. In conclusion, sarcolipin appears to play no role in regulating the fat mass of men. Sprint training reduces sarcolipin expression, which may improve muscle efficiency.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We studied the responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities, the soil's nutritional state and strawberry yield, when the soil was biofumigated each year for five consecutive years using fresh chicken manure (BioFum). BioFum significantly increased the soil's NH-N, NO-N, available P and K and organic matter. Fusarium spp. and Phytophthora spp. which are known to cause plant disease, were significantly decreased after BioFum. In addition, Biofum increased the soil's temperature, enhanced chlorophyll levels in the leaves of strawberry plants, and the soluble sugar and ascorbic acid content in strawberry fruit. We used high-throughput gene sequencing to monitor changes in the soil's bacterial and fungal communities. Although BioFum significantly decreased the diversity of these communities, it increased the relative abundance of some biological control agents in the phylum Actinobacteria and the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Chaetomium. An increase in these biological control agents would reduce the incidence of soil-borne pathogens and plant disease. Although strawberry marketable yield using BioFum was higher in the first three years, the decline in the final two years could be due to the accumulation of P and K which may have delayed flowering and fruiting. Methods to overcome yield losses using BioFum need to be developed in the future. Our research, however, showed that BioFum enhanced soil fertility, reduced the presence of soil pathogens, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and fungi and improved strawberry quality. Unlike chemical soil treatments that can cause pest and disease resistance when used continuously over many years, our multi-year research program on BioFum showed that this treatment provided significant benefits to the soil, plant and strawberry fruit.Copyright © 2019.

The role of the ligand→metal charge transfer, the equilibrium bond distance, the electronegativity of the donor atom, the ligand polarizability, and the relative stability of the complexes are discussed in detail. The interacting quantum atoms (IQA) method is used to decompose the binding  into electrostatic and quantum mechanical contributions. In addition, bond energies are also estimated by means of multipolar electrostatic calculations. No simple correlation exists between bond energies and structural/electronic descriptors unless the data are segregated by the type of ligand or metal. The electrostatic attraction of some molecules (H 2 O, NH 3 , CH 3 OH) towards the metal cations is well reproduced using their (unrelaxed) atomic multipoles, but the same comparison is much less satisfactory for other ligands ( e.g. , benzene, thiol/thiolate groups, etc.).

The intravitreous injection of VEGF antibodies has been reported to be an effective treatment to relieve symptoms of WAMD. However, the limitations of this treatment are high costs and invasiveness. For this reason, oral delivery route can be considered as a cost-effective way and the safest method to deliver drug molecules to the eyes. Accordingly, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was included in the oral formulation as the potential substance for the cure of WAMD in the animal model. Various pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects, have been reported for UDCA and recent reports support the effects of UDCA in ocular treatment. However, due to poor water solubility and low pKa (around 5.0), it has been challenging to formulate aqueous solution of UDCA in the neutral pH range. In the present study, we confirmed the aqueous solubility of the oral UDCA formulation and performed a preclinical study, including pharmacokinetic profiling and WAMD model efficacy study in mice after oral administration of the drug solution. The results demonstrated that the formulation improved bioavailability of UDCA and efficiently delivered UDCA to the eye tissues after oral absorption. UDCA formulation was found to have inhibitory effects of choroidal neovascularization with a functional recovery in mice retinas. Taken together, our results suggest that the oral UDCA formulation could be used as a potent supplement for the cure of WAMD and related retinal diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675560>Association of prenatal pesticide exposures with adverse pregnancy outcomes and stunting in rural Bangladesh.</a></h1><p>Pesticide exposure during pregnancy is thought to adversely affect fetal growth, which in turn may impact child growth, but results have been inconsistent across studies and few have explored these effects in developing countries.To quantify urinary concentrations of pesticide biomarkers in early pregnancy (<16 weeks' gestation), and to estimate the association of these concentrations with preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, and stunting at ~1 and 2 years of age.Eight pesticide biomarkers were quantified in urine collected from 289 pregnant women (aged 18-40 years) participating in a birth cohort study in Bangladesh. Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total  and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth weight compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or 2 years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this work, sulfate functionalized Ni(OH) 2 (SNO) nanoplates were in-situ grown on nickel foam (NF) via a green and facile one-step hydrothermal treatment of NF without need for external Ni source or surfactant addition. The resulting material showed 9.3 times higher areal capacity and 1.8 times higher rate capability than the sulfate-free control, and retained 81.3% capacity after 5000 cycles. When being used as the positive electrode in a hybrid supercapacitor, the SNO/NF//activated carbon system achieved >95% columbic efficiency, maximum  density of 3.59 W h m -2 and maximum power density of 44.63 W m -2 , outperforming most of the existing Ni-based supercapacitor. Detailed material characterization and density functional theory calculation revealed that the sulfate introduction expanded the layer spacing of Ni(OH) 2 and improved electrical conductivity and wettability to favor more efficient electrolyte diffusion, charge transfer and reactant adsorption. The high loading of reactive component and inherited porous structure also contributed to the superior capacitive performances of the SNO/NF electrodes. Therefore, the SNO/NF holds great potential for commercialized supercapacitor application.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Analytes were separated using an Zorbax Extend-Agilent C (1.8 μm, 4.6 × 30 mm) column following a simple methanol precipitation treatment. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and water containing 0.1% formic acid, and the total gradient program time was 1.5 min. Method validation results showed TH was linear in 2-500 ng/mL (r > 0.99), and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 2 μg/mL. The intra-run and inter-run precision (coefficient of variation, CV) was within 2.80%, and the accuracy (relative error, RE) was within ±11.10%. Stability of TH was evaluated in different storage conditions, including short-term I-III, long-term I-III, 2 and 4 h in the artificial gastrointestinal tract, respectively. There was no obvious interference between TH and internal standards (IS). With the established Caco-2 monolayer permeability model, Papp(AB) of TH was calculated as 46.29 ± 8.31 × 10 cm/s, and the efflux ratio (ER) value was calculated as 0.22, indicating a high permeability character of TH. The transmembrane transport of TH followed the concentration-dependent, temperature-independent, and -free manner. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that TH is a highly permeable drug and the transport mechanism is mainly via passive diffusion.Copyright © 2019.

Despite being one of the most studied coccinellid species, many aspects of its foraging behavior are still not completely understood. This study focuses on the diel foraging behavior of C. septempunctata, investigating their olfactory orientation towards aphid-infested plants, walking activity on plants and on the soil, and feeding rates. In the scotophase the ladybird beetles were significantly more attracted to the odor of aphid-infested plants, on which they also showed considerably higher walking activity then on uninfested controls. Females were more prone to utilize olfactory cues when searching for prey and fed at higher rates than males; this shows that they are better adapted to nocturnal activity, as they require higher food intake. Coccinella septempunctata have the same feeding rate during the scotophase as in the photophase. Our study shows that C. septempunctata has the potential to forage in the scotophase if prey is abundant. The results support the hypothesis that volatiles of aphid-infested plants can attract or arrest foraging adult ladybird beetles, even in the darkness, which makes a considerable contribution to efficient prey search and enhances feeding capacity.

However, there was only one study that catalyzes the producing of hydrogen via the methanolysis of MeAB, and it was carried out by our research group. For this reason, in this work, a new catalyst system entitled by single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) supported bimetallic platinum-ruthenium nanoparticles were developed and called as PtRu@SWCNT. These NPs were characterized by several techniques (XRD, XPS, Raman, and TEM), and they were performed for the methanolysis of MeAB with high catalytic activity. The prepared PtRu@SWCNT NPs were also tested in the methanolysis of MeAB at different parameters including different temperatures, catalyst and substrate concentrations, and reusability performance. Experimental results revealed that the new PtRu@SWCNT NPs had excellent catalytic activity and reusability for removing of hydrogen from the methanolysis of MeAB at ambient conditions. According to the obtained data, the turnover frequency is 136.25 mole H/mole PtRu × min, and the activation  (Ea) is 17.29 kJ/mole. More than 99% of conversion was observed at room temperature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672379>The study of laser cooling of TeH anion in theoretical approach.</a></h1><p>The probabilities of laser cooling of TeH anion via a spin-forbidden transition and a three-electronic-level transition are proposed. The potential  curves of the XΣ, a∏, A∏, and bΣ electronic states of tellurium monohydride anion (TeH) are calculated using multi-reference configuration interaction method. Davidson corrections, core-valence correlations and spin-orbit coupling effects are also considered. The AWCV5Z-PP pseudopotential basis set of Te atom is used. Spectroscopic parameters of the Λ-S and Ω states are obtained by solving radial Schrodinger equation. These results are reported at the first time. Permanent dipole moments of the Ω states and transition dipole moments of the a1↔X0 and A1↔X0 transitions are also calculated. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors of the a1↔X0 and A1↔X0 transitions are obtained, the value of f is 0.9970 and 0.9980, respectively. Spontaneous radiative lifetimes of the a1 and A1 excited states are predicted. i.e. τ(a1) = 200.3 ns and τ(A1) = 84.3 ns. Only the main pump laser is required to driving a1↔X0 and A1↔X0 transitions. The laser wavelengths both are in the visible region. Doppler temperatures and recoil temperatures of laser cooling TeH anion are also predicted.Copyright © 2019.

The Er- or Ho-doped fluoride gain fibers generally used in these lasers have strong anomalous dispersion at ∼3 µm, which generally forces them to operate in the soliton regime. Here we report that a pulse- clamping effect, caused by the buildup of intracavity nonlinearities, limits the shortest obtainable pulse durations in these mid-infrared soliton fiber lasers. Excessive intra-cavity  results in soliton instability, collapse and fragmentation into a variety of stable multi-pulse states, including phase-locked soliton molecules and harmonically mode-locked states. We report that the spectral evolution of the mid-IR laser pulses can be recorded between roundtrips through stretching their second-harmonic signal in a 25-km-length of single-mode fiber. Using a modified dispersive Fourier transform set-up, we were able to perform for the first time spectro-temporal measurements of mid-IR laser pulses both in the pulsed state and during pulse collapse and fragmentation. The results provide insight into the complex nonlinear dynamics of mid-IR soliton fiber lasers and open up new opportunities for obtaining a variety of stable multi-pulse mode-locked states at mid-IR wavelengths.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675628>Constructing multilayered neural networks with sparse, data-driven connectivity using biologically-inspired, complementary, homeostatic mechanisms.</a></h1><p>The immense complexity of the brain requires that it be built and controlled by intrinsic, self-regulating mechanisms. One such mechanism, the formation of new connections via synaptogenesis, plays a central role in neuronal connectivity and, ultimately, performance. Adaptive synaptogenesis networks combine synaptogenesis, associative synaptic modification, and synaptic shedding to construct sparse networks. Here, inspired by neuroscientific observations, novel aspects of brain development are incorporated into adaptive synaptogenesis. The extensions include: (i) multiple layers, (ii) neuron survival and death based on information transmission, and (iii) bigrade growth factor signaling to control the onset of synaptogenesis in succeeding layers and to control neuron survival and death in preceding layers. Also guiding this research is the assumption that brains must achieve a compromise between good performance and low  expenditures. Simulations of the network model demonstrate the parametric and functional control of both performance and  expenditures, where performance is measured in terms of information loss and classification errors, and  expenditures are assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of the number of neurons. Major insights from this study include (a) the key role a neural layer between two other layers has in controlling synaptogenesis and neuron elimination, (b) the performance and -savings benefits of delaying the onset of synaptogenesis in a succeeding layer, and (c) how the elimination of neurons in a preceding layer provides  savings, code compression, and can be accomplished without significantly degrading information transfer or classification performance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Strategies on how to identify individuals at high fracture risk and target them for treatment have lagged far behind other developments in the osteoporosis field. Most osteoporosis quality improvement strategies have focused on patients with recent or prior fracture (secondary prevention), with limited attention to individuals without prior fracture. For populations without prior fracture, the only quality improvement strategy for which meta-analysis demonstrated significant improvement in osteoporosis care was patient self-scheduling of DXA plus education Much more work is needed to develop and validate effective primary screening and prevention strategies and translate these into high-quality guidelines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675563>Combining species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model and thermodynamic index (exergy) for system-level ecological risk assessment of contaminates in aquatic ecosystems.</a></h1><p>After reviewing the species- and community-level ecological risk assessments (ERAs) of chemicals in the aquatic environment, the present study attempted to propose a third stage of ERA, i.e., the ecosystem-level ERA. Based on the species sensitivity distribution model (SSD) and thermodynamic theory, the exergy and biomass indicators of communities from various trophic levels (TLs) were introduced to improve ecological connotation of SSDs. The species were classified into three TLs based on algae (TL1), invertebrates (TL2), and vertebrates (TL3), and the weight of each TL was determined based on relative biomass and β value, which indicated a holistic contribution of each species or community to the ecosystem. Then, a system-level ERA protocol was successfully established, and the community- and system-level ecological risks of 10 typical toxic micro-organic pollutants in the western area of Lake Chaohu and its inflowing rivers were evaluated. System-level ERA curves (ExSSD) were mainly affected by the community-level SSD at TL2 for most chemicals in the present study. The uncertain boundary of ExSSD was mostly related to TLs with a wider uncertain boundary, but had little relation to the weight of each TL. The results of system-level ERAs revealed that dibutyl phthalate had the highest eco-risk, whereas γ-hexachlorocyclohexane presented the lowest eco-risk. Results of the system-level ERA were not fully consistent with the those of community-level ERA owing to the lack of a sufficient dataset, SSD model type, and ecosystem structure, as indicated by the weight of each TL. The successful application of ExSSD in Lake Chaohu signifies the start of the third stage of ERA at the system-level, and it also provides a scientific basis for ecosystem-level ERA, aquatic ecosystem protection, and future water safety management. However, there were some limitations, including sufficient data dependence, neglect of ecological interactions, and neglect of environmental parameters such as natural organic matter. We propose to employ toxicogenomics to enrich the toxicity database, to simulate the interaction using the ecological dynamic model, and to introduce the chemical fate model into the system-level ERA.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Pathways and associated probable health risk were appraised by employing multivariate statistical approaches, health risk model and Monte-Carlo simulation. Except for the Cu, Cr and Zn concentrations, the mean concentrations of all TMs in the basin were above the permissible water quality limits set by Bangladesh and international standards. Correlation coefficient and principal component analysis, supported by cluster analysis indicated that anthropogenic inputs were more contributed to the elevated concentrations of TMs compared to geogenic sources as the major reasons of groundwater pollution in the basin. The results of non-carcinogenic risk appraisal depicted that hazard index (HI) values for both adults and children were exceeded the safe limits (>1.0) except for few locations, indicating serious health risks on the human via oral and dermal absorption pathways. However, the carcinogenic risk values of Cd and Cr exceeded the US EPA range of 1 × 10 to 1 × 10, with higher risk for children than adults, with oral intake as the key exposure pathway. A sensitivity study identified the concentration of Cr, exposure frequency and ingestion rate for carcinogenic effect as the most sensitive parameters influencing the probable health risk. Overall, the results suggest that Cr in drinking water could cause detrimental effects to exposed local residents; thus, strict health regulation and groundwater management should concentrate on Cr contamination in groundwater from the coal basin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although such fatigue can be controlled in other contexts, on surfaces, the photochromic compounds are held in close proximity to each other and relatively few molecules modulate the properties of a device, leading to a loss of functionality after only a few switching cycles. The switching process was characterized by photoelectron spectroscopy and differences in tunneling currents in the spiropyran and merocyanine forms using eutectic Ga-In. Self-assembled monolayers comprising only the photochromic compounds degraded rapidly, while mixed monolayers with hexanethiol showed different behaviors depending on the relative humidity. Under dry conditions, no chemical degradation was observed and the switching process was reversible over at least 100 cycles. Under humid conditions, no degradation occurred, but the switching process became irreversible. The absence of degradation observed in mixed monolayers is ascribed to the lack of solvation, which increases the barrier to a key bond rotation past the available thermal . These results highlight important differences in the contexts in which photochromic compounds are utilized and demonstrate that they can be leveraged to extract device-relevant functionality from surface-bound switches by suppressing fatigue and irreversibility.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p></html>
