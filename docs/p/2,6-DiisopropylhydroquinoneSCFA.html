The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial barrier integrity and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with 5, 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; () abundance of short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of  receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511468>Effect of Storage Condition on Oil Oxidation of Flat-European Hybrid Hazelnut.</a></h1><p>In order to study the oxidative stability of hazelnut oil stored at room temperature, hazelnut oil accelerated oxidized at 62°C was used to determine peroxide value (POV), p-anisidine value (p-AV), total oxidation value (TOTOX), the content of   and  oxidative products. The correlation between the content of   or  oxidative products and three peroxidation indexes was analyzed. The results showed that the relative content of linoleic acid in hazelnut oil decreased significantly at the duration of accelerated oxidation (p < 0.05), which was in line with the zero-order oxidation kinetics model. The absolute content of four   all accorded with the zero-order oxidation kinetics model. Both relative and absolute content of linoleic acid can set up a slightly negative linear correlation with POV, p-AV and TOTOX, respectively (p < 0.05). The oxidation of unsaturated   in hazelnut oil produced a variety of  oxidation products, among which hexanal, -octenal, -decenal and 3-octene--one could establish a significantly positive correlation with POV, p-AV and TOTOX at a certain period of time, which could be used as a new index to evaluate the oxidative decomposition of unsaturated   in hazelnut oil during storage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259677> sp. nov., isolated from the gut microflora of sea bass ( L.) and emended description of the genus .</a></h1><p>A Gram-stain-negative, non-flagellated, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive bacterial strain, designated YLY08, was isolated from the gut microflora of sea bass ( L.) collected from the coast of Yuanyao Wharf, Weihai, PR China, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain YLY08 grew optimally at 28-30 °C, at pH 7.0-7.5 and in the presence of .0-3.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Poly--hydroxybutyrate granules were produced. Neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YLY08 clustered with the type strain of , with which it exhibited 95.3 % sequence similarity, while the similarity to other genera was below 95.0 %. Genomic analyses, including average nucleotide identity and the digital DNA-DNA hybridization, clearly separated YLY08 from  MCCC 1A11863 with values below the thresholds for species delineation. The major cellular  acid was summed feature 8 (Cω7 and/or Cω6). The sole respiratory quinone detected was Q-10. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified phospholipid. The genome of strain YLY08, with 38 assembled contigs, was 3.9 Mb long with a G+C content of 59.0 mol%. The results of the phenotypical, phylogenetic and biochemical analyses between the strain YLY08 and the related type strain indicated that this strain represents a novel species in genus  within the family , for which the name  sp. nov. is proposed.

Treatments were arranged in a  ×  factorial design with  dietary energy levels [high net energy for lactation (NE) = 1.53 Mcal/kg of DM vs. low NE = 1.37 Mcal/kg of DM; HE vs. LE) fed either with rumen-protected lysine (bypass lysine; 40 g/cow per day) or without rumen-protected lysine (control). Sixty-eight third-lactation Holstein dairy cows entering their fourth lactation were randomly allocated to 4 treatments groups: HE with bypass lysine, HE without bypass lysine, LE with bypass lysine, and LE without bypass lysine. Groups were balanced based upon their expected calving date, previous milk yields, and body condition score. All cows were fed the same diet (NE = 1.34 Mcal/kg of DM) during the dry period prior to the trial. Rumen-protected lysine was top-dressed on a total mixed ration to deliver 9.68 g/d of metabolizable lysine to pre- and postpartum cows. After calving, all cows received the same TMR (1.69 Mcal/kg of DM). Blood samples were collected at -21, -14, -7, 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to calving, and free   and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were measured. Amount of feed offered and orts were collected and measured for individual cows 4 d/wk. Milk samples were collected once per week following calving, and milk composition was analyzed. Feeding high NE to close-up cows decreased the concentrations of free  acid and β-hydroxybutyrate in prepartum cows but not in postpartum cows. Addition of rumen-protected lysine increased postpartum DM intake, and decreased serum free  acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. Neither energy nor rumen-protected lysine supplementation nor their interaction affected milk yield or fat or lactose yields. However, cows in the group receiving HE with bypass lysine tended to produce more milk compared with other groups and had a lower blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentration postpartum. These results indicate that feeding a high-energy diet together with rumen-protected lysine improved DM intake and lowered serum free  acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in transition cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal microbiota of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection, microbiome studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3.5.). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular  (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001). Despite performing consecutive repetitions, the factor experimental replication contributed more to the differences of microbial composition in comparison to the factor age at infection.Copyright © 2019 Hankel, Jung, Kuder, Keller, Keller, Galvez, Strowig and Visscher.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376656>Liupao tea extract alleviates diabetes mellitus and modulates gut microbiota in rats induced by streptozotocin and high-fat, high-sugar diet.</a></h1><p>Liupao tea, a popular dark tea, exhibited anti-diabetic activity in Chinese tea culture. However, the bioavailability of the main active components is low. Therefore, the relationship between the anti-diabetic activity and the modulation of gut microbiota was investigated in this study for the first time. Liupao tea extract (LTE) could significantly alleviate hyperglycemia, insulin-resistance, and plasma lipid profiles. The hypoglycemic effect of high-dose LTE was comparable to that of metformin. Importantly, LTE exhibited beneficial effect on modulating the diabetic-induced disorder of gut microbiota, such as increasing Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and up-regulating putative short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria, including Prevotella and Bacteroides. Moreover, 29 key phylotypes were significantly correlated with at least one diabetic index. In conclusion, LTE could be developed into an anti-diabetic functional beverage and its beneficial effects is likely to be associated with the prebiotic effects for increasing the level of SCFAs and the relative abundance of -producing bacteria.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Their living and excursion depths were 55-134 metres underwater with a saturation duration of 12-31 days and PaO of 38-65 kPa. The faecal samples were examined through 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing based on the Illumina sequencing platform to analyse changes in the bacteria composition in the divers' guts.Although the α and β diversity of the gut microbiota did not change significantly, we found that living in a hyperbaric environment of helium-oxygen saturation decreased the abundance of the genus , an obligate anaerobe, from .43%±3.83% at T1 to 0.79%±1.23% at T2 and 0.59%±0.79% at T3. Additionally, the abundance of some short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria, such as , rectale group and , showed a decreased trend in the order of before, during and after diving. On the contrary, the abundance of species, such as , , , , ,  and , showed an increasing trend, but most of them were pathogens.Occupational exposure to high pressure in a helium-oxygen saturation environment decreased the abundance of  and some -producing bacteria, and increased the risk of pathogenic bacterial infection. Supplementation of the diver diet with probiotics or prebiotics during saturation diving might prevent these undesirable changes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Some non-Saccharomyces species have been described as part of the fermentative microbiota, specially found in the initial steps of wine fermentations. These species may play roles from wine spoilage to flavor quality enhancement. From a large number of wine fermentations (429 wine samples), analyzed by ITS-amplicon sequencing to define their mycobiome,  non-conventional yeast species (Nakazawaea ishiwadae and Lodderomyces elongisporus) were detected, in a very limited number of samples but in significant levels of relative abundance. One strain of each species was isolated and their technological and enological potential have been characterized in this work. Compared with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Viniferm Revelacion wine strain, the studied N. ishiwadae BMK17.1 and L. elongisporus BMK12.5 strains showed, as expected, a lower tolerance and growth fitness in high ethanol concentrations. However, N. ishiwadae BMK17.1 was able to grow also at 15% ethanol and L. elongisporus BMK12.5 at 10% reaching, in the latter case, slightly higher efficiency rates than S. cerevisiae at this level. Contrary to most non-Saccharomyces yeasts, these species were able to growth in presence of high doses of potassium-metabisulfite, reaching in both cases higher efficiency rates than S. cerevisiae. A notable affinity of L. elongisporus BMK12.5 for high pH values was clearly observed. Their fermentation kinetics and the final chemical-analytical characterization were studied in micro-fermentation assays, using synthetic grape must. L. elongisporus BMK12.5 was able to complete, in single inoculation, the sugar fermentation after 19 days, but, N. ishiwadae BMK17.1 left about 80 g/L sugars at this time. Co-inoculation assays (in a 1:100 proportion of S. cerevisiae:non-Saccharomyces strains) finished sugar consumption with similar kinetics than the S. cerevisiae single inoculation, in the case of L. elongisporus BMK12.5 co-inoculation, and with lower kinetics when using N. ishiwadae BMK17.1. A remarkable malic acid consumption and a low acetic acid production was associated with L. elongisporus BMK12.5 fermentations, together with a high production of 3-methyl-1-butanol and -phenylethanol, and the release of high amounts of proteins into the wines. N. ishiwadae BMK17.1, although unable to finish the fermentation itself, showed a high production of oligosaccharides and  compounds such as isobutanol or isobutyric acid. This work reports, for the first time, the occurrence and enological potential of two strains pertaining to the non-conventional yeast genera Lodderomyces and Nakazawaea.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One of the problems is that for the polar probe molecules of dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, and ethanol, the molecular area of each probe has different values in literature. In this paper, we point out the incorrect molecular area values presented in the literature by comparing these values with those indicated in Smallwood's Handbook of Organic Solvent Properties. The correct molecular area values of 11 polar probes are determined by plotting the molecular areas of the polar probes versus the van der Waals surface areas reported in the handbook. The correct molecular areas for six common polar probes, namely, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran, are 38.0, 44.0, 42.5, 48.0, 47.0, and 45.0 Å, respectively. Benzene is a specific molecule with a conjugated π-bond structure, and its molecular area is estimated to be larger than that of other molecules. Therefore, benzene is unsuitable for use as a probe molecule.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results revealed that a higher MgCl concentration inhibited acidogenesis, while the purity of  (VFAs) improved and the maximum percentage of VFAs accounted for 52.92% (w/w) of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) at 120 mmol/L Mg. A phosphate removal efficiency of 81.22% was obtained at 15 mmol/L MgCl concentration, while only a 14.77% increase was observed when further MgCl was added (120 mmol/L MgCl). Capillary suction time (CST) values decreased sharply from 4410.20 s to 207.30 s with the increase of MgCl. A similar trend was observed in bound water and the minimum value was 85.56 ± 0.06%. The distribution of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and rheological profiles of the fermented sludge were also analyzed and the results confirmed that a high MgCl concentration had a positive effect on sludge dewatering.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We used leaves and pods from A. nilotica alone and combined. The combination of HT from A. nilotica leaves and pods and condensed tannins (CT) from Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala were also evaluated to assess potential differences in biological activity between HT and CT. Four series of 24-h incubations were performed using rumen contents of 4 sheep fed a tropical grass (natural grassland based on Dichanthium spp.). A first experiment tested different levels of replacement of this tropical forage (control [CTL] without tannins) by A. nilotica leaves or pods: 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 and 100:0. A second experiment tested the mixture of A. nilotica leaves and pods in different proportions: 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. A third experiment tested the 50:50 combination of A. nilotica leaves or pods with C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala. Acacia nilotica pods and leaves had a high content of HT (350 and 178 g/kg DM, respectively), whereas C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala had a high content of CT (361 and 180 g/kg DM, respectively). The inclusion of HT from A. nilotica leaves and pods decreased CH4 production dose-dependently (P < 0.01). Total replacement of the CTL by A. nilotica decreased CH4 production by 64 and 55% with leaves and pods, respectively. Pods were richer in HT than leaves, but their antimethanogenic effect did not differ (P > 0.05). Although A. nilotica leaves and pods inhibited fermentation, as indicated by the lower gas production and VFA production (P < 0.01), this effect was less pronounced than for CH4.   acid production decreased by 12% in leaves and by 30% in pods when compared with the CTL alone. Positive associative effect was reported for VFA, when HT-rich sources and CT-rich sources were mixed. Combining the  sources of HT did not show associative effects on fermentation or CH4 production (P > 0.05). Hydrolyzable tannin-rich sources were more effective in suppressing methanogenesis than CT-rich sources. Our results show that HT-rich A. nilotica leaves and pods have the potential to reduce ruminal CH4 production.© The Author(s) 2019.

The control group (CG) was fed with a conventional complete diet, while the experimental group (ZG) received a daily zinc supplementation of 60 mg for kg of dry complete feed. During the experimental period, the milk yield was monitored and samples of milk and caciocavallo cheese were collected and analyzed for chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile.The enrichment of dairy cows diet with zinc, did not influence milk yield and composition, however a marked reduction of somatic cell count (SSC) was evidenced. Both in milk and cheese the ZG samples were characterized by a lower concentration of satured   (SFA) and an increase in oleic, vaccenic and rumenic . The aromatic profile of dairy products was also positively affected by dietary zinc intake, with an increase in concentration of carboxylic , esters and lactones.The present results suggest a positive role of dietary zinc intake in improving the quality of bovine milk and related cheese, in particular for the increase in concentration of bioactive   such as rumenic acid. The changes evidenced in cheese through the analysis of the  profile, would be consistent with the development of interesting organoleptic properties, although further evaluations should be performed to confirm the consumer acceptability of these changes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31272803>Biochar enabled syntrophic action: Solid state anaerobic digestion of agricultural stubble for enhanced methane production.</a></h1><p>In this study, effect of hardwood biochar on solid state anaerobic digestion of wheat straw has been investigated. The concentration of biochar was 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 g/L and added in inoculum along with wheat straw for anaerobic action. Results showed that 10 g/L of hardwood biochar led to -fold increment in methane yield (223 L/kg VS) compared to the control (110 L/kg VS). However, increasing the concentration of hardwood biochar did not help in significant increase in methane yield and raised pH and alkalinity up to 8.3 and 24.3 g/L respectively. Principal component analysis showed that methane yield is positively correlated with  solid reduction while biochar loading is directly correlated with pH as well as alkalinity and inversely correlated with total   acid. This study revealed that biochar may help to maintain syntrophy in the anaerobic reactor and enhance methane yield significantly.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The environment of fermented doughs can be hostile for microbial survival due to high levels of microbial metabolites such as weak carboxylic organic  and ethanol. In order to get a better understanding of the intrinsic factors affecting the microbial successions of yeasts during dough fermentation, survival and physiological responses of the yeasts associated with West African fermented cereal doughs were investigated at exposure to relevant concentrations of microbial inhibitory compounds. Three strains each of the predominant species, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Pichia kudriavzevii as well as the opportunistic pathogen Candida glabrata were studied. The strains were exposed to individual stress factors of cereal doughs, i.e. (i) pH 3.4, (ii) 3% (v/v) ethanol (EtOH), (iii) 285 mM lactic acid (LA) and (iv) 150 mM acetic acid (AA) as well as to combinations of these stress factors, i.e. (v) (LA + AA)  and (vi) (LA + AA+EtOH) . Growth and single cell viability were studied by flow cytometry using combined SYTO 13 and propidium iodide (PI) staining. Intracellular pH (pH), plasma membrane integrity and micro-colony development of stressed cells were studied by fluorescence microscopy using PI and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-se). Viability of the yeast strains was not affected by pH 3.4 and 3% (v/v) ethanol (EtOH). 285 mM lactic acid (LA) reduced the specific growth rate (μ) from 0.27-0.41 h to 0.11-0.26 h and the viability from 100% to .6-41.7% at 72 h of exposure in most yeast strains, except for two strains of C. glabrata. 150 mM acetic acid (AA) as well as the combinations (LA + AA)  and (LA + AA+EtOH)  reduced μ to 0.0 h and induced significant cell death for all the yeast strains. Exposed to (LA + AA+EtOH) , the most resistant yeast strains belonged to S. cerevisiae followed by P. kudriavzevii, whereas C. glabrata and K. marxianus were more sensitive. Strain variations were observed within all four species. When transferred to non-stress conditions, i.e. MYGP, pH 5.6, after exposure to (LA + AA+EtOH)  for 6 h, 45% of the single cells of the most resistant S. cerevisiae strain kept their plasma membrane integrity, recovered their pH to near physiological range (pH = 6.1-7.4) and resumed proliferation after 3-24 h of lag phase. The results obtained are valuable in order to change processing conditions of the dough to favor the survival of preferable yeast species, i.e. S. cerevisiae and K. marxianus and inhibit opportunistic pathogen yeast species as C. glabrata.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, pigs in a natural setting are manipulating fibre-rich plant material from a young age. Moreover, dietary fibre affects gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development and health in older pigs. We hypothesised that supplemental diets that contain vegetal fibres are accelerating GIT development in suckling piglets in terms of size and functionality. From d  of life, sow-suckled piglets had access to a low fibre diet (CON), a diet with a fermentable long-chain arabinoxylan (lc-AXOS), a diet with a largely non-fermentable purified cellulose (CELL), or a diet containing both fibres. During the initial  weeks, the control diet was a high-density milk replacer, followed by a dry and highly digestible creep meal. Upon weaning at 25 d, 15 piglets from each treatment group, identified as eaters and originating from six or seven litters, were sacrificed for post-mortem examination of GIT morphology, small intestinal permeability and metabolic profile of the digesta. The microbiota composition of the mid-colon was evaluated in a sub-set of ten piglets.No major statistical interactions between the fibre sources were observed. Piglets consumed the fibre-containing milk supplements and creep diets well. Stomach size and small intestinal permeability was not affected. Large intestinal fill was increased with lc-AXOS only, while relative large intestinal weight was increased with both fibre sources ( < 0.050). Also, CELL decreased ileal pH and tended to increase ileal DM content compared to CON ( < 0.050). Moreover, the concentration of  was increased in the caecum ( < 0.100) and mid-colon ( < 0.050) by addition of CELL. lc-AXOS only stimulated caecal propionate ( < 0.050). The microbiota composition showed a high individual variation and limited dietary impact. Nonetheless, CELL induced minor shifts in specific genera, with notable reductions of -.Adding dietary fibres to the supplemental diet of suckling piglets altered large intestinal morphology but not small intestinal permeability. Moreover, dietary fibre showed effects on fermentation and modest changes of microbial populations in the hindgut, with more prominent effects from the low-fermentable cellulose.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147381>Donor metabolic characteristics drive effects of faecal microbiota transplantation on recipient insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure and intestinal transit time.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism. Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and  weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain   () and bile , and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal , bile , glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity  weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile  (increased lithocholic, deoxycholic and (iso)lithocholic acid after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand  (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Rats were pretreated with either 5% GOS, MOS, or FOS or vehicle (water) from day -12 to day 0. On day 0, rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of saline or 5FU. Metabolic data were recorded daily and all rats were killed on day 3. Histopathology was quantified in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Intestinal sucrase and myeloperoxidase activity were quantified by biochemical assay. Fecal SCFAs-acetic, propionic, and butyric acid-were also measured. Statistical analysis was by repeated-measures, -factor ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Body weight was significantly decreased in all treatment groups after 5FU injection, with no change in body weight observed in any prebiotic treatment group. Total food intake was lower by ≥7% in the GOS treatment group pre-5FU than in all other groups (P < 0.05). Ileal villus height was 18% higher in GOS-treated rats pre-5FU than in respective water controls (P < 0.05). Jejunal and ileal villus height and crypt depth were significantly decreased in all treatment groups after 5FU injection, with no prebiotic effect observed. SCFAs were differentially increased in prebiotic treatment groups compared with water-only controls (P < 0.05).FOS, GOS, and MOS have differential effects in modifying small intestinal pathology and  profiles in rats with healthy and damaged small intestinal mucosa.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602647>The composition and oxidative stability of vegetarian omega-3 algal oil nanoemulsions suitable for functional food enrichment.</a></h1><p>Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated  acid (LCn3PUFA) nanoemulsion enriched foods offer potential to address habitually low oily fish intakes. Nanoemulsions increase LCn3PUFA bioavailability, but may cause lipid oxidation. This study examined oxidative stability of LCn3PUFA algal oil-in-water nanoemulsions created by ultrasound using natural and synthetic emulsifiers during 5-weeks of storage at 4, 20 and 40°C.  acid composition, droplet size ranges and  compounds were analysed.No significant differences were found for  acid composition at various temperatures and storage times. Lecithin nanoemulsions had significantly larger droplet size ranges at baseline and during storage regardless of temperatures. While combined Tween 40 and lecithin nanoemulsions had low initial droplet size ranges, there were significant increases at 40°C after 5-weeks storage. Gas chromatograms identified hexanal and propanal as predominant  compounds, along with -ethylfuran; propan-3-ol; valeraldehyde. The Tween 40 only nanoemulsion sample showed formation of lower concentrations of volatiles compared to lecithin samples. Formation of hexanal and propanal remained stable at lower temperatures although higher concentrations were found in nanoemulsions than bulk oil. The lecithin only sample had formation of higher concentrations of volatiles at increased temperatures despite having significantly larger droplet size ranges than the other samples.Propanal and hexanal were the most prevalent of five  compounds detected in bulk oil and lecithin and/or Tween 40 nanoemulsions. Oxidation compounds remained more stable at lower temperatures indicating suitability for enrichment of refrigerated foods. Further research to evaluate the oxidation stability of these systems within food matrixes is warranted. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of L. plantarum MTD1, a commercial probiotic, when co-administered with waste molasses (WM), on the silage quality, rumen  and greenhouse gas (GHG) production of rice straw. Rice straw was ensiled with no additive (Control), 10 cfu/g L. plantarum (L), L + %WM, L + 3%WM and L + 4%WM for 3, 6, 9, 15, 30 and 60 days. The rumen  and gas production kinetics were determined using in vitro incubation technology. All additives, especially L + 4%WM, improved the silage quality of rice straw, indicated by higher lactic acid and nonstructural carbohydrate content, lower pH, butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen content (P < 0.05). A simple linear regression showed that the ruminal propionic concentration increased (linear, P < 0.0001) and the ratio of acetic to propionic acid decreased (linear, P = 0.0002) as a function of WM dose. The 60-day ensilage could decrease ruminal total gas production by 13.51-31.29% as compared to the untreated rice straw. Wherein L had no effect on the mitigation of CH but decreased the CO production, and further WM inclusion decreased the CH production with a dose effect. If the better silage quality and lower ruminal GHG production observed in the study are confirmed in practice, applying L + 4%WM may provide an insight for straw waste management while reducing pollution input into the atmosphere system. This in vitro study can be valuable for screening and informing on the suitability of these fermentation modifiers for further evaluation in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of AMPs on ameliorating rumen fermentation function and rumen microorganisms in goats. Eighteen 4-month-old Chuanzhong black goats were used in a 60-day experiment (6 goats per group). Group I was used as the control and was fed a basal diet, the group II were fed the basal diet supplemented with  g of AMPs [per goat/day] and group III were fed the basal diet supplemented 3 g of AMPs [per goat/day], respectively. Rumen fluid samples were collected at 0, 20 and 60 days. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes and ciliate protozoal 18S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from rumen samples. The amplicons were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Rumen fermentation parameters and digestive enzyme activities were also examined. Our results showed that dietary supplementation with AMPs increased the levels of the bacterial genera Fibrobacter, Anaerovibrio and Succiniclasticum and also increased the ciliates genus Ophryoscolex, but reduced the levels of the bacterial genera Selenomonas, Succinivibrio and Treponema, and the ciliate genera Polyplastron, Entodinium, Enoploplastron and Isotricha. Supplementation with AMPs increased the activities of xylanase, pectinase and lipase in the rumen, and also increased the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and total . These changes were associated with improved growth performance in the goats. The results revealed that the goats fed AMPs showed improved rumen microbiota structures, altered ruminal fermentation, and improved efficiency regarding the utilization of feed; thereby indicating that AMPs can improve growth performance. AMPs are therefore suitable as feed additives in juvenile goats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610486>Effect of low severity hydrothermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion performance of corn stover.</a></h1><p>The anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of corn stover was investigated under low hydrothermal pretreatment (HP) severity. Pretreated corn stover, with and without ammonia was examined at the three temperatures (50, 70, and 90 °C) coupled with different pretreatment time (24-72 h). The results showed that the pH value decreased with increasing pretreatment time for the same temperature. The highest  (VFAs) concentration (4616.23 mg/L) was achieved at a HP severity of 4.56. The highest removal rate of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were 19.62%, 25.53%, and 32.91% for HP with ammonia (HPA) severities of 3.34, 3.34, and HP severity of 4.35, respectively. The maximum methane yield of corn stover was 148.19 mL/g∙VS under 50 °C held for 24 h (HPA severity of .59), which was 31.35% higher than that of the untreated corn stover. The research results suggest that properly pretreatment severity can play an important role in promoting methane production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Adults were included if newly admitted to the ICU and could receive oral nutrition, enteral feedings, or no nutrition. Rectal swabs were performed at admission and 72 hours later. The primary exposure was fiber intake over 72 hours, classified in tertiles and adjusted for energy intake. The primary outcome was the relative abundance (RA) of  producers via 16S RNA sequencing and the tolerability of fiber.In 129 patients, median fiber intake was 13.4 g (interquartile range 0-35.4 g) over 72 hours. The high-fiber group had less abdominal distension (11% high fiber vs 28% no fiber, P < .01) and no increase in diarrhea (15% high fiber vs 13% no fiber, P = .94) or other adverse events.

But until now, the performances and mechanisms of the co-pretreatment for SCFAs production are unknown. This research aimed to investigate the AF mechanisms through studying its influence on sludge solubilization and related bioprocesses. WAS was pretreated for 48 h with FNA (1.07 mg N/L), freezing (-5 °C) and combination of FNA and freezing (0.53-.13 mg N/L FNA at -5 °C), respectively, then conducted batch AF. Experimental results indicated that the optimal total SCFAs yield of 391.19 ± 5.54 mg COD/g VSS was achieved after 1.07 mg N/L FNA + freezing pretreatment at 9 days of AF, which was ., 1.6 and 1.3-fold of the blank, freezing and FNA pretreated samples, respectively. The mechanisms analysis showed that co-pretreatment showed synergetic effects on sludge disintegration and solubilization, which could release more soluble substrates for SCFAs production. The co-pretreatment resulted in slight inhibition to hydrolysis and negligible inhibition to acidogenesis but severe inhibition to methanogenesis, maybe due to less endurance of methanogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain   (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of -synthetic key enzymes such as acetate kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein- (UCP-) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation.

Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased liver triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain  .

These criteria were obtained from the quantitative model of Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 9634 (as a model food contaminant) competition in co-culture fermentation. The model is based on the hypothesis that probiotics can reduce the specific growth rate of non-probiotics by producing short-chain  . To define the relationship between the specific growth rate of non-probiotics and short-chain  acid yields, the inhibition constants were determined separately for each inhibitor produced by bifidobacteria (lactic, acetic and propionic ) in a pure culture of bacilli. Two different equations based on the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) and inhibition constant (K) were used to connect the specific growth rate and concentrations of inhibitors. The yields of the inhibitors mentioned above were obtained from co-culture experiments. The experimental values and the values predicted by the model of Bacillus count did not differ significantly (R not less than 0.83) in the competition experiments. Therefore, the general criterion of the synbiotic effect was derived from the model and presents the coefficient of non-probiotic specific growth rate reduction as a result of probiotic growth and inhibitor formation in the final co-culture fermentation. This criterion has been examined for different commercial prebiotics coupled with the Bifidobacterium adolescentis strain. The synergistic combination of inulin GR with bifidobacteria had the best effect against Bacillus cereus ATCC 9634.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243601>Budesonide-Loaded Eudragit S 100 Nanocapsules for the Treatment of Acetic Acid-Induced Colitis in Animal Model.</a></h1><p>Nanoparticles for colon-drug delivery were designed and evaluated to solve many discrepancy issues as insufficient drug amount at diseased regions, high adverse effects of released drugs, and unintentionally premature drug release to noninflamed gastrointestinal regions.

Nanocapsules were prepared efficiently by nanoprecipitation technique and composed mainly of the pH-sensitive Eudragit S 100 polymeric coat with a semisynthetic Capryol 90 oily core. Full 3 ×  factorial design was applied to obtain optimized nanocapsules. Optimal nanocapsules showed mean particle size of 171 nm with lower polydispersity index indicating the production of monodispersed system and negative zeta-potential of - 37.6 mV. Optimized nanocapsules showed high encapsulation efficiency of 83.4% with lower initial rapid release of 10% for first  h and higher rapid cumulative release of 72% after 6 h.

Pollution of the water environment may cause contamination in the fish body and the smell of freshwater fish is heavy and unacceptable. This study focuses on the odor of American silver carp to provide a foundation for later deodorization to increase utilization of the American silver carp.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544530>The effects of age and dietary resistant starch on digestibility, fermentation end products in faeces and postprandial glucose and insulin responses of dogs.</a></h1><p>The same food formulation processed to obtain two different starch gelatinisations (SG) and resistant starch (RS) contents was evaluated in old and adult dogs, regarding apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients, fermentation products in faeces, and postprandial glucose and insulin responses. A diet with corn was ground and extruded in two different ways, obtaining Low RS (. g/kg DM; 99.9% of SG) and High RS (15.3 g/kg DM; 62.6% of SG). Each diet was fed to adults (4.0 ± 0.7 years) or old beagle dogs (11.5 ± 0.4 years) in a  (ages) x  (RS amounts) factorial arrangement with 8 dogs per food. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance, and postprandial responses by analysis of variance of repeated measurements over time ( < 0.05). Diet × age interaction was observed for protein ATTD, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS than those for the other treatments ( < 0.05). No age or diet effect was verified for the ATTD of other nutrients and faecal score. Faecal moisture and pH were higher for adults than that for old dogs ( < 0.05). The High RS food increased acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations in faeces, regardless of age ( < 0.01). Old dogs presented lower acetate and total short-chain   () and higher lactate and ammonia than adults ( < 0.05). Only for old dogs the intake of the High RS food reduced ammonia and increased faecal lactate ( < 0.05). An age × diet interaction was verified for glucose postprandial response, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS food ( < 0.05), while no differences were found for the other treatments. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion regardless of the diet ( < 0.05), and lower insulin increment at 180 min after the meal when fed the Low RS than when fed the High RS food ( < 0.05). In conclusion, the diet with lower SG and higher RS improved the intestinal microenvironment, with higher butyrate and total  without altering faeces production or score. Old dogs presented less acetate and total  and higher lactate and ammonia in faeces than adults. The High RS food increased lactate and reduced ammonia in faeces of old dogs, with possible positive influences for gut health. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion than that of adults to maintain blood glucose, and the diet with higher RS content reduced the postprandial glucose response of old dogs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615062>Acetate Affects the Process of Lipid Metabolism in Rabbit Liver, Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Short-chain   (SCFAs) (a microbial fermentation production in the rabbit gut) have an important role in many physiological processes, which may be related to the reduced body fat of rabbits. In the present experiment, we study the function of acetate (a major  in the rabbit gut) on fat metabolism. Ninety rabbits (40 days of age) were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group (injection of saline for four days); a group experiencing subcutaneous injection of acetate for four days ( g/kg BM per day, one injection each day, acetate); and a pair-fed sham treatment group. The results show that acetate-inhibited lipid accumulation by promoting lipolysis and  acid oxidation and inhibiting  acid synthesis. Activated G protein-coupled receptor 41/43, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/ signal pathways were likely to participate in the regulation in lipid accumulation of acetate. Acetate reduced hepatic triglyceride content by inhibiting  acid synthesis, enhancing  acid oxidation and lipid output. Inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α () and activated AMPK and ERK1/ signal pathways were related to the process in liver. Acetate reduced intramuscular triglyceride level via increasing  acid uptake and  acid oxidation. PPARα was associated with the acetate-reduced intracellular fat content.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325356>Effects of abomasally infused amylase and increasing amounts of corn starch on fecal excretion of starch, total and microbial nitrogen, and  in heifers1.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to study the effect of exogenous amylase on postruminal disappearance of increasing amounts of corn starch being infused into the abomasum of heifers, and to detect a possible limitation of starch digestion in the small intestine. Four rumen-fistulated heifers ( German Black Pied and  Jersey × German Black Pied) with an initial BW of 565 ± 6 kg were fed 5.6 kg DM/d of a diet targeted to contain only a negligible amount of starch. Animals were assigned randomly to a crossover trial with  experimental periods lasting 35 d each with 10 d of diet adaption followed by 25 d of sample collection. During the sampling period, each animal was abomasally infused with native corn starch at 5 levels (953, 1,213, 1,425, 1,733, and 1,993 g DM/d) each for a 5-d period with and without exogenous amylase, respectively. At days 6 to 10 the heifers received an abomasal infusion of starch in amounts of 724 g/d. Feces were sampled 4 times a day during the collection periods. Titanium dioxide was ruminally administered (10 g/d) to estimate fecal excretion. Purine bases in feces were determined and used as a marker for microbial N excretion. Fecal excretion of microbial N increased linearly with increasing level of starch infusion (P < 0.001), indicating a constant proportion of the infused starch being fermented in the hindgut. In contrast, the apparent digestibility of starch from the total postruminal tract decreased linearly from 90% to 80% (P < 0.001) when the intestinal starch supply increased from 1 to  kg/d. There is strong evidence based on the increasing starch excretion with feces and the indication of a constant proportion of infused starch being fermented in the hindgut for a decreasing efficiency of starch digestion in the small intestine with increasing intestinal supply. Amylase administration increased fecal excretion of butyrate (P = 0.04) and tended to increase isovalerate excretion (P = 0.06). However, amylase did not affect fecal excretion of microbial N or starch, suggesting that pancreatic amylase activity may not be the primarily limiting factor of postruminal starch digestion in heifers when corn starch is abomasally infused in amounts up to  kg/d.© The Author(s) 2019.

SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL,  mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the  propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic acid and glycerol--phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid metabolism products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited  acid synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the  propionate on host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421592>Effect of thermal activated peroxydisulfate pretreatment on short-chain   production from waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation.</a></h1><p>The effect of thermal activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) pretreatment on anaerobic fermentation (AF) of waste activated sludge (WAS) was investigated. WAS pretreatment was conducted at 35 °C and 55 °C with PDS dosage increasing from 0.1 to 0.9 mM/g TSS (total suspended solids). Experimental results showed that sludge solubilization and short chain   (SCFAs) production were significantly improved after pretreatment, while methanogenesis was severely inhibited. The maximum total SCFAs yield of 3183.51 mg COD/L occurred at 55 °C with 0.3 mM PDS/g TSS addition and day 9 of AF, which was .1, 1.3 and 1.1 fold of the blank, 55 °C and 35 °C + 0.3 mM PDS/g TSS pretreated samples, respectively. In addition, thermal activated PDS pretreatment could enhance the dewaterability of fermented sludge, which was advantageous for subsequent disposal of sludge.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In nonruminants, the mitochondrial membrane protein mitofusin  (MFN2) plays important roles in regulating mitochondrial function and intrahepatic lipid metabolism. Whether MFN2 is associated with hepatic lipid metabolism in dairy cows with moderate  liver is unknown. Therefore, to investigate changes in MFN2 expression and lipid metabolic status in dairy cows with moderate  liver, blood and liver samples were collected from healthy dairy cows (n = 10) and cows with moderate  liver (n = 10). To determine the effects of MFN2 on lipid metabolism in vitro, hepatocytes isolated from healthy calves were used for small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of MFN2 or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MFN2 for 48 h, or treated with 0, 0.6, 1., or .4 mM NEFA for 12 h. Milk production and plasma glucose concentrations in dairy cows with moderate  liver were lower, but concentrations of NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were greater in dairy cows with moderate  liver. Dairy cows with moderate  liver displayed hepatic lipid accumulation and lower abundance of hepatic MFN2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A). However, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA),  acid synthase (FASN), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) were more abundant in the livers of dairy cows with moderate  liver. In vitro, exogenous NEFA treatment upregulated abundance of SREBP-1c, ACACA, FASN, and DGAT1, and downregulated the abundance of PPARα and CPT1A. These changes were associated with greater lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, and MFN2 silencing aggravated this effect. In contrast, overexpression of MFN2-ameliorated exogenous NEFA-induced lipid accumulation by downregulating the abundance of SREBP-1c, ACACA, FASN, and DGAT1, and upregulating the abundance of PPARα and CPT1A in calf hepatocytes. Overall, these data suggest that one cause for the negative effect of excessive NEFA on hepatic lipid accumulation is the inhibition of MFN2. As such, these mechanisms partly explain the development of hepatic steatosis in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Herd-level monitoring for disease risk involves evaluating multiple factors, including food intake, cow density, and biomarkers of nutrient metabolism. Biomarkers that are measured include non-esterified   (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which are usually measured in a subset of the herd (i.e. cohort). If a certain proportion of cows in the cohort are above a specific threshold for a biomarker, the cohort is considered at high risk of disease. Few previous studies have investigated other methods to aggregate individual cow-level data to the cohort level. We designed a proof-of-concept study to determine if biomarker aggregation methods may be useful to predict cohort incidence of adverse health events including 1) clinical diseases: mastitis, metritis, retained placenta, ketosis, lameness, pneumonia, milk fever, displaced abomasum, ) and abortion or death of the calf or the cow. The study design was a prospective cohort study that used cows (N = 277) from five Michigan commercial dairy herds. Multiple cohorts of cows (two to four cohorts per farm, 18 total) were enrolled that shared the same dry-off date. We tested three different methods (central, dispersion, and count) to aggregate individual cow data (i.e. biomarkers and covariates) measured at dry-off. The central method consisted of calculating the average value of each variable within a cohort, and the dispersion method involved taking the standard deviation or mean absolute deviation about the median of each variable within a cohort. The count method consisting of counting the number of cows above a specific threshold for each variable within a cohort. We used best subsets selection to select a bouquet of candidate models for each aggregation method and averaged the predictions over the model set. We built 4 sets of Poisson regression models: one for each aggregation method and a combined model that included all three methods. We evaluated the models based on goodness-of-fit, model calibration using scoring rules, and comparison of observed versus predicted counts. The central and the combined method produced models that had good fit and model calibration. These results indicate that it may be possible to use aggregate measures to predict cohort disease incidence as early as dry-off. The next step is to test biomarker aggregation methods in studies with larger sample sizes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Isobutyl propionate was evaluated for genotoxicity, repeated dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, local respiratory toxicity, phototoxicity/photoallergenicity, skin sensitization, and environmental safety. Data from read-across analog isobutyl acetate (CAS # 110-19-0) show that isobutyl propionate is not expected to be genotoxic. Data from read-across analog isoamyl acetate (CAS # 123-92-) show that there are no safety concerns for isobutyl propionate for skin sensitization under the current declared levels of use. The repeated dose and reproductive endpoints were evaluated using the TTC for a Cramer Class I material, and the exposure to isobutyl propionate is below the TTC (0.03 mg/kg/day and 0.03 mg/kg/day, respectively). For the local respiratory endpoint, a calculated MOE >100 was provided by read-across analog butyl acetate (CAS # 123-86-4). The phototoxicity/photoallergenicity endpoints were evaluated based on UV spectra; isobutyl propionate is not expected to be phototoxic/photoallergenic. The environmental endpoints were evaluated; isobutyl propionate is not PBT as per the IFRA Environmental Standards. For the risk assessment, isobutyl propionate was not able to be risk screened as there were no reported volumes of use for North America or Europe in the 2015 IFRA Survey.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We sequenced the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of gut microbiota and detected metabolites based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in faecal samples.The composition of both the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites changed significantly with T2D patients. The abundance of Proteobacteria and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were higher in T2D patients than healthy subjects, and the short chain   (SCFAs), bile  and lipids of T2D patients were significantly disordered. Moreover, the abundances of certain -producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae etc.) were significantly increased in T2D patients, while the faecal SCFAs concentrations were significantly decreased. It's suggested that the role of -producing bacteria was not simply to produce SCFAs. Then we identified 44 microbial modules to explore the correlations between the gut microbiota and metabolic traits. Specially, most modules including certain -producing bacteria were comprehensively correlated to body mass index, the levels of blood glucose, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and faecal bile  and lipids.Our study identified the relationships between the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites, and provided a resource for future studies to understand host-gut microbiota interactions in T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284994>Grape peel powder promotes intestinal barrier homeostasis in acute TNBS-colitis: A major role for dietary fiber and fiber-bound polyphenols.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by impaired intestinal barrier function. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of grape peel powder (GPP) and its bioactive rich-fractions on the barrier function and colonic injury in a model of colitis induced by ,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Wistar rats received diets supplemented with either GPP (8%), extractable polyphenols (EP), non-extractable polyphenols-rich fraction (NEP-F), or polyphenols-poor, fiber-rich fraction (F) from grapes at amounts equivalent to the GPP group during 15 days before and for 7 days after colitis induction. NEP-F has decreased the extension of colonic lesion but the other grape peel bioactive fractions did not protect against macroscopic or microscopic colonic damage, EP diet increased macroscopic colonic damage. GPP, EP, and NEP-F reduced claudin- mRNA expression, whereas GPP and F fraction increased occludin and ZO-1 mRNA expression. All experimental diets reduced the colitis-triggered increase of MMP-9 mRNA expression. Colitis reduced by 30% the production of cecal short-chain   (). GPP and NEP-F completely protected against this effect, whereas F fraction was ineffective. Only GPP and NEP-F were able to decrease the upregulation of GRP94 mRNA triggered by colitis. Dietary fiber seems to reestablish the intestinal barrier function, whereas fiber-bound phenolics were able to restore cecal metabolism to produce beneficial metabolites like  and to reduce the activation of the unfolded protein response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In Experiment 1, 90 pigs were fed NC or NC with 250 mg GSP/kg (GSP) or 400 mg betaine/kg [positive control (PC)] for 28 d. In Experiment , 30 pigs were fed NC, GSP, or GSP with antibiotics (GSP + Abx) diets for 14 d. In Experiment 3, pigs were fed NC, NC plus 1 g sodium propionate/kg (SP), or NC plus 1 g sodium butyrate/kg (SB) diet for 14 d. Serum biochemical indexes,  concentrations, and microbial composition were determined.In Experiment 1, compared with the GSP group, visceral adipocyte area was higher in the NC (28.6%) and PC (18.%) groups (P ≤ 0.05). Colonic propionate and butyrate concentrations were 30.% and 3.6% higher in the GSP group than in the NC group, respectively (P ≤ 0.05).

According to a 6 × 6 Latin square design, 6 rumen-fistulated second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were abomasally infused with saline (LMP-C); isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d palm olein (LMP-LG), or 844 g/d essential AA (EAA; HMP-C); or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d glucose + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d palm olein + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-LG). Each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous infusion followed by  d of rest. A total mixed ration (42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate on a dry matter basis) formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected on d 5 of each period. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk yield or composition differently than at the LMP level. Neither GG nor LG infusion stimulated milk protein or lactose yield, but fat yield tended to decrease with GG and tended to increase with LG. Infusion of GG increased arterial plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin and decreased concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), nonesterified  , long-chain   (LCFA), total AA, EAA, and group  AA. Infusion of LG increased arterial triacylglycerides (TAG) and LCFA but did not affect EAA concentrations. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased arterial concentrations of BHB, urea, and all EAA groups and decreased the concentration of total non-EAA. Mammary plasma flow increased with GG and was not affected by LG or protein level. Uptake and clearance of total EAA and group  AA were affected or tended to be affected by GG × AA interactions, with their uptakes being lower and their clearances higher with GG, but only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG did not affect uptake or clearance of any AA group. The HMP level increased uptake and decreased clearance of all EAA groups and decreased non-EAA uptake. Infusion of GG tended to increase mammary glucose uptake, and tended to decrease BHB uptake only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG increased mammary uptake of TAG and LCFA and increased or tended to increase clearance of TAG and LCFA. We suspect GG increased mammary plasma flow to maintain intramammary energy and AA balance and stimulated lipogenesis in adipose, accounting for depressed arterial BHB and group  AA concentrations. Mammary glucose uptake did not cover estimated requirements for lactose and fat synthesis at the HMP level, except during HMP-GG infusion. Results of this study illustrate flexibility in mammary metabolite utilization when absorptive supply of glucogenic, lipogenic, and aminogenic substrate is increased.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Early- to mid-lactation Holstein Friesian cows were categorized as low or high emitters (n = 10 each) retrospectively, using predictions from milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, before the start of the experiment. Data from MIR estimates and from measurements with the GreenFeed (GF; C-Lock Technology Inc., Rapid City, SD) system over the 5-mo experiment were combined into 7-, 14-, and 28-d periods. Feed intake, eating and ruminating behavior, and ruminal fluid traits were determined in two 7-d measurement periods in the grazing season. The CH emission data were analyzed using a split-plot ANOVA, and the repeatability of each of the applied methods for determining CH emission was calculated. Traits other than CH emission were analyzed for differences between low and high emitters using a linear mixed model. The initial category-dependent differences in daily CH production persisted over the subsequent 5 mo and across  feeding regimens with both methods. The repeatability analysis indicated that the biweekly milk control scheme, and even a monthly scheme as practiced on farms, might be sufficient for confirming category differences. However, the relationship between CH data estimated by MIR and measured with GF for individual cows was weak (R = 0.26). The categorization based on CH production also generated differences in CH emission per kilogram of milk; differentiation between cow categories was not persistent based on milk MIR spectra and GF. Compared with the high emitters, low emitters tended to show a lower acetate-to-propionate ratio in ruminal , whereas feed intake and ruminating time did not differ. Interestingly, the low emitters spent less time eating than the high emitters. In conclusion, the CH estimation from analyzing the milk MIR spectra is an appropriate proxy to form and regularly control categories of cows with different CH production levels. The categorization was also sufficient to secure similar and persistent differences in emission intensity when estimated by MIR spectra of the milk. Further studies are needed to determine whether MIR data from individual cows are sufficiently accurate for breeding.The Authors.

Despite its widespread use, little is understood of its impact on the gut microbiota, an important environmental factor that can mediate metabolism and subsequent obesity and disease risk. Furthermore, given previous reports of dysbiosis with some artificial low-calorie sweeteners, we wanted to understand whether prebiotic consumption could rescue potential stevia-mediated changes in gut microbiota. Three-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to consume: (1) Water (CTR); () Rebaudioside A (STV); (3) prebiotic (PRE); (4) Rebaudioside A + prebiotic (SP) ( = 8/group) for 9 weeks. Rebaudioside was added to drinking water and prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin added to control diet (10%). Body weight and feces were collected weekly and food and fluid intake biweekly. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests, gut permeability tests, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and tissue harvest were performed at age 12 weeks. Rebaudioside A consumption alone did not alter weight gain or glucose tolerance compared to CTR. Rebaudioside A did, however, alter gut microbiota composition and reduce nucleus accumbens tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels compared to CTR. Prebiotic animals, alone or with Rebaudioside A, had reduced fat mass, food intake, and gut permeability and cecal  concentration. Adding Rebaudioside A did not interfere with the benefits of the prebiotic except for a significant reduction in cecal weight. Long-term low-dose Rebaudioside A consumption had little effect on glucose metabolism and weight gain; however, its impact on gut microbial taxa should be further examined in populations exhibiting dysbiosis such as obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426488>Enhancement of  Production from Food Waste by Mature Compost Addition.</a></h1><p>Food waste (FW) collected from a university canteen was treated in acidogenic fermenters to produce  (VFA) under biological pretreatment with mature compost. Batch assays working at pH 6 revealed an increment of 9.0%, 7.9%, and 4.1% (on COD basis) of VFA concentration when adding .5%, 3.5%, and 4.5% / of mature compost, respectively, even though the  solids (VS) concentration of food waste was lower in the tests with increasing doses of mature compost. For batch tests at pH 7, this VFA generation improvement was lower, even though enhanced COD solubilization was recorded. Operating in semi-continuous conditions at 35 °C, pH of 6, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.5 days, the addition of .5% / of mature compost led to a VFA concentration up to 51. ± 12.3% more (on VS basis) when compared to a reference reactor without compost addition. Moreover, the percentage of butyric acid on VS basis in the fermentation broth working at a pH of 6 increased from up to 12. ± 1.9% (0% compost addition) to up to 23.5 ± .7% (.5% compost addition). The VFA production was not improved when a higher percentage of mature compost was used (3.5% instead of .5% /), and it slightly decreased when mature compost addition was lowered to 1.5% /. When working at a pH of 7 in the semi-continuous fermenters with the addition of .5% / mature compost at an HRT of 3.5 days, an improvement of 79% and 104% of the VFA concentration (on VS basis) were recorded as compared to fermenters working at a pH of 6 with .5% and 0% / of mature compost addition, respectively. At a pH of 7, higher production of propionic and valeric  was found with respect to the reactor working at a pH of 6. The effect of pH on VFA generation was estimated to have greater contribution than that of only biological pretreatment using mature compost. At a pH of 7, the VFA yield was higher for the fermenter working with .5% / mature compost but at a pH of 7 and HRT of 5 days, the effect of mature compost on VFA production improvement was lower than that obtained at a pH of 6. Moreover, higher solubilization in terms of soluble chemical oxygen demand and total ammonium was detected when biological pretreatment using mature compost was applied at both a pH of 6 and a pH of 7, which indicates enhanced hydrolysis in both conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240226>Alteration of the Gut Microbiota and Its Effect on AMPK/NADPH Oxidase Signaling Pathway in 2K1C Rats.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the alteration of the gut microbiota and its effect on adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) signaling pathway in two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) rats.The 2K1C rat models were established. The rats were randomly divided into the following  groups: 2K1C group and sham group. Alterations of the gut microbiota were analyzed based on the high throughput sequencing method. Plasma concentrations of short chain   (SCFAs) were measured by chromatography. The protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was determined by western blotting. NADPH oxidase activity was measured by a luminometer.Microbial community analyses revealed that the structure and composition of the gut microbiota were significantly disrupted in 2K1C rats when compared to sham rats. This disruption was associated with the drastic increase in relative abundance of the genera  and the decrease in -producing bacterial population. We further confirm that SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota influence NADPH oxidase activity through AMPK.Our data implicated the important role of gut microbiota in the regulation of AMPK/NADPH oxidase signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31253064>Effects of branched-chain  and fibrolytic enzyme on rumen development in pre- and post-weaned Holstein dairy calves.</a></h1><p>The study evaluated the effects of branched-chain  (BCVFA) and fibrolytic enzyme (FE) on rumen development in calves. Forty Holstein male calves at the same ages (15 ± .5 days of age) and weights (45 ± 3.3 kg of body weight [BW]) were assigned randomly to four groups with a  ×  factorial arrangement of treatments. Supplemental BCVFA (0 g/d or 18 g/d) and FE (0 g/d or 1.83 g/d) were fed to calves. Data were analyzed as a  ×  factorial arrangement random design by the mixed procedure of SAS. The BCVFA × FE interaction was observed for ruminal propionate, blood growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and GH receptor (GHR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression in the rumen mucosa. Dry matter intake was higher for BCVFA addition. The higher average daily gain and ruminal  were observed for BCVFA or FE addition. Stomach weight and the length and width of rumen papillae were higher for BCVFA addition. The higher expression of GHR, IGF-1R and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 in rumen mucosa, and blood GH and IGF-1 were observed with BCVFA or FE addition. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were higher for BCVFA addition. The results indicated that rumen development was promoted by BCVFA, but was not affected with FE addition in calves.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213497>Treatment effects and comorbid diseases in 58 patients with visual snow.</a></h1><p>To evaluate pharmacologic treatment options for visual snow and to report prevalence of comorbid diseases.Medical charts of patients with a diagnosis of visual snow at the neurology outpatient clinic were reviewed on prescribed medication, and comorbid migraine, tinnitus, and psychiatric conditions including depression and anxiety.From 2007 to 2018, 58 patients were diagnosed with visual snow. Comorbid migraine was present in 51.7% of patients, lifetime depression in 41.4%, and lifetime anxiety in 44.8%. Lamotrigine was prescribed most frequently (26/58) and resulted in partial remission of symptoms in 5/26 (19.%). No patients reported complete remission. Adverse events occurred in 13/26 (50.0%) patients. None of the other prescribed drugs (valproate [n = 7], topiramate [n = 4], acetazolamide [n = ], flunarizine [n = 1]) led to improvement except for topiramate in one patient, who discontinued, however, because of adverse events.Of medication prescribed (lamotrigine, valproate, acetazolamide, flunarizine), only lamotrigine afforded some improvement in a small minority of patients. Migraine, depression, anxiety, and tinnitus were common comorbid diseases.This study provides Class IV evidence that for some patients with visual snow, lamotrigine resulted in partial remission of symptoms.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Initially, biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was conducted for optimization of mixing ratio of FW and FOG. The optimal methane production (800 L (kg VS)) was obtained from co-digestion of 70% FW + 30% FOG (w/w), which was 1. times and 12 times of that obtained from mono-digestion of FW and FOG, respectively. This optimal mixing ratio was used for subsequent fed-batch studies with the addition of two conductive additives, granular activated carbon (GAC) and magnetite. The addition of GAC significantly shortened the lag phase (from 7 to 3 d), reduced accumulation of various  (VFAs), and enhanced methane production rate (50-80% increase) compared to the control and magnetite-amended bioreactor. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) analysis suggested that the degradation of lipids, protein and carbohydrates was the highest in GAC amended reactor, followed by magnetite and control reactors. GAC addition also enriched more abundant and diverse bacteria and methanogens than control. Magnetite addition also showed similar trends but to a lesser degree. The substantial enrichment of syntrophic LCFA β-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Syntrophomonas) and methanogenic archaea in the GAC-amended bioreactor likely attributed to the superior methanogenesis kinetics in GAC amended bioreactor. Our findings suggest that the addition of GAC could provide a sustainable strategy to enrich kinetically efficient syntrophic microbiome to favor methanogenesis kinetics in co-digestion of FW and FOG.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The uptake, translocation and biotransformation of 6: FTSA in pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) were investigated by hydroponic exposure for the first time. The root concentration factor (RCF) of 6: FTSA was .6-24. times as high as those of perfluoroalkyl  (PFAAs) of the same or much shorter carbon chain length, demonstrating much higher bioaccumulative ability of 6: FTSA in pumpkin roots. The translocation capability of 6: FTSA from root to shoot depended on its hydrophobicity. Six terminal perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) metabolites, including perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were found in pumpkin roots and shoots. PFHpA was the primary metabolite in roots, while PFBA was the major product in shoots. 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), a cytochromes P450 (CYPs) suicide inhibitor, could decrease the concentrations of PFCA products with dose-dependent relationships in pumpkin tissues, implying the role of CYP enzymes involved in plant biotransformation of 6: FTSA. This study indicated that the application of 6: FTSA can lead to the occurrence of PFCAs (C2-C7) in plants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study investigates the effects of SBSO on blood cholesterol and the gut microbiota in hypercholesterolemia hamsters. Four groups of hamsters (n = 8 each) were given one of four diets, namely a non-cholesterol control diet (NCD), a high-cholesterol control diet (HCD) containing 0.1% cholesterol, and an HCD diet with sea buckthorn seed oil replacing 50% lard (SL) or replacing 100% lard (SH). Feeding SL and SH diets could reduce blood total cholesterol by 20-22%. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of the gene expression of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase  (ACAT2), microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP), and ATP-binding cassette transporter8 (ABCG8). SBSO supplementation also increased the production of intestinal short-chain   and fecal outputs of neutral sterols. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that feeding SL and SH diets could favorably modulate the relative abundance of Bacteroidales_S24-7_group, Ruminococcaceae, and Eubacteriaceae. It was therefore concluded that SBSO was effective in reducing blood cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic hamsters via increasing intestinal cholesterol excretion and promoting the growth of -producing bacteria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561307>Assessment of perfluoroalkyl substances levels in tap and bottled water samples from Turkey.</a></h1><p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) draw considerable attention for their potential toxic effects in humans and environment. Drinking water is accepted as one of the major exposure pathways for PFASs. In this study, we measured concentrations of 10 perfluoroalkyl substances in 94 tap water samples collected in two different sampling periods (August 2017 and February 2018) from 33 provinces of Turkey, as well as in 26 different brands of plastic and glass-bottled water samples sold in supermarkets in Turkey. Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) were the most frequently detected PFASs in the samples of tap waters. The maximum concentrations in tap waters were measured as .90, .37, .18, .04, and 1.93 ng/L, for PFHxA, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), respectively. The most abundant perfluorinated chemical in tap water samples was PFBA with 17%, followed by PFOS (13%), PFBS (12%), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) (11%), PFHxA (11%), and PFOA (11%). The total PFASs concentration in tap water ranged from 0.08 to 11.27 ng/L. As regards bottled waters, the concentrations of PFASs were generally lower than those in tap water samples. These results revealed that tap water samples in Turkey might be considered generally safe based on the established guidelines around the world. However, due to their persistence and potential to accumulate and reach higher concentrations in the environment, careful monitoring of PFASs in all types of water is critical.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, management and treatment of confectionery effluents, as one of the most important agro-industrial wastewaters, become essential. Confectionery industries produce high-strength and highly biodegradable wastewaters that are appropriate for biological treatment prior to discharge. In this study, long-term dynamic performance of a full-scale anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor treating confectionery effluent was simulated by using Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1). Substrate fractionation was carried out based on the ADM1 state variables, and then, the model was calibrated with 300 days of operation data. The calibrated model could capture the dynamic performance of the anaerobic reactor for a long validation period of 500 days. Although the reactor was operated under highly fluctuating volumetric loading rates (VLR) between 0. and 5 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD)/m day, the model results indicated medium to high prediction accuracy for effluent COD, methane generation, total  (VFA), and pH parameters. Mean relative absolute errors for COD, methane flow, VFA, and pH parameter simulations were 22%, 16%, 29%, and 1%, respectively. The study presents the applicability of ADM1 for full-scale reactors treating industrial wastewaters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491976>Predictors of Obesity among Gut Microbiota Biomarkers in African American Men with and without Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota and their biomarkers may be associated with obesity. This study evaluated associations of body mass index (BMI) with circulating microbiota biomarkers in African American men (AAM) ( = 75). The main outcomes included fecal microbial community structure (16S rRNA), gut permeability biomarkers (ELISA), and short-chain   (SCFAs, metabolome analysis). These outcomes were compared between obese and non-obese men, after adjusting for age. The results showed that lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), the ratio of LBP to CD14 (LBP/CD14), and SCFAs (propionic, butyric, isovaleric) were higher in obese ( = 41, age 58 years, BMI 36 kg/m) versus non-obese ( = 34, age 55 years, BMI 26 kg/m) men. BMI correlated positively with LBP, LBP/CD14 ( < 0.05 for both) and SCFAs (propionic, butyric, isovaleric,  < 0.01 for all). In the regression analysis, LBP, LBP/CD14, propionic and butyric  were independent determinants of BMI. The study showed for the first time that selected microbiota biomarkers (LBP, LBP/CD14, propionic and butyric ) together with several other relevant risks explained 39%-47% of BMI variability, emphasizing that factors other than microbiota-related biomarkers could be important. Further research is needed to provide clinical and mechanistic insight into microbiota biomarkers and their utility for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366828>Development and Evaluation of a Water-in-oil Microemulsion Formulation for the Transdermal Drug Delivery of Teriflunomide (A771726).</a></h1><p>Teriflunomide (TEF, A771726) is the active metabolite of leflunomide (LEF), a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. The main purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsion formulation of TEF. The W/O microemulsion was optimized formula is the physical and chemical stability of lecithin, ethanol, isopropyl myristate (IPM) and water (20.65/20.78/41.52/17.05 w/w) by using the pseudo-ternary phase diagram and the average droplet size is about 40 nm. The permeability of TEF microemulsion is about 6 times higher than control group in vitro penetration test. The results of anti-inflammatory effect showed that compared with the control group, the external TEF microemulsion group could significantly inhibit swelling of paw in rats, and no significant difference compared with oral LEF group. The results of hepatotoxicity test show that there were normal content of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and no obvious inflammatory infiltration of TEF microemulsion group compared with LEF group. The plasma concentration curve showed that compared with LEF group, the peak concentration of TEF microemulsion group was decreased, the half-life (t) was prolonged, and the relative bioavailability of TEF microemulsion was 75.35%. These results suggest that TEF W/O microemulsion can be used as a promising preparation to play an anti-inflammatory role while significantly reducing hepatotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349175>Response of bamboo biochar amendment on  accumulation reduction and humification during chicken manure composting.</a></h1><p>Present study was focused on to evaluate the effectiveness of increasing bamboo biochar (BB) (0%, %, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%) amendment on  (VFAs) degradation and humification, as well as correlation with interrelated physicochemical parameters during chicken manure (CM) composting. The results showed that the extended thermophilic period and higher humic acid/fulvic acid ratio as well as richness bacteria community during CM composting. In addition, lower quantities of VFAs and odor generation with elevated biochar concentration. Redundancy analysis also supported that 10% BB has strong correlation with physicochemical parameters than other treatments. Overall, the 10% BB amendment could stimulate microbial activities to accelerate the organic waste degradation, reduced VFAs and odor emission so that improve hygiene and end product quality. It is notably assessed that application of 10% BB additive were optimal feasible and effectively channel for disposal of manure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to provide a wider perspective of the metabolic effect of OAF to test its potential as a strategy to address metabolic disorders of the transition period. A group of 10 Holstein dairy cows were divided into  groups: The treated group (IMS; 5 cows) received 32.5 g of OAF twice a day (65 g d) as top-dress in the morning and afternoon feeds from -55 to 42 days from calving (DFC), whereas the control group (CTR; 5 cows) received no supplementation. From -62 to 42 DFC, body condition score, body weight, dry matter intake, rumination time and milk yield were measured; blood samples were collected weekly to assess a wide hematochemical profile and to test white blood cell functions by  challenge assays. At 30 DFC, rumen fluid was collected and analyzed for pH,  composition, urea nitrogen, and lactate contents. Data were submitted to ANOVA using a mixed model for repeated measures, including treatment, time, and their interaction as fixed effects. OAF decreased blood nonesterified   and beta hydroxybutyrate concentrations and increased rumination time in early lactation. Leukocytes from IMS cows had lower lactate production and lower glucose consumption after  stimulation. OAF did not reduce the acute phase response indicators and reduced the blood concentrations of albumin and antioxidants after calving, suggesting impairment of hepatic functions related to protein synthesis and antioxidant management. Nevertheless, the lack of effect on bilirubin and liver enzymes refutes the possibility of severe liver damage occurring with OAF supplementation. Positive effects in reducing mobilization of body fats and ketogenesis and in increasing rumination time after calving suggest OAF effectiveness in preventing metabolic disorders of the transition period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507445>Effects of Dietary- on Microbial Protein Synthesis and Urinal Urea-N Excretion Are Related to Microbiota Diversity in Rumen.</a></h1><p>Two experiments were performed in this study. In Experiment 1, twenty goats were fed with an isonitrogenous diet, containing 28% Non-Fiber Carbohydrate (MNFC group,  = 10) or 14% NFC (LNFC group,  = 10). In the MNFC group, the ruminal concentration of Short Chain   () increased, and pH declined. Compared with those in the LNFC group, the microbial protein synthesis in rumen and mRNA abundance of urea transporter B (UT-B) in rumen epithelium increased in the MNFC group, although serum urea-N (SUN) did not differ significantly between groups. Simultaneously, urinal urea-N excretion was reduced in the MNFC group. Significant correlations were found between rumen  and UT-B and between UT-B and urinal urea-N excretion. Furthermore, the abundances of  receptor of GPR41 and GPR43 increased in the rumen epithelium of the MNFC group. These results suggest that increases of SUN transported into the rumen and incorporated into microbial protein and decreases of urinal urea-N excretion are related to ruminal . This is supported by data from our previous study in which added  on the mucosal side caused increases of urea transport rate (flux J urea) from the blood to the ruminal lumen side. In Experiment , we used 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing to analyze the structure of the ruminal microbiota community in relation to . An additional eight goats were assigned into the MNFC ( = 4) and LNFC ( = 4) groups. The dietary ingredients, chemical composition, and feeding regimes were the same as those in Experiment 1. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA analysis) revealed NFC promoted the expansion of microbiota diversity, particularly of -producing microbes. The function prediction of 19 upregulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog groups showed an NFC-induced increase of the types and abundances of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing N and  acid metabolism. Based on our present and previous investigations, our results indicate that, in goats consuming a MNFC diet, the facilitated urea transport in the rumen and improved urea N salvage are triggered by an expansion of ruminal microbiota diversity and are signaled by ruminal . This study thus provides new insights into the microbiota involved in the dietary modulation of urea-N salvage in ruminant animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31326818>Anaerobic treatment of LCFA-containing synthetic dairy wastewater at 20 °C: Process performance and microbial community dynamics.</a></h1><p>Facilitating anaerobic degradation of long-chain   (LCFA) is key for tapping the high methane production potential of the fats, oil and grease (FOG) content of dairy wastewaters. In this study, the feasibility of using high-rate granular sludge reactors for the treatment of mixed LCFA-containing synthetic dairy wastewater (SDW) was assessed at 20 °C. The effects of the LCFA concentration (33-45% of COD) and organic loading rates (-3 gCOD/L·d) were determined using three parallel expanded granular sludge bed reactors. For the first time, long term anaerobic treatment of LCFA-containing feed at 20 °C was shown to be feasible and was linked to the microbial community dynamics in high-rate reactors. During a two-month operation, a soluble COD removal of 84-91% and COD to methane conversion of 44-51% was obtained. However, granular sludge flotation and washout occurred after two months in all reactors without  (VFA) accumulation, emphasizing the need for sludge retention for long-term granular sludge reactor operation with LCFA-containing feed at low ambient temperatures. The temporal shifts in microbial community structure were studied in the high-rate treatment of SDW, and the process disturbances (elevated LCFA loading, LCFA accumulation, and batch operation) were found to decrease the microbial community diversity. The relative abundance of Methanosaeta increased with higher LCFA accumulation in the settled and flotation layer granules in the three reactors, therefore, acetoclastic methanogenesis was found to be crucial for the high-rate treatment of SDW at 20 °C. This study provides an initial understanding of the continuous anaerobic treatment of LCFA-containing industrial wastewaters at low ambient temperatures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, to date, the heritability of rumen microbial features and host genetic components associated with the rumen microbiota, as well as whether such genetic components are animal performance relevant, are largely unknown.In the present study, we assessed rumen microbiota from a cohort of 709 beef cattle and showed that multiple factors including breed, sex, and diet drove the variation of rumen microbiota among animals. The diversity indices, the relative abundance of ~ 34% of microbial taxa (59 out of 174), and the copy number of total bacteria had a heritability estimate (h) ≥ 0.15, suggesting that they are heritable elements affected by host additive genetics. These moderately heritable rumen microbial features were also found to be associated with host feed efficiency traits and rumen metabolic measures (). Moreover, 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on 12 bovine chromosomes were found to be associated with 14 (12 of them had h ≥ 0.15) rumen microbial taxa, and five of these SNPs were known quantitative trait loci for feed efficiency in cattle.These findings suggest that some rumen microbial features are heritable and could be influenced by host genetics, highlighting a potential to manipulate and obtain a desirable and efficient rumen microbiota using genetic selection and breeding. It could be a useful strategy to further improve feed efficiency and optimize rumen fermentation through targeting both cattle and their rumen microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206672>Impact of Microclimate on   and  Terpenes in "Kerman" and "Golden Hills" Pistachio (Pistacia vera) Kernels.</a></h1><p>Pistachio is an economically important nut crop in California. Since temperature variations among geographical locations can influence biochemical processes during fruit development, it is of great relevance to understand the impact of growing area over the components that define the nutritional and sensory characteristics of pistachio nuts. Changes in moisture, fat content,  acid composition and  terpenes were studied during kernel development for "Kerman" and "Golden Hills" varieties in two different California Central Valley microclimates, Lost Hills and Parlier. Moisture content decreased from July to September for both cultivars at both locations. Kerman had a higher moisture content at both locations compared with Golden Hills. Harvest time affected fat content only for Kerman, where the values increased drastically from 21-July to 4-Aug, then remained constant. Golden Hills' fat content remained constant during the period of the study. The main  acid in pistachio oil is oleic acid (46% to 59%), followed by linoleic acid (26% to 36%) and palmitic acid (11% to 16%). C16:0, C16:1, C18:, and C18:3 decreased with harvest time, while C18:1 increased. α-Pinene was the most concentrated  among the cultivars and locations. It decreased with harvest time for both cultivars at both locations, ranging from 105 to 2464 mg/kg. At harvest, Golden Hills and Kerman at Parlier both had higher concentrations of α-pinene than the two cultivars at Lost Hills. Our results demonstrate that microclimate affects biosynthesis of   and terpenes in pistachio kernels, the main compounds responsible for pistachio nutritional and sensory characteristics.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158775>Response of the microbial community to the methanogenic performance of biologically hydrolyzed sewage sludge with variable hydraulic retention times.</a></h1><p>Hyperthermophilic biological hydrolysis of sewage sludge was applied before long-term anaerobic digestion to investigate how shortening hydraulic retention times (HRT, 20-5d) affected methanogenic performances and microbial dynamics. Results indicated that although the three different HRTs provided a stable process with a steady-state of methane production, both methane yield (161 L kg-VS 25% higher) and  solids removal (VS, 50%, -fold higher) increased during longer HRTs. Redundancy analysis results indicated that Sporosarcina and Methnosarcina positively correlated to VS removal and methane yield, and negatively correlated to  (VFAs) accumulation. The relative abundance of Coprothermobacter (>60%), syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria (SAOB), and Methanospirillum (8-15%), increased during shorter HRTs. A slight shift to two-stage acetate conversion was observed during shorter HRTs. The results demonstrated that HRTs played a key role in shaping microbial structure, leading to a new steady-state of microbial community profiles and process performances at variable HRTs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

DA-6 has been applied to many plant species, but the molecular mechanism by which spraying DA-6 after anthesis regulates wheat grain filling is still unknown.In this study, we used four DA-6 concentrations: C0 (0 g/L), C2 ( g/L), C4 (4 g/L), and C6 (6 g/L). The results showed that C4 and C6 led to a significantly higher 1000-grain weight and seed protein content than C0 during two wheat growing seasons. We then subjected samples at 24 days after anthesis (at which point the grain weight increased rapidly) to transcriptome analysis. Flag leaf (L), seed (S), and stem (T) samples under C6 and C0 were used for RNA-seq. The seed samples under C6 compared with C0 (S6vsS0) presented the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 2164). Plant hormone signal transduction (p = 1.97 × 10), protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; p = 9.04 × 10) and starch and sucrose metabolism (p = 1.90 × 10) pathways were the most markedly enriched pathways in the flag leaves, stems, and seeds, respectively. DEGs involved in sucrose synthesis in the flag leaves, protein processing in ER in the stems, and starch synthesis and protein processing in ER in the seeds were significantly upregulated under C6 compared with C0.Overall, we propose a model for spraying DA-6 after anthesis to regulate metabolic pathways in wheat, which provides new insights into wheat in response to DA-6.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635264>Short Chain   and Fecal Microbiota Abundance in Humans with Obesity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>There have been mixed results regarding the relationship among short chain   (SCFAs), microbiota, and obesity in human studies. We selected studies that provided data on  levels or fecal microbiota abundance in obese and nonobese individuals and then combined the published estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis. Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of acetate (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.5), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls. The subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity among obese individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m ( = 0.0%). At the phylum level, the abundance of fecal microbiota was reduced in obese compared to nonobese individuals, but the difference was not statistically significant (Bacteroidetes phylum, SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.73-0.01; Firmicutes phylum, SMD = -0.10, 95% CI = -0.31-0.10). The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of  but not gut microbiota richness at the phylum level. Additional well-designed studies with a considerable sample size are needed to clarify whether this association is causal, but it is also necessary to identify additional contributors to  production, absorption, and excretion in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250637>Sodium Butyrate Improves Liver Glycogen Metabolism in Type  Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h1><p>Liver plays a central role in modulating blood glucose level. Our most recent findings suggested that supplementation with microbiota metabolite sodium butyrate (NaB) could ameliorate progression of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and decrease blood HbA1c in db/db mice. To further investigate the role of butyrate in homeostasis of blood glucose and glycogen metabolism, we carried out the present study. In db/db mice, we found significant hypertrophy and steatosis in hepatic lobules accompanied by reduced glycogen storage, and expression of GPR43 was significantly decreased by 59.38 ± 3.33%; NaB administration significantly increased NaB receptor G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) level and increased glycogen storage in both mice and HepG2 cells. Glucose transporter  (GLUT2) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) on cell membrane were upregulated by NaB. The activation of intracellular signaling Protein kinase B (PKB), also known as AKT, was inhibited while glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) was activated by NaB in both in vivo and in vitro studies. The present study demonstrated that microbiota metabolite NaB possessed beneficial effects on preserving blood glucose homeostasis by promoting glycogen metabolism in liver cells, and the GPR43-AKT-GSK3 signaling pathway should contribute to this effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311119>Early Feeding Regime of Waste Milk, Milk, and Milk Replacer for Calves Has Different Effects on Rumen Fermentation and the Bacterial Community.</a></h1><p>We investigated the effects of different types of early feeding on rumen fermentation parameters and the bacterial community in calves. Fifty-four Holstein calves were assigned to three treatments and fed whole milk (M), pasteurized waste milk (WM), or milk replacer (MR). Male calves were slaughtered at the age of two months to measure the stomach masses. The female calves were followed for six months to determine the body weight, blood indices, rumen fermentation, and ruminal bacterial community. At the age of two months, the average daily gain was lower, but the concentration of total  was greater in the MR group. Starter intake and stomach mass were lower, but the isovalerate molar proportion was greater in the WM group. The blood indices and ruminal bacterial community of the WM group differed from those of the other groups. At the age of six months, the ruminal propionate molar proportion was lower, but the ruminal pH and acetate/propionate ratio were greater in the MR group. In conclusion, calves fed WM had different rumen fermentation and bacterial community during the weaning period, whereas feeding MR produced a long-lasting effect on the rumen environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203938>Characteristics of two-phase mesophilic anaerobic digestion of co-substrates consisting of waste activated sludge and corn silage based on modified ADM1.</a></h1><p>Two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates is a promising process to alleviate environmental pollution, product valuable methane gas and renew energy. A modified anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1) was proposed to characterize the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion at the feedstock ratios of waste activated sludge to corn silage 1:1, :1, 3:1, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the modified ADM1 was operated on the platform AQUASIM .0 while the kinetic parameter estimation and simulation was implemented on the platform MATLAB 7.0. The Monod maximum specific uptake rate for acetate (k) was calibrated to 29.0 d, and the half-saturation value for acetate (k) 0.40 kgCOD/m in the acidification phase while k 35.0 d, Monod maximum specific uptake rate for hydrogen (k) 23.0 d and k 0.70 kgCOD/m in the methanogenic phase in the modified ADM1. The results from the batch tests showed the optimal feedstock ratio of waste activated sludge to corn silage was :1. Under this condition, chemical oxygen demand could reach the largest removal at around 51.0%, while Ammonia-nitrogen and total phosphorous increased by the maximal 192.0% and 71.5%. Besides,  were lowest at about 0.27 kgCOD/m, and the biogas flow was highest at about 47.6 mL/d. The pH values were always maintained at 6.8-7.. Good agreements could be achieved between the measured data and the simulation with the modified ADM1. Therefore, the optimal and preferable operating factors during two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates could be obtained from the simulation. The modified model will contribute to further investigating and predicting the characteristics of the process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain  acid () transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, %, or 5% FM) or FOS (~%, 5%, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three  transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at % and 5% FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, a lack of physical online sensors, the high price of the available online water-quality analyzers, and the need for regular maintenance and calibration prevent frequent use of online monitoring. Soft-sensors are viable alternatives, with advantages in terms of price and flexibility in operation. As an example, this work presents the development, tuning, implementation, and validation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) on a grey-box model to estimate the concentration of  (VFA), soluble phosphates (PO-P), ammonia nitrogen (NH-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO-N) using simple and inexpensive sensors such as pH and dissolved oxygen (DO). The EKF is implemented in a sequential batch moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) pilot scale unit used for biological phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater. The grey-box model, used for soft sensing, was constructed by fitting the kinetic data from the pilot plant to a reduced order version of ASM2d model. The EKF is successfully validated against the standard laboratory measurements, which confirms its ability to estimate various states during the continuous operation of the pilot plant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553365>In vitro antioxidant, DNA-damaged protection and antiproliferative activities of ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of Centaurea sphaerocephalaL.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antiproliferative and inhibition of oxidative DNA-damage activities of n-butanol (n-BuOH) extract of Centaurea sphaerocephala. The in vitro antioxidant activity of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and the n-BuOH extracts of this plant were also assayed. To investigate the antioxidant potential, extracts were tested for their capacity to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl--picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·) and to inhibit lipid peroxidation using the TBARs method. The contents of total phenolics and flavonoids were measured. Additionally, antiproliferative activity and DNA-damage inhibition of the n-BuOH extract was determined using XCELLigence RTCA instrument and photolyzing 46966 plasmid, respectively. The results exhibited that the scavenging abilities of the EtOAc extract were better than the n-BuOH extract with an IC50= 11.59 µg/mL and 16.67 µg/mL for both extracts, respectively. The phenolic and flavonoid contents were found higher in the n-BuOH and EtOAc extracts. Furthermore, our results showed that n-BuOH extract exhibited a remarkable inhibition of lipid peroxidation with an IC50 of 340.94±7.49 μg/mL and had an antiproliferative effect against Hela cells.

The objective of this study was to analyze the bacterial dynamics associated with whole crop wheat silage with and without inoculants. Whole crop wheat was ensiled in laboratory silos, with and without  inoculants (), for 3 months. Untreated and -treated silages were sampled at several times during ensiling, while -treated silage was sampled only at 3 months. Bacterial composition was studied using next generation sequencing approach. Dominant bacteria, before ensiling, were  (34.7%),  (28.4%) and  (10.4%),  (7.8%), and  (3.4%). Exogenous inoculants significantly affected bacterial composition and dynamics during ensiling. At 3 months of ensiling,  dominated the silage bacterial population and reached an abundance of 59.5, 92.5, and 98.% in untreated, - and -treated silages, respectively. The bacterial diversity of the mature silage was lower in both treated silages compared to untreated silage. Functional profiling of the bacterial communities associated with the wheat ensiling demonstrated that the abundant pathways of membrane transporters, carbohydrate and amino  metabolisms followed different pattern of relative abundance in untreated and -treated silages. Only three pathways, namely base-excision repair, pyruvate metabolism and transcription machinery, were significantly different between untreated and -treated silages upon maturation. Lactic acid content was higher in treated silage compared to untreated and treated silage. Still, the pH of both treated silages was lower in the two -treated silages compared to untreated silage. Aerobic stability test demonstrated that -, but not -supplement, facilitated silage deterioration. The lower aerobic stability of the -treated silage may be attributed to lower content of acetic acid and other  which inhibit aerobic yeasts and molds. Indeed, high yeast count was recorded, following exposure to air, only in -treated silage, supporting this notion. Analysis of bacterial community of crop silage can be used for optimization of the ensiling process and the selection of appropriate inoculants for improving aerobic stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560750>Organic matter disappearance, short and branched chain   production of selected fiber sources used in pet foods by a canine in vitro fermentation model.</a></h1><p>Dietary fibers can influence a dog's overall health, but high concentrations of soluble dietary fibers can cause soft stools. An in vitro model could be useful to predict the rate fibers are fermented once they reach the colon. Pet food companies are constantly searching for new ingredients to differentiate their products from competitors. Miscanthus grass (MG), pea fiber (PF), and sorghum bran (SB) are novel fiber sources that could be alternatives to standards like cellulose (CE) and beet pulp (BP). The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of fiber source on organic matter disappearance (OMD), estimated organic matter disappearance (EOMD), and fermentation end-product concentrations using an in vitro fermentation procedure and dog fecal inoculum. Total dietary fiber (TDF) residues from MG, CE, BP, PF, and SB were fermented in vitro with buffered dog feces. Fecal samples were collected and maintained in anaerobic conditions until the dilution and inoculation. Test tubes containing the fibrous substrates were incubated for 4, 8, and 12 h at 39ºC. Short chain   (), branched chain   (BCFA), OMD, and EOMD were determined for each fiber source and time point. Beet pulp had the highest OMD, EOMD, and  production of all tested fiber sources (38.6% OMD, 26.% EOMD, .72 mmol /g of substrate). Sorghum bran led to greater concentrations of BCFA (59.86 µmol/g of substrate) and intermediate OMD and EOMD compared to the other tested fibers. Cellulose and MG were poorly fermented with the lowest OMD, EOMD, , and BCFA compared to other fibers. In conclusion, MG could be used as an insoluble minimally fermentable replacement fiber for CE in dog foods.© The Author(s) 2019.

The results showed that OL, S/I ratio and initial pH significantly affected batch anaerobic process. Methane yield was proved to be inversely proportional to OL and S/I ratio. Digester with lowest OL (5 g VS/L) obtained greatest methane yield (551.4 mL/g VS), highest organics removal (94.1%) and good stability. Enhancing OL to 10 g VS/L was recommended for satisfactory stability and higher volumetric methane productivity. When OL was designated as 10 g VS/L, digester with low S/I ratio (1/) achieved satisfactory methane yield (539.3 mL/g VS), high organics removal (92.3%) and stable performance. When OL was relatively high (20 g VS/L), adjusting initial pH to 7.5 contributed to stable performance via enhancing buffering capacity against  (VFA) disturbance. Strong VFA inhibition occurred under high OL (40 g VS/L) or great S/I ratio (/1) or acidic initial pH (6.5). In this case, acetate was dominant VFA, followed by butyrate. However, when digester was stable, acetate was main VFA, followed by propionate. This study provided practical guidance on process configurations for batch digesters of food waste needed to achieve satisfactory performance and stability.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The effect of fish peptides in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not previously been investigated, hence this study aimed to evaluate the effect of a cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) supplement on symptom severity, gut integrity markers and fecal fermentation in IBS-patients. A double-blind, randomized parallel-intervention with six weeks of supplementation with .5 g CPH ( = 13) or placebo ( = 15) was conducted. The outcomes were evaluated at baseline and the end of the study. The primary outcomes were symptom severity evaluated by the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and quality of life. The secondary outcomes included gut integrity markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum, fecal fermentation measured by concentration of short-chain   (SCFAs) and fecal calprotectin. The groups were comparable at baseline. The total IBS-SSS-scores were reduced in both the CPH-group (298 ± 69 to 236 ± 106,  = 0.081) and the placebo-group (295 ± 107 to 202 ± 103,  = 0.005), but the end of study-scores did not differ ( = 0.395). The concentrations of serum markers and SCFAs did not change for any of the groups. The baseline measures for the whole group showed that the total  concentrations were inversely correlated with the total IBS-SSS-score ( = -0.527,  = 0.004).

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of supplementing broiler diets with xylanase or xylo- oligosaccharide (XOS) on growth performance, the concentration of non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) hydrolysis products in the ileum and concentration of short chain   () in the caeca of broiler chickens.. In total, 500 male Ross 308 broilers were used in this 29-day (d) study. The treatments were organised into a  ×  plus 1 factorial arrangement consisting of two additives (xylanase or XOS) at two levels (low or high) plus a control treatment with no additives. This gave five treatments with 100 birds in each treatment group. The diets were slightly deficient in protein by 20 g/kg and energy by 1 MJ/kg.3. On d 14 and 28, two birds per pen were euthanised, the caeca content collected and analysed for short chain  acid () concentration. On d 29, six birds per pen were euthanised and ileal digesta were collected and analysed for the concentration of NSP fractions.4. On d 14, caecal acetic acid, iso-butyric acid, iso-valeric acid, n-valeric acid and total  concentrations were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) when diets were supplemented with XOS compared with xylanase.5. Ileal concentration of arabinose, galactose and glucuronic acid (GlucA2) were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the insoluble NSP fraction when diets were supplemented with a high level of xylanase, compared with the control treatment. Ileal concentration of fructose was significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the water soluble NSP when a high level of xylanase or low level of XOS were included in the diet compared with the control.6. It was concluded that xylanase and XOS had similar effects on NSP concentration and  in the caeca, although there was little effect on performance. This observation demonstrated further benefits of xylanase supplementation in wheat-based broiler diets beyond digesta viscosity reduction and the release of extra nutrients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562378>Intestinal inflammation increases convulsant activity and reduces antiepileptic drug efficacy in a mouse model of epilepsy.</a></h1><p>We studied the effects of intestinal inflammation on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice and the effects thereon of some antiepileptic and anti-inflammatory treatments to establish if a link may exist. The agents tested were: alpha-lactoalbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in tryptophan, effective in some animal models of epilepsy and on colon/intestine inflammation, valproic acid (VPA), an effective antiepileptic drug in this seizure model, mesalazine (MSZ) an effective aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory treatment against ulcerative colitis and sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain  acid () normally produced in the intestine by gut microbiota, important in maintaining gut health and reducing gut inflammation and oxidative stress. Intestinal inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration for 6 days. Drug treatment was started on day 3 and lasted 11 days, when seizure susceptibility to PTZ was measured along with intestinal inflammatory markers (i.e. NF-κB, Iκ-Bα, COX-, iNOS), histological damage, disease activity index (DAI) and  concentration in stools. DSS-induced colitis increased seizure susceptibility and while all treatments were able to reduce intestinal inflammation, only ALAC and NaB exhibited significant antiepileptic properties in mice with induced colitis, while they were ineffective as antiepileptics at the same doses in control mice without colitis. Interestingly, in DSS-treated mice, VPA lost part of its antiepileptic efficacy in comparison to preventing seizures in non-DSS-treated mice while MSZ remained ineffective in both groups. Our study demonstrates that reducing intestinal inflammation through ALAC or NaB administration has specific anticonvulsant effects in PTZ-treated mice. Furthermore, it appears that intestinal inflammation may reduce the antiepileptic effects of VPA, although we confirm that it decreases seizure threshold in this group. Therefore, we suggest that intestinal inflammation may represent a valid antiepileptic target which should also be considered as a participating factor to seizure incidence in susceptible patients and also could be relevant in reducing standard antiepileptic drug efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217543>Propionic Acid Induces Gliosis and Neuro-inflammation through Modulation of PTEN/AKT Pathway in Autism Spectrum Disorder.</a></h1><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by glia over-proliferation, neuro-inflammation, perturbed neural circuitry, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The role of gut dys-biosis in ASD is intriguing and should be elucidated. We investigated the effect of Propionic acid (PPA), a short-chain  acid () and a product of dys-biotic ASD gut, on human neural stem cells (hNSCs) proliferation, differentiation and inflammation. hNSCs proliferated to 66 neuropsheres when exposed to PPA versus 45 in control. The neurosphere diameter also increased at day 10 post PPA treatment to (Mean: 193.47 um ± SEM: 6.673 um) versus (154.16 um ± 9.95 um) in control, p < 0.001. Pre-treatment with β-HB,  receptor inhibitor, hindered neurosphere expansion (p < 0.001). While hNSCs spontaneously differentiated to (48.38% ± 6.08%) neurons (Tubulin-IIIβ positive) and (46.63% ± .5%) glia (GFAP positive), PPA treatment drastically shifted differentiation to 80% GFAP cells (p < 0.05). Following  mM PPA exposure, TNF-α transcription increased 4.98 fold and the cytokine increased 3.29 fold compared to control (P < 0.001). Likewise, GPR41 (PPA receptor) and pro-survival p-Akt protein were elevated (p < 0.001). PTEN (Akt inhibitor) level decreased to (0.42 ug/ul ± 0.04 ug/ul) at  mM PPA compared to (0.83 ug/ul ± 0.09 ug/ul) in control (p < 0.001). PPA at  mM decreased neurite outgrowth to (80.70 um ± 5.5 um) compared to (194.93 um ± 19.7 um) in control. Clearly, the data supports a significant role for PPA in modulating hNSC patterning leading to gliosis, disturbed neuro-circuitry, and inflammatory response as seen in ASD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620454>Conversion of Branched-Chain Amino  to Corresponding Isoacids - An  Tool for Estimating Ruminal Protein Degradability.</a></h1><p>In this paper we describe a study that evaluates the applicability of an  fermentation model to assess the resistance of protein supplements to rumen degradation. The protein sources used were: soybean meal (SBM); whey protein (WHEY), which was expected to be rapidly degraded, and yeast-derived microbial protein (YMP), which was proposed to be resistant to rumen degradation. The basal diet was composed of grass silage and a commercial compound feed. The protein supplements were added at three isonitrogenous doses. Fermentation was monitored for 24 h and gas production, , lactic acid, and ammonia were analyzed at three timepoints. Protein degradation was estimated by determining the extent to which branched-chain amino  (BCAA) introduced with the protein supplement were converted to corresponding branched-chain  (BCVFA). At the highest dose of WHEY, 60% of introduced valine, leucine, and isoleucine was recovered as isobutyric, -methylbutyric, and isovaleric acid (products of BCAA decarboxylation and deamination), respectively. The BCVFA detected represented 50% of added BCAA with SBM, but <15% with YMP. Further indications that YMP protein is resistant to degradation were provided by analysis of ammonia. With YMP, the residual ammonia concentration only marginally exceeded that of the cultures with no protein supplementation, while it increased dose-dependently when the vessels were supplemented with WHEY or SBM. This suggests that with WHEY and SBM, the rate of deamination exceeded the rate of ammonia assimilation by bacteria. Residual ammonia and BCVFA, the two indicators of protein fermentation, were strongly correlated. Overall bacterial activity was monitored as yield of gas, , and bacteria. These three correlating parameters showed that WHEY only modestly stimulated fermentation, whereas SBM and YMP stimulated fermentation extensively, possibly owing to their higher carbohydrate content. The results presented suggest that the  fermentation method was suitable for detecting differences in resistance of protein supplements to rumen degradation and following a full method validation could be a useful tool for diet formulation. The data obtained suggested that YMP was the most resistant and WHEY the most susceptible to degradation.Copyright © 2019 Apajalahti, Vienola, Raatikainen, Holder and Moran.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487531>Butyrate mediated regulation of RNA binding proteins in the post-transcriptional regulation of inflammatory gene expression.</a></h1><p>Short chain   (SCFAs) are produced by commensal bacteria in the gut and are known to reduce inflammation through transcriptional inhibition of cytokines and inflammatory proteins such as cyclooxygenase- (COX-). Butyrate is a  that was reported to alter the mRNA stability of inflammatory genes by increasiing the expression of the RNA binding protein (RBP) Tristetraprolin (TTP). We have hypothesized that butyrate may regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally through global effects on the expression or cytoplasmic translocation of RBPs. Using bioinformatics analyses of publicly available microarray data as well as colon cancer cell lines treated with sodium butyrate, we have observed that butyrate treatment led to a general reduction in expression of several (but not all) RBPs and inhibition in the cytosolic translocation of HuR, a well-known stabilizing RBP. This was reflected in reduced NanoLuc reporter activity of several different AU-rich element (ARE) sequences in the presence of butyrate; this suppression was retained even when HuR was overexpressed. Mechanistically, we have shown that reduced activity of HuR was related to decreased phosphorylation of p38 and MK2 and enhanced phosphorylation of Chk2. As a proof of concept, we show butyrate-mediated inhibition in binding of HuR to the 3'UTR of COX- mRNA resulting in reduced mRNA and protein levels of the inflammatory gene. Overall, our data suggest that butyrate can reduce the expression of inflammatory genes not only by transcriptional regulation, but also by post-transcriptional regulation via inhibition of mRNA stabilizing proteins.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The cultures were fed a mixture of a 400 g/l concentrated lactose and a concentrated mussel processing waste (CMPW, 101.72 g glucose/l) medium (fermentation I) or a CMPW medium supplemented with glucose and KHPO up to concentrations of 400 g glucose/l and 3.21 g total phosphorus/l, respectively (fermentation II). For an accurate description and a better understanding of the kinetics of both cultures, the growth and product formation by  CECT 539 were both modelled, for the first time, as a function of the amounts of glucose () added and the pH gradient () generated in every realkalization and feeding cycle, by using an empirical polynomial model. With this modeling procedure, the kinetics of biomass, viable cell counts, nisin, lactic acid, acetic acid and butane-,3-diol production in both cultures were successfully described (  values > 0.970) and interpreted for the first time. In addition, the optimum  and  values for each product were accurately calculated in the two realkalized fed-batch cultures. This approach appears to be useful for designing feeding strategies to enhance the productions of biomass, bacteriocin, and metabolites by the nisin-producing strain in wastes from the food industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149273>SHORT CHAIN   UPREGULATE ADIPOKINE PRODUCTION IN TYPE  DIABETES-DERIVED HUMAN ADIPOCYTES.</a></h1><p>Short chain   (SCFAs) play a major regulatory role in adipocyte function and metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SCFAs on adiponectin and leptin expression in adipocytes, and also to determine whether the effects of  treatment in visceral adipocytes obtained from healthy subjects are different relative to the effects in adipocytes from patients with type  diabetes.Human pericardiac preadipocytes and human pericardiac preadipocytes type  diabetes were differentiated into adipocytes for 21 days in 48-well plates. After differentiation, two kinds of mature adipocytes, human pericardiac adipocytes (HPAd) and human pericardiac adipocytes-type  diabetes (HPAd-T2D) were incubated with or without 1 mM of acetic acid (AA), butyrate acid (BA), and propionic acid (PA). After 48 hours of incubation, intracellular lipid accumulation was measured using oil red staining. In addition, mRNA levels of adiponectin, leptin and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ) were determined by Real-Time PCR system.In HPAd,  supplementation did not inhibit lipid accumulation. By contrast, both AA (p<0.01) and PA (p<0.01) significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in HPAd-T2D. Regarding mRNA levels of adiponectin, no significant changes were found in HPAd, while all three types of SCFAs significantly increased (p<0.05) adiponectin expression in HPAd-T2D. Leptin mRNA expression levels were significantly increased by treatment with all three types of SCFAs in both HPAd (p<0.05) and HPAd-T2D (p<0.05).SCFAs inhibited lipid droplet accumulation and increased mRNA expression of adiponectin and leptin in T2D-derived adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440513>Early-Life Iron Deficiency and Subsequent Repletion Alters Development of the Colonic Microbiota in the Pig.</a></h1><p> Iron deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency worldwide, affecting over two billion people. Early-life iron deficiency may alter the developing microbiota, which may or may not be reversible with subsequent dietary iron repletion. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether early-life iron deficiency and subsequent repletion alter colonic microbial composition and fermentation end-product concentrations in pigs.  Forty-two male pigs received either control (CONT, 21.3 mg Fe/L) or iron-deficient (ID, .72 mg Fe/L) milk replacer treatments from postnatal day (PND)  to 32. Subsequently, 20 pigs continued through a series of age-appropriate, iron-adequate diets from PND 33 to 61. Contents from the ascending colon (AC) and rectum (feces) were collected at PND 32 and/or 61. Assessments included microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing and   acid (VFA) concentrations by gas chromatography methods. Data were analyzed using a 1-way ANOVA and PERMANOVA to assess the main effects of early-life iron status on all outcomes.  In AC samples, 15 genera differed ( < 0.05) between ID and CONT pigs, while 27 genera differed ( < 0.05) in fecal samples at PND 32. Early-life ID pigs had higher ( = 0.012) relative abundance of  in AC samples compared with CONT pigs. In feces, ID pigs had lower ( < 0.05) relative abundances of  and  from the families of Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae. At PND 61, only two genera differed between treatment groups in AC samples, with ID pigs having a higher ( = 0.043) relative abundance of  and lower ( = 0.047) relative abundance of . Beta diversity differed at PND 32 in both AC and feces between CONT and ID pigs but no differences remained at PND 61. At PND 32, the total VFA concentration was higher in ID pigs compared with CONT pigs in both AC ( = 0.003) and feces ( = 0.001), but no differences in VFA concentrations persisted to PND 61.  Early-life iron status influenced microbial composition and VFA concentrations within the large intestine, but these differences were largely normalized following subsequent dietary iron repletion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374412>Valorization of sewage sludge for  production and role of microbiome on acidogenic fermentation.</a></h1><p>This work explored the production of  (VFA) through the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge (SS). The first experiment took place at batch scale to evaluate the combined effect of using a thermal pre-treatment (120 °C, 15 min) and different Substrate/Inoculum ratios (S/I) (1, , 4 and 6 g VS substrate/g VS inoculum) on the acidogenic potential of the SS. The results showed that the thermal pre-treatment influenced positively the degree of acidification of the SS at low S/I ratios, reaching maximum of 45%. Afterwards, a continuous lab-scale experiment, was set-up to study two ranges of organic loading rates (OLR): 1300-1600 mg COD L d and 2400-3500 mg COD L d. The highest degree of acidification (22%) was achieved at the lowest OLR.

A major retronasal burnt aroma region was purified by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and HPLC separation from the soy sauce aroma-type Baijiu sample. A novel retronasal burnt aroma compound was identified as 6-(-formyl-5-methyl-1-pyrrol-1-yl)hexanoic acid () by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry and 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance. The retronasal burnt aroma threshold of compound  was determined to be 209.5 μg/L in 53% ethanol aqueous solution. Quantitative analysis showed that the concentration of compound  ranged from below the limit of quantitation (3.8 μg/L) to 224. μg/L in the Baijiu samples.

Alternative source of NPN is the slow release of ammonia sources in which the product is the extrusion of starch with urea. This work aimed to determine the effects on nutrient intake, ingestive behaviour, digestibility, nitrogen balance, ruminal pH, rumen ammonia nitrogen,  (VFA) and blood parameters with increased levels of extruded urea (50, 60, 70 and 80 g/100 kg of body weight [BW]) in beef cattle diet. Four rumen cannulated crossbred steers with initial mean weight of 336 ± 47 kg in a 4 × 4 Latin square design were distributed. Diets were formulated with 400:600 g/kg roughage:concentrate ratio on dry matter based and provided once per day, being used whole corn silage as roughage. There were no effects on nutrient intake (kg/day), ingestive behaviour, apparent digestibility, nitrogen balance,   acid (VFA) and blood parameters in extruded urea treatment groups. Similar results were observed on time spent on feeding, rumination and idleness. There were positive linear effects (p = 0.022) on rumen pH in the time of 8 hr after feeding and also on plasma concentration of the extruded urea levels (p = 0.039); whereas a linear negative effect (p = 0.030) was observed on ammonia nitrogen for the collection time of  hr after feeding. Increased levels of extruded urea could maintain nutrient intake, digestibility, ingestive behaviour, rumen pH and blood parameters in normal conditions. In conclusion, we recommend the extruded urea use with values up to 80 g/100 kg BW in confined beef cattle that receive balanced diets with 140 g/kg of crude protein.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160019>Fe inhibits bio-foam generating in anaerobic digestion reactor under conditions of organic shock loading and re-startup.</a></h1><p>Bio-foaming during the anaerobic digestion (AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a major cause of unstable reactor operations, especially under high organic loading rates (OLRs). Here, we used two 40-liter anaerobic reactors to deal with the actual organic fraction of municipal solid waste at OLRs of 5 and 7.5 kgVS/m/d and tried to inhibit bio-foam generation by dosing with Fe. One of reactors had 400 g of Fe added before operation and additional 200 g of Fe was added when the operating conditions changed; the other one was the control reactor with no Fe dosing. The results show that bio-foam was generated in the control reactor at an organic shock loading of 10 kgVS/m/d and re-startup at 5 kgVS/m/d, while the reactor containing Fe operated normally. Due to the surfactant attributes of  (VFAs), the probability of bio-foam generation was positively correlated with the effluent's degree of surface activity (SA) induced by VFAs, which is a parameter representing the foaming potential. Because VFA biodegradation was enhanced in the reactor with added Fe, at the position of Fe accumulation, the SA was decreased by 49.7-59.%. Furthermore, the effect of Fe dosing on inhibiting bio-foam was evaluated by comparison with traditional commercial anti-foam agents. The results suggest possible reasons for bio-foam generation in OFMSW AD and suggest the reasonable usage of Fe to inhibit bio-foam formation.Copyright © 2019.

There are no effective methods including vaccines to prevent or control these diseases. Alternative methods should be employed, such as using novel immunostimulant poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). The present study aimed to evaluate effects of dietary PHB supplementation on the growth, antioxidant enzymes activity, immune-related genes expression and intestinal microbiota in soiny mullet. The fish was fed for 30 or 60 days with six diets at different PHB supplementation of 0, 0.5, 1, , 4 and 8%, named as groups P0, P0.5, P1, P2, P4 and P8. The results showed that the weight gain and specific growth rate of fish in P2 and P0.5 groups were significantly higher than those in control P0 group at 30 and 60 days, respectively (P < 0.05). The antioxidant enzymes activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase in serum were significantly increased in P0.5/P1/P2 groups after 30 days. The transcriptional levels of penicillin-binding protein A and interleukin-8 analyzed by qRT-PCR were significantly upregulated in P2 and P4 groups compared to those in P0/P0.5/P1/P8 groups at 30 days. The transcriptional level of major histocompatibility complex class II in P2 group was significantly upregulated, and aldehyde oxidase downregulated compared to P0 group. Intestinal microbiota analysis by Illumina high-throughput sequencing showed that the microbiota diversity was not changed significantly, but the microbiota structure shifted significantly post PHB treatment. At the phyla level, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were predominant in both P0 and P2 groups. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Bacillus spp. in P2 group increased significantly, and abundance of Achromobacter spp. decreased significantly. KEGG pathway analysis by PICRUSt showed that oral administration PHB significantly upregulated abundances of genes responsible for 10 pathways and downregulated genes involved in 17 pathways. In conclusion, soiny mullet fed with % PHB supplemental diets for 30 days showed better growth performance, higher antioxidant enzymes activity and immune-related genes expression. Their regulation of growth and immunity might be related with the intestinal microbiota change post PHB supplementation. It will provide very useful basic information to study the regulation mechanism of PHB in aquatic animals, and provide good green method to prevent disease in soiny mullet.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, fish samples were stored in zein coatings containing 1.00% EO and .00% extract and in combination treatment containing 1.00% of each of them in refrigerator for 12 days. All of treatments were analyzed for microbiological count (Enterobacteriaceae, psychrophilic bacteria, mesophilic bacteria and pseudomonas bacteria) and chemical including pH, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total  base nitrogen, peroxide value (POV) and free   (FFAs) and sensory (odor, color and texture) characteristics. Results showed that the highest levels of three factors including TBARS, POV and FFAs were related to the control sample and the least amount of these parameters was observed in EO and extract combination treatments. This effect of combined treatment was also observed in the reduction of total  basic nitrogen and pH parameters. Total bacterial counts during storage in fish treated with the extract and EO were remained below the acceptable level and microbial spoilage was significantly decreased compared to control. According to the sensory evaluation, treatments containing EO and extract showed improvement in this index compared to control treatment during storage. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the EO and extract of  as active ingredients in zein coating successfully improve the quality and shelf life of the fish in the refrigerator.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152444>Lithium for acute mania.</a></h1><p>Bipolar disorder is a common condition associated with high morbidity; developing efficacious, safe treatments is therefore essential. Lithium is an effective maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. It acts as mood stabiliser and reduces the risk of suicide. However, evidence assessing the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania is less robust. Current evidence-based guidelines cite multiple anti-dopaminergic and mood-stabilising agents as initial treatments: more definite evidence is needed to decide if lithium should be the first-line therapy.1. To assess the effects of lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatment in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.. To review the acceptability and tolerability of treatment with lithium in comparison with placebo or other active treatments in alleviating the acute symptoms of a manic or mixed episode in people with bipolar disorder.We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We also searched the World Health Organization trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We have incorporated studies from searches to 18 May 2018 into the current analyses.Prospective randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo or alternative drug treatment in treatment of acute mania. We included anyone with bipolar disorder, male and female, of any age.At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We used odds ratios (ORs) to analyse binary efficacy outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuously distributed outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was moderate or substantial, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse data. We assessed the certainty of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.We found 36 randomised controlled studies comparing lithium with placebo, one of 12 drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of acute mania. Studies included male and female participants (n = 4220), of all ages, who all fitted criteria for a manic episode within the context of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.Risk of bias was variable; 12 studies had a high risk of bias in one domain and 27 gave inadequate information on randomisation leading to an 'unclear' rating for selection bias.Lithium versus placeboHigh-certainty evidence found that lithium was an effective treatment for acute mania and was more effective than placebo at inducing a response (OR .13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to .63; participants = 1707; studies = 6; I = 16%; high-certainty evidence), or remission (OR .16, 95% CI 1.73 to .69; participants = 1597; studies = 5; I = 21%; high-certainty evidence).Lithium was more likely than placebo to cause tremor (OR 3.25, 95% CI .10 to 5.04; participants = 1241; studies = 6; I = 0%; high-certainty evidence), and somnolence (OR .28, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.58; participants = 1351; studies = 7; I = 0%; high-certainty evidence).There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lithium for all-cause dropouts (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; participants = 1353; studies = 7; I = 75%; moderate-certainty evidence), and weight gain (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.92; participants = 735, studies = 3; I= 51%; moderate-certainty evidence).Lithium versus antipsychotics or mood stabilisersFor the outcome of inducing a response, there was only very low-certainty evidence regarding lithium compared to haloperidol (MD -.40, 95% CI -6.31 to 1.50; participants = 80; studies = 3; I = 95%), quetiapine (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.55; participants = 335; studies = ; I = 71%), and carbamazepine (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.60; participants = 102; studies = 3; I = 0%).Lithium was probably less likely to induce a response than olanzapine (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; participants = 180; studies = ; I = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence).Lithium may be less likely to induce a response than risperidone (MD 7.28, 95% CI 5.22 to 9.34; participants = 241; studies = 3; I = 49%; low-certainty evidence).There was no evidence of a difference between lithium and valproate (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.70; participants = 607; studies = 5; I = 22%; moderate-certainty evidence).There was moderate-certainty evidence that lithium was more effective than topiramate at treating acute mania (OR .28, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.20; participants = 660; studies = 1).Data on adverse events for these comparisons contained too few studies to provide high-certainty evidence.This systematic review indicates that lithium is more effective than placebo as a treatment for acute mania but increases the risk for somnolence and tremor. Limited evidence suggests little or no difference between lithium and other mood stabilisers (valproate, carbamazepine) or antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, haloperidol). Olanzapine may be an exception, as it is probably slightly more effective than lithium. There is uncertain evidence that risperidone may also be more effective than lithium. Lithium is probably more effective at treating acute mania than topiramate. When compared to placebo, lithium was more likely to cause adverse events. However, when compared to other drugs, too few studies provided data on adverse effects to provide high-certainty evidence. More, rigorously designed, large-scale studies are needed to definitively conclude if lithium is superior to other interventions in treating acute mania.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414382>Enterocin M and Sage Supplementation in Post-weaning Rabbits: Effects on Growth Performance, Caecal Microbiota, Fermentation and Enzymatic Activity.</a></h1><p>The effects of enterocin (Ent) M and sage extract applied separately and in combination were investigated. EntM (E 50 μL/animal/day in water) and sage extract (S 10 μL/animal/day in water) were applied individually and in combination (E+S) to rabbits during 21 days of treatment. The rabbits' growth was not significantly influenced by the additives. Lower feed conversion (FC) was noted in the experimental groups compared with controls, with the lowest data detected in E. The antimicrobial activity of EntM was noted (in E+S: lactic acid bacteria-P < 0.01; in E, E+S: enterococci, enterobacteria-P > 0.05; in E: clostridia-P > 0.05). The most significant changes in fermentation between weaned and older rabbits were noted in amylolytic activity at day 21 (E P < 0.05; E + S P < 0.05); prolonged reduction effect of sage extract on amylolytic activity was observed. The activity of cellulase, pectinase and xylanase was higher in older than in younger animals. Decrease in lactic acid and  was noted during EntM administration, with significant effect on propionic acid concentration (E P < 0.05; E+S P < 0.001). The sage extract reduced propionic acid (S P < 0.001) and butyric acid levels (S P < 0.05) and increased the concentrations of butyric, iso-valeric, valeric, caproic  and lactic acid (P < 0.001).

Key functional groups at the genus level identified by high-throughput sequencing were evaluated as well. The results showed that anaerobic feeding mode and acetate promoted the compact AGS formation with excellent total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (averaging 91.7% ± 4.1%) at various dissolved oxygen conditions. While the aerobic feeding mode led to a loose AGS structure with a vulnerable anaerobic core and poor TN removal efficiency (averaging 58.8% ± 7.4%). Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process played the dominant role in N removal in compact AGS over the alternating nitrification and denitrification process. High-concentration glucose undermined feast-famine condition with filamentous bacteria growth out of granule and decreased TN removal efficiency to 67.3% ± 15.%. Lower food to microorganism ratio may result in a lower N removal rate attributed to the sharply increased biomass concentration fed by glucose. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, and denitrifying phosphorus accumulation organisms enriched during AGS granulation also contributed to the efficient N removal. The proposed strategy provided insights into the relationship between various factors and stable AGS formation, and systemic operation methods for various complicated wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The response of two experimental, continuously stirred tank reactors under mesophilic condition (fed with pig manure) was investigated to analyze the perturbation of organic and hydraulic overloading, and low-temperature shock. The pH was stably maintained in the range of 7.-7.7, regardless of the presence of most simulated perturbation situations. Monitoring of biogas production and composition is important to reflect the current state of biogas process, but cannot predict the imbalance in the system. Accumulation of total VFAs up to 21,718 mg/L was observed under the organic overloading condition (rapid increase of the organic loading rate of pig manure from 3 g VS/L/d to 9 g VS/L/d), but not for other perturbations. The ratio of propionate to acetate and that of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity are rapidly altered in response to all perturbations, indicating their potential to function as stability indicators. However, the determination of the ratio of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity can be performed by simple titration methods and be easily applied to actual projects without significant investment in advanced equipment and skilled operators.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that  alkyl furans and 23  aldehydes including 4 toxic OdβUAs were detected by GC-MS. The original  acid compositions of the oils played a key role in the type and concentration of those  compounds. 4-Hydroxy--hexenal (HHE) and ethyl furan were only detected in PAO with a high content of linolenic acid, while the greatest level of pentyl furan was detected in PO with abundant linoleic acid. Greater amounts of 4-hydroxy-(E)--nonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-(E)--nonenal (ONE) were formed in the OVO with abundant oleic acid. The close relativity of HHE and ethyl furan was also demonstrated. With principal component analysis, these vegetable oils could be discriminated based on their   and  compounds. The loading plot confirmed that HHE and ethyl furan were derived from the linolenic acid oxidation and degradation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The chemometric results showed that the formation of the  components during heating in different vegetable oils has close correlation with the original   composition of vegetable oils. Our research has also confirmed the presence of toxic OɑβUAs in oils after heating. Considering that they are proven to generate lots of degenerative diseases, further studies are needed to establish the risk level of using certain oils in frying and seek effective methods to inhibit their formation.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170585>Effects of ozone treatment on performance and microbial community composition in biofiltration systems treating ethyl acetate vapours.</a></h1><p>Ozone (O) treatment is an effective strategy in maintaining high efficiency and control of biomass accumulation in gas phase biofiltration. However, little is known about the long-term impact of O on the microbial communities. In the present study, two biofilters treating gaseous ethyl acetate were operated continuously for 230 days with inlet loads up to 180 g m∙h. A biofilter operated under continuous O addition (90 ppb) yielded consistently higher removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) compared to the control system. After 120 days of operation, a lower biomass content accompanied by a pH of 1.5 was observed in the ozonated biofilter, which was  units lower compared to the control reactor. Both reactors developed a distinct microbial community composition over the course of 230 days. The bacterial community was dominated in both biofilters by Beijerinckia and Gluconacetobacter, while Rhinocladiella similis, Trichosporon veenhuissi and Exophilia oligosperma were abundant in the fungal community. These findings suggest that ozonation of the biofiltration systems not only reduced clogging, but also contributed to the selection of biomass suitable for degradation of ethyl acetate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to identify the microbial basis of flavor by identifying the combined effects of LD type lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starters and Penicillium camemberti on the generation of metabolites during the ripening process. Metabolomics analyses were performed on three model cheeses: normal cheese, no-mold cheese with only LAB, and no-LAB cheese with only white mold. Aroma compounds and their potential precursors were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and solvent extraction-GC/MS, respectively. Measurements during ripening and multivariate analyses on the data revealed the relationship between the microorganisms and metabolic activities, which were classified into four groups: metabolites generated by LAB and degraded by P. camemberti; metabolites generated by P. camemberti and degraded or inhibited by LAB; metabolites generated by P. camemberti and enhanced by LAB; and metabolites exhibiting no interaction between P. camemberti and LAB.

The relationship among Lactobacillus, Clostridium and Bacillus as key micro-organisms on hydrogen production from organic solid waste was studied. The effect of the HRT (8-48 h) on the hydrogen production and the microbial community was evaluated. Quantitative PCR was applied to determine the abundance of bacteria (in particular, Enterobacter, Clostridium and Lactobacillus genera). An AnSBR fermentative reactor was operated for 111 cycles, with carbohydrate and organic matter removal efficiencies of 80 ± 15·42% and 22·1 ± 4·49% respectively. The highest percentage of hydrogen in the biogas (23· ± 11·1 %), and the specific production rate (0·42 ± 0·16 mmol H gVS  d ) were obtained at an HRT of 48 h. The decrease in the HRT generated an increase in the hydrogen production rate but decreasing the content of the hydrogen in the gas. HRT significantly influence the abundance of Enterobacter, Clostridium and Lactobacillus during the hydrogen production from food waste leading the hydrogen production as well as the metabolic pathways. The microbial analysis revealed a direct relationship between the HRT and the presence of fermentative bacteria (Enterobacter, Clostridium and Lactobacillus genera). Clostridium sp. predominated at an HRT of 48 h, while Enterobacter and Lactobacillus predominated at HRTs between 8 and 24 h. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Significance and Impact of the Study: It was demonstrated that hydrogen production using food waste was influenced by the hydraulic retention time (HRT), and closely related to changes in microbial communities together with differences in metabolic patterns (e.g. , lactate, etc.). The decrease in the HRT led to the dominance of lactic acid bacteria within the microbial community whereas the increase in HRT favoured the emergence of Clostridium bacteria and the increase in acetic and butyric . Statistical data analysis revealed a direct relationship existing between the HRT and the microbial community composition in fermentative bacteria. This study provides new insight into the relationship between the bioprocess operation and the microbial community to understand better and control the biohydrogen production.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424518>Two different Clostridium perfringens strains produce different levels of necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>Subclinical necrotic enteritis (NE) is primarily caused by the gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium perfringens (Cp). The trend towards removal of in-feed antimicrobials and subsequent increased emergence of infection in poultry has resulted in a wide interest in better understanding of the mechanism behind this disease. The virulence of NE, to a large extent, depends on the virulence of Cp strains. Thus, this study was to assess how  different strains of Cp affect performance and gut characteristics of broiler chickens. Ross 308 male broilers (n = 468) were assigned to a  × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments with antibiotics (Salinomycin at 72 ppm and zinc bacitracin at 50 ppm -, or +) and challenge (non-challenge, Cp EHE-NE18, or Cp WER-NE36). Oral administration of Eimeria oocysts (day 9) followed by inoculation with 1 mL 108 CFU Cp strains (day 14 and 15) were used to induce NE. Broiler performance was analyzed at day 10, 24, and 35. On day 16, intestinal lesion score and intestinal pH were evaluated and samples of cecal content were analyzed for bacterial counts and short-chain  acid concentrations (). Birds in both challenged groups showed higher feed conversion ratio (FCR), lower weight gain (P < 0.001), increased lesion scores in the jejunum (P < 0.01), and reduced pH in the ileum and cecum (P < 0.01), compared to the non-challenged birds. They also showed decreased numbers of Bacillus spp. (P < 0.001), and Ruminococcus spp. (P < 0.01) in the cecal content. On day 35, the NE36 challenged birds had a lower weight gain (P < 0.001) and higher FCR (P < 0.001) compared to the NE18 challenged birds. Interestingly, cecal Lactobacillus and lactate were increased by the NE challenge (P < 0.001), and to a greater extent in birds challenged with NE36 compared to the NE18 strain (P < 0.001). This study suggests that Cp strains varying in virulence produce different levels of disease in broiler chickens through modulating the gut environment, intestinal microbiota, and  profile to different extents.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276993>Enhanced production of short-chain   from waste activated sludge by addition of magnetite under suitable alkaline condition.</a></h1><p>Alkaline fermentation technology is an effective method for resource recovery, e.g., short-chain   (SCFAs), but the acidification process needs to be further enhanced.

However, a mutual dependence is developed between the host and symbiotic microbes, which has the potential to extract the energy present in these DF. Dietary fibers escape digestion in the foregut and are fermented in the hindgut, producing short-chain   () that alter the microbial ecology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of pigs. Most of the carbohydrates are fermented in the proximal part, allowing protein fermentation in the distal part, resulting in colonic diseases. The structures of resistant starch (RS), arabinoxylan (AX), and β-glucan (βG) are complex; hence, makes their way into the hindgut where these are fermented and provide energy substrates for the colonic epithelial cells. Different microbes have different preferences of binding to different substrates. The RS, AX and βG act as a unique substrate for the microbes and modify the relative composition of the gut microbial community. The granule dimension and surface area of each substrate are different, which influences the penetration capacity of microbes. Arabinose and xylan are  different hemicelluloses, but arabinose is substituted on the xylan backbone and occurs in the form of AX. Fermentation of xylan produces butyrate primarily in the small intestine, whereas arabinose produces butyrate in the large intestine. Types of RS and forms of βG also exert beneficial effects by producing different metabolites and modulating the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, it is important to have information of different types of RS, AX and βG and their roles in microbial modulation to get the optimum benefits of fiber fermentation in the gut. This review provides relevant information on the similarities and differences that exist in the way RS, AX, and βG are fermented, and their positive and negative effects on  production and gut microbial ecology of pigs.

Insufficient SCFAs productions are associated with type  diabetes (T2D). We used a long-term high-fat diet to simulate the pathogenesis of T2D and studied the effects of baicalin on gut microbiota and metabolites in mice as well as its mechanism, providing a theoretical basis for the treatment of T2D. Baicalin groups were given 200 mg/kg/day, and control groups were given an equal volume of 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution for 15 weeks. 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequences was performed to evaluate the gut microbiota composition, and gas chromatography was used to detect SCFAs in stool samples in the different experimental groups. The abundance of gut microbiota in the high-fat model group was altered, and was associated with a decreased production of SCFAs. The microbiota abundance of the baicalin group was closer to that of the control group, increasing the population of -producing bacteria spp and improving metabolic syndrome, including abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism caused by a high-fat diet. Baicalin may improve abnormalities in glycolipid metabolism by affecting the production of SCFAs.Copyright © 2019.

Microbial load of slices treated with DBD-HVCAP were lower than the control. The efficacy of bacteria reduction by DBD-HVCAP was dependent on the treatment times (P < 0.05). Total viable bacteria count (TVBC) was more than 6.0 Log CFU/g at day 6 for the control kept in air. Slices treated with DBD-HVCAP for all treatment times used had TVBC lower than the limit at day 12. Total  nitrogen base content (TVNB) as well as trimethylamine (TMA) content in slices treated with DBD-HVCAP were lower than that of the control throughout the storage. TVNB as well as TMA contents were lower in HVCAP treated slices in a treatment time-dependent manner. Nevertheless, lipid oxidation in samples treated with DBD-HVCAP was higher than that of the control. Polyunsaturated   were decreased in slices treated with DBD-HVCAP for more than 5 min after 12 days of storage. Therefore DBD-HVCAP treatment for 5 min was demonstrated to be potential means for increasing the shelf-life of Asian sea bass slices with minimal negative effect on chemical and sensory properties, in which they could be stored longer than 12 days at 4 °C.

The predominant bacteria and archaea in stable digesters were Firmicutes and acetoclastic Methanosaeta, respectively, while Bacteroidetes predominated and the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium increased significantly in acidic digesters. Amounts of bacteria and archaea were inhibited in acidic digesters. Our results provide useful information for enhancing efficient methane production and advancing the understanding of the microbiome in HSS-AD of RS and DM at different S/I ratios.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204469>Short chain   contribute to gut microbiota-induced promotion of colonic melatonin receptor expression.</a></h1><p>Melatonin plays an important role in various gut functions through melatonin receptors. The gut microbiota/gut hormone axis has recently received increasing attention. However, the relationship between the gut microbiota and melatonin receptors has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to determine the effect of the gut microbiota on colonic melatonin receptor expression in germ-free (GF) rats and to further explore the potential mechanism in Caco- cells. In this study, GF rats were transplanted with fecal samples from a healthy human donor. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to analyze the microbial communities. Colon tissue was collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The correlations between melatonin receptor expression and the gut microbiota were assessed. Melatonin receptor expression in Caco- cells was detected by Western blot. We found that fecal microbiota transplantation significantly increased the expression of colonic melatonin receptors in GF rats. The amount of fecal Short chain   (SCFAs) was significantly higher in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) rats than in GF rats. -producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats. Additionally, acetate and propionate significantly increased melatonin receptor-1 expression in Caco- cells. Therefore, the gut microbiota may promote melatonin receptor expression, and the mechanism may involve the action of SCFAs. This finding may facilitate the development of new therapeutic treatments for various gastrointestinal disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200141>Linking microbial diversity and population dynamics to the removal efficiency of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in an anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (AO) system.</a></h1><p>The removal efficiencies (REs) of nineteen pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (six antibiotics-clarithromycin, ofloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim -, four β-blockers -atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and sotalol-, two antihypertensives/diuretics -furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide-, three lipid regulators -bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil-, and four psychiatric medications -carbamazepine, diazepam, lorazepam and paroxetine) were ascertained in a pilot-scale anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (AO) system treating urban wastewater, long term operated during two experimental phases using different sets of environmental conditions and operating parameters. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the structure, diversity and population dynamics of bacteria, archaea and fungi communities in the activated sludge. The results showed that mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M) were operational parameters significantly influencing the REs of five of the analyzed PhACs in the AO system. Biota-environment (BIO-ENV) analysis revealed strong correlations between population shifts of the activated sludge community and the REs of PhACs of the different pharmaceutical families. Increased REs of clarithromycin, furosemide, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were concomitant to higher relative abundances of bacterial phylotypes classified within the Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae (Alphaproteobacteria), while those of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Methanomethylovorans (Euryarchaea) correlated positively with the REs of up to seven PhACs belonging to different therapeutic groups.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Boiling influenced nutrient ileal and total tract digestibilities, and production of SCFAs (P < 0.05), but its effect was in general cowpea specific. For instance, boiling increased the apparent ileal proline digestibility of red-hulls cowpea only (P < 0.05), while it only increased the apparent total tract cellulose digestibility of pink-hulls cowpea (P < 0.05). White-hulls cowpea had in general higher nutrient apparent ileal and total tract digestibilities (P < 0.05). For instance, white-hulls cowpea had greater (+.6% units) apparent total tract dry matter digestibility than pink- and red-hulls cowpeas (P < 0.05). In conclusion, boiling influenced several parameters relate to the nutritional value of the cowpeas, but its effect was specific for each cowpea variety.

Selected binary combinations of lactobacilli strains were recently successfully used to inhibit Penicillium commune and Mucor racemosus in four dairy products. Our aim was to identify the compounds most likely involved in their antifungal activity. Four chromatographic methods, targeting 56 antifungal compounds as well as volatiles, were combined. Overall, 53 antifungal compounds were detected, of which 33 were in significantly higher amounts in at least one product inoculated with an antifungal culture compared to the controls. They were present at concentrations below their MIC and thus could act in synergy. Among them, the most commonly identified were acetic, hydroxyphenyllactic, phenyllactic, 3-phenylpropanoic, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic and 5-oxopyrrolidine--carboxylic , diacetyl, acetoin, and an unidentified .

The multi-flower spiciform thyrse of lavender not only determines the output of EOs but also reflects an environmental adaption strategy. With the flower development and blossom in turn, the fluctuation of the  terpenoids displayed a regular change at each axis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of  terpenoids during the process of flowering is poorly understood in lavender. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA-Seq analyses of flowers of five developmental stages at first- and second-axis (FFDSFSA) and initial flower bud (FB0) to discover the active terpenoid biosynthesis as well as flowering-related genes.A total of 56 mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified in the EOs of L. angustifolia 'JX-'. FB0' EO consists of 55 compounds and the two highest compounds, β-trans-ocimene (20.57%) and (+)-R-limonene (17.00%), can get rid of 74.71 and 78.41% aphids in Y-tube olfactometer experiments, respectively. With sequential and successive blossoms, temporally regulated volatiles were linked to pollinator attraction in field and olfaction bioassays. In three characteristic compounds of FFDSFSA' EOs, linalyl acetate (72.73%) and lavandulyl acetate (72.09%) attracted more bees than linalool (45.35%). Many transcripts related to flowering time and  terpenoid metabolism expressed differently during the flower development. Similar metabolic and transcriptomic profiles were observed when florets from the two axes were maintained at the same maturity grade. Besides both compounds and differentially expressed genes were rich in FB0, most  compounds were significantly correlated with FB0-specific gene module. Most key regulators related to flowering and terpenoid metabolism were interconnected in the subnetwork of FB0-specific module, suggesting the cross-talk between the two biological processes to some degree.Characteristic compounds and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest control. The precise control of each-axis flowering and regular emissions at transcriptional and metabolic level are important to pollinators attraction for lavender.

The results revealed that RL could decrease the adhesion force of EPS from 13.46 nN to 1.08 nN, resulting in EPS disintegration layer by layer, decreasing the median particle size by 31.57 μm and releasing abundant soluble organic matter. The cell number of living bacteria remained stable after RL pretreatment (.59 × 10 vs. .66 × 10), indicating that RL has a minimal impact on microbial cells (only ~% bacterial lysis was observed). The kinetic studies of ammonia nitrogen release and  production suggested that, in the RL-pretreated WAS, the reaction rate constants for hydrolysis and acidogenesis were respectively -fold and 1.5-fold higher than those of the control group.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses were carried out to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of 1-MCP on peach aroma from different standpoints:  acid (FA) metabolism, ethylene signal transduction and lipoxygenase/β-oxidation pathway during 20 °C storage. Results indicate that 1-MCP significantly postponed the ethylene climacteric peak appearance and reduced ethylene production through down-regulation of related biosynthesis and signal transduction genes including PpaSAMS1/, PpaACS1/, PpaACO1 together with PpaETR1/, PpaERS1, PpaEIN4 and PpaCTR1. Decrease in the levels of FAs and PpaFADs was observed in treated fruit, except oleic acid and PpaFAD4/5, before day 5 of storage. In addition, 1-MCP-treated fruit also possessed higher levels of C6 aldehydes and alcohols and delayed the formation of  compounds characteristic of peach-like aroma by upregulation of PpaLOX1//3 and PpaHPL1 expression and down-regulation of PpaLOX5 expression. Our findings suggest that inhibition of peach-like volatiles and promotion of green-note volatiles by 1-MCP were associated with ethylene production and modulation of FA levels through transcriptional regulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering tumor is a type of metabolic disease, we investigated the metabolomics changes in serum and tumor after apatinib treatment and the molecular mechanism of characteristic changes associated with its antitumor efficacy. Molecules in serum and tumor tissue were extracted and analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolic platform. Apatinib significantly inhibited e tumor growth and alleviated metabolic rearrangement in both serum and tumor of A549 xenograft mice. Among these endogenous metabolites, 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3-HB) was significantly increased in serum, tumor and liver after apatinib treatment. Interestingly, giving exogenous 3-HB also inhibited tumor growth. Gene expression, dual luciferase reporter gene assay and molecular docking analysis all indicated that apatinib could induce 3-HB production through the dependent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and promotion of  acid utilization in the liver. Therefore, increased content of 3-HB induced by PPARα activation in the liver partially contributed to the antitumor effect of apatinib. It may provide clues to another potential mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of apatinib besides its antiangiogenic effect through inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor .© 2019 The Authors.

A total of 4 iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous corn-soybean meal-based diets were allocated to 12 replicate cages/pens and fed (ad libitum) in a four-phase feeding program (starter; days 0 to 28, grower-1; days 29 to 56, grower-; days 57 to 84, and finisher; days 85 to 126). The diets had either 0 (control), 1E+08 (low), 2E+08 (mid) or 1E+09 (high) cfu B. subtilis/kg. Feed intake (FI) and BW were recorded by phase. Excreta samples were collected towards the end of starter and grower-1 phases for apparent retention (AR) of components by marker method and litter moisture, respectively. Selected birds were necropsied on days 28 and 56 for GIT weight and samples for jejunal histomorphology and ceca digesta short chain   (). Supplemental SSB had linear and non-linear (P < 0.05) response on BW gain (BWG). Specifically, relative to the control, birds fed low SSB had higher BWG in starter and grower-1 phases whereas bird fed mid and high SSB had lower BWG in grower- and birds fed low and mid SSB had higher BWG in finisher phase. Consequently, birds fed low and mid SSB doses were heavier (P < 0.05) than control fed birds at the end of trial. The FCR response to SSB was linear and non-linear (P < 0.05) with birds fed low SSB showing lower FCR than control fed birds in starter, grower-1 and finisher phases. Supplemental SSB had linear and non-linear (P < 0.05) effects on AR of components (DM, ash, crude protein, crude fat, neutral detergent fiber, and gross energy), litter moisture, GIT weight, jejunal histomorphology, and . Relative to control, birds fed high SSB showed higher AR of components, villi height, day 56 ceca digesta total  concentration, and lower litter moisture. In conclusions, under condition of the current study, growth performance was optimized by low to mid SSB. Improved nutrient retention and indices of gut health suggested higher SSB doses may optimize growth performance under challenging farm conditions.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404779>Transformation of raw ewes' milk applying "Grana" type pressed cheese technology: Development of extra-hard "Gran Ovino" cheese.</a></h1><p>This work was carried out to pursue a double objective: to improve the hygienic safety of cheeses produced from raw ewes' milk; and to produce a new typology of raw ewes' milk through the application of "Grana" technology for which the name "Gran Ovino" was chosen. With this in mind, raw milk from an individual farm was transformed under controlled conditions at a dairy pilot plant. The production technology included the partial skimming of the evening and morning milk mixture by cream surfacing and the addition of a natural whey starter cultures (NWSC) prepared with four selected Streptococcus thermophilus strains (PON6, PON244, PON261 e PON413). Ten microbial groups were investigated by plate counts from raw milk until ripened cheeses. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were in the range 10-10 CFU/ml before NWSC addition. After curdling, this group increased by 3 log cycles and was counted at 10 CFU/g after curd cooking. A rapid pH drop (to 6.05) was registered after almost 3 h from NWSC addition. The levels of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were at about 10 CFU/ml in raw milk and decreased after curd cooking to 1 log cycle. A similar behavior was shown by the other undesired microbial groups and a complete disappearance of staphylococci was registered. The microbiological counts of 9-month ripened cheeses showed the dominance of LAB and undetectable levels of the undesired bacteria. MiSeq Illumina was applied to better investigate the bacterial composition of ripened cheeses and this technique evidenced that the majority of OTUs belonged to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera. The final cheeses were characterized by 67.65% dry matter of which 41.85% of fats and 47.02% of proteins. The main cheese   were palmitic, oleic and myristic  and the saturated  /unsaturated   ratio was .17. Forty-one  compounds, including , esters, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols and one terpene were emitted from the cheese.

At an anode potential of -0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the MEC showed COD and VSS removal efficiencies of 73 ± 1% and 75 ± %, respectively. The volumetric current density and specific hydrogen production rate were 23 ± 1. A/m, and 145 ± 4.1 L/m-d, respectively. The anodic microbial community was consisted of various fermentative/hydrolytic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides and Dysgonomonas) and anode-respiring bacteria (Geobacter), while different hydrolytic/fermentative bacteria were abundant in suspension. The MEC showed substantially inferior performance along with a higher accumulation of various  when the anode potential was switched to more positive values (0 V and +0.4 V). Both biofilms and suspended communities were also shifted when the anode potential was changed. Notably, at +0.4 V, Geobacter genus entirely disappeared from the biofilms, while Paludibacter species (known fermentative bacteria) were selectively enriched in biofilms. Also, the relative abundance of genus Bacteroides (known hydrolytic bacteria) substantially decreased in both biofilms and suspension, which was correlated with the inferior hydrolysis of VSS. Quantitative comparison of biofilms and suspended microbial communities at different anode potentials revealed a sharp decrease in bacterial cell numbers in anode biofilms after changing anode potential from -0.4 V to +0.4 V. By contrast, bacterial cell numbers in suspension were slightly decreased. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the role of anode potential in shaping key microbial players associated with hydrolysis/fermentation and anodic respiration processes when MECs are operated with real biowastes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/ MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental colitis 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of colitis, Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10).

The influences of chromatographic conditions on the retention behavior were studied by enantioselective liquid-liquid extraction experiments using the methodology of response surface It was found that -(3-chlorophenyl)propanoic  could be successfully chiral separated by countercurrent chromatography, while no resolution was achieved for racemic -(-chlorophenyl)propanoic  and -(4-chlorophenyl)propanoic  under optimized separation conditions. The formation of 1:1 stoichiometric inclusion compounds between -(3-chlorophenyl)propanoic  and HP-β-CD was determined by UV spectra measurements. The inclusion constants for -(3-chlorophenyl)propanoic  and HP-β-CD were determined by the Benesi-Hildebrand equation. Meanwhile, the inclusion constants of -(3-chlorophenyl)-propanoic acid enantiomer and HP-β-CD were obtained by the pesudophase retention equation in countercurrent chromatography. Furthermore, the inclusion interactions of the three racemates with HP-β-CD were also investigated by the molecular docking. The results obtained from UV spectra measurements and molecular docking showed that the racemate with chlorine substituents in meta-position presented the highest enantiorecognition while the racemates with chlorine substituents in ortho-position had the lowest enantiorecognition. The above results further indicated that forming a stable inclusion complex between racemate and chiral selector is a prerequisite for a successful enantioseparation and at the same time, the difference in inclusion capacity between the two enantiomers is also essential for the enantioseparation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of supplementing SFA in the form of triglycerides (TSFA), as compared to CSFA, on yields, efficiency and diet digestibility in high-yielding dairy cows. Twenty-eight (14 cows in each group) multiparous cows were fed a basal diet supplemented (on DM basis) with either 12 g/kg TSFA (~350 g/cow per day - contained 980 g/kg fat; 882.3 g/kg SFAs) or 14 g/kg CSFA (~440 g/cow per day - contained 800 g/kg fat; 566.4 g/kg SFAs). The supplement amounts in the diet were balanced according to fat content. Rumen samples were taken for measurements of ammonia and  concentrations, and fecal samples were taken for digestibility measurements. The CSFA cows produced 3% higher milk yields (47.6 v. 46. kg/day; P < 0.0001) and 4.7% higher 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM; 44.7 v. 42.7 kg/day; P = 0.02) than the TSFA cows. No difference in milk-fat content was observed, but milk-protein content was higher in the TSFA than CSFA cows. Yields of fat and protein were similar, but lactose yields were higher in TSFA cows. There were no differences in dry matter intake or efficiency calculations between groups. The ruminal ammonia concentrations were similar between groups, whereas acetate concentrations and acetate : propionate ratio were greater for CSFA than TSFA cows. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry (P < 0.0007) and organic matters (P < 0.0003), fat (P < 0.0001), NDF and ADF (P = 0.02) were lower in the TSFA v. CSFA cows. In conclusion, the CSFA-supplemented cows produced 3% higher milk and 4.7% higher 4% FCM than the TSFA cows. However, TSFA supplementation did not depress milk-protein content. The apparent total-tract digestibility was lower for all dietary components in the TSFA cows, which was probably due to the effects of both degree of saturation and triglyceride form of the TSFA supplement. Considering that diets were balanced according to the fat content of the supplements, the lower yields of milk and FCM observed in the TSFA than CSFA cows were likely due to the lower digestibility of the fat and other nutrients in the TSFA cows, which might have negatively influenced the dietary energy content.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572572>Meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties of lambs fed pasture versus mixed diet.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of feeding regimens (pasture vs. mixed diet) on meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties in lamb meat.

Major  compounds in the muscles included hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, octanal, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and ,3-octanedione. The levels of hexanal, nonanal, and ,3-octanedione were significantly lower in PG lamb muscle ( < 0.01). In contrast, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol levels were higher in M lamb muscle ( < 0.01). Muscle from PG lamb exhibited higher catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity ( < 0.05). PG muscle also contained a higher radical-scavenging ability (RSA;  < 0.001) and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC;  < 0.05). Overall, the improved antioxidant status in PG muscle inhibited lipid peroxidation (aldehydes and ketones), thereby improving the meat quality.© 2019 The Authors.

Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on 5 healthy and 5 ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P < 0.05 and fold changes >1.5 or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino , and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase , pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

There is concern that the diet could exacerbate inflammation by modifying microbiota and short-chain  acid () production. We examined the effect of altering dietary FODMAP content on inflammation in preclinical inflammatory models.C57BL/6 mice were given 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5 days and recovered for 3 weeks (postinflammatory, n = 12), or 5 days (positive-control, n = 12). Following recovery, DSS-treated or control mice (negative-control, n = 12) were randomized to -week low- (0.51 g/100 g total FODMAP) or high-FODMAP (4.10 g) diets. Diets mimicked human consumption containing fructose, sorbitol, galacto-oligosaccharide, and fructan. Colons were assessed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological damage. Supernatants were generated for perforated patch-clamp recordings and cytokine measurement. Cecum contents were analyzed for microbiota, , and branched-chain   (BCFA). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni.Inflammatory markers were higher in the positive-control compared with negative-control and postinflammatory groups, but no differences occurred between the two diets within each treatment (MPO P > .99, histological scores P > .99, cytokines P > .05), or the perforated patch-clamp recordings (P > .05). Microbiota clustered mainly based on DSS exposure. No difference in  content occurred. Higher total BCFA occurred with the low-FODMAP diet in positive-control (P < .01) and postinflammatory groups (P < .01).In this preclinical study, reducing dietary FODMAPs did not exacerbate nor mitigate inflammation. Microbiota profile changes were largely driven by inflammation rather than diet. Low FODMAP intake caused a shift toward proteolytic fermentation following inflammation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321841>Effects of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation on skeletal muscle in healthy and cirrhotic rats.</a></h1><p>Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a leucine metabolite with protein anabolic effects. We examined the effects of an HMB-enriched diet in healthy rats and rats with liver cirrhosis induced by multiple doses of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). HMB increased branched-chain amino  (BCAAs; valine, leucine and isoleucine) in blood and BCAA and ATP in muscles of healthy animals. The effect on muscle mass and protein content was insignificant. In CCl4-treated animals alterations characteristic of liver cirrhosis were found with decreased ratio of the BCAA to aromatic amino  in blood and lower muscle mass and ATP content when compared with controls. In CCl4-treated animals consuming HMB, we observed higher mortality, lower body weight, higher BCAA levels in blood plasma, higher ATP content in muscles, and lower ATP content and higher cathepsin B and L activities in the liver when compared with CCl4-treated animals without HMB. We conclude that (1) HMB supplementation has a positive effect on muscle mitochondrial function and enhances BCAA concentrations in healthy animals and () the effects of HMB on the course of liver cirrhosis in CCl4-treated rats are detrimental. Further studies examining the effects of HMB in other models of hepatic injury are needed to determine pros and cons of HMB in the treatment of subjects with liver cirrhosis.© 2019 The Authors.

HRT of 12 h revealed the maximum overall H productivity of 1394.1(±70.6) mL/L/d with contents of 48.9(±.5) and 47.4(±1.4)% for dark- and photo-processes, respectively. Overall substrate removal efficiency (SDE) of 58.9(±4.5)% was registered at HRT o 12 h. High H productivity was ascribed to fermentation type occurred at dark reactor, since acetate and butyrate accounted for 70.9% of . Besides, pH and carbon to nitrogen ratio of dark reactor's effluent at HRT = 12 h were 5.5(±0.1) and 30.0(±.5), respectively which are the optimum levels for photo fermentation process. Moreover, energetic and economic analyses emphasized on the superiority of 12 h-HRT, where net gain energy, daily saving and payback period accounted for 1319.5 kWh/d, 148.7 $/d and 9.8 years, respectively.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cablin patchouli herb (CPH), Atractylodes rhizome (AR), Amur Cork-tree (AC) and Cypsum were mixed with the weight ratios of 1:1:1:0.5 and 1:1:1:1 to make up TCMC1 and TCMC2, respectively. Both TCMC were added at level of 25 g/kg of substrate dry matter.  gas production was recorded and methane concentration was determined at 12 and 24 h of incubation. After 24 h, the incubation was terminated and the inoculants were measured for pH, ammonia nitrogen,  (VFA). Total deoxyribonucleic acid of ruminal microbes was extracted from the inocula, and populations were determined by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Populations of total rumen methanogens, protozoa, total fungi, ,  and  were expressed as a proportion of total rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. Compared with the control, the  TCMC decreased ( ≤ 0.05) total VFA concentration, acetate molar proportion, acetate to propionate ratio, gas and methane productions at 12 and 24 h, hydrogen (H) produced and consumed, and methanogens and total fungi populations, while the  TCMC increased ( ≤ 0.05) propionate molar proportion. Traditional Chinese medicine compound 1 also decreased ( ≤ 0.05)  population. From the present study, it is inferred that there is an effect of the TCMC in suppressing methanogenesis, probably mediated via indirect mode by channeling H utilized for methanogenesis to synthesis of propionate and direct action against the rumen microbes involved in methane formation. In addition, the relative methane reduction potential (RMRP) of TCMC2 was superior to that of TCMC1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174754>Alcohol acyltransferase gene and ester precursors differentiate composition of  esters in three interspecific hybrids of Vitis labrusca × V.

Results showed 'Moldova' showed lower esters content than 'Campbell Early' and 'Catawba' resulting from its limited AAT gene expression and 20 different encoded amino . The  esters compositions of 'Campbell Early' and 'Catawba' in both vintages were different. Correlation analysis revealed that concentrations of hexyl acetate, -phenethyl acetate, ethyl (E,E)-,4-hexadienoate and ethyl phenylacetate were related to their corresponding alcohols level, whereas threonine and alanine affected ethyl heptanoate formation.

A sample of 32 Friesian cows, balanced for parity, milk production, and days in milk, were randomly assigned to  groups. The control group (CG) was fed with a conventional feeding strategy, while the experimental group (SeG) received a daily selenomethionine supplementation of 0.45 mg/kg in total mixed ration. During the experimental period, milk yield was monitored, and samples of milk and caciocavallo cheese were collected and analyzed to obtain information on chemical-nutritional composition and  compounds profile. Dietary Se integration did not induce variations on milk yield or composition but significantly lowered the somatic cell count (SCC). In both milk and cheese, samples from SeG were characterized by a lower concentration of saturated   (SFA) and increases in linoleic and rumenic . The  compounds profile of dairy products was also positively affected by dietary Se intake, with an increase in concentration of free  , esters, and aldehydes. These results suggest that Se plays a positive role in improving bovine mammary gland functionality and the nutraceutical properties of milk and caciocavallo cheese made therefrom. Such findings could contribute to the production of cheeses with interesting organoleptic properties, although further sensorial evaluations should be performed to deeply investigate these changes and confirm consumer acceptability.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In addition, the effects of adding solid residues of previous fermentation cycles, and of fungus α-amylase and W. anomalus HN006 supplementation on the biochemical parameters of lily rice wine were evaluated. The optimum quality of the wine, in terms of ethanol and residual sugar content, acidity levels and aroma, was obtained with 5% (w/v) solid residue addition, and supplementation with 10 U/g fungal α-amylase and % (v/v) W. anomalus inoculum on the 4th day of fermentation.  compound profiles, the total amount of amino  and the sensory characteristics of the lily rice wines produced by the two fermentation processes were also evaluated and compared. The lily rice wine obtained from our optimized experimental technology produced higher amounts of some esters, free  , alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, alkenes,  phenol and thiazole, in addition to higher total amino acid content and sensory scores compared to the traditionally brewed wine.

Twenty-four Holstein calves ( d old) in hutches were used in a 12-wk randomized complete block design study. Calves were blocked by birth date and sex. Treatments were (1) control (CON) with no supplement and () 50 g/d of CWS. Preweaning CWS was fed with milk and postweaning CWS was top-dressed on starter pellets. Calves were fed .83 L of pasteurized milk ×/d during wk 1 to 5, 1×/d in wk 6, and weaned at d 42. Calves had ad libitum access to starter pellets and water. Individual intakes of milk and starter pellets were measured daily. Fecal scores (0 = firm, 3 = watery) and respiratory scores (healthy ≤3, sick ≥5), calculated from the sum of scores for rectal temperature, cough, ocular, and nasal discharge, were recorded daily. Body weights (BW), frame growth, and jugular blood samples were taken once every week at 3 h after the morning feeding. Fecal grab samples were collected in wk 12 for analysis of apparent total-tract digestibility. Data were analyzed using MIXED procedures of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with repeated measures. Total dry matter intake was greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Calves fed CWS tended to have greater BW during the postweaning period. Gain:feed, average daily gains, withers heights, and concentrations of plasma urea nitrogen were not different. Concentrations of plasma β-hydroxybutyrate were greater in calves fed CWS compared with CON. Serum glucose concentrations were greater in calves fed CON during the preweaning stage, but similar concentrations were found between treatments during the postweaning stage. Rumen pH, ammonia-N, and total  were similar between treatments. The acetate:propionate ratio was greater in calves fed CWS. The apparent total-tract digestion of nutrients was similar; however, CON tended to have greater digestion of neutral detergent fiber. Fecal scores were not different, but a treatment by week interaction was observed. Supplementing CWS improved starter intake, postweaning BW, β-hydroxybutyrate, fecal scores, and maintained frame growth.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-eight uncastrated, crossbreed lambs with an average initial weight of 22.6 ± .37 kg were used in the experiment. The treatments consisted of a standard diet (control) containing buffelgrass and spineless cactus and three diets containing cactus as the only roughage source plus varied concentrations of WB (30, 37, and 44%, on a dry matter basis). Results were evaluated by analysis of variance, and contrasts were applied at the 5% probability level for mean comparison. Rumen villus height and width were greater and musculature was lower in the lamb fed diets containing 37% and 44% WB compared with those fed control diet. In the intestine, the crypts were smaller in the animals which consumed the diets with 30, 44, and 37% WB. All WB levels resulted in lower nitrogen intake and retention. Microbial protein concentration, microbial protein efficiency, microbial nitrogen, urea, and glucose were not significantly affected. Feeding lamb with diets containing levels of wheat bran, with cactus as the only roughage source, does not negatively affect their ruminal-fermentation, blood, and urinary characteristics; ammoniacal nitrogen concentration; pH; or microbial protein.

Here, we examined the impact of the microbiota on CD8 T cell memory. Antigen-activated CD8 T cells transferred into germ-free mice failed to transition into long-lived memory cells and had transcriptional impairments in core genes associated with oxidative metabolism. The microbiota-derived short-chain  acid () butyrate promoted cellular metabolism, enhanced memory potential of activated CD8 T cells, and SCFAs were required for optimal recall responses upon antigen re-encounter. Mechanistic experiments revealed that butyrate uncoupled the tricarboxylic acid cycle from glycolytic input in CD8 T cells, which allowed preferential fueling of oxidative phosphorylation through sustained glutamine utilization and  acid catabolism. Our findings reveal a role for the microbiota in promoting CD8 T cell long-term survival as memory cells and suggest that microbial metabolites guide the metabolic rewiring of activated CD8 T cells to enable this transition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have the potential to effectively convert manure into high-quality fertilizer. The aims of this investigation were to observe the organic matter transformation of different livestock manures and  (VFAs), and to evaluate the end product quality. Three types of manure [chicken (T1), pig (T2), and cow (T3)] were inoculated with BSFL (1.:7 ratio on fresh weight basis), three types without BSFL were used as control (T4, T5, and T6), and both were composted for 9 days. The results showed that the BSFL composting reduced the organic matter by 20.31-22.18% and the accumulation of VFAs by 25.58-80.08% as compared to the control. BSFL composting greatly decreased the nitrogen, by 6.08-14.37%. The employment of BSFL significantly increased the total phosphorous (TP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total nutrients by 42.30-64.16%, 45.41-88.17%, and 26.51-33.34%, respectively. This study showed that employing BSFL could improve the quality of the product and the maturity degree of the composting. Therefore, the BSFL could be added as a high-efficiency transformation agent for converting organic manure into stable compost, especially in developing countries, where adopting technical devices for composting is expensive and difficult to manipulate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the profiles of  compounds (4  , 6 higher alcohols and 12 esters) from 34 European ciders were studied using HS-SPME-GC-MS. Volatiles were isolated by HS-SPME using a CAR/PDMS fiber. Analytical data were statistically evaluated using principal component analysis, and differences in composition of volatiles between cider produced using "intensified" technologies and that of ciders produced by traditional production processes were demonstrated. This difference was mainly due to varying contents of some higher alcohols (-methylpropanol, isoamyl alcohols, hexanol, and butane-,3-diol) and esters (ethyl -methylbutanoate, butylacetate, and hexyl acetate).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467327>Circulating but not faecal short-chain   are related to insulin sensitivity, lipolysis and GLP-1 concentrations in humans.</a></h1><p>Microbial-derived short-chain   () acetate, propionate and butyrate may provide a link between gut microbiota and whole-body insulin sensitivity (IS).

In a subgroup (n = 93), IS was determined using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age and BMI. Fasting circulating acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations were positively associated with fasting GLP-1 concentrations. Additionally, circulating  were negatively related to whole-body lipolysis (glycerol), triacylglycerols and free   levels (standardized (std) β adjusted (adj) -0.190, P = 0.023; std β adj -0.202, P = 0.010; std β adj -0.306, P = 0.001, respectively).

We discuss the impact of SCFAs in the duodenal defense mechanisms and in the gastrointestinal (GI) pathogenesis.Luminal SCFAs augment the duodenal mucosal defenses via release of serotonin (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptide- (GLP-) from enteroendocrine cells. Released GLP- protects the small intestinal mucosa from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy.

This study was to evaluate bacterial and archaeal composition of gut flora and the corresponding metabolism performance of these micro-organisms in fecal samples of patients with ALS.A comparative study was performed on the intestinal microbiota from eight patients with ALS and eight healthy individuals at Huadong Hospital during November 2017 to April 2018; meanwhile, the metabolite concentrations of human endotoxin, short-chain   (), NO2-N/NO3-N, and γ-aminobutyric acid were also evaluated by spectrophotometry methods. The correlations between intestinal microbiota and metabolite concentration were compared between the two groups using one-way analysis of variance; the relative abundance of beneficial and harmful micro-organisms in fecal samples was also analyzed.In general, the richness and evenness of bacterial and archaeal communities of healthy individuals were healthier than that of patients with ALS. The phylum Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, genus Methanobrevibacter showed an enhancive tendency in patients with ALS, whereas the relative abundance of beneficial micro-organisms (genera Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides) presented a significant decrease tendency in patients with ALS.

At a FW/CM ratio of 3.5:1 (based on  solids), the mixed liquor pH was always above 8.0 and no apparent  (VFAs) accumulation occurred even at the highest OLR of 11.9 g COD/L/day (hydraulic retention time as 10 days and solid retention time as 15.5 days, correspondingly), indicating a very stable operation condition which resulted in an average CH yield as high as 250 mL/g COD and CH production as high as .71 L CH/L/day. The hardly biodegradable organic components, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, were effectively degraded by 78.3%, 58.8%, and 47.5%, respectively. Significantly high anaerobic digestion reaction ratios, especially the hydrolysis ratio which is usually the limiting factor, were calculated based on experimental results. Furthermore, the high lignocellulase contents and coenzyme F levels, along with the decrease of cellulose crystallinity from 72.6% to 16.4% in the feedstock, provided strong evidence of an enhanced biological activity by CM addition. By high-throughput sequencing analysis, more abundant and diverse bacterial, archaeal, and fungal genera were identified from the DMBR sludge. With CM addition, the biodegradation of lignocellulose might have produced sufficient H and CO for the hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as Methanoculleus, Methanomassiliicoccus, and Methanobacterium, which were highly tolerant to ammonium inhibition, and then the elevated ammonium level would have provided high buffering capacity in the DMBR thus ensuring a stable condition for high rate FW digestion and CH production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study included  experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is .76 kcal/g. In Exp. , a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 5 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin  gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal  concentration, which subsequently enhanced the barrier function and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212318>Genetic parameters of plasma and ruminal  in sheep fed alfalfa pellets and genetic correlations with enteric methane emissions1.</a></h1><p>Animal-to-animal variation in methane (CH4) emissions determined in respiration chambers has a genetic basis, but rapid phenotyping methods that can be applied on-farm are required to enable increased genetic progress by the farming industry. Fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen results in the formation of VFA with hydrogen (H2) as a byproduct that is used for CH4 formation. Generally, fermentation pathways leading to acetate are associated with the most H2 production, less H2 formation is associated with butyrate production, and propionate and valerate production are associated with reduced H2 production. Therefore, VFA may constitute a potential correlated proxy for CH4 emissions to enable high-throughput animal screening. The objective of the present study was to determine the genetic parameters for ruminal and plasma VFA concentrations in sheep fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pellets and their genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations with CH4 emissions. Measurements of CH4 emissions in respiration chambers and ruminal (stomach tubing 18 h from last meal) and blood plasma (3 h post-feeding) VFA concentrations were made on 1,538 lambs from 5 birth years (2007 and 2009 to 2012) aged between 5 and 10 mo, while the animals were fed alfalfa pellets at .0 times maintenance requirements in  equal size meals (0900 and 1500 h). These measurements were repeated twice (rounds) 14 d apart. Mean (± SD) CH4 production was 24.4 ± 3.08 g/d, and the mean CH4 yield was 15.8 ± 1.51 g/kg DMI. Mean concentration of total ruminal VFA was 52. mM, with concentrations of acetate, propionate and butyrate of 35.97, 8.83, and 4.02 mM, respectively. Ruminal total VFA concentration had heritability (h2) and repeatability estimates (± SE) of 0.24 ± 0.05 and 0.35 ± 0.03, respectively, and similar estimates were found for acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Blood plasma concentrations of VFA had much lower estimates of h2 and repeatability than ruminal VFA. Genetic correlations with CH4 yield were greatest for total concentrations of ruminal VFA and acetate, with 0.54 ± 0.12 and 0.56 ± 0.12, respectively, which were much greater than their corresponding rp. The rp and rg of ruminal VFA proportions and blood VFAs with CH4 emissions were in general lower than for ruminal VFA concentrations. However, minor ruminal VFA proportions had also moderate rg with CH4 yield. Pre-feeding concentrations of total VFA and acetate were the strongest correlated proxies to select sheep that are genetically low CH4 emitters.© The Author(s) 2019.

Male Holstein calves (n = 158) transported from auction barns and local dairy farms were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 decoquinate-containing CMR for the first 49 d of the experiment: all milk protein and no additives (CONT); 15% of crude protein (CP) replaced with spray-dried porcine plasma, no additives (PLM); or all milk protein and an added combination of sodium butyrate (rate 1.4 kg of butyric acid/Mt) and Bacillus subtilis (1.28 million cfu/g of feed; BB). All milk replacers were formulated to contain 26% CP and 17% fat, .4% Lys, and 0.8% Met, and were bucket-fed at daily feeding rates of 520 g during wk 1 and , 650 g during wk 3, and 900 g during wk 4 and 5, in a total of 4, 5, and 6 L of solution, respectively. Calves were offered texturized calf starter (18% CP) upon arrival until wk 3 and transitioned to a corn and pellet ration with % straw (18.1% CP). No prophylactic administration of antibiotics occurred. All calves were gradually weaned over a -wk period. Calves were individually housed until weaned and then housed in groups of 5 in a mechanically ventilated facility in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Fecal scores, treatments administered (antibiotic or supportive therapy), and mortalities were recorded daily. Body weight was measured using a digital scale at arrival and at 14, 49, 56, and 78 d after arrival. No differences were found among the groups with respect to growth, feed efficiency, or incidence of diarrhea or respiratory infection treatment. Calves supplemented with BB had a greater hazard of mortality over the growing period compared with CONT. An interaction was found between the BB group and the level of total serum protein, with the BB group having a lower proportion of days with a fecal score of 3 when the calves had a higher total serum protein level. Calves fed PLM had a lower proportion of d with a fecal score of 3 relative to CONT but no difference in the proportion of d with a fecal score of  or higher. This study found that the addition of spray-dried plasma in CMR reduced diarrhea severity; however, supplementing BB was associated with a higher hazard of calf mortality and had a varying response on fecal score.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soluble fibre supplementation, with and without a probiotic, on plasma short chain   (), airway inflammation, asthma control and gut microbiome in adults with asthma.A randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled 3-way cross-over trial in 17 subjects with stable asthma at the Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, Australia. Subjects received 3 × 7 day oral interventions in random order; soluble fibre (inulin 12 g/day), soluble fibre + probiotic (inulin 12 g/day + multi-strain probiotic >25 billion CFU) and placebo. Plasma , sputum cell counts and inflammatory gene expression, asthma control gut microbiota, adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms were measured.There was no difference in change in total plasma  levels (μmol/L) in the placebo versus soluble fibre (Δmedian [95% CI] 16·3 [-16·9, 49·5], p = 0·335) or soluble fibre+probiotic (18·7 [-14·5, 51·9], p = 0·325) group.

II: Impact on   acid absorption.</a></h1><p>Diet is known to affect rumen growth and development. Calves fed an all-liquid diet have smaller and less developed rumens and a decreased ability to absorb  (VFA) compared to calves fed both liquid and dry feed. However, it is unknown how rumens respond when challenged with a defined concentration of VFA. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of  different feeding programs on VFA absorption in preweaned calves. Neonatal Holstein bull calves were individually housed and randomly assigned to 1 of  diets. The diets were milk replacer only (MRO; n = 5) or milk replacer with starter (MRS; n = 6). Diets were isoenergetic (3.87 ± 0.06 Mcal of metabolizable energy per day) and isonitrogenous (0.17 ± 0.003 kg/d of apparent digestible protein). Milk replacer was 22% crude protein, 21.5% fat (dry matter basis). The textured calf starter was 21.5% crude protein (dry matter basis). Feed and ad libitum water intakes were recorded daily. Calves were exposed to a defined concentration of VFA buffer (acetate 143 mM, propionate 100 mM, butyrate 40.5 mM) 6 h before euthanasia on d 43 ± 1. Rumen fluid samples were obtained every 15 to 30 min for 6 h to measure the rate of VFA absorption. Rumen tissues were obtained from the ventral sac region and processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analyses of the VFA transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4). Body growth did not differ between diets, but empty reticulorumens were heavier in MRS than MRO calves (0.67 vs. 0.39 ± 0.04 kg) and MRS calves had larger papillae areas (0.76 vs. 15 ± 0.08 mm). We observed no differences between diets in terms of the abundance of MCT1 and MCT4 per unit area. These results indicate that the extrapolated increase in total abundance of MCT1 or MCT4 in MRS calves was not due to increased transporter density per unit area. Modeled VFA absorption metrics (flux, mmol/h, or 6 h absorbed VFA in mmol) were not different across diets. These results demonstrate that the form of calfhood diet, whether solely MR or MR and starter, does not alter VFA absorption capacity when the rumen is exposed to a defined concentration of VFA at 6 wk of age.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

I: Impact on growth and development.</a></h1><p>Preweaning diet is known to affect rumen tissue appearance at the gross level. The objectives of this experiment were to investigate effects of different preweaning diets on the growth and development of the rumen epithelium and on putative rumen epithelial stem and progenitor cell measurements at the gene and cell levels. Neonatal Holstein bull calves (n = 11) were individually housed and randomly assigned to 1 of  diets. The diets were milk replacer only (MRO; n = 5) or milk replacer with starter (MRS; n = 6). Diets were isoenergetic (3.87 ± 0.06 Mcal of metabolizable energy per day) and isonitrogenous (0.17 ± 0.003 kg/d of apparent digestible protein). Milk replacer was 22% crude protein, 21.5% fat (dry matter basis). The textured calf starter was 21.5% crude protein (dry matter basis). Water was available ad libitum and feed and water intake were recorded daily. Putative stem and progenitor cells were labeled by administering a thymidine analog (5-bromo-'-deoxyuridine, BrdU; 5 mg/kg of body weight in sterile saline) for 5 consecutive days and allowed a 25-d washout period. Calves were killed at 43 ± 1 d after a 6 h exposure to a defined concentration of . We obtained rumen tissue from the ventral sac and used it for immunohistochemical analyses of BrdU (putative stem and progenitor cells) and Ki67 (cell proliferation), gene expression analysis, and morphological measurements via hematoxylin and eosin staining. Epithelial stem and progenitor cell gene markers of interest, analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, were β1-integrin, keratin-14, notch-1, tumor protein p63, and leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5. Body growth did not differ by diet, but empty reticulorumens were heavier in MRS calves (MRS: 0.67 ± 0.04 kg; MRO: 0.39 ± 0.04 kg). The percentage of label-retaining BrdU basale cells was higher in MRO calves than in MRS calves (.0 ± 0.3% vs. 0.3 ± 0.%, respectively). We observed a higher percentage of basale cells undergoing proliferation in MRS calves than in MRO calves (18.4 ± .6% vs. 10.8 ± .8%, respectively). Rumen epithelial gene expression was not affected by diet, but the submucosa was thicker in MRO calves and the epithelium and corneum/keratin layers were thicker in MRS calves. Presumptive stem and progenitor cells in the rumen epithelium were identifiable by their ability to retain labeled DNA in the long term, changed proliferative status in response to diet, and likely contributed to observed treatment differences in rumen tissue thickness.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

To date, knowledge of the influence of climatic factors in association with other potential influencing factors on colostrum quality is scarce. Associated influential factors are parity, body condition score, length of dry period, ration fed ante partum (AP), β-hydroxybutyrate postpartum (PP), milk yield, milk fat and protein, as well as somatic cell counts from previous and current lactation. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of barn climate and the aforementioned factors on colostrum quality. Data were collected from 1,381 multiparous Holstein Friesian cows kept on one dairy farm over a period of one year (August 2014 to August 2015). Colostrum was harvested on farm within 1 h PP. The quantity and quality of first colostrum (estimated by Brix refractometry) were recorded for each cow. Additional data recorded were parity, body condition score at drying off, length of dry period, ration fed AP, milk yield data from previous and current lactation, milk somatic cell counts, and β-hydroxybutyrate PP. During the study period, temperature and humidity were recorded in the barn every hour, and temperature-humidity-index (THI) was calculated. Linear regression was performed with colostrum quality as the dependent variable. In the final model, colostrum quantity (L), length of dry period, parity, and climatic factors (specifically, median humidity in the 3rd week AP and hours with THI ≥72 in the last 14 and 21 d AP, respectively) were significant. Colostrum quality improved with parity and length of dry period and decreased with colostrum quantity, humidity, and hours with a THI ≥72. A classification and regression tree analysis revealed that colostrum quantity was the most important factor in this model [normalized importance (NI) 100%]. Parity (NI 42.7%), length of dry period (NI 37.1%), and climatic factors (NI 0.4 to 1.9%) followed with decreasing importance. These results indicate that the most important factors for colostrum quality (i.e., colostrum quantity and parity) may not be influenced by management. The  factors that can be influenced by management [i.e., length of dry period and THI (e.g., by cooling)], were quantitatively of minor importance compared with the other  factors. Further studies are necessary to determine whether changing these factors can improve colostrum quality significantly.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was -25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303943>Prevalence of precancerous cervical lesions in women attending Mezam Polyclinic Bamenda, Cameroon.</a></h1><p>Precancerous cervical lesion is significantly a health problem globally.

The pattern of cross-resistance for the TrpLeu mutation is still ambiguous. In this paper, mutant homozygote (1999Leu/Leu, RR) and wild type (1999Trp/Trp, SS) B. syzigachne plants with the same genetic background were purified from the JS-26 population using the dCAPS method. The activity of ACCase in RR and SS was determined. Then, the cross-resistance pattern to ACCase inhibiting herbicides of the TrpLeu mutation was determined using the whole-plant method. ACCase activity showed that the TrpLeu mutation decreased ACCase sensitivity to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl by .73-fold. A dose-response experiment indicated that the TrpLeu mutation conferred high resistance to quizalofop-p-ethyl (20.29-fold), metamifop (12.22-fold) and pinoxaden (18.60-fold), moderate resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (8.20-fold) and sethoxydim (6.38-fold), low resistance to cyhalofop-butyl (.73-fold) and no resistance to clodinafop-propargyl (1.42 fold) and clethodim (1.59-fold).

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged  to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a -week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for  weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and  analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower  concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain  Acid Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain   (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are conflicting.

The CS was pretreated by water freezing-thawing (water-FT) and ammonia freezing-thawing (ammonia-FT), and then pretreated and untreated CS were anaerobically digested in three continuously stirred tank biodigesters (CSTBRs) at three organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.6, 1.8 and .0 gVS L d. The analyses showed that pH value and  (VFAs) concentration of three systems were in reasonable ranges of 6.8-7.5 and 160-330 mg L, respectively. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in R3 system ranged from 600 mg L to 1300 mg L, which was conducive to maintain system stability. The removal amount of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of CS by ammonia-FT pretreatment was 17.3-20.5% higher than that of water-FT pretreatment.

However, the high solid AD of chicken manure has been a challenge due to the inhibition effects caused by high ammonia levels. In this study, the addition of 280 mg/L Fe and  mg/L Ni has been proven to enhance the microbial activity and to overcome inhibition under the stressed environment. The mesophilic digesters feeding with total solid around 150 g/kg operated at an organic loading rate of 4.8 g/(L d) based on  solid and a 20-day hydraulic retention time. The total ammonia-nitrogen reached around 6.8 g/L in control and Fe-Ni digesters. The results from the 147-day continuously-fed experiment provided an increment of 34% methane production and a 29% reduction of  against control. The acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity was increased by 89% and 40% respectively. The high throughout sequencing results showed an increased percentage of Methanosarcina sp., which may have contributed to the shifting of the methanogenic pathway towards acetoclastic methanogenesis. The positive effects of Fe and Ni supplementation obtained in this study lay the foundation for its use in AD of nitrogen rich materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Tanker milk from 55 groups of farms (264 farms in total) in France, Slovakia, and Slovenia was collected twice during the indoor season and 3 times during the outdoor season. The tanker rounds were selected in each country to be balanced according to their origin (lowland or upland) and within upland or lowland groups, according to the forage systems: corn-based or grass-based forage system. At each milk sampling, the production conditions were recorded through on-farm surveys. The milk was analyzed for gross composition, carotenoids, minerals,  , phenolic compound derivatives,  organic compound concentrations, and color. The milk from upland and lowland areas differed in their contents of a few constituents. Upland milk was richer in not identified (n.i.) retention time (Rt) 13,59, 4-methylpentylbenzene, 1-methyl--n-hexylbenzene, and β-caryophyllene than lowland milk. These differences could be most likely attributable to the utilization of highly diversified and extensively managed semi-natural grasslands. The higher forbs content of upland pastures could be related as well to the richness in C18:3n-3, CLA cis-9,trans-11, MUFA, and PUFA we observed in upland compared with lowland milk during the outdoor season. In contrast, grazing on lowland pastures rich in grasses gave a yellower milk that was richer in β-carotene. Out of the few compounds showing a significant effect of origin or its interaction, most of the milk constituents were unaffected by the origin at all. However, almost all milk constituents differed according to the forage system and the season, and the differences observed between seasons can be attributed to differences in the cow diet composition.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the synergistic effects of ad libitum milk replacer (MR) feeding and butyrate supplementation of MR on rumen and small intestinal growth and on gene expression in the small intestine related to growth and energy metabolism at weaning. Male Holstein calves (n = 32) received colostrum from birth to d 3 of age and MR either ad libitum (Adl) or restrictively (Res; 6 L of MR/d; 12.5% solids) with (AdlB+, ResB+) or without (AdlB-, ResB-) 0.24% butyrate from d 4 until wk 8 of age. From wk 9 to 10, all calves were weaned and were fed  L/d until the end of the trial. Concentrate, hay, and water were freely available. At d 80, calves were slaughtered,  were measured in rumen fluid, and rumen and small intestine samples were taken for histomorphometric measurements. The expression of mRNA associated with the local insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and glucose metabolism as well as lactase and maltase activities were measured in the intestinal mucosa. The small intestine was 3 m longer in Adl than in Res. In the atrium ruminis, papilla width was greater in Res than in Adl. Villus circumference, cut surface, and height in the duodenum, proximal jejunum, and ileum were greater in Adl than in Res and in the proximal, mid, and distal jejunum and ileum were greater in calves treated with butyrate. Crypt depth in the duodenum and proximal jejunum was greater in Adl than in Res and in the ileum was smaller in calves treated with butyrate. The villus height:crypt depth ratio was greatest in AdlB+ calves. In the proximal and mid jejunum, IGF1 mRNA abundance was lower in calves treated with butyrate. In the proximal jejunum, INSR mRNA abundance was greater in Res than in Adl. The abundance of PCK2 mRNA was greater in Res than in Adl in the duodenum and was greatest in ResB- in the mid jejunum. Lactase activity tended to be greater in Res than in Adl and after butyrate treatment in the proximal jejunum. The results indicated an elevated growth of the small intestinal mucosa at weaning due to intensive milk feeding and butyrate supplementation, and the local IGF system was involved in intestinal growth regulation. Rumen development was not affected by butyrate supplementation of MR and was slightly delayed due to ad libitum MR feeding.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Four dietary supplementation treatments were imposed; non-supplementation (control, T1); supplementation of RP fed at % of DMI (low, T2); supplementation of RP fed at 4% of DMI (medium, T3) and supplementation of RP fed at 6% of DMI (high, T4). All cattle were given a concentrate supplement at 1 % of body weight while Napier grass was provided as a free choice.The findings revealed that RP supplementation did not negatively affect (P>0.05) DM intake of Napier grass, while RP intake and total DMI were the greatest in the RP supplementation at 4 and 6%DMI. Nevertheless, the nutrients (DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF) digestibilities were not changed in the RP supplementation groups. Rumen fermentation parameters especially those of total , acetate and butyrate were not significantly changed. However, the propionate concentration was remarkably increased (P<0.05) in the RP supplementation. Notably, the ratio of acetate to propionate, the number of protozoa, as well as the methane estimation were significantly reduced in the RP supplemented groups (4 and 6 % of DMI), while the counts of bacteria was not altered.Supplementation of RP (4% of DMI) improved rumen propionate production, reduced protozoal population and methane estimation (P<0.05) without a negative effect on DM consumption and nutrients total tract digestibilities in beef cattle.

Treated stalks were ensiled in 5-litre laboratory silos for 30, 60, and 90 d. The S and SL silages had a greater ( < 0.001) pH and greater crude protein, ammonia nitrogen/total nitrogen, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, and ethanol contents at all three ensiling periods than the U silage. Acetate, propionate and  in the S and SL silages after 30 and 90 d of ensiling were greater ( < 0.05) than those in the U silage, but they were lower ( < 0.05) in the S and SL silages than in the U silage after 60 d. The lactate and V-score of the S and SL silages were lower ( < 0.001) than those of the U silage at all three ensiling periods.

This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of RO and flaxseed oil (FO) supplementation on nutrients digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters and rumen FA profile of dairy cows. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of four treatments for 8 weeks, including basal diet (CON) or the basal dietary supplemented with 4% RO, 4% FO or % RO plus % FO on a DM basis. Compared with CON, dietary oil supplementation improved the total tract apparent digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fibre and ether extracts ( P 0.05), whereas oil groups significantly changed the   acid (VFA) profile by increasing the proportion of propionate whilst decreasing total VFA concentration, the proportion of acetate and the ratio of acetate to propionate ( P 0.05). In addition, dietary oil supplementation increased the total unsaturated FA proportion in the rumen by enhancing the proportion of trans-11 C18:1 vaccenic acid (VA), cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) ( P &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that dietary supplementation with RO and FO could improve nutrients digestibility, ruminal fermentation and ruminal FA profile by enhancing the VA, cis-9, trans-11 CLA and ALA composition of lactating dairy cows.

Moreover, using HCl in edible foods is also a health concern. Replacing HCl with organic  for acid-aided solubilization could address these problems. The aim was to study the effect of organic acid (glacial acetic acid) as a replacement for HCl during pH shift processing on the characteristics and functionality of rohu (Labeo rohita) protein isolates. Rohu proteins were obtained by solubilizing at pH 3.0 and pH 11.0 using glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide (10 mol L ).Results showed that solubilization at pH 11.0 gave higher protein yields (766.8 ± .4 g kg ) compared to solubilization at pH 3.0 (735.7 ± 7.1 g kg ) (P < 0.05). Isolates from acid-aided solubilization had higher whiteness and total pigment content over isolates obtained by alkali-aided solubilization. Rohu isolates recovered by alkaline solubilization showed higher water and oil holding capacity, gel strength, folding scores, foaming and emulsion capacity than acid processed isolates (P < 0.05). Solubilization of rohu proteins using glacial acetic acid produced isolates with low breaking force (149.0 g), low storage modulus (G') values and low folding test score (1.0) over the alkaline isolates (P < 0.05).Results indicated that, recovering rohu proteins using organic acid (glacial acetic acid) could produce isolates with poor functional properties, while using the organic acid to precipitate the proteins solubilized by alkali-aided processing could produce proteins with better yields and functionality. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385316>Effects of silencing TT8 and HB12 on in vitro nutrients degradation and VFA production in relation to molecular structures of alfalfa (Medicago sativa).</a></h1><p>Transparent Testa8 (TT8) and Homeobox12 (HB12) are two transcriptional factors in plant phenylpropanoid pathways and were reported to be positively related to lignin content. Alfalfa with silenced TT8 (TT8i) and HB12 (HB12i) was therefore generated using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. Although lignin was found to be high in HB12i, such gene-silencing of alfalfa resulted in nutrient profiles that might be suitable for grazing. To extend the nutritional evaluation of transformed alfalfa, ground samples of 11 HB12i, 5 TT8i and 4 wild type (WT) were incubated in rumen fluid : buffer solution for 0, , 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h at 39 °C. Dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradations at each time point, and production of  (VFA) at 4, 12, 24 and 48 h were analyzed, as well as degradation and production kinetics. The correlations and regressions between nutritive profiles and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectral parameters were determined.Both transformed genotypes had lower DM degradation and HB12i had lower VFA production compared with WT. Structural carbohydrate (STC) parameters were found to be negatively correlated with DM degradation and VFA production. The kinetics of DM degradation and VFA production were predicted from spectral parameters with good estimation power.Silencing of HB12 and TT8 affected fermentation characteristics of alfalfa and some fermentation characteristics were predictable from spectral parameters using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450982>Butyrolactone-I, an efficient α-glucosidase inhibitor, improves type  diabetes with potent TNF-α-lowering properties through modulating gut microbiota in db/db mice.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of butyrolactone-I (A6) on type  diabetes (T2D) in db/db mice because A6 was found to inhibit α-glucosidase activities and TNF-α release, which were associated with improving T2D.

Glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and persistent intestinal flora disturbance are common in CKD. Short-chain   (SCFAs), produced by the intestinal microbiota, have been previously reported to ameliorate kidney injury; however, the specific concentrations and types that are required to improve renal function remain unknown. The present study aims to evaluate the levels of SCFAs in healthy and CKD patients, and to test the hypothesis that SCFAs play a critical role in delaying CKD progression. One hundred and twenty-seven patients with CKD and 63 healthy controls from China were enrolled in the present study. Butyrate, which is considered beneficial to humans, was almost three-times higher in healthy volunteers than that in CKD5 subjects (=0.001). Moreover, the serum  levels in controls were significantly higher than that in CKD patients (<0.05), and the butyrate level among CKD5 patients (1.48 ± 0.60 μmol/l) was less than half of that in controls (3.44 ± .12 μmol/l, <0.001). In addition, we observed an inverse correlation between butyrate level and renal function (<0.05). A CKD rat model transplanted with microbiota obtained from CKD patients exhibited accelerated CKD progression via increased production of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which was reversed by supplementation with extra butyrate. Our results showed that  levels were reduced in CKD patients and that butyrate supplementation might delay CKD progression.© 2019 The Author(s).

Transformation systems for marine Nannochloropsis species have been established in the recent decade, however, genetic manipulation of Nannochloropsis limnetica, the only known freshwater species in this genus, is not yet available. Based on established marine Nannochloropsis species electrotransformation protocol, nuclear genetic transformation was established in N. limnetica, meanwhile the appropriate antibiotic selection concentration and electric field strength of electroporation were determined.

To characterize the potential roles of JAZ gene family in plant development and abiotic stress response, fifteen JAZs were identified based on the genome of Nicotiana tabacum. Structural analysis confirmed the presence of single Jas and TIFY motif. Tissue expression pattern analysis indicated that NtJAZ-, -3, -5, and -10 were highly expressed in roots and NtJAZ-11 was expressed only in the cotyledons. The transcript level of NtJAZ-3, -5, -9, and -10 in the stem epidermis was higher than that in the stem without epidermis. Dynamic expression of NtJAZs exposed to abiotic stress and phytohormone indicated that the expression of most NtJAZs was activated by salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, gibberellic acid, cold, salt, and heat stresses. With abscisic acid treatment, NtJAZ-1, -, and -3 were not activated; NtJAZ-4, -5, and -6 were up-regulated; and the remaining NtJAZ genes were inhibited. With drought stress, the expression of NtJAZ-1, -, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -8 was up-regulated, whereas the transcript of the remaining genes was inhibited. Moreover, high concentration MeJA (more than 1 mM MeJA) had an effect on secreting trichome induction, but inhabited the plant growth. Nine NtJAZs may play important role in secreting trichome induction. These results indicate that the JAZ proteins are convergence points for various phytohormone signal networks, which are involved in abiotic stress responses.Copyright © 2019.

Twenty-seven male Holstein calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, fed colostrum at 45 min, 6 h, and 12 h after birth, respectively. Ileum and colon mucosa were collected at 51 h after birth, and their associated microbial profiles were assessed using amplicon sequencing. Both ileum and colon mucosa-associated microbiota were predominated by genus Escherichia-Shigella. The negative correlation between the molar proportion of short-chain   () and ileum mucosa-associated opportunistic pathogens, and the positive correlation between the molar proportion of  and colon mucosa-associated beneficial bacteria, suggest that  might play an important role in maintaining the gut health of -d-old calves. A higher relative abundance of ileum mucosa-associated Enterococcus and Streptococcus was detected when the first colostrum feeding was delayed for 12 h. The relative abundance of colon mucosa-associated Lactobacillus tended to be lower in calves fed colostrum 12 h than those under the other  treatments, whereas that of Faecalibacterium tended to be lower in calves fed colostrum immediately after birth than those fed colostrum 6 and 12 h after birth, respectively. Our findings suggest that delayed first colostrum feeding affects the establishment of ileum and colon mucosa-associated bacteria, which may have long-term effects on gut health of calves.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We aimed to investigate the associations between putative colorectal cancer-related markers and total protein intake, plant and animal proteins, and protein from red and processed meat in pre-diabetic adults (> 25 years).Analyses were based on clinical and dietary assessments at baseline and after 1 year of intervention. Protein intake was assessed from 4-day dietary records. Putative colorectal cancer-related markers identified from 24-h faecal samples collected over three consecutive days were: concentration of short-chain  , phenols, ammonia, and pH.In total, 79 participants were included in the analyses. We found a positive association between change in total protein intake (slope: 74.72 ± 28.84 µmol per g faeces/E%, p = 0.01), including animal protein intake (slope: 87.63 ± 32.04 µmol per g faeces/E%, p = 0.009), and change in faecal ammonia concentration. For change in ammonia, there was a dose-response trend from the most negative (lowest tertile) to the most positive (highest tertile) association (p = 0.01): in the high tertile, a change in intake of red meat was positively associated with an increase in ammonia excretion (slope: .0 ± 0.5 µmol per g faeces/g/day, p < 0.001), whereas no such association was found in the low and medium tertile groups.Increases in total and animal protein intakes were associated with higher excretion of ammonia in faeces after 1 year in overweight pre-diabetic adults undertaking a weight-loss intervention.

EAEC-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HCT116 and SW620 cells was detected using ',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG). The photo- and dark toxicities of EAEC were estimated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cellular uptake and localization of EAEC were detected by confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess apoptosis and autophagy. The antitumor activity of EAEC was confirmed in a xenograft model. Finally, effects on the PERK pathway were verified using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. EAEC displayed absorption and fluorescence emission peaks at 660 nm and 678 nm, respectively. EAEC induced ROS production in CRC cells. Assessment of dark toxicity showed that treatment with EAEC alone induced little cytotoxicity in CRC or normal cells but that EAEC-PDT induced significant photocytotoxicity in CRC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After cellular uptake, EAEC was located in the mitochondria. Treatment with EAEC-PDT reduced xenograft tumor size. Further evaluation suggested that activation of the PERK pathway mediates these effects, as the apoptotic rate and autophagy flux increased markedly after EAEC-PDT.

Additionally, a change occurs in the innate immune response during this period, which contributes to increased risk of disease. In the current study, we compared the transcriptomes of neutrophils from dairy cows divergent in their metabolic health post-calving. Cows (n = 5 per risk group) were selected from a parent experiment (n = 45 cows). Those with high or low concentrations of plasma nonesterified  , plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, and liver triacylglycerol in both wk 1 and  were deemed to be at "high risk" (HR) or "low risk" (LR) of metabolic dysfunction, respectively. Circulating neutrophils were isolated at 3 time points during the transition period (d 0 and wk 1 and 4 post-calving), and gene expression was analyzed using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression between the risk groups was determined using edgeR (http://bioconductor.org), and pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Statistical analysis indicated no interaction between risk and week. Therefore, the overall effect of risk was analyzed across all time points. In total, 3,500 genes were differentially expressed between the HR and LR cows (false discovery rate < 0.05). Of these, ,897 genes were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and used for pathway analysis. Of the relevant pathways identified, neutrophils isolated from HR cows showed downregulation of genes involved in the recruitment of granulocytes, interferon signaling, and apoptosis, and upregulation of genes involved in cell survival. The results indicate that metabolically stressed cows had reduced neutrophil function during the peripartum period, highlighting a potential relationship between subclinical metabolic disease and innate immune function that suggests that metabolic health negatively affects the innate immune system and may contribute to the state of immunosuppression during the peripartum period. In this way, the metabolic stress among the HR cows may reduce their ability to combat infection during the transition period.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) are involved in several cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety, and narcolepsy, all of which are comorbid with ASD. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating effect of the novel dual-active ligand E100 with high H3R antagonist affinity and balanced AChE inhibition on autistic-like repetitive behavior, anxiety parameters, locomotor activity, and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of VPA-induced ASD in C57BL/6 mice. E100 (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) dose-dependently and significantly ameliorated repetitive and compulsive behaviors by reducing the increased percentages of nestlets shredded (all P < 0.05). Moreover, pretreatment with E100 (10 and 15 mg/kg) attenuated disturbed anxiety levels (P < 0.05) but failed to restore the hyperactivity observed in the open field test. Furthermore, pretreatment with E100 (10 mg/kg) the increased microglial activation, proinflammatory cytokines and expression of NF-κB, iNOS, and COX- in the cerebellum as well as the hippocampus (all P < 0.05). These results demonstrate the ameliorative effects of E100 on repetitive compulsive behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo demonstration of the effectiveness of a potent dual-active H3R antagonist and AChE inhibitor against autistic-like repetitive compulsive behaviors and neuroinflammation, and provides evidence for the role of such compounds in treating ASD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Both the saccharide side chains and acetyl substituents improve the gelation of welan gum (WG), diutan gum (DG) and gellan gum (GG) in pure water at 25 °C. For the polysaccharides with saccharide side chains (WG and DG), the relationship between the apparent viscosity and concentration conforms to the linear equation, while that of the polysaccharide with acetyl (GG) is exponential. More importantly, the roles of substituents on the stability of the molecular conformation of polysaccharides are significantly depended on the surrounding environment. Disaccharide side chains promote the stability of helical conformation and gel aggregates of GG at high temperature (85 °C) or in the presence of inorganic salts with the ionic strength of .0 mol L. The stability of gel structure containing acetyl (GG) shows higher temperature/salt sensitivity. Additionally, deacylated gellan gum (GG(d)) solutions transform into hydrogels in the presence of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB).

Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain   (). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular, acetate beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and acetate production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant  acetate and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral acetate administration (vinegar intake), colonic acetate infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased the emission of monoterpenes, including (E)- and (Z)-β-ocimene, limonene, and myrcene, as well as sesquiterpene blends of (E)-caryophyllene, α-copaene, (+)-cyclosativene, and α-farnesene. RNA sequencing analysis predicted 14 putative Eo terpene synthase (EoTPS) genes, and two full-length EoTPS were successfully amplified: Eo7816 (1722 bp) and Eo6039 (1701 bp). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Eo7816 and Eo6039 belonged to the clades of TPS-b and TPS-a, respectively. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing Eo7816 exclusively released (E)-β-ocimene (96%) with (Z)-β-ocimene and myrcene. In contrast, Eo6039-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants emitted significant amounts of α-muurolene (69.4%) and eremophilene (21.8%). Together, we demonstrated that the two TPSs play roles in producing major  terpenes in Eo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Herein, an 8-week nutritional trial was designed to investigate the effects of dietary lipid sources including fish oil (FO), krill oil (KO), palm oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil and linseed oil on profiles of amino ,   and volatiles in muscle of swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus). Volatiles of crab muscle were characterized by headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results revealed that crabs fed FO and KO had significantly higher levels of protein, indispensable amino , eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in muscle. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated that muscle volatiles of crabs fed different dietary oils exhibited significant variations. Dietary FO and KO significantly increased the relative levels of 3-methylbutanal, heptanal, benzaldehyde and nonanal in muscle, which may produce more pleasant flavors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino acid metabolism-associated pathways (amino acid related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal microbiota, which in turn modulates their odor production. Our study provides references for breeding and enteric manipulation for defined microbiota to reduce odor gas emission.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228493>Change in CT-measured abdominal subcutaneous and visceral but not thigh fat areas predict future insulin sensitivity.</a></h1><p>We examined the longitudinal association between change in body composition directly measured by computed tomography (CT) and future insulin sensitivity.This was a prospective study with 10 years of follow-up with 297 Japanese-American without diabetes. Intra-abdominal fat area (IAFA) and abdominal subcutaneous fat area (), and thigh  were measured by CT. Insulin sensitivity was calculated by HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index.Baseline and change in IAFA were significantly and independently associated with change in HOMA-IR and Matsuda index during follow-up. In multivariate analysis, IAFA and 10-year change in IAFA (Δ IAFA) was significantly and positively associated with 10-year HOMA-IR (p < 0.001) and significantly and negatively associated with 10-year Matsuda index (p < 0.001). The association with Matsuda index though was non-linear and best modeled as a quadratic function (Δ IAFA + Δ IAFA). No significant associations in multivariate analyses were seen between thigh  and insulin sensitivity or abdominal  and HOMA-IR but an increase in abdominal  was associated with diminished insulin sensitivity measured by the Matsuda index.An increase in visceral adiposity predicts diminished insulin sensitivity over 10 years of follow-up independent of the size of this adipose depot at baseline.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a new approach to produce them from crude glycerol, by combining propionic acid fermentation with chain elongation. Propionic acid was produced by Propionibacterium acidipropionici (8.49 ± 1.40 g·L). In the subsequent mixed population chain elongation, valeric acid was the dominant product (5.3 ± 0.69 g·L) of the chain elongation process. Residual glycerol negatively impacted the selectivity of mixed culture chain elongation towards valeric acid, whereas this was unaffected when Clostridium kluyveri was used as bio-catalyst. Valeric acid could be selectively isolated and upgraded to ethyl valerate by using dodecane as extractant and medium for esterification, whereas shorter-chain carboxylic  could be recovered by using a 10 wt% solution of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) in dodecane. Overall, our work shows that the combined fermentation, electrochemistry and homogeneous catalysis enables fine chemical production from side streams.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
