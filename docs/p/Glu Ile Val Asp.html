Human platelet factor 4 consists of identical subunits containing 70 amino acids, each with a molecular  of 7,756. The molecule contains no methionine, phenylalanine or tryptophan. The proposed amino acid sequence of PF4 is: -Ala----Gly--Leu-Gln-Cys-Leu-Cys--Lys-Thr-Thr-Ser- Gln--Arg-Pro-Arg-His--Thr-Ser-Leu----Lys-Ala-Gly-Pro-His-Cys-Pro-Thr-Ala-Gin- Leu--Ala-Thr-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Arg-Lys--Cys-Leu--Leu-Gln-Ala-Pro-Leu-Tyr-Lys-Lys- --Lys-Lys-Leu-Leu--Ser. From consideration of the homology with p-thromboglobulin, disulphide bonds between residues 10 and 36 and between residues 12 and 52 can be inferred.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018713>Effects of Alpha-Ketoglutarate on Glutamine Metabolism in Piglet Enterocytes in Vivo and in Vitro.</a></h2><p>Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) plays a vital part in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is a key intermediate in the oxidation of L-glutamine (Gln). The study was to evaluate effects of AKG on Gln metabolism in vivo and in vitro. A total of twenty-one piglets were weaned at 28 days with a mean body  (BW) of 6.0 ± 0.2 kg, and randomly divided into 3 groups: corn soybean meal based diet (CON group); the basal diet with 1% alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG treatment group); and the basal diet with 1% L-glutamine (GLN treatment group). Intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) were incubated to investigate effects of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG addition on Gln metabolism. Our results showed that there were no differences (P > 0.05) among the 3 treatments in initial BW, final BW, and average daily feed intake. However, average daily gain (P = 0.013) and gain:feed (P = 0.041) of the AKG group were greater than those of the other two groups. In comparison with the CON group, the AKG and GLN groups exhibited an improvement in villus length, mucosal thickness, and crypt depth in the jejunum of piglets. Serum concentrations of , , , , Tyr, Phe, Lys, and Arg in the piglets fed the 1% AKG or Gln diet were lower than those in the CON group. Compared with the CON group, the mRNA expression of jejunal and ileal amino acid (AA) transporters in the AKG and GLN groups were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Additionally, the in vitro study showed that the addition of 0.5, 2, and 3 mM AKG dose-dependently decreased (P < 0.05) the net utilization of Gln and formulation of ammonia, , Ala, and  by IPEC-1. In conclusion, dietary AKG supplementation, as a replacement for Gln, could improve Gln metabolism in piglet enterocytes and enhance the utilization of AA.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19528608>Effect of abomasal glucose infusion on splanchnic amino acid metabolism in periparturient dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Six Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulas and permanent indwelling catheters in the portal vein, hepatic vein, mesenteric vein, and an artery were used to study the effects of abomasal glucose infusion on splanchnic AA metabolism. The experimental design was a split plot, with cow as the whole plot, treatment as the whole-plot factor and days in milk (DIM) as the subplot factor. Cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control or infusion of 1,500 g/d of glucose into the abomasum from the day of calving to 29 DIM. Cows were sampled prepartum and at 4, 15, and 29 DIM. Postpartum dry matter intake increased at a lower rate with infusion compared with the control. Arterial concentrations of all essential AA (EAA) were lower with infusion compared with the control. Net portal fluxes of His, , Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, , Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr were lower with infusion compared with the control and the net portal fluxes of these AA showed positive correlations with dry matter intake, whereas the net portal fluxes of , , and Gln were unaffected by treatment. Net hepatic fluxes of EAA were not affected by treatment but increased as lactation progressed with both treatments. On a net basis, all EAA were removed by the liver prepartum and at 4 DIM, whereas Met, Phe, and Thr were the only EAA being removed at 29 DIM. Except for Ala, AA removed by the liver might be used primarily for noncatabolic processes, as exemplified by the 16% of hepatic Gly uptake accounted for as urinary hippurate. The measured hepatic uptake of glucogenic precursors (glucogenic AA, volatile fatty acids, lactate, and glycerol) accounted for 50 to 90% of the hepatic release of glucose. The hepatic urea output accounted for more than 100% of the hepatic ureagenic precursor uptake, indicating that the glucogenic precursors unaccounted for are nonnitrogen-containing compounds. In conclusion, an increased exogenous glucose supply to the small intestine did not seem to affect the amount of EAA and non-EAA available for peripheral tissues in early lactation, and the study did not indicate an AA-sparing effect of small intestinal glucose absorption. In periparturient dairy cows, hepatic catabolism of AA was not driven by the increased whole-body demand for glucose, and Ala was the only AA that contributed substantially to hepatic . In very early lactation, the supply of EAA might be of greater concern than the supply of glucogenic substrates.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26506550>Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides in commercial Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses of different ages.</a></h2><p>Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤ 6d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular  (MW) ≤ 3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, -Pro-Pro (IPP), -Pro-Pro (VPP), -Lys---Arg-Phe (EKDERF), -Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro--Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe--Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

The current study is aimed at understanding the role of executioner caspase 6 on lamin A integrity in islet β-cells under duress of glucotoxic (20 mM glucose; 24 h) and diabetic conditions. Under glucotoxic conditions, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and metabolic cell viability were significantly attenuated in INS-1 832/13 cells. Further, exposure of normal human islets, rat islets and INS-1 832/13 cells to glucotoxic conditions leads to caspase 6 activation and lamin A degradation, which is also observed in islets from the Zucker diabetic fatty rat, a model for type 2  (T2D), and in islets from a human donor with T2D. Z-----fluoromethylketone, a specific inhibitor of caspase 6, markedly attenuated high glucose-induced caspase 6 activation and lamin A degradation, confirming that caspase 6 mediates lamin A degradation under high glucose exposure conditions. Moreover, Z-----fluoromethylketone, a known caspase 3 inhibitor, significantly inhibited high glucose-induced caspase 6 activation and lamin A degradation, suggesting that activation of caspase 3 might be upstream to caspase 6 activation in the islet β-cell under glucotoxic conditions. Lastly, we report expression of ZMPSTE24, a zinc metallopeptidase involved in the processing of prelamin A to mature lamin A, in INS-1 832/13 cells and human islets; was unaffected by high glucose. We conclude that caspases 3 and 6 could contribute to alterations in the integrity of nuclear lamins leading to metabolic dysregulation and failure of the islet β-cell.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711271>Identification of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides from mare whey protein hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity is a promising strategy for treatment of type 2 . In the current study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identiﬁed from mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained by papain. The results showed that all the mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained at various hydrolysis durations possessed more potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared with intact whey protein. The 4-h hydrolysates showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.18 mg/mL. The 2 novel peptides from 4-h hydrolysate fractions separated by successive chromatographic steps were characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The novel peptides Asn-Leu----Leu-Arg and Thr-Gln-Met------Met--Lys-Phe-Arg, which corresponded to β-lactoglobulin 1 f(71-77) and β-lactoglobulin 1 f(143-155), demonstrated DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 86.34 and 69.84 μM, respectively. The DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the 2 peptides was retained or even improved after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro. Our findings indicate that mare whey protein-derived peptides may possess potential as functional food ingredients in the management of type 2 .Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (, Asn, , and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (, , Lys, and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, Tyr, and Phe, and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, , , Cys, Gly, Ser, and Thr. The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order glycolysis and  with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively). Cladistic analysis of the structure of biochemical pathways makes hypotheses in biochemical evolution explicit and parsimonious.</p><p>Keyword:['gluconeogenesis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15746249>Tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} decreases Akt protein levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via the caspase-dependent ubiquitination of Akt.</a></h2><p>TNF-alpha is a mediator of insulin resistance in sepsis, obesity, and type 2  and is known to impair insulin signaling in adipocytes. Akt (protein kinase B) is a crucial signaling mediator for insulin. In the present study we examined the posttranslational mechanisms by which short-term (<6-h) exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to TNF-alpha decreases Akt levels. TNF-alpha treatment both increased the ubiquitination of Akt and decreased its protein level. The decrease in protein was associated with the presence of an (immunoreactive) Akt fragment after TNF-alpha treatment, indicative of Akt cleavage. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-(O-Me)-fluoromethyl ketone markedly suppressed these effects of TNF-alpha. The caspase-6 inhibitor Z--(OMe)--(OMe)-CH(2)F potently suppressed Akt ubiquitination, degradation, and fragment formation, whereas the proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO modestly attenuated the decline in Akt levels. Exposure to TNF-alpha also enhanced the association of Akt with an E3 ligase activity. Adipocytes preexposed to TNF-alpha for 5 h and then stimulated with insulin for 30 min exhibited decreased levels of Akt, phosphorylated Akt, as well as phosphorylated Mdm2, which is a known direct substrate of Akt, and glucose uptake. Caspase inhibition attenuated these inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha. Collectively, our results suggest that TNF-alpha induces the caspase-dependent degradation of Akt via the cleavage and ubiquitination of Akt, which results in its degradation through the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the caspase- and proteasome-mediated degradation of Akt due to TNF-alpha exposure leads to impaired Akt-dependent insulin signaling in adipocytes. These findings expand the mechanism by which TNF-alpha impairs insulin signaling.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559889>Characterization of Lipopeptide Biosurfactants Produced by  MB01 from Marine Sediments.</a></h2><p>Antibiotic resistance has become one of the world's most severe problems because of the overuse of antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more difficult to kill and more expensive to treat. Researchers have been studied on antibiotic alternatives such as antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides. A functional bacteria MB01 producing lipopeptides which can be used as bacteriostat was isolated from the Bohai Sea sediments, which had been identified as  the morphological, physiological, and biochemical identification and 16s rDNA sequence.

Three groups of breeding pigeons in the lactation period (n = 30 pairs/group) were respectively injected with rapamycin (RAPA, a specific inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex) at doses of 0 (vehicle, control), 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg body  (BW)/day via the wing vein for 7 days. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) and BW of the breeding pigeons and the BW of young squabs were respectively recorded throughout the experimental period. The breeding pigeons were sacrificed to collect their crop tissues, crop milk, and serum on the eighth day of the experiment. The results showed that neither 0.6 nor 1.2 mg/kg BW RAPA injection affected BW loss or ADFI in breeding pigeons (P > 0.05), while crop thickness and crop relative  were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the 1.2 mg/kg BW rapamycin-injected group. Simultaneously, RAPA (especially at 1.2 mg/kg BW) decreased the crude protein, αs1-casein, αs2-casein, β-casein, and amino acid contents (, Thr, Ser, , Gly, Ala, Cys, , Met, , Leu, Tyr, Lys, His, Arg, and Pro) of crop milk (P < 0.05) and the concentrations of albumin, total protein, and uric acid in the serum of breeding pigeons (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of TORC1 pathway-related proteins (TORC1, S6K1, S6, 4EBP1, and eIF4E) was downregulated in the crop tissues of breeding pigeons by 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg BW/day RAPA injection (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the average daily gain (ADG) of young squabs declined, and the mortality rate increased significantly (P < 0.05). Together, the results showed that RAPA reduced protein and amino acid levels in the crop milk of breeding pigeons and retarded young squab growth, suggesting a crucial role of TORC1 in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12803541>Gamma III-crystallin is the primary target of glycation in the bovine lens incubated under physiological conditions.</a></h2><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for the way in which glucose and its metabolites cause cataract, retinopathy and other complications of , the most convincing being glycation. Glycation, the reaction of sugars with free amino groups of proteins, is one of a variety of non-enzymic post-translational modifications. The aim of the present study was to identify some of the most reactive proteins in the lens when incubated under physiological conditions. Fresh intact bovine lenses were incubated with [14C]glucose in a conventional tissue-culture medium with added antibiotics. After 3 and 6 days of incubation, the water-soluble proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions were separated by using a sugar affinity column (Affi-Gel 601). Then the radioactive fractions were identified on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the whole bovine lenses were incubated with 10 mM fructose and glucose for 3 and 6 days. The glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions in parallel with the radioactive fractions were separated by affinity chromatography, and were identified further by amino-acid sequencing. A progressive uptake of radioactive label showed that the majority of proteins incorporating both glucose and fructose were water-soluble fractions. Chromatography and SDS/polyacrylamide gel results showed that alpha- and gamma-crystallin and some proteins of a mean molecular mass of 36-37 kDa incorporated sugars early during incubation. After 6 days of incubation, more crystallins were glycated compared with 3 days, in particular beta-crystallin. Affinity-chromatography results indicated that proteins with subunit masses of 36 kDa and 20 kDa were possibly radiolabelled at an early stage. The purified glycated proteins following incubation with both glucose and fructose, which corresponded to 20 kDa and 36 kDa bands on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of both 20 kDa bands were Gly-Lys--Thr, characteristic of gamma-crystallins, but the N-termini of both 36 kDa bands were blocked. Further sequencing after digestion of 36 kDa bands with trypsin and running on HPLC revealed that the glucose sample gave the peptide sequences as Gly--Tyr-Pro--Tyr-Gln-Gln and Tyr--Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg, which match with bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin. The peptide sequence Tyr--Leu-Pro-Asn-Tyr-Arg is only present in the published sequence of bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin and not in any other type of gamma-crystallin. The fructose sample gave the peptide sequences -Thr-Phe-Tyr---Arg, Arg-Gly--Tyr-Pro--Tyr-Gln-Gln-Trp, Gln-Tyr-Leu-Leu-Arg and ---Leu-Tyr, which all matched with bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. The sequence ---Leu-Tyr only appears in the sequence of bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. gammaIII-Crystallin is the most susceptible lens protein to glycation. The primary target of glucose is gammaIIIb-crystallin, whereas that of fructose is gammaIIIa-crystallin. The early glycation of gammaIII-crystallin by glucose and fructose could result in structural alterations, leading to aggregation of crystallin and eventually cataract formation.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053831>Effect of dietary fiber levels on performance, gizzard development, intestinal morphology, and nutrient utilization in meat ducks from 1 to 21 days of age.</a></h2><p>The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of dietary fiber levels on growth performance, gizzard development, intestinal morphology, and nutrient utilization in Cherry Valley meat ducks. In total, 720 1-day-old ducklings were fed with starter diets (120 ducklings, 8 pens of 15 ducklings, on each diet) containing 6 levels of crude fiber (CF, 1.46, 3.09, 4.15, 6.18, 7.52, and 9.03%, based on analysis) for 21 d.
