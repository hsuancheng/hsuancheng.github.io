The producer strain, designated OSY-I1, was determined to be Brevibacillus laterosporusvia morphological, biochemical, and genetic analyses. The antimicrobial agent was extracted from cells of OSY-I1 with isopropanol, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and structurally analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The MS and NMR results, taken together, uncovered a linear lipopeptide consisting of 13 amino  and an N-terminal C6  acid (FA) chain, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid. The lipopeptide (FA-Dhb-Leu-Orn---Val-Lys-Val-Val-Lys--Leu-valinol, where Dhb is α,β-didehydrobutyric acid and valinol is 2-amino-3-methyl-1-butanol) has a molecular mass of 1,583.0794 Da and contains three modified amino acid residues: α,β-didehydrobutyric acid, ornithine, and valinol. The compound, designated brevibacillin, was determined to be a member of a cationic lipopeptide antibiotic family. In addition to its potency against drug-resistant bacteria, brevibacillin also exhibited low MICs (1 to 8 μg/ml) against selected foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes,Bacillus cereus, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Purified brevibacillin showed no sign of degradation when it was held at 80 °C for 60 min, and it retained at least 50% of its antimicrobial activity when it was held for 22 h under acidic or alkaline conditions. On the basis of these findings, brevibacillin is a potent antimicrobial lipopeptide which is potentially useful to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

In May 2016, a suspected A. aequalis resistant population AHTC-06 that survived fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl applied at their field-recommended rates was collected from a wheat field in Jinji County, Anhui Province, China. This study aimed to determine the resistance profile of this AHTC-06 population to ACCase- and ALS-inhibitors, and to investigate its mechanisms of resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl.Two mutations, a common -2041-Asn (ACCase gene) and a very rare Pro-197- (ALS1 gene), were both identified in resistant individual plants. The homozygous subpopulation AHTC-06F1 for the two mutations was generated, and it showed broad-spectrum resistance to APPs, DENs, and ALS-inhibiting herbicides of all five chemical families tested, with resistance index (RI) values that ranged from 2.2 to 36.5. In vitro ALS activity assays showed the ALS from the resistant population was insensitive to all the tested ALS inhibitors, with RI values ranging from 3.10 to 22.51. Pre-treatment with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and malathion significantly (P < 0.05) reversed the weed's resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl, respectively. Two P450 genes, c21190_g1 and c43350_g3, were constitutively overexpressed and mesosulfuron-methyl-induced upregulated in resistant plants, for which c43350_g3 was also fenoxaprop-P-ethyl-induced upregulated.This study confirms the first case of a grass weed featuring broad-spectrum resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides due to a Pro-197- mutation in the ALS gene. Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl resistances in AHTC-06 plants were conferred by target site mutations and P450s-based metabolism. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p></html>
