Sixty Sprague-Dawley female rats were randomized into five groups (N = 12): control, diabetic, diabetic treated with calcitriol and/or pomegranate peel extract (PPE), and mated with non-diabetic healthy males. After confirmation of pregnancy, treatments were kept until gestational day (E-18). Serum and cardiac tissues of mothers and foetuses were collected and processed for biochemical, histopathological, and molecular assessments. We observed that, compared to the control, diabetic mothers showed dramatically increased hyperglycaemia and  associated with decreased myocardial functions and disrupted maternal performance. Also, diabetic mothers and their neonates exhibited elevated levels of myocardial injury (troponin I, endothelin 1, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase), with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1, interleukin 1β, transforming growth factor β) and oxidative redox. Concurrently, the MAPK pathway was significantly down-regulated with increased myocardial apoptotic activity. Furthermore, mRNA expression of angiogenic and fibrotic markers was significantly increased. Paradoxically, calcitriol and/or pomegranate peel extract alleviated these diabetic myocardial insults and normalized the aforementioned assayed parameters. Our findings hypothesized that calcitriol and/or pomegranate peel extract exerted cardioameliorative impacts due to their unique anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, and thus may be a promising treatment that directly targets the secondary myocardial complications of diabetes in dams and their offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485369>Quantitative Analysis of Eight Triterpenoids and Two Sesquiterpenoids in Rhizoma Alismatis by Using UPLC-ESI/APCI-MS/MS and Its Application to Optimisation of Best Harvest Time and Crude Processing Temperature.</a></h1><p>Rhizoma Alismatis (RA), widely known as "Ze-Xie" in China, is the tuber of  (Sam.) Juzep (Alismaceae), a Chinese herbal medicine that has been used to treat , diabetes, hypertension, dysuria, and inflammation. In this study, a sensitive and reliable method based on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) couple with two ionisation modes, including electrospray ionisation (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS), namely, UPLC-ESI/APCI-MS/MS was developed and validated to simultaneously determine 8 triterpenoids (ESI mode) and  sesquiterpenoids (APCI mode) in RA. Ten marker compounds were analysed with a Waters' CORTECS UPLC C18 column (200 mm × .1 m, 1.6 m) and gradient elution with water (contained 0.1% formic) and acetonitrile within 7 min. The established method was validated for linearity, intra- and interday precisions, accuracy, recovery, and stability. The calibration curve for 10 marker compounds showed good linear regression ( > 0.9971). The limits of detection and quantification for analytes were 0.14-1.67 ng/mL and 0.44-5.65 ng/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSD, %) and accuracy (RE, %) of intra- and interday precisions were less than 3.83% and 1.21% and 3.22% and 1.46%, repeatability and stability for real samples were less than .78% and 3.19%, respectively. All recoveries of the 10 marker compounds ranged from 97.24% to 102.49% with RSDs less than 4.05%. The developed method efficiently determined the 10 marker compounds in RA and was subsequently applied to optimise harvest time and crude processing temperature. The result indicated the 90% wilted phase and 70°C (or lower) may be the best harvest time and the processing temperature of RA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481133>Comorbidities and polypharmacy among HIV-positive patients aged 50 years and over: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>This study was to determine and compare the prevalences of polypharmacy and comorbidities in patients aged 50 years or older with those patients younger than 50 years in a Mexican population.One hundred and twenty-five patients were enrolled, 60 (48%) were aged 50 years or older.

EC refers to "the fraction of potential health gain that is actually delivered to the population through the health system, given its capacity," and is used to indicate the percentage of the population whose diseases are well controlled among those who require treatment or are receiving treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of occupational health services on EC. We hypothesized that occupational health services provided to employees by full-time occupational health practitioners, such as occupational physicians and occupational health nurses, improve EC for hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  compared to those services provided by part-time occupational health practitioners. We conducted a cross-sectional study to analyze the results of general medical examinations, personnel information, and medical expense claims in fiscal year 2011. A total of 91,351 male employees at a company group participated in the study. The EC for hypertension, diabetes mellitus and  was measured and compared between the employees in workplaces with occupational health practitioners (OH group) and the employees in workplaces without occupational health practitioners (non-OH group).

The contribution of the triggering/ATP-sensitive potassium (K)-dependent Ca signalling and K-independent amplification pathways, that include anaplerosis and lipid signalling of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), are well established. A proposed model included a key role for a metabolic partitioning 'switch', the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)/malonyl-CoA/carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) axis, in beta cell glucose and fatty acid signalling for insulin secretion. This model has gained overwhelming support from a number of studies in recent years and is now refined through its link to the glycerolipid/NEFA cycle that provides lipid signals through its lipolysis arm. Furthermore, acetyl-CoA carboxylase may also control beta cell growth. Here we review the evidence supporting a role for the ACC/malonyl-CoA/CPT-1 axis in the control of GSIS and its particular importance under conditions of elevated fatty acids (e.g. fasting, excess nutrients,  and diabetes). We also document how it is linked to a more global lipid signalling system that includes the glycerolipid/NEFA cycle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469869>Association of iron deficiency anemia with tuberculosis in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based study.</a></h1><p>Iron deficiency is associated with decreased cellular immunity, which may predispose patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). This study investigated the relationship between newly diagnosed IDA and TB infection in Taiwan.The study included data on 21,946 patients with incident IDA and 87,555 non-IDA controls from a national database covering the period 2000-2012. IDA and non-IDA subjects were matched 1:4 on age, gender, and index year. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial IDA diagnosis to the date of developing TB or 31 December 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with the control group as the reference.The adjusted hazard ratio of TB for the IDA group was 1.99 (95% confidence interval, 1.77-.25) compared with the control group. The subgroup analysis showed that for both genders, all age groups, and patients with diabetes mellitus, , hypertension, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hepatitis B virus infection, the IDA group had significantly higher TB incidence. The association was significantly stronger within the 5 years after new IDA diagnosis for both genders and all age groups.Higher TB incidence was discovered in the IDA group, especially for patients with comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579461>The impact of cigarette smoking on infarct location and in-hospital outcome following acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.</a></h1><p> Smoking, which is a major modifiable risk factor for coronary artery diseases, affects cardiovascular system with different mechanisms. We designed this study to investigate the association of smoking with location of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and short-term outcomes during hospitalization.  In 1017 consecutive patients with anterior/inferior STEMI, comprehensive demographic, biochemical data, as well as clinical complications and mortality rate, were recorded. Patients were allocated into two groups based on smoking status and compared regarding the location of myocardial infarction, the emergence of clinical complications and in-hospital mortality in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Among 1017 patients, 300 patients (29.5%) were smoker and 717 patients (70.5 %) were non-smoker. Smokers were significantly younger and had lower prevalence of diabetes,  and hypertension. Inferior myocardial infarction was considerably more common in smokers than in non-smokers (45.7% vs. 36%,  = 0.001). Heart failure was developed more commonly in non-smokers (33.9% vs. 20%,  = 0.001). In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in smokers (6.7% vs. 17.3%,  = 0.001). After adjustment for confounding variables, smoking was independently associated with inferior myocardial infarction and lower heart failure [odds ratio: 1.44 (1.06-1.96),  = 0.01 and odds ratio: 0.61 (0.40-0.92),  = 0.02, respectively]. However, in-hospital mortality was not associated with smoking after adjustment for other factors [odds ratio: 0.69 (0.36-1.31),  = 0.].  Smoking is independently associated with inferior myocardial infarction. Although smokers had lower incidence of heart failure, in-hospital mortality was not different after adjustment for other factors.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443662>Congenital nephrotic syndrome associated with 22q11. duplication syndrome in a Chinese family and functional analysis of the intronic NPHS1 c. 3286 + 5G > A mutation.</a></h1><p>Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS), which is defined as heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia,  and edema, is most caused by monogenic defects in structural proteins of the glomerular filtration barrier in the kidneys. 22q11. duplication syndrome was a chromosomal disease with variable clinical featuresranging from normal to mental retardation and with congenital defects. Co-occurrence of two genetic disorders in a single patient is rare.The proband was born at 36 weeks of gestational age spontaneously and weighed 2350 g at birth. Six days after birth, the proband was admitted to our hospital due to fever of 38.5 °C lasting for 6 h. Physical examination at admission time showed dysmorphic features of hypertelorism, palpebral edema, broad nose bridge, upturned nose, dysmorphic auricle, long philtrum, and a thin upper lip. Additionally, we found left wrist drop and bilateral strephexopodia, bilateral knee joint flexion contracture in this patient. A series of indicators were detected and showed abnormalities. Albumin was used to remit the hypoproteinemia and edema. However, the parents refused to accept further therapy and the boy died at age 3 months due to cachexy.

Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated , sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

We examined atherogenesis in the left carotid artery with and without interrupted blood flow of C57BL/6 (B6) and C3H-Apoe-deficient (Apoe-/-) mouse strains.Blood flow was interrupted by ligating the common carotid artery near its bifurcation in one group of mice and another group was not interrupted.Without interference with blood flow, C3H-Apoe-/- mice developed no atherosclerosis in the carotid artery, while B6-Apoe-/- mice formed advanced atherosclerotic lesions (98,019 ± 10,594 μm2/section) after 12 weeks of a Western diet. When blood flow was interrupted by ligating the common carotid artery near its bifurcation, C3H-Apoe-/- mice showed fatty streak lesions  weeks after ligation, and by 4 weeks fibrous lesions had formed, although they were smaller than in B6-Apoe-/- mice. Neutrophil adhesion to endothelium and infiltration in lesions was observed in ligated arteries of both strains. Treatment of B6-Apoe-/- mice with antibody against neutrophils had little effect on lesion size.These findings demonstrate the dramatic influences of genetic backgrounds and blood flow on atherogenesis in the carotid artery of hyperlipidemic mice.© 2019 S.

A total of 1 402 975 adults aged 40 to 79 years who had no known cardiorenal disease were included.Systolic BP treated with antihypertensive medication.The yearly rates of critical cardiorenal events and all-cause death were estimated according to the levels of treated systolic BP and the presence of 5 risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, , proteinuria, and smoking).During the study periods, 225 103 of 487 412 participants (54.0% male; median [interquartile range] age, 50 [44-59] years) in the primary cohort and 360 503 of 915 563 participants (50.1% male; median [interquartile range] age, 52 [46-60] years) in the secondary cohort received antihypertensive treatment. In total, 28 411 of 51 292 cardiorenal incidents and 33 102 of 72 500 deaths were noted in ever-treated participants. The absolute increase in cardiorenal and mortality risk associated with inadequately treated BP was greater in participants with multiple risk factors than in those with 1 or 0 risk factors. The hazard ratios for critical cardiorenal events increased as the treated systolic BP increased to more than 130 to 140 mm Hg. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for patients with 3 or more risk factors and treated systolic BP within the range of 110 to 119 mm Hg was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.07-1.37); 130 to 139 mm Hg, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98-1.11); 140 to 149 mm Hg, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.05-1.20); 150 to 159 mm Hg, 1.21 (95% CI, 1.11-1.32); and 160 mm Hg or greater, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.32-1.62) compared with high-risk patients with BP of 120 to 129 mm Hg. For participants with 1 or 0 risk factors and treated systolic BP within the range of 110 to 119 mm Hg, the hazard ratio was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.07-1.22); 130 to 139 mm Hg, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.93-1.02); 140 to 149 mm Hg, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.91-1.09); 150 to 159 mm Hg, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.99-1.14); and 160 mm Hg or greater, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.15-1.37). However, when categorized using cardiovascular risk calculators, there was no consistent trend in mortality thresholds of BP across the risk score categories.These results suggest that intensive BP control is appropriate for reducing all-cause mortality in addition to cardiorenal risk in higher- rather than lower-risk patients.

Statins effectively combat hypercholesterolemia but are not well tolerated at high doses, raising the need for coprescription with cholesterol sorbents and/or absorption inhibitors. Montmorillonite (MMT) clay was found to attenuate hypercholesterolemia and obesity by reducing cholesterol and fat absorption. However, acicular clay-like sepiolite may offer better results due to its more substantial adsorption of nonpolar molecules. We herein aimed at (1) assessing  the capacity of sepiolite to adsorb edible oil and cholesterol compared with that of MMT and () assessing  the effect of continuous feeding on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD) (53.6% w/w fat and 0.% cholesterol) supplemented with 5% (w/w) edible sepiolite, on diet-induced obesity rate, hypercholesterolemia, and . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed  that sepiolite adsorption of olive oil and cholesterol was five to eight times greater than that of MMT clay. Sepiolite supplementation to HFD fed to mature mice for 12.5 weeks resulted in lower total blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and attenuated body weight gain, by reducing fat gain. Sepiolite supplementation did not affect energy intake but increased fecal extraction of sterols and lipids, without notable side effects. These results demonstrate that supplementing a HFD with sepiolite attenuates gastrointestinal absorption of dietary lipids and sterols, thus mitigating obesity, , and hypercholesterolemia. Further exploration of the efficacy, mechanism of action, and safety of sepiolite as a food supplement for combating the metabolic syndrome is needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382304>Pathogenesis and Management of Thrombotic Disease in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.</a></h1><p>Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are characterized by clonal expansion of an abnormal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell and include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Venous thrombosis, often at unusual sites, including splanchnic vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis, as well as a hemorrhagic tendency and a propensity to transform into myelofibrosis or acute leukemia are common complications in patients with MPNs. The pathogenesis of thrombosis in MPN patients is complex and multifactorial. Disease related factors, such as an increase in blood cell counts (i.e., leukocytosis, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis), and more importantly presence of  mutation can interact with non-disease patient related factors such as age, previous history of thrombotic events, obesity, hypertension, , and presence of thrombophilic defects. The overall rate of recurrent thrombosis after venous thromboembolism (VTE) is 6.0 to 6.5 per 100 patient-years in patients with MPN compared to .7 to 3.7 per 100 patient-years in patients without MPN, and antithrombotic therapy with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is associated with a clear benefit, reducing the incidence of recurrence by 48 to 69%. Life-long oral anticoagulation with VKAs is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic treatment for splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). Patients with MPN-related cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) should also be treated with long-term anticoagulation with VKAs. The role of direct acting oral anticoagulants in patients with thrombosis and MPN is not established and the use of these anticoagulants should be considered on an individual basis according to the risk of recurrent of VTE and bleeding.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585432>Expansive carotid artery remodeling: possible marker of vulnerable plaque.</a></h1><p>Accumulated findings in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis have demonstrated that not only luminal narrowing but also plaque characteristics influence the risk of future ischemic events. The morphology of the carotid artery (CA) changes in response to atherosclerotic development by expansive remodeling (ER), the clinical significance of which remains unclear. This study aimed to define associations between ER and local risk factors, including CA geometry and traditional systemic risk factors for ischemic events, to determine whether ER could serve as a clinical marker of carotid vulnerable plaque.The authors retrospectively analyzed 66 patients with CA stenosis who were scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy or CA stenting. They calculated ER ratios in the internal CA (ICA) from long-axis MR images and as the maximal distance between the lumen and the outer borders of the plaque perpendicular to the axis of the ICA/the maximal luminal diameter of the distal ICA at a region unaffected by atherosclerosis. Relative overall signal intensity (roSI) was calculated to assess intraplaque hemorrhage and defined as the signal intensity of plaque on an axial T1-weighted image with maximal stenosis relative to that of the adjacent sternocleidomastoid muscle. The authors evaluated CA geometry by calculating the angles between the common CA (CCA) and ICA, and between the CCA and external CA (ECA) using digital subtraction angiography. The ER ratios, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, roSI, hypertension, , low-density lipoprotein, statin medication, diabetes, smoking habit, and ischemic heart disease were compared between 33 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic patients. The authors also compared symptomatic status, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, ICA angle, ECA angle, roSI, and other traditional atherosclerotic risk factors between groups with extensive and slight ER.The ER ratio was significantly greater in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (1.91 ± 0.46 vs 1.68 ± 0.40, p < 0.05). The ICA angle was significantly larger in the group with extensive ER than in those with slight ER (33.9° ± 20.° vs 21.7° ± 13.8°, p < 0.01). The roSI, ECA angle, percentage stenosis, or any other traditional vascular risk factors were not associated with ER.Carotid ER might be an independent indicator of carotid vulnerable plaque, which should be validated in a longitudinal study of patients with carotid atherosclerosis, including those with nonstenotic to moderate stenosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525874>Xanthohumol Suppresses NPC1L1 Gene Expression through Downregulation of HNF-4α and Inhibits Cholesterol Uptake in Caco- Cells.</a></h1><p>Xanthohumol (Xan) is a prenylated chalcone mainly found in hops; it has been demonstrated to function against hypercholesterolemia, , and atherosclerosis. In this study, we focused on the hypocholesterolemic effect of Xan on cholesterol uptake and the underlying molecular mechanisms of Xan in human intestinal Caco- cells. The microarray data showed that Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), an essential transporter for dietary cholesterol absorption, was significantly downregulated in Xan-treated Caco- cells. We demonstrated that Xan (10 and 20 μM) suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of NPC1L1 by 0.65 ± 0.12-fold and 0.54 ± 0.15-fold and 0.72 ± 0.04-fold and 0.44 ± 0.12-fold, respectively, compared to that of the vehicle-treated Caco- cells. Moreover, Xan (10 and 20 μM) significantly inhibited cholesterol uptake by approximately 12 and 32% in Caco- cells. NPC1L1 promoter activity was significantly suppressed by Xan, and a DNA element within the NPC1L1 promoter involved in Xan-mediated NPC1L1 reduction located between the -120 and -20 positions was identified. Moreover, Xan markedly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α), a critical activator of NPC1L1 transcription, and subsequently attenuated HNF-4α/NPC1L1 promoter complex formation, resulting in the suppression of NPC1L1 gene expression. Finally, we demonstrated that Xan markedly abolished lovastatin-induced NPC1L1 overexpression in Caco- cells. These findings reveal that Xan suppresses NPC1L1 expression via downregulation of HNF-4α and exerts inhibitory effects on cholesterol uptake in the intestinal Caco- cells. Our findings suggest Xan could serve as a potential cholesterol-lowering agent and supplement for statin therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390500>Volanesorsen and Triglyceride Levels in Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by loss of lipoprotein lipase activity and characterized by chylomicronemia and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. There are no effective therapies. In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome, antisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic  mRNA with volanesorsen led to decreased plasma apolipoprotein C-III and triglyceride levels.We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized 52-week trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of volanesorsen in 66 patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive volanesorsen or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline to 3 months.Patients receiving volanesorsen had a decrease in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 25.7 mg per deciliter, corresponding to an 84% decrease at 3 months, whereas patients receiving placebo had an increase in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 1.9 mg per deciliter, corresponding to a 6.1% increase (P<0.001). Patients receiving volanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a mean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]), whereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to 5.5 mmol per liter]) (P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as compared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of less than 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 patients who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of the patients who received placebo had such reactions. No patients in the placebo group had platelet counts below 100,000 per microliter, whereas 15 of 33 patients in the volanesorsen group had such levels, including  who had levels below 25,000 per microliter. No patient had platelet counts below 50,000 per microliter after enhanced platelet-monitoring began.Volanesorsen lowered triglyceride levels to less than 750 mg per deciliter in 77% of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Thrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions were common adverse events.

The short-term efficacy of statin therapy in children is well established, but longer follow-up studies evaluating changes in the risk of cardiovascular disease are scarce.We report a 20-year follow-up study of statin therapy in children. A total of 214 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (genetically confirmed in 98% of the patients), who were previously participants in a placebo-controlled trial evaluating the -year efficacy and safety of pravastatin, were invited for follow-up, together with their 95 unaffected siblings. Participants completed a questionnaire, provided blood samples, and underwent measurements of carotid intima-media thickness. The incidence of cardiovascular disease among the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia was compared with that among their 156 affected parents.Of the original cohort, 184 of 214 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (86%) and 77 of 95 siblings (81%) were seen in follow-up; among the 214 patients, data on cardiovascular events and on death from cardiovascular causes were available for 203 (95%) and 214 (100%), respectively. The mean LDL cholesterol level in the patients had decreased from 237.3 to 160.7 mg per deciliter (from 6.13 to 4.16 mmol per liter) - a decrease of 32% from the baseline level; treatment goals (LDL cholesterol <100 mg per deciliter [.59 mmol per liter]) were achieved in 37 patients (20%). Mean progression of carotid intima-media thickness over the entire follow-up period was 0.0056 mm per year in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and 0.0057 mm per year in siblings (mean difference adjusted for sex, -0.0001 mm per year; 95% confidence interval, -0.0010 to 0.0008). The cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events and of death from cardiovascular causes at 39 years of age was lower among the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia than among their affected parents (1% vs. 26% and 0% vs. 7%, respectively).In this study, initiation of statin therapy during childhood in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia slowed the progression of carotid intima-media thickness and reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood.

In this study, we synthesized and characterized a novel G. lucidum polysaccharide‑chromium (III) [GLP-Cr(III)] complex. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the reaction conditions for the maximum chelation rate of GLP-Cr(III) complex. The optimal reaction conditions obtained from RSM were as follows: concentration of CrCl 5.71 mg/mL, pH 6.36, temperature 66.4 °C and time .0 h, respectively. The pH was the most significant factor, followed by reaction temperature and CrCl concentration. Under the optimal conditions, the experimental chelation rate was 94.17 ± 1.0% for GLP-Cr(III) complex, which agreed closely with the predicted value (94.60%). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed that the primary sites of chromium (III)-binding in G. lucidum polysaccharide were OH and CO groups, which induce the morphology change from flat sheet to rough surface. Meanwhile, according to the result of X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystal degree of GLP was disappeared after chelation with Cr(III). The presence of a "blind zone" in the H NMR spectrum obviously indicated the binding of Cr(III) to GLP. Additionally, the effects of GLP-Cr(III) complex on hyperglycemia and  in high fructose and fat diet-induced pre-diabetic mice were also investigated. Results showed that the serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance in mice supplemented with GLP-Cr(III) complex (50 mg/kg day) were significantly lower than the model group (P < 0.01). More importantly, the GLP-Cr(III) complex had no significant adverse effects on the physiological metabolism, organ index, and liver tissue morphology of mice fed a normal diet. These results suggest that GLP-Cr(III) complex could be used as potential functional food ingredients for the prevention or treatment of hyperglycemia and .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The outcome of this study illustrates reduction in glucose and insulin levels significantly in zingerone-treated diabetic groups. Lipid parameters were resumed to normal in zingerone-treated diabetic group as demonstrated by significant reduction in triglycerides, cholesterols (total, low-density and very low-density) levels along with significant increase high-density cholesterols levels. Zingerone-treated diabetic groups exhibited significant reduction in LPO levels and restoration of GSH contents. Administration of zingerone to treated diabetic groups indicated improvement in antioxidant enzymes (GPx, GR, GST, SOD and CAT). Administration of zingerone to treated diabetic groups minimized degeneration of pancreatic β-cells as witnessed from histopathological studies. Our results demonstrate that zingerone modulates hyperglycaemia, , oxidative biochemical markers and degenerative changes in β-cells of treated diabetic groups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581454>Protein Expression Profiling Identifies Key Proteins and Pathways Involved in Growth Inhibitory Effects Exerted by Guggulsterone in Human Colorectal Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading killer cancer worldwide and one of the most common malignancies with increasing incidences of mortality. Guggulsterone (GS) is a plant sterol used for treatment of various ailments such as obesity, , diabetes, and arthritis. In the current study, anti-cancer effects of GS in human colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116 was tested, potential targets identified using mass spectrometry-based label-free shotgun proteomics approach and key pathways validated by proteome profiler antibody arrays. Comprehensive proteomic profiling identified 14 proteins as significantly dysregulated. Proteins involved in cell proliferation/migration, tumorigenesis, cell growth, metabolism, and DNA replication were downregulated while the protein with functional role in exocytosis/tumor suppression was found to be upregulated. Our study evidenced that GS treatment altered expression of Bcl- mediated the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c which triggered the formation of apoptosome as well as activation of caspase-3/7 leading to death of HCT 116 cells via intrinsic apoptosis pathway. GS treatment also induced expression of p53 protein while p21 expression was unaltered with no cell cycle arrest. In addition, GS was found to inhibit NF-kB signaling in colon cancer cells by quelling the expression of its regulated gene products Bcl-, cIAP-1, and survivin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625574>Mitochondria-targeted therapy rescues development and quality of embryos derived from oocytes matured under oxidative stress conditions: a bovine in vitro model.</a></h1><p>Can we use a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant (Mitoquinone) during in vitro embryo culture to rescue developmental competence of oocytes matured under lipotoxic conditions, exhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress?Supplementation of embryo culture media with Mitoquinone reduced oxidative stress and prevented mitochondrial uncoupling in embryos derived from metabolically compromised oocytes in vitro, leading to higher blastocyst rates and lower blastomeric apoptosis.Maternal metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type-II diabetes are associated with  and elevated free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations in the ovarian follicular fluid (FF). Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of palmitic acid (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty acid-free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX- and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

However, the risk factors of an adverse cardiovascular event after a normal exercise (ESE) or dobutamine (DSE) stress echocardiography are not well established.  A cohort of 705 patients without previous history of CAD and a negative ESE/DSE was studied. All studies were performed in a high-volume echocardiologic laboratory and interpreted by two experienced echocardiography-trained cardiologists. Patients with inconclusive studies and those with an evidence of myocardial ischemia were excluded. Demographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic findings were recorded. Patients were followed for at least  years. Independent predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were determined by regression analysis.  During a period of 55.7±17.5 months, MACE occurred in 35 (5.0%) of patients. Negative predictive value (NPV) of DSE was 89.%, which was significantly less than 96.5% for ESE in predicting the occurrence of MACE ( = 0.001). MACE occurred more frequently among older (≥65 years) men with preexisting diabetes, hypertension, and/or . During ESE, a higher maximum blood pressure*heart rate product for the achieved level of metabolic equivalent (METS) of tasks was also an independent predictor of MACE.  Inability of patients to undergo traditional ESE that led to the choice of using DSE alternative reduces the NPV of the stress echocardiography among patients without previous history of CAD. A modest rise of heart rate and blood pressure in response to increased level of activity serves as favorable prognostic value and improves the NPV of stress echocardiography.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652273>Progression of glucose intolerance and cardiometabolic risk factors over a decade in Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A case-control study.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased metabolic risk, though data on long-term follow-up of cardiometabolic traits are limited. We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up.One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41. years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 ± 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 ± 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and  of women with PCOS at follow-up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.%-38.1%) to 47.% (95% CI 40.3%-54.%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type  DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI .13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified that baseline waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71 [95% CI 1.08-.69], p < 0.05) and elevated triglyceride (OR = 6.63 [95% CI 1.23-35.69], p < 0.05) are associated with the progression to T2DM in PCOS. Limitations of this study include moderate sample size with limited number of incident diabetes during follow-up period and potential selection bias.High risk of diabetes and increased cardiovascular disease risk factors among Chinese women with PCOS are highlighted in this long-term follow-up study.

The use of the ratio of total cholesterol-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) is often overlooked. The aim was to study TC/HDL-C in relation to later AMI, in a large sample of women, adjusted for age, educational status, smoking, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. The hypothesis was that increasing TC/HDL-C is associated with an increased risk of later AMI.From December 1995 to February 2000, 6147 women aged 50-59 years from the Womens' Health in Lund area (WHILA) study in southern Sweden underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests and filled in a questionnaire. The women were followed through national registers for incidence of AMI during a mean follow up of 17 years.An increasing TC/HDL-C showed a strong relationship with AMI, with the lowest hazard ratio (HR = 1) in women with a ratio of ≤3.5. The HR for AMI was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.73-1.78) for those with a ratio between 3.5 and 4.0; in those with a ratio between 4.0 and 5.0 the HR for AMI was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.00-.13) and in those with a ratio > 5.0 the HR was 1.89 (95% CI 1.26-.82), after adjusting for potential confounding factors.TC/HDL-C ratio is a powerful predictor of AMI in middle-aged women. The results indicate that this variable should be used in clinical practice and is important for early identification of individuals at risk of AMI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373063>Retinopathy among Chinese subjects with type  diabetes mellitus in Shanghai: A community-based follow-up study.</a></h1><p>To determine the incidence, progression, and regression rates of diabetic retinopathy (DR), as well as their associated factors, in Chinese type  diabetic patients.Diabetic patients who participated in a previous survey were recruited for a 1-year follow-up study. Nonmydriatic fundus photographs were acquired to assess the severity of DR as per the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale (2002). Factors that potentially influence DR outcomes, including its incidence, progression, and regression, were identified via statistical analyses.We initially recruited 2453 subjects, among whom 2331 were followed and included in the final analysis. The incidences of new and progressed (ie, ≥ scale steps) DR were 10.6% and 6.1%, respectively. Moreover, 7.3% of patients with established DR at baseline experienced complete regression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that high glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, P = .021) and  (OR = 1.46, P = .025) were independent predictors of DR development, high HbA1c (OR = 4.16, P = .027) and macroalbuminuria (OR = 5.60, P = .010) predicted DR progression, and low HbA1c (OR = 0.20, P = .001) and low triglyceride levels (OR = 0.34, P = .026) were associated with DR regression.Albumin and HbA1c levels should be closely monitored as signs of progressive retinal damage in diabetic subjects. Optimized control of glucose and triglyceride levels is vital for reducing the incidence of DR or promoting its regression in afflicted patients.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31548127>Statin use increased new-onset diabetes in hypercholesterolemic individuals: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort database (NHIS-HEALS).</a></h1><p>We investigated the association between statin use and new-onset diabetes (NODM) in Korean adults with hypercholesterolemia.This study performed based on data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort for the years from 2002 to 2015. Statin users classified as high- or low- users according to medication possession ratio. Statin non-users consisted of hypercholesterolemic participants who never used statin over the entire follow-up period. 21,469 participants (10,880 statin users, 10,589 statin non-users) with a median follow-up period of 12.5 years were included. We estimated the NODM risk based on the survival analyses. In particular, to adjust for confounding effects, we considered Cox proportional hazards regression models over three stages.Compared to non-users, statin users had a significantly higher risk for NODM. The fully adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) (95% confidential intervals [95% CIs]) of statin users for NODM were 1.43 (1.31-1.57) in men, and 1.86 (1.66-.10) in women, respectively after adjusted confounding factors including age and lifestyle factors.

A retrospective observational cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>The Japanese government has developed and promoted a national nutrient-based dietary guideline for preventing lifestyle-related chronic disease. However, its impact in a real-life setting has never been evaluated. We performed a critical appraisal of the guideline by examining the association between adherence to the guideline and lifestyle-related outcome indicators.This is a retrospective observational cross-sectional study using nationally representative data on health and nutrition characteristics from the 2016 National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japan. We considered 3,861 participants aged ≥20 years, with evidence of low health risks of diabetes, hypertension, , and obesity. Five health outcome indicators (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and body mass index), were employed. A summary score was developed to reflect adherence to the recommended intake of seven nutrients defined by the guideline, including proteins, fat, saturated fatty acid, carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, and potassium. Multivariate quartile regression approaches were employed to examine the association between the adherence score and the health outcome indicators, adjusting for the covariates.Overall, the proportion of those who adhered to the guideline (adherence rate) for all seven nutrients was only 0.3%. There was considerable variation in the adherence rate between the different nutrients, from 24.% to 61.8%. After adjustment for covariates, in most health outcome indicators, regardless of age category and quartile, there was no clear association between the guideline adherence score and indicators.There is plenty of scope for improving the guideline. Nutrient impact on health may not necessarily depend on the amount of each nutrient in the diet. The significance and contribution of synergies between nutrients and complex interactions within foods to health outcomes need to be explored in future guideline updates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625373>Decreased Serum miR-1296 may Serve as an Early Biomarker for the Diagnosis of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Circulating microRNA has become a candidate biomarker for many diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of miR-1296 as a non-invasive biomarker in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Serum samples were collected from normal people and NAFLD patients for biochemical detection. Serum microRNAs were isolated by the NucleoZOL method, and the stem-loop method was used to reverse transcribe the DNA. The relative quantification of miR-1296 was performed by SYBR Green method. Spearman's method was used to analyze the correlation between miR-1296 and serum biochemical parameters.By using -∆∆CT method, we found that, compared with the normal control group, the expression of serum miR-1296 increased in patients with normal lipid NAFLD and those with  NAFLD. At the same time, the expression of microRNA-1296 in the NAFLD  group increased more significantly than that in the NFALD group with normal lipid. Spearman's correlation assay demonstrated that the correlation between the expression of miR-1296 and blood lipids, including TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c, was TC (r = 0.4951, p = 0.0013), TG (r = 0.054, p = 0.6425), HDL-C (r = 0.3435, p = 0.07522), and LDL-C (r = 0.3307, p = 0.0699.

There was a preponderance of male patients in the HP group (78.0% vs 66.1%, P = .02). Associated risk factors, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and , were similar in both groups. Indications for carotid endarterectomy in HP patients include recent stroke (<8 weeks) in 15 patients (15.0%), transient ischemic attack in 23 patients (23.0%), and asymptomatic in 62 patients (62.0%). Three patients (3.0%) with HP required shunt placement compared with 10.9% in the nHP group (P = .009). Completion carotid arteriogram was performed in 6 patients. Perioperative stroke and mortality were similar in both groups. The incidence of cranial nerve injury was higher in the HP group.Most patients with HP can be diagnosed with computed tomography angiography of the neck or catheter-based arteriography. Shunt requirement in patients with HP is significantly lower than in the nHP group. Perioperative stroke and mortality in patients with HP undergoing carotid endarterectomy is similar to the nHP group; however, there is a higher incidence of permanent cranial nerve injury. Carotid artery stenting should be considered in cases in which carotid endarterectomy may be challenging, such as in patients with HP. Overall, our results demonstrate that carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed in patients with HP, however, at an increased risk of permanent cranial nerve injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Several studies have confirmed that obesity (OB),  (HL), or diabetes mellitus (DM) can increase severity, mortality, and complications in AP. However, there is no comprehensive information on the independent or joint effect of MetS components on the outcome of AP. Our aims were (1) to understand whether the components of MetS have an independent effect on the outcome of AP and () to examine the joint effect of their combinations.From 2012 to 2017, 1435 AP cases from 28 centers were included in the prospective AP Registry. Patient groups were formed retrospectively based on the presence of OB, HL, DM, and hypertension (HT). The primary endpoints were mortality, severity, complications of AP, and length of hospital stay. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.1257 patients (55.7 ± 17.0 years) were included in the analysis. The presence of OB was an independent predictive factor for renal failure [OR: .98 (CI: 1.33-6.66)] and obese patients spent a longer time in hospital compared to non-obese patients (12.1 vs. 10.4 days,  = 0.008). HT increased the risk of severe AP [OR: 3.41 (CI: 1.39-8.37)], renal failure [OR: 7.46 (CI: 1.61-34.49)], and the length of hospitalization (11.8 vs. 10.5 days,  = 0.020). HL increased the risk of local complications [OR: 1.51 (CI: 1.10-.07)], renal failure [OR: 6.4 (CI: 1.93-21.17)], and the incidence of newly diagnosed DM [OR: .55 (CI: 1.26-5.19)]. No relation was found between the presence of DM and the outcome of AP. 906 cases (mean age ± : 56.9 ± 16.7 years) had data on all four components of MetS available. The presence of two, three, or four MetS factors increased the incidence of an unfavorable outcome compared to patients with no MetS factors.OB, HT, and HL are independent risk factors for a number of complications. HT is an independent risk factor for severity as well. Components of MetS strongly synergize each other's detrimental effect. It is important to search for and follow up on the components of MetS in AP.Copyright © 2019 Szentesi, Párniczky, Vincze, Bajor, Gódi, Sarlós, Gede, Izbéki, Halász, Márta, Dobszai, Török, Farkas, Papp, Varga, Hamvas, Novák, Mickevicius, Maldonado, Sallinen, Illés, Kui, Erőss, Czakó, Takács and Hegyi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415032>Incidence and Risks for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Steatohepatitis Post-liver Transplant: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>The true incidence and unique risk factors for recurrent and de novo nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) post-liver transplant (LT) remain poorly characterized. We aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for recurrent and de novo NAFLD/NASH post-LT.MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched for studies from 2000 to 2018. Risk of bias was adjudicated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Seventeen studies representing 2378 patients were included. All were retrospective analyses of patients with post-LT liver biopsies, with the exception of  studies that used imaging for outcome assessment. Seven studies evaluated occurrence of recurrent NAFLD/NASH, 3 evaluated de novo occurrence, and 7 evaluated both recurrent and de novo. In studies at generally high or moderate risk of bias, mean 1-, 3-, and ≥5-year incidence rates may be 59%, 57%, and 82% for recurrent NAFLD; 67%, 40%, and 78% for de novo NAFLD; 53%, 57.4%, and 38% for recurrent NASH; and 13%, 16%, and 17% for de novo NASH. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that post-LT body mass index (summarized odds ratio = 1.27) and  were the most consistent predictors of outcomes.There is low confidence in the incidence of recurrent and de novo NAFLD and NASH after LT due to study heterogeneity. Recurrent and de novo NAFLD may occur in over half of recipients as soon as 1 year after LT. NASH recurs in most patients after LT, whereas de novo NASH occurs rarely. NAFLD/NASH after LT is associated with metabolic risk factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595197>Role of Regulatory T cells in Atorvastatin Induced Absorption of Chronic Subdural Hematoma in Rats.</a></h1><p>Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a neurological disorder with a substantial recurrence rate. Atorvastatin is an effective drug for treating  and known to improve neurological outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. Previous studies have reported that atorvastatin treatment promotes hematoma absorption in CSDH, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin mediate absorption of CSDH. 144 male, Wistar rats (6 months old) were randomly divided into the following groups: 1) sham surgery control, ) treatment: CSDH + atorvastatin, and 3) vehicle control: CSDH + saline. Atorvastatin or saline was orally administered daily for 19 days after CSDH procedure. A T2WI MRI was used to evaluate CSDH volume changes during the time course of the study. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure the number of regulatory T cells (Treg). ELISA was used to measure cytokine level in the hematoma border. Neurological function and cognitive outcome were evaluated using Foot-Fault test and Morris Water Maze test, respectively. When compared to saline treatment, atorvastatin treatment accelerated the absorption of CSDH as indicated by decreased hematoma volume in T2WI MRI data on 14 and 21 day after CSDH (P<0.05). Atorvastatin treatment significantly increased the number of Treg in circulation and hematoma border from 3 to 21 day after CSDH. Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased the levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), but increased IL-10 level in the hematoma border. Atorvastatin treatment also improved neurological function and cognitive outcome compared to vehicle treated group. Atorvastatin induced anti-inflammatory responses and increased Treg in circulation and brain which may contribute to the accelerated CSDH absorption in rats.Copyright: © 2019 Quan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365995>[Prevalence and risk factors of aortic valve calcification among the elderly residents of Wuxi city, Jiangsu province].</a></h1><p> To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of aortic valve calcification among the elderly (≥65 years old) resident of Wuxi city, Jiangsu province.  The household registration population aged ≥65 years old in Wuxi city was selected as the research subject by stratified sampling method from August 2017 to December 2018. Echocardiography was performed to assess the aortic valve calcification, and the participants were divided into calcification group and non-calcification group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the related risk factors of aortic valve calcification.  The age of the respondents was (73.6±7.1) years old, of which 48.8% (461 cases) were males.The prevalence rate of aortic valve calcification was 22.0% (208/944) in the elderly (≥ 65 years old) residents in Wuxi city. The prevalence rate in 65-69 years old, 70-74 years old, 75-79 years old, 80-84 years old and ≥85 years old was 16.7% (58/347),16.7% (41/245),16.% (26/161),23.3% (24/103), and 67.0% (59/88),respectively. There were significant differences in age, weight, abdominal circumference, hip circumference, high-salt diets, exercise, hypertension, , diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and carotid atherosclerosis between the non-calcified group (736 cases) and the calcified group (208 cases) (0.01 or 0.05).Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (1.077, 95 1.053-1.101, 0.001), diabetes mellitus (1.697, 95 1.174-.453, 0.005), and coronary heart disease (1.964, 95 1.378-.799, 0.001) were the risk factors of aortic valve calcification.

The exposures were stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, , hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease. The secondary outcome was a new diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Marginal structural Cox models adjusting for time-dependent confounding were used to characterize the association between exposures and outcomes. We also evaluated the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent renal colic (negative control).Among 1,035,536 Medicare beneficiaries followed for a mean of 5. years, 15,531 (1.5%) participants were diagnosed with Parkinson disease and 81,974 (7.9%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. Most evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors, including prior stroke (hazard ratio = 1.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.39-1.72), were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson disease. The magnitudes of these associations were similar, but attenuated, to the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and Alzheimer disease. Confirming the validity of our analytical model, most cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with the subsequent diagnosis of renal colic.Cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with Parkinson disease, an effect comparable to their association with Alzheimer disease.

However, the prognostic significance of troponin elevation following coronary intervention is still debated.Patient-level data from 5 contemporary coronary stent trials and 1 large registry were pooled. Mortality of patients with stable angina, with normal baseline biomarkers, was compared between patients with and those without different cutoff values of cTn and CK-MB.A total of 13,452 patients were included in this pooled analysis. The overall percentage of patients with elevated biomarkers following PCI was 23.9% for CK-MB and 68.4% for cTn. In the patient cohort for whom both assays were available (n = 8,859), .4% had both CK-MB ≥5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and cTn ≥35 × ULN, while 92% had both CK-MB <5 × ULN and cTn <35 × ULN. Among patients with CK-MB ≥5 × ULN (n = 315), 212 (67.3%) also had cTn ≥35 × ULN. Conversely, 390 of patients (64.8%) who had cTn ≥35 × ULN did not have CK-MB ≥5 × ULN. A total of 259 patients (1.9%) died at 1 year; 20 (7.7%) had CK-MB ≥5 × ULN, and 23 (8.8%) had cTn ≥35 × ULN. In the Cox multivariate analysis, in which the CK-MB and cTn ratios post-procedure were forced into the model, age, prior myocardial infarction, lesion complexity, , and CK-MB ratio (≥10) post-procedure were associated with increased 1-year mortality.Following elective PCI in patients in stable condition treated with second-generation drug-eluting stent, CK-MB and cTn elevations remain common. After multivariate adjustment, there was an increased mortality rate with elevation of CK-MB after PCI, whereas cTn elevation was not independently associated with mortality at 1 year.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Forty-five patients had microalbuminuria and 55 subjects were microalbuminuria negative. Endothelial measurements were obtained using specular microscopy. Endothelial cell density, average area, co-efficient of variation, maximum area, minimum area, hexagonality and corneal thickness were compared between the groups on the basis of microalbuminuria, DM duration and medication, HbA , body mass index, serum lipid and protein profiles, hypertension and  diagnosis.There were no significant differences in age, gender, endothelial cell density, average area, co-efficients of variation, maximum area, minimum area, hexagonality or corneal thickness among the microalbuminuria positive, microalbuminuria negative and control groups (p > 0.05). However, microalbuminuria positive patients had lower high-density lipoprotein levels than the microalbuminuria negative patients (p = 0.042). DM and control groups showed similar endothelial measurements (p > 0.05). Patients with a HbA > 7 per cent (53 mmol/mol) had lower hexagonality value (p = 0.039) than in the subjects with a HbA ≤ 7 per cent. No significant differences were found in endothelial parameters when groups were compared based on DM duration, medication and co-morbidities.Microalbuminuria positive and negative patients with DM without retinopathy seem to have similar corneal endothelial measurements with controls. However, patients with a HbA > 7 per cent should be monitored for deterioration in corneal endothelial cell morphology even without diabetic retinopathy, which might be critical prior to anterior segment surgery.© 2019 Optometry Australia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340308>Prevalence of depression and anxiety and their association with cardiovascular risk factors in Northeast Brasil primary care patients.</a></h1><p>Depression and anxiety disorders (DAD) are the most prevalent mental health conditions worldwide.

They play a pivotal role in the management of pain, inflammation, cancer, obesity and diabetes mellitus. CB receptor activity downregulation is hallmark of inflammation and oxidative stress. Strong evidence display the relation between activation of CB receptors with decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-apoptotic factors. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have been validated to confirm the role of CB receptor in the management of obesity,  and diabetes mellitus by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Activation of CB receptor has led to reduction of inflammatory cytokines; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κβ) and also amelioration of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species playing role in apoptosis. Many studies confirmed the role of CB receptors in the insulin secretion via facilitating calcium entry into the pancreatic β-cells. CB receptors also displayed improvement in the neuronal and renal functions by decreasing the oxidative stress and downregulating inflammatory cascade. The present review addresses, potential role of CB receptor activation in management of diabetes and its complications. It also includes the role of CB receptors as an anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory for the treatment of DM and its complications. Also, an informative summary of CB receptor agonist drugs is provided with their potential role in the reduction of glucose levels, increment in the insulin levels, decrease in the hyperglycaemic oxidative stress and inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The complement system plays a leading role in vessel integrity and inflammation response. However, the association between serum complement level and the prognosis of HF remains unclear.In our study, a total of 263 newly diagnosed hypertension patients with HF were included. Eight classical Cardiovascular(CV) risk factors were collected, and plasma C3a, C3b, C5a, sC5b-9, and CH50 levels were detected.Compared with control group, plasma C5a(p<0.001), sC5b-9 (p<0.001) and CH50 (p=0.004) levels of hypertension patients with HF were significantly increased. Based on univariate analysis, an older age, higher frequency of alcohol consumption, high level of BMI, medium or high risk of hypertension, , and diabetes were poor prognostic factors while low levels of C5a, sC5b-9 and CH50 were associated with favorable overall survival (OS).

Herein, we aimed to develop a long-acting delivery system of lixisenatide (Lixi), a glucose-dependent antidiabetic peptide, based on an injectable hydrogel for the synchronous treatment of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complications. Two triblock copolymers, poly(ε-caprolactone--glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone--glycolic acid) and poly(d,l-lactic acid--glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(d,l-lactic acid--glycolic acid) possessing temperature-induced sol-gel transitions, were synthesized by us. Compared to the two single-component hydrogels, their 1/1 mixture hydrogel not only maintained the temperature-induced gelation but also exhibited a steadier degradation profile in vivo. Both in vitro and in vivo release studies demonstrated that the mixture hydrogel provided the sustained release of Lixi for up to 9 days, which was attributed to balanced electrostatic interactions between the positive charges in the peptide and the negative charges in the polymer carrier. The hypoglycemic efficacy of Lixi delivered from the mixture hydrogel after a single subcutaneous injection into diabetic db/db mice was comparable to that of twice-daily administrations of Lixi solution for up to 9 days. Furthermore, three successive administrations of the abovementioned gel system within a month significantly increased the plasma insulin level, lowered glycosylated hemoglobin, and improved the pancreatic function of the animals. These results were superior or equivalent to those of twice-daily injections of Lixi solution for 30 days, but the number of injections was markedly reduced from 60 to 3. Finally, an improvement in , augmentation of nerve fiber density, and enhancement of motor nerve conduction velocity in the gel formulation-treated db/db mice indicated that the sustained delivery of Lixi arrested and even ameliorated diabetic complications. These findings suggested that the Lixi-loaded mixture hydrogel has great potential for the treatment of T2DM with significant improvements in the health and quality of life of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400774>Propolis relieves the cardiotoxicity of chlorpyrifos in diabetic rats via alleviations of paraoxonase-1 and xanthine oxidase genes expression.</a></h1><p>Pesticides cardiotoxicity in case of diabetic-induced cardiac complications is unidentified. The probable amelioration role of propolis is gauged against the cardiotoxic effects of chlorpyrifos in the diabetic rats through paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and xanthine oxidase (XO) genes dysregulation. Fifty-six male rats were distributed (n = 7) into eight groups. The first one saved as control whereas the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th were kept for propolis aqueous extract (100 mg/kg), diabetes (60 mg/kg streptozotocin) and chlorpyrifos (.5 mg/kg), respectively. The 5th was diabetes/chlorpyrifos combination, while 6th, 7th, and 8th were intubated with propolis for four weeks after diabetic induction, chlorpyrifos intoxication, and their combination, respectively. The plasma glucose, lipid profiles, cardiac enzymes and interleukin-6 (IL-6) significantly elevated, while insulin decreased in the diabetic and combination groups. Although the cardiac acetylcholinesterase, total thiols, and PON1 significantly reduced after diabetic and/or chlorpyrifos gavage, the protein carbonyl, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and XO significantly elevated. The mRNA genes expression of PON1 and XO have also confirmed the enzymatic activities. Interestingly, propolis significantly restored the hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, , IL-6 elevations, and antioxidant defense system disorder. These records revealed that the immunomodulatory, anti-diabetic and antioxidant tasks are fine pointers for the cardiovascular defender of propolis especially during diabetes and/or pesticides exposure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of spliced vein bypass (SVB) as primary treatment versus treatment after failed endovascular intervention (endovascular SVB [ESVB]) for infrainguinal revascularization.A retrospective analysis of a single vascular group's database of all SVBs was queried for demographics, indications, intraoperative details, and outcomes. Exclusion criteria included acute ischemia, aneurysm, dual outflow, bypass revisions, and patients lost to immediate follow-up. SPSS software was used for statistical analysis.Two hundred thirty-five infrainguinal SVBs were performed between January 2011 and March 2017. There were 182 SVB (77%) and 53 ESVB (23%) with a mean follow-up of 488 days (range, 1-2140). Demographics between the SVB and ESVB groups were similar in all categories recorded: diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, current smoker, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, , and renal disease (P = .29). Indications for bypass were not statistically significant between SVB and ESVB (P = .48). The study included Rutherford class 3 (14 vs ), class 4 (51 vs 20), class 5 (67 vs 18), and class 6 (50 vs 13). Inflow was grouped into iliac (.6%), femoral (88%), and popliteal (9.8%). Outflow arteries were grouped into below knee popliteal (14.9%) and infrapopliteal (85.1%). Inflow and outflow arteries, as well as number of spliced pieces per bypass were not different between groups. Major amputation rates were not different between SVB and ESVB for the entire study period. There was no statistical difference with patency outcomes based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P = .84).An aggressive endovascular first strategy for treatment of patients without adequate autogenous conduit seems to offer benefit without negatively affecting future bypass options. SVB patency and major amputation rates in this series were not affected by a prior endovascular treatment.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, the significant increase of MDA in control group (p < 0.05) caused a considerable difference between two groups. Glycemic indices containing insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, and QUICKI decrease significantly in both groups (p < 0.05). No considerable effect was observed on blood pressure and homocysteine in intervention group as well as control group.This trial provided some evidences that apple vinegar consumption may cause beneficial effects on glycemic indices and oxidative stress in individuals with diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Participants underwent standardised systemic and ocular examinations. RNFL thickness was obtained using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT). RNFL symmetry (in %) was calculated based on Pearson correlation coefficient between the RNFL thickness profiles of the right and left eyes. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to investigate the associations between ocular and systemic factors with RNFL symmetry.4211 participants (1227 Chinese, 1245 Malays, 1739 Indians) were included. The mean RNFL symmetry was 86.7%±8.5% in Chinese, 84.7%±10.% in Malays and 84.0%±10.7% in Indians. The fifth percentile limit of RNFL symmetry was 71.% in Chinese, 65.0% in Malays and 62.0% in Indians. In multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, , intereye absolute differences in intraocular pressure (IOP), axial length and disc area, Malays (β=-0.9; p=0.03) and Indians (β=-1.76; p<0.001) were found to have lower RNFL symmetry compared with Chinese. Older age, greater intereye differences in IOP, axial length and disc area were significantly associated with lower RNFL symmetry (all p≤0.003).In non-glaucoma individuals, intereye RNFL profile is less symmetric in Malays and Indians than that in Chinese. This also suggests that current commercial optical coherence tomography's deployment of a single, universal RNFL symmetry cut-off for glaucoma detection is flawed, and ethnic-specific cut-off is warranted.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, their side effects and high costs underscore the need for herbal alternative drugs.  is one of the medicinal plants which are important in the management of diabetes mellitus. This study investigated the effect of  seed powder solution on the lipid profile of newly diagnosed type II diabetic patients.A total of  = 114 newly diagnosed type II diabetic patients without any significant diabetes complication were selected. They were grouped into two groups: the treatment group ( = 57) consumed 25 g  seed powder solution orally twice a day for one month and the second group is the control ( = 57) which receives metformin. Blood sample was collected from each participant by a medical technologist/technician before and after the study. Lipid profile was analyzed by using Mindray BS 200E fully automated clinical chemistry analyzer.By the end of the intervention period, the treatment group showed significantly lower total cholesterol level by 13.6% as compared with the baseline level (219.1 ± 35.51 vs. 189.29 ± 29.06,  < 0.001) and the control group (189.29 ± 29.06 vs. 208. ± 40.,  < 0.001); triglyceride level also reduced by 23.53% compared with the baseline level (256.1 ± 15.4 vs. 195.8 ± 82.95,  < 0.001) and compared with the control group (195.8 ± 82.95 vs. 244.1 ± 96.9,  < 0.05); and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level also reduced by 23.4% as compared to the baseline level (137.9 ± 26.9 vs. 105.6 ± 24.,  < 0.001) and the control group (between groups) (105.6 ± 24. vs. 144.1 ± 23.3,  < 0.001), but the treatment group showed significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 21.7% as compared to the baseline level, within group (37.8 ± 1.51 vs. 48.3 ± 11.9,  < 0.001), and the control group, between groups (48.3 ± 11.9 vs. 36.01 ± 9.5,  < 0.001). However, lipid profile levels in the control group were not significantly changed.The present study showed that the administration of  seed powder solution had pronounced effects in improving lipid metabolism in type II diabetic patients with no adverse effects.

T1 also significantly decreased serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterin (LDL) in methionine solution (Mets) induced hyperlipidemic mice. Moreover, hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) were obviously ameliorated after treatment with T1 and the histological observation indicated that T1 ameliorated the injury in liver tissue and inhibited the hepatic lipid accumulation. In the livers of T1-administrated rat, the levels of PPARα related to lipids metabolism were up-regulated.

This study was designed to identify the molecular mediators of kidney injury associated with metabolic syndrome with or without hyperglycemia. We compared renal gene expression profiles in Zucker lean (ZL), Zucker obese (ZO), and Zucker diabetic (ZD) rats using cDNA microarray with quantitative verification of selected transcripts by real-time PCR. Compared to the 20-week-old ZL control (glucose: 110 ± 8 mg/dL), both prediabetic ZO (glucose: 157 ± 11 mg/dL) and diabetic ZD (glucose: 481 ± 37 mg/dL) rats displayed  and kidney injury with a high degree of proteinuria. cDNA microarray identified 25 inflammation and injury-related transcriptomes whose expression levels were similarly increased in ZO and ZD kidneys. Among them, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) was found to be the most highly upregulated in both ZO and ZD kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections revealed a strong correlation between lipid overload and KIM-1 upregulation in proximal tubules of ZO and ZD rats. In cultured primary renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), administration of saturated fatty acid palmitate resulted in an upregulation of KIM-1, osteopontin, and CD44, which was greatly attenuated by U0126, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/. Moreover, knockdown of KIM-1 by siRNA interference inhibited palmitate-induced cleaved caspase-3, osteopontin, and CD44 proteins in primary TECs. Our results indicate that KIM-1 expression is upregulated in renal lipotoxicity and may play an important role in fatty acid-induced inflammation and tubular cell damage in obesity and diabetic kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618750>Metabolic Disorders in Patients with Central Nervous System Infections: Associations with Neurosyphilis.</a></h1><p>Recently, neurosyphilis was found to be associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). Whether the association was specific to neurosyphilis among central nervous system (CNS) infections, and whether neurosyphilis is associated with other prevalent metabolic disorders deserves further study.An in-depth cross-sectional study was conducted with 74 neurosyphilis patients and 74 sex- and age-matched patients with other CNS infections. DM-, hypertension-, and dyslipidemia-related factors were compared between patients with neurosyphilis and those with other CNS infections.The prevalence rates of hypertension and  in neurosyphilis patients were 45.9 and 21.4%, respectively, which were higher than those in patients with other CNS infections (45.9 vs. 28.4%, p = 0.027; 21.4 vs. 8.3%, p = 0.028). In addition, neurosyphilis patients had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (BP; median 139 mm Hg; interquartile range [IQR] 121-151 mm Hg), -diastolic BP (median 83 mm Hg; IQR 76-89 mm Hg), total cholesterol (median 4.86 mmol/L; IQR 3.80-5.51 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein (median 3.39 mmol/L; IQR .52-3.95 mmol/L), and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1; median 1.31 g/L; IQR 1.06-1.52 g/L) levels and lower apoB/A1 ratios (median 0.67; IQR 0.49-0.99) than patients with other CNS infections (p< 0.05). There were no differences in the DM-related factors between patients with neurosyphilis and those with other CNS infections (p> 0.05).Potential association between neurosyphilis and metabolic disorders was found among CNS infections.

This report describes the discovery of NPC1L1, its transport properties, and the inhibitory effects of polyphenols on NPC1L1. NPC1L1 was identified in 2004 while searching for ezetimibe molecular targets. Excessive synthesis of cholesterol results in , which increases the amount of bile cholesterol excreted into the duodenum. The inhibition of NPC1L1 decreases blood cholesterol because food and bile cholesterol are also absorbed from NPC1L1 in the intestine. Some polyphenols, particularly luteolin, have been reported as NPC1L1-mediated anti-dyslipidemia constituents. Luteolin affects NPC1L1 through two mechanisms. Luteolin directly inhibits NPC1L1 by binding to it, which occurs in a short timeframe similar to that for ezetimibe. The other mechanism is the inhibition of NPC1L1 expression. Luteolin reduced the binding of Sterol-regulatory element-binding protein  (SREBP2) in the promoter region of the  gene and decreased mRNA levels of  and . These data suggest that luteolin decreases the expression of NPC1L1 through regulation of transcription factors.

Patients were randomly assigned (:::1) to treatment with the fixed-dose combination, bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg or placebo added to stable background statin therapy for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to week 12 in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Among the 301 patients included in the primary analysis, the mean baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 3.87 mmol/L (149.8 mg/dL). At week 12, the fixed-dose combination lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-36.%) significantly more than placebo (1.8% (placebo-corrected difference -38.0%);  < 0.001), ezetimibe alone (-23.%;  < 0.001) or bempedoic acid alone (-17.%;  < 0.001). The fixed-dose combination lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels similarly across subgroups, including patients receiving high-intensity, other-intensity or no statin therapy. Improvements with the fixed-dose combination were also observed in secondary efficacy endpoints, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In this trial, fixed-dose combination treatment had a generally similar safety profile compared with bempedoic acid, ezetimibe or placebo.The bempedoic acid and ezetimibe fixed-dose combination significantly lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol versus placebo or other oral monotherapies and had a favourable safety profile when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high cardiovascular disease risk.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471367>Milk-induced hypertriglyceridaemia and acute pancreatitis after discontinuation of treatment for type  diabetes and .</a></h1><p>A 39-year-old man with a background of type  diabetes mellitus presented with extreme hypertriglyceridaemia (114.4 mmol/L) and acute pancreatitis, attributed to excessive dairy intake.

The St. Joseph's/Candler Center for Medication Management (CMM) is a pharmacist-managed ambulatory care clinic that provides referral-based ambulatory care services in anticoagulation, diabetes, heart failure, tobacco cessation, transitional care, vaccinations, and wellness contracts for self-insured organizations, and has 147 referring physicians. Nurse Practitioners and Pharmacists evaluate and manage patients under their scope of practice and supervising medical director for the CMM. Pharmacists and Nurse Practitioners educate patients and collaborate with referring physicians for disease state management but do not carry prescriptive authority at CMM. CMM bills for services as a provider-based department of the hospital. CMM is recognized as an Anticoagulation Center of Excellence by the Anticoagulation Forum and is interventional with ambulatory care quality initiatives of the health system. Pharmacists in CMM are board-certified in ambulatory care provided by Board of Pharmacy Specialties and have completed a minimum of a 1-year post-graduate training program accredited by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. CMM has 4 off-campus satellite locations providing ambulatory care referral-based services. Since 2007, the CMM has primarily provided anticoagulation services via laboratory monitoring and management of warfarin.Pharmacists transitioned from provider-based departments of a hospital to outpatient primary care medical groups. This transition changed their job description and the model for reimbursement of the pharmacists' salaries. Four pharmacists were present 60 hours per week from January 2018 to August 2018, and 80 hours per week ( full-time clinical pharmacist positions) from September 2018 to December 2018, to conduct AWVs and disease state management patient encounters. These pharmacists divided their time between a department of a hospital and a traditional medical group of the same health system.For calendar year 2018, 1770 AWVs and 468 disease state management patient care visits were provided exclusively by pharmacists to patients of the 4 primary care medical groups of this community practice health system. Patient visits for disease state management included diabetes, hypertension, , anticoagulation, and tobacco cessation.For the calendar year 2018, 1770 AWVs and 468 disease state management patient visits were provided exclusively by pharmacists, under the direct supervision of physician, to patients of primary care medical groups.This is an example of expanding direct patient care pharmacy services, within a health system, to primary care medical groups, without direct grant or university funding.Copyright © 2019.

Herein, the effects of recombinant BTI (rBTI) on fat accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans were studied. rBTI prevented fat accumulation under normal and high glucose conditions, and led to significantly shorter body widths without affecting C. elegans feeding behavior. Results also indicate that rBTI altered fat breakdown, synthesis, and accumulation by altering the transcription, expression and activity of key enzymes in lipolysis and fat synthesis. In daf- and daf-16 mutants, rBTI did not prevent fat accumulation, indicating that rBTI activity relies on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) pathway. Overall rBTI may regulate changes in lipolysis and fat synthesis by down-regulating the IIS pathway, which can affect fat accumulation. These findings support the application of rBTI in preventing obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, Cassiae semen was reported to be a potentially hepatotoxic herb, and the underlying hepatotoxicity mechanisms or specific hepatotoxic components of Cassiae semen are unknown.In this study, we aimed to explore the potential hepatotoxicity mechanisms and the hepatotoxic components of Cassiae semen.Both young adult male and female SD rats were orally administrated with the aqueous extract of the seeds of Senna obtusifolia (L.) H.S.Irwin & Barneby at doses of 4.73, 15.75, 47.30 g/kg for 28 days, and the body weight, liver coefficient, bile acids, histopathology, serum levels of TC, TG, LDL, HDL, ALP, ALT, AST, and LDH were examined. Lipidomic analysis of rat serum was performed by LC-MS to investigate the specifically changed lipids caused by the aqueous extract treatment. The components absorbed in plasma were detected by UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS. MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these components absorbed in plasma.The serum levels of ALP, AST, ALT, LDH were increased on day 7 with some of which gradually dropped to normal level on day 28. In high dose of the aqueous extract treated group, the histopathological changes were observed based on the cytoplasmic vacuolation in the liver and the increase of bile acids, indicating the hepatotoxicity of the aqueous extract. The changes of TC, TG, LDL, HDL indicated the disorder of lipid metabolism. By comparing the difference in lipids between high dose group and control group, the results showed that the alterations were primarily focused on glycerophospholipid metabolism in both male and female rats. In addition, the glycerolipid metabolism in female rats also changed. Further analyses found that PC (18:/20:4) and LysoPC 18:0 were significantly increased. Among these phytochemicals detected in plasma, nine components in the aqueous extract were considered to have the highest concentrations, particularly some types of anthraquinones (AQs) existing in Cassiae semen (AQs-in-CS), such as obtusifolin, aurantio-obtusin, and obtusin. The MTT assay showed that emodin, obtusifolin, rhein, aurantio-obtusin, and obtusin inhibited cell viability. Considering plasma concentrations and cytotoxicity of these components, our study indicates that the AQs-in-CS (obtusifolin, aurantio-obtusin and obtusin), emodin and rhein are the potential hepatotoxic phytochemicals in the aqueous extract.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

These findings support the recommendation of treating any metabolic component abnormality, even in young adults without a MetS diagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419622>Rationale and design of a nurse-led intervention to extend the HIV treatment cascade for cardiovascular disease prevention trial (EXTRA-CVD).</a></h1><p>Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) are at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In spite of this, uptake of evidence-based clinical interventions for ASCVD risk reduction in the HIV clinic setting is sub-optimal. METHODS: EXTRA-CVD is a 12-month randomized clinical effectiveness trial that will assess the efficacy of a multi-component nurse-led intervention in reducing ASCVD risk among PLHIV. Three hundred high ASCVD risk PLHIV across three sites will be randomized 1:1 to usual care with generic prevention education or the study intervention. The study intervention will consist of four evidence-based components: (1) nurse-led care coordination, () nurse-managed medication protocols and adherence support (3) home BP monitoring, and (4) electronic health records support tools. The primary outcome will be change in systolic blood pressure and secondary outcome will be change in non-HDL cholesterol over the course of the intervention. Tertiary outcomes will include change in the proportion of participants in the following extended cascade categories: (1) appropriately diagnosed with hypertension and  () appropriately managed; (3) at treatment goal (systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg and non-HDL cholesterol < National Lipid Association targets). CONCLUSIONS: The EXTRA-CVD trial will provide evidence appraising the potential impact of nurse-led interventions in reducing ASCVD risk among PLHIV, an essential extension of the HIV care continuum beyond HIV viral suppression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, few of the studies with a small number of patients had tested the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the outcomes and complications among acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. We hypothesized that lipid disorders (LDs), though risk factors for AIS, were associated with better outcomes and fewer post-stroke complications.We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (years 2003-2014) in adult hospitalizations for AIS to determine the outcomes and complications associated with LDs, using ICD-9-CM codes. In 2014, we also aimed to estimate adjusted odds of AIS in patients with LDs compared to patients without LDs. The multivariable survey logistic regression models, weighted to account for sampling strategy, were fitted to evaluate relationship of LDs with AIS among 2014 hospitalizations, and outcomes and complications amongst AIS patients from2003-2014.In 2014, there were 28,212,820 (.02% AIS and 5.50% LDs) hospitalizations. LDs patients had higher prevalence and odds of having AIS compared with non-LDs. Between 2003-2014, of the total 4,224,924 AIS hospitalizations, 451,645 (10.69%) had LDs. Patients with LDs had lower percentages and odds of mortality, risk of death, major/extreme disability, discharge to nursing facility, and complications including epilepsy, stroke-associated pneumonia, GI-bleeding and hemorrhagic-transformation compared to non-LDs. Although LDs are risk factors for AIS, concurrent LDs in AIS is not only associated with lower mortality and disability but also lower post-stroke complications and higher chance of discharge to home.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518413>Gene expression profiling of the bone trabecula in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head by RNA sequencing.</a></h1><p>Early diagnosis and treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is challenging. Bone trabecula play a vital role in the severity and progression of ONFH. In the present study, the investigators used gene expression profiling of bone trabecula to investigate gene alterations in ONFH patients. Osteonecrotic bone trabecula (ONBT) such as necrosis, fibrosis, and lacuna were confirmed by histological examination in the patients. The adjacent ''normal'' bone trabecula (ANBT) did not show any pathological changes. Gene sequencing data revealed that although ANBT showed no significant histological changes, alteration of mRNA profiling in ANBT was observed, similarly to that in ONBT. Our results indicated that the alteration of mRNA profiling in ANBT may cause normal bone tissue to develop into necrotic bone. RNA-seq data indicated that 2297 differentially abundant mRNAs were found in the ONBT group (1032 upregulated and 1265 downregulated) and 1523 differentially abundant mRNAs in the ANBT group (744 upregulated and 799 downregulated) compared with the healthy control group. GO enrichment analysis suggested that fatty acid metabolism and degradation were the main zones enriched with differentially expressed genes (DEG). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that PPARγ pathway was the most significantly regulated pathway. Lipocalin- (LCN2), an osteoblast-enriched secreted protein, was significantly decreased in ONBT suggesting that downregulation of LCN2 might affect lipid metabolism and lead to , and thus promote pathogenesis of ONFH.© The Author(s) 2019.

However geographic disparities persist that may, in part, be attributed to environmental effects.Ischemic heart disease age-adjusted mortality were obtained from the CDC database for years 1999 through 2014 by county, gender, race, and Hispanic origin for the Central Valley of California.There was an increase in mortality from north to south of 14.9 (95% CI: 8.0-21.9, p value <0.0001) in time period 1, 7.9 (95% CI: 0.8-15, p value <0.05) in time period , and 9.

The expression of , a  gene copy, partially compensates for  disruption due to exon-7 excision in 90% of transcripts subsequently explaining the strong clinical heterogeneity. Several alterations in energy metabolism, like glucose intolerance and , have been reported in SMA at both systemic and cellular level, prompting questions about the potential role of energy homeostasis and/or production involvement in disease progression. In this context, we have recently reported the tolerance of mild SMA-like mice ( ) to 10 months of low-intensity running or high-intensity swimming exercise programs, respectively involving aerobic and a mix aerobic/anaerobic muscular metabolic pathways. Here, we investigated whether those exercise-induced benefits were associated with an improvement in metabolic status in mild SMA-like mice. We showed that untrained SMA-like mice exhibited a dysregulation of lipid metabolism with an enhancement of lipogenesis and adipocyte deposits when compared to control mice. Moreover, they displayed a high oxygen consumption and energy expenditure through β-oxidation increase yet for the same levels of spontaneous activity. Interestingly, both exercises significantly improved lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in SMA-like mice, and enhanced oxygen consumption efficiency with the maintenance of a high oxygen consumption for higher levels of spontaneous activity. Surprisingly, more significant effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol with the maintenance of high lipid oxidation. Finally, when combining electron microscopy, respiratory chain complexes expression and enzymatic activity measurements in muscle mitochondria, we found that (1) a muscle-specific decreased in enzymatic activity of respiratory chain I, II, and IV complexes for equal amount of mitochondria and complexes expression and () a significant decline in mitochondrial maximal oxygen consumption, were reduced by both exercise programs. Most of the beneficial effects were obtained with the high-intensity swimming protocol. Taking together, our data support the hypothesis that active physical exercise, including high-intensity protocols, induces metabolic adaptations at both systemic and cellular levels, providing further evidence for its use in association with SMN-overexpressing therapies, in the long-term care of SMA patients.Copyright © 2019 Houdebine, D’Amico, Bastin, Chali, Desseille, Rumeau, Soukkari, Oudot, Rouquet, Bariohay, Roux, Sapaly, Weill, Lopes, Djouadi, Bezier, Charbonnier and Biondi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374036>Deep vein thrombosis secondary to abdominal aortic aneurysm: A case report.</a></h1><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm is an extremely rare cause of deep vein thrombosis. Here we report an elderly gentleman who presented with deep vein thrombosis and was found to have concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm upon ultrasonographic screening. It illustrates the possibility of such an aetiology, and the importance of screening for such aneurysms in a select patient population before heparinization.A 73-year-old Asian gentleman with underlying hypertension, , chronic renal failure, and history of chronic smoking presented to the emergency department with acute left lower limb swelling of 1 day. On examination, the patient was tachycardic (110 beats/minute) and hypertensive (168/84 millimeters mercury (mmHg)). The entire left lower limb was swollen with notable pitting oedema, tenderness, and warmth; left calf swelling was measured to be 4 centimeters (cm).The patient's Wells score of 4 placed him in the high-risk group for deep vein thrombosis. Serum D-dimer was subsequently found to be elevated at 926 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml). Compression ultrasonography revealed a thrombus in the left deep femoral vein, confirming the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. The ultrasonographic evaluation was extended to the abdominal aorta due to the patient's high risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and a 7-cm aneurysm was indeed found. Further computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging localized it to the infrarenal region, with left common iliac vein compression resulting in stagnant venous return.Emergency endovascular repair was performed with insertion of an inferior vena cava filter.The patient was subsequently monitored in the intensive care unit and uneventfully discharged after  weeks.Such clinical presentations of deep vein thrombosis are rare, but physicians are reminded to consider screening for abdominal aneurysms and other anatomical causes before heparinization in patients who seemingly do not have thromboembolic risk factors. This is especially so for the high risk group of male deep vein thrombosis patients aged 65-75 years with a history of smoking who have yet to be screened for abdominal aortic aneurysms, in line with United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia,  and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/ cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty acid synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in oleic acid-treated HuS-E/ cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Patients with unstable or deteriorating cardiac disease within 6 months before enrollment were ineligible. Medical history at baseline and concomitant CV medication use during treatment were reported. A retrospective, blinded review of AE preferred terms was conducted to identify MACE-plus and bleeding events. Subgroup analyses examined the impact of concomitant CV medication use on how pirfenidone treatment affected clinical outcomes.In total, 1247 patients were included [n = 623 pirfenidone (2403 mg/day) and n = 624 placebo].

The main objective of this study is to provide new thoughts in designing functional food with some lipid/glucose metabolism regulating effects for obese people. () Methods: The alleviating abilities of γ-oryzanol, phytosterol or ferulic acid-enriched wheat flour on lipid/glucose metabolic dysfunction were evaluated in male SD rats induced by a high-fat-fructose diet. The underlying mechanisms were clarified using western blot. (3) Results: In an in vitro cell model, γ-oryzanol, phytosterol and ferulic acid regulate lipid/glucose metabolism by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt, and PI3K expression, as well as decreasing expressions of DGAT1 and SCD. The in vivo study shows that ferulic acid and γ-oryzanol-enriched flours are beneficial for managing body weight, improving glucose metabolism,  and hepatic lipid accumulation. Phytosterol-enriched flour exerted remarkable effects in regulating hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and hyperuricemia. Western blot analysis of proteins from liver samples reveals that these enriched flours alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance through their elevation in the phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt. (4) Conclusions: Our study indicates that these enriched flours can serve as a health-promoting functional food to regulate obesity-related lipid/glucose metabolic dysfunction in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519487>Bariatric surgery is safe and effective in Medicare patients regardless of age: an analysis of primary gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy outcomes.</a></h1><p>Numerous studies have shown that bariatric surgery in older patients is safe and effective. However, both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and a Medicare Evidence Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) have cited gaps in the evidence for outcomes in Medicare patients undergoing bariatric surgery. These gaps are predominantly in the safety and outcomes evidence in Medicare patients younger than 65 years old (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] < 65).The aim of our study was to review both the safety and efficacy of gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in Medicare patients compared with other payers.A single academic medical center.A prospectively maintained database of 3300 patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 2007 and December 2017 was utilized. The outcomes of Medicare patients undergoing RYGB and SG were analyzed and compared to those of similar patients covered by Medicaid or Commercial insurers.There were too few patients with commercial insurance older than 65 to compare to those with Medicare (CMS ≥ 65). Mortality at 90 days for CMS ≥ 65 was 1.3% and the overall complication rate was 20.1% (minor 15.6%; major 7.1%). Total weight loss (TWL) at 6 months and 1, , and 3 years was 25.3%, 30.0%, 29.9%, and 29.4% respectively. For any time after surgery, 23% of CMS ≥ 65 had complete remission of diabetes and 45% had partial remission. Demographic analysis of CMS < 65 found Medicare patients were significantly older with more diabetes, hypertension and  than those with commercial payers. Mortality at 90 days for CMS < 65 was 0.6% and the overall complication rate was 18.3% (minor 14.3%; major 4.7%). Mortality was not significantly different between payers. After adjustment for baseline differences and comparing to the Medicare group, the commercial group was less likely to have minor complications (P = .019), any complications (P = .007), and extended length of stay (P < .001). The TWL for the entire cohort age <65 at 6 months and 1, , and 3 years was 28.1%, 34.1%, 34.1%, and 31.8% respectively. After adjusting for differences, there was no significant difference in TWL between payers. For any time after surgery, complete remission of diabetes was 45% in CMS < 65 patients and partial remission was 59%. The comparison of remission between groups was then adjusted for DiaRem score and surgery type. CMS < 65 patients had significantly less partial remission of diabetes than commercial patients (P = .034) but no difference in complete remission.RYGB and SG are both safe and effective in Medicare patients of all ages. CMS ≥ 65 have acceptable mortality and complication rates with TWL and diabetes remission similar to younger patients. CMS < 65 patients are older than those with commercial insurance with more comorbid disease. While they have longer hospital stays after bariatric surgery, their weight loss and complete remission of diabetes are no different than patients with Medicaid or commercial insurance. This study helps fill an important evidence gap in bariatric surgical patients raised by both Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and a Medicare Evidence Advisory Committee.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Patients enrolled in LLTG (n=200) or CG (n=453) were compared by a propensity score matching analysis (PSM, caliper = 0.01, n=) to balance pre-existing clinical characteristics. After matching, the effective rate of different  types and different types of audiogram in both groups was performed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (CMH).After PSM 440 patients were studied (146 in LLTG, 294 in CG), and the influence of interference factors were balanced, meanwhile the final hearing level was better in LLTG than CG (p=0.043), hearing gain was higher in LLTG than CG (p=0.006). Cure rate (32.9%), significant improvement rate (22.6%) and the total effective rate (76.0%) in LLTG were better than that in CG group (26.5%,15.6% and 63.6%) after the Pearson chi-square test(p<0.05). Analysis with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test showed that the total effective rate was better in LLTG than CG respectively (p=0.009) in each different  types, there were statistically significant differences in TG higher group (TG Group) (p=0.018). Moreover, the total effective rate was better in LLTG than CG (p=0.006) for all patterns of audiogram, and there were statistically significant differences in flat audiogram (p=0.043).Lipid-lowering therapy can improve the curative effect of sudden hearing loss patients combined with . There was a significant difference in the total effective rate of TG Group after lipid intervention, suggesting that there might be causal relationship between TG and sudden hearing loss. There was a significant difference in the total effective rate between flat audiogram, which may suggest flat hearing loss was more likely caused by vascular dysfunction.

This investigation was performed as an observational retrospective cohort study includes 137 patients (age 61 ± 15; 34.3% women) with a primary diagnosis of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent).We collected information about the drug therapy, comorbidities and survival of AF patients and determined their congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or TIA or thromboembolism, vascular disease, age, sex category (CHA2DS2-VASc) scores. Statistical analysis identified patients with high CHA2DS2-VASc scores and defined the predictive value of individual parameters, or their combination, with regards to the outcomes of stroke and mortality.CHA2DS2-VASc scores identified 43.8% of the patients as low to intermediate risk (score 0-1) and 56.% of the patients as high risk (score ≥). Increasing CHA2DS2-VASc scores were not only accompanied by an increase in the incidence of stroke (Ptrend < .001) but also by an increase in the 3 to 5 years mortality (P = .005). Comparison of anticoagulation and anti-aggregation treatment between the 3 groups of AF did not show any significant statistical difference. Highly significant predictors of death were the CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.10-.67, P < .017) as well as other risk factors not included in the CHA2DS2-VASc score such as valvular heart disease (OR 5.04, 95% CI 1.10-23.10, P = .037),  (OR 4.82, 95% CI 1.03-22.63, P = .046) and chronic renal failure (OR 14.21, 95% CI .41-83.91, P = .003). The type of AF type did not affect survival (P = .158) nor the incidence of stroke (P = .466). Patients with paroxysmal AF were linked to significantly lower frequencies of ischemic heart disease (P < .0001), vascular disease (P = .002), diabetes mellitus (P = .047), valvular heart disease (P = .03) and heart failure/left ventricular dysfunction (P = .015).The CHA2DS2-VASc score correctly predicted the patients at high-risk for 3 to 5 years mortality and confirmed its significant predictive value in the patients with AF.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636783>Half Dose Once-Daily Pemafibrate Effectively Improved Hypertriglyceridemia in Real Practice.</a></h1><p> is a worldwide problem related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and sudden death. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been treated well by the use of statins, but hypertriglyceridemia was not the case. Previous fibrates have been shown a certain effect of preventing CVD events, but some remain not enough or even could cause adverse events. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator (SPPARMα) with the potential to reduce high triglycerides. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety profile of Pemafibrate, we have started with half dose once-daily administration.Thirty-three patients with hypertriglyceridemia, triglyceride (TG) levels > 150 mg/dL, were treated with Pemafibrate (0.1 mg, once daily) from July 2018 to February 2019. Changes in TG (non-fasting) and LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine (Cre), blood glucose (PBG) (postprandial), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and body weight (BW) levels were investigated, compared to the baseline levels of the previous visit.Of the 33 patients, 11 were using other fibrates before. Nine were given statins along with. Baseline TG was 285.0 (210.5 - 423.0) mg/dL, LDL-C 116.4 ± 33.4 mg/dL, and HDL-C 46.5 ± 12.5 mg/dL. TG changes were statistically significant (-20.8 ± 47.6%; P < 0.01). Patients with TG > 200 mg/dL, who used fibrates for the first time, experienced the most significant changes in TG levels (-34.5 ± 37.%; P < 0.01). In patients using statins already, TG reduction was relatively less, compared to those not using statins (-25.4 ± 36.1%; P < 0.01). HDL-C increased by 3.9 ± 10. mg/dL (P < 0.05). LDL-C increased by 16.6 ± 23.7 mg/dL (P < 0.001) in patients not using statins, while patients using statins did not show such significant change. AST, ALT, CK, Cre, PBG, HbA1c and BW did not significantly change.A selective PPARα modulator, Pemafibrate, effectively improved hypertriglyceridemia without major adverse events in real practice, with half dose once-daily administration. Combined use of statins might be a potent therapeutic maneuver for dyslipidemia.Copyright 2019, Iitake et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649547>Mitophagy in Hepatic Insulin Resistance: Therapeutic Potential and Concerns.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by central obesity, hypertension, and , increases the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease, type  diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic diseases. It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460623>Pioneering studies on monogenic central precocious puberty.</a></h1><p>Pubertal timing in humans is determined by complex interactions including hormonal, metabolic, environmental, ethnic, and genetic factors. Central precocious puberty (CPP) is defined as the premature reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, starting before the ages of 8 and 9 years in girls and boys, respectively; familial CPP is defined by the occurrence of CPP in two or more family members. Pioneering studies have evidenced the participation of genetic factors in pubertal timing, mainly identifying genetic causes of CPP in sporadic and familial cases. In this context, rare activating mutations were identified in genes of the kisspeptin excitatory pathway (KISS1R and KISS1 mutations). More recently, loss-of-function mutations in two imprinted genes (MKRN3 and DLK1) have been identified as important causes of familial CPP, describing novel players in the modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in physiological and pathological conditions. MKRN3 mutations are the most common cause of familial CPP, and patients with MKRN3 mutations present clinical features indistinguishable from idiopathic CPP. Meanwhile, adult patients with DLK1 mutations present high frequency of metabolic alterations (overweight/obesity, early onset type  diabetes and ), indicating that DLK1 may be a novel link between reproduction and metabolism.

(Bread wheat) and Zea maize L. (maize) have been developed in Pakistan, which are randomly consumed by normal individuals and diabetic patients. In this study, 17 wheat and 9 maize varieties were tested for starch composition, glycemic index, radical scavenging activities, and lipid profile. Among various wheat samples, KPK15 was observed to have highest ,-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, while CZP132011 was highest radical scavenger among various maize samples. Glycemic index of wheat varieties varied between 62.83 ± .19 and 70.70 ± .82 in Hashim10 and Insaf, respectively, while for maize it ranged between 56.45 ± 1.95 in Sarhad white and 70.76 ± 4.40 in CHT1W. In most of the varieties, a linear correlation was observed between glycemic index and amylose contents. The data show that KPK15 and Saleem 2000 are the best wheat varieties while Sarhad white is the best among maize samples to be consumed by normal individuals and diabetic patients.

Demographics, comorbidity variables, and outcomes were collected. Preprocedure computed tomography scans were used to measure the PMA. Descriptive statistics summarized the demographic information and predictor variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses were performed. The main outcome measure was survival time.Median survival time for patients with PMA in the lowest quartile of the distribution (≤1442 mm) was 65.5 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 37.7-78.9) vs 91. months (95% CI 77.9-110.0 when PMA >1442 mm). Multivariate analysis revealed lower PMA was associated with decreased survival (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.68; 95% CI 1.15-.40, P = .006). Similarly, the presence of coronary artery disease (AHR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-.35, P = .045) and statin use after EVAR were associated with decreased survival (AHR .36, 95% CI 1.24-4.49, P = .009).  was associated with increased survival after EVAR (AHR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.81, P = .004).

However, its mechanisms responsible for anti-hyperlipidemic activity have not been fully identified. The aim of the study was to investigate the lipid-lowering mechanisms of C3R through inhibition of lipid digestion and absorption in vitro.The inhibitory activity of C3R against pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase was evaluated using enzymatic fluorometric and enzymatic colorimetric assays, respectively. An enzyme kinetic study using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk plot was performed to understand the possible types of inhibition. The formation of cholesterol micelles was determined using the cholesterol assay kit. The bile acid binding was measured using the colorimetric assay. The NBD cholesterol uptake in Caco- cells was determined using fluorometric assay. The mRNA expression of cholesterol transporter (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) was determined by RT-PCR.The results showed that C3R was a mixed-type competitive inhibitor of pancreatic lipase with the IC value of 59.4 ± 1.41 μM. Furthermore, C3R (0.125-1 mM) inhibited pancreatic cholesterol esterase about 5-18%. In addition, C3R inhibited the formation of cholesterol micelles and bound to primary and secondary bile acid. In Caco- cells, C3R (12.5-100 μM) exhibited a significant reduction in cholesterol uptake in both free cholesterol (17-41%) and mixed micelles (20-30%). Finally, C3R (100 μM) was able to suppress mRNA expression of NPC1L1 in Caco- cells after 24 h incubation.The present findings suggest that C3R acts as a lipid-lowering agent through inhibition of lipid digestion and absorption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422992>Disease Burdens and Risk Factors for Diabetes, Hypertension, and  among Refugees in Buffalo, New York, 2004-2014.</a></h1><p>Limited is known about prevalence and risk factors for diabetes, hypertension, and  among refugees.At a refugee clinic in Buffalo, N.Y.

The aim was to investigate the prevalence of  and the effect of surgical resection.One hundred and thirty-two patients with PPGLs underwent an operation at the National Institutes of Health from 2009 to 2016, of which 54 patients met the inclusion criteria. Clinical demographics, BMI, genetic mutations, tumor size, perioperative catecholamine levels and perioperative lipid panels were retrospectively reviewed. Spearman correlation between catecholamines and lipid levels was evaluated. Paired Wilcoxon and paired t test were used to analyze differences in pre- and postoperative lipid levels.Preoperatively, 51 patients (94.4%) had elevated catecholamines, thirteen (24.1%) had elevated total cholesterol (TC) (>200 mg/dL), nine (16.6%) had elevated LDL (>130 mg/dL) and ten (18.5%) had elevated triglycerides (>150 mg/dL). Serum and urinary metanephrine levels were positively associated with TC (r = 0.2792, p = 0.0372 and r = 0.4146, p = 0.0031, respectively) and LDL levels (r = 0.2977, p = 0.0259 and r = 0.4434, p = 0.0014, respectively). Mean TC decreased from 176.4 to 166.3 mg/dL (p = 0.0064) and mean HDL decreased from 56.7 to 53. mg/dL (p = 0.0253) after PPGL resection (median 3.1 months (range 1.3-50.) between lipid panels). Most patients with elevated TC (76.9%) had improvement with mean TC decreasing from 225 to 200. mg/dL (p = 0.0230). Of patients with elevated LDL, 66.7% had improvement with mean LDL decreasing from 149 to 131.1 mg/dL (p = 0.0313).The prevalence of  in patients with PPGLs is 46%. Future prospective studies are needed to determine whether surgical resection improves TC and/or LDL levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356905>Chronic iron overload intensifies atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient mice: Role of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.</a></h1><p>We previously demonstrated that iron overload induces endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which could increase the risk for atherosclerosis. However, the iron-related harmfulness under a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis is still unclear. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that chronic iron overload may change vascular reactivity associated with worsening of the atherosclerotic process in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice.Serum and aortas of wild-type (WT) and apoE(-/-) mice injected with iron-dextran (IO, 10 mg/mouse/day, ip) or saline 5 times a week for 4 weeks, were used.Iron overload increased serum levels of iron and biomarkers of liver injury and oxidative stress, and iron deposition in the aorta in both lines, but only apoE(-/-) IO mice had intensified hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. By scanning electron microscopy, the small endothelial structural damage caused by iron in WT was worsened in the apoE(-/-) group. However, endothelial dysfunction was found only in the apoE(-/-) IO group, identified by impaired relaxation to acetylcholine and hyperreactivity to phenylephrine associated with reduced nitric oxide modulation. Moreover, tiron and indomethacin attenuated reactivity to phenylephrine with greater magnitude in aortas of the apoE(-/-) IO group. Confirming, there were changes in the antioxidant (superoxide dismutase and catalase) activity, increased expression of cyclooxygenase- in the aorta and elevated levels of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin metabolites in the urine of apoE(-/-) IO.Our results showed that chronic iron overload intensifies the atherosclerotic process and induces endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerotic mice, probably due to the oxidative stress and the imbalance between the relaxing and contractile factors synthesized by the damaged endothelium.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and few effective therapeutic approaches are available. Summary and Key Messages: A myriad of different rodent models has been developed to elucidate pathophysiology of NAFLD/NASH and guide therapeutic strategy. To date, no single rodent model can display the whole disease spectrum and metabolic features associated with human NASH, but can imitate particular characteristics. In this paper, we review the most commonly used dietary, genetic, and chemical rodent models for NAFLD referring to their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we illustrate the status of latest treatment strategy using various NAFLD rodent models. We hope to provide critical guidance for researchers to select appropriate animal models.© 2019 S.

Both groups were followed up to identify individuals who later developed diabetes. After a follow-up identification of diabetes, diabetes and non-diabetes cohorts were subjected to an analysis for the risk of macrovascular events between diagnosis of diabetes and December 31, 2013.Compared with individuals without statin therapy, statin-treated patients had a higher risk of developing diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio: .46; 95% confidence interval: .37-.57). Compared with statin-treated patients without diabetes, statin-treated participants developing diabetes had a higher overall incidence of macrovascular complications (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.62-1.88). Moreover, compared with that of other diabetogenic statins, patients taking pravastatin had a lower risk of developing diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.55-0.73) and macrovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.98).According to these findings, prescribing statins that have a neutral effect on glucose homeostasis may be advisable for Asian populations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patients were stratified by smoking status at time of enrollment. The 1- and 5-year ischemic outcomes were compared.Among 24,354 patients with available data on smoking status, 6,722 (27.6%) were current smokers. Smokers were younger and less likely to have diabetes mellitus; hypertension; ; or prior myocardial infarction (MI), PCI, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Angiographically, smokers had longer lesions, more complex lesions, and more occlusions, but were less likely to have moderate or severe calcification or tortuosity. At 5 years, smokers had significantly higher rates of MI (7.8% vs. 5.6%; p < 0.0001) and definite or probable stent thrombosis (3.5% vs. 1.8%; p < 0.0001); however, there were no differences in the rates of death, cardiac death, target lesion revascularization, or composite endpoints (cardiac death, target vessel MI, or ischemic target lesion revascularization). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, smoking was a strong independent predictor of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63 to .12; p < 0.0001), cardiac death (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.38 to .05; p < 0.0001), MI (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.58; p < 0.0001), stent thrombosis (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.99; p < 0.0001), and target lesion failure (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.30; p = 0.005).The present large, patient-level, pooled analysis with 5-year follow-up clearly demonstrates smoking to be an important predictor of adverse outcomes after PCI.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

The present study was designed to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine (Dex) treatment could reduce the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgery in a  model.  was induced in Sprague‑Dawley rats (male, 6‑7 months old) by consuming a high‑fat diet, and rats were divided into three groups (n=10 each) and underwent: exploratory laparotomy to introduce surgical trauma (surgery group), laparotomy and Dex treatment (surgery+Dex group), or sham surgery (sham group). Learning, memory and exploration behavior were assessed using the Morris water maze. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑1β, were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. BBB permeability was assessed by Evans blue staining. Relative major facilitator superfamily domain‑containing protein  (Mfsd2a) mRNA expression was determined by quantitative PCR. In the Morris water maze test, the time and distance ratio for the surgery group was significantly lower than those of the sham and surgery+Dex groups (P<0.05). In addition, the TNF‑α concentrations in the sham and surgery+Dex groups were lower than that in the surgery group (P<0.05 on days 1 and 3). Evans Blue staining was increased in the surgery group on day 1 (P<0.01). Mfsd2a mRNA expression was higher in the sham and surgery+Dex groups compared with that noted in the surgery group (P<0.05). In conclusion, Dex treatment decreased the incidence of cognitive dysfunction following surgical trauma in a  rat model. We demonstrated that Dex stabilized BBB integrity through increased Mfsd2a gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336439>Lipid profile in type  diabetic patients with new dapagliflozin treatment; actual clinical experience data of six months retrospective lipid profile from single center.</a></h1><p>Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter  inhibitor that improves glycemic control in patients with type II diabetes mellitus which increasing urinary glucose excretion. With numerous controlled experimental studies of dapagliflozin, evaluation of real-life data after entry into clinical practice is an important condition. In our study, the effects of dapagliflozin (10 mg) on lipid profile were investigated retrospectively.A total of thirty-one type  diabetic patients with HbA1c level between 6,5% and 13%, aged 45-80 years and whose body mass index higher than 20 kg/m were enrolled to the study. Data before dapagliflozin treatment and three and six months results were recorded.Dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c levels by 0,9% at 3 months and 0,79% at 6 months. Total cholesterol level decreased 17,6 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol level decreased 13,4 mg/dl and triglyceride level by 25.9 mg/dl at the 6th months and it is observed that there is no serious side effect on the usage for 6 months.There are conflicting results about the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the lipid profile in the literature.

Multislice CT (MSCT) is a non-invasive alternative to coronary angiography (CAG) suggested for patients with a low-to-intermediate risk of CAD. No established definition of such patients exists. Our purpose was to develop a simple score to identify as large a group as possible with a suitable pretest risk of CAD.Retrospective study of patients in Denmark undergoing CAG due to newly diagnosed HF from 2010 to 2014. All Danish patients were registered in two databases according to geographical location. We used data from one registry and multiple logistic regression with backwards elimination to find predictors of CAD and used the derived OR to develop a clinical risk score called the CT-HF score, which was subsequently validated in the other database.The main cohort consisted of 2171 patients and the validation cohort consisted of 2795 patients with 24% and 27% of patients having significant CAD, respectively. Among significant predictor, the strongest was extracardiac arteriopathy (OR .84). Other significant factors were male sex, smoking, , diabetes mellitus, angina and age. A proposed cut-off of 9 points identified 61% of patients with a 15% risk of having CAD, resulting in an estimated savings of 15% of the cost and 21% of the radiation.A simple score based on clinical risk factors could identify HF patients with a low risk of CAD; these patients may have benefitted from MSCT as a gatekeeper for CAG.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This was a prospective single-center observational study. From January 2013 to December 2013, 4 744 patients diagnosed as PCAD and treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in Fuwai Hospital were enrolled. The general clinical data, laboratory results and interventional treatment data of all patients were collected, and patients were followed up for  years after PCI and the incidence of events including MACCE and bleeding was analyzed. The baseline data and clinical events of PCAD patients of different genders were compared. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze whether gender was an influencing factor of different clinical events of PCAD patients within  years after PCI, and other relevant influencing factors of MACCE and bleeding events.  Among the 4 744 PCAD patients included, there were 3 390 (71.5%) male aged (47.0±5.4) years old and 1 354 (28.5%) female aged (57.0±5.8) years old. Compared with female patients, male patients had higher body mass index, higher proportion of , smoking, myocardial infarction, previous PCI, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, radial artery approach, intravenous ultrasound use and chronic occlusive lesions (all 0.05). Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, past stroke history, non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and the use of calcium channel blockers were lower in male patients than in female patients (all 0.05).

However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of .6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180.5 ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/m2, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and ): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes.

This study uses a population-based dataset to examine this question.Data from the National Health Interview Survey were used to identify 13 266 cancer survivors who completed surveys from 2011 to 2015. Prevalence of CVD and associated risk factors, patterns of doctor visitation, and receipt of CVD preventive care were examined. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine factors associated with the receipt of preventive care for survivors with and without CVD risk factors.CVD risk factors were prevalent in older cancer survivors 65 years and older (56.9% with , 66.8% with hypertension) and younger survivors younger than 50 years (35.4% obese, 30.3% current smokers). Rates of blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose monitoring were high, but rates of lifestyle modification were lower (54.8% moderate exercise, 47.1% smoking cessation attempts among smokers). Although 71.5% of survivors at  years or less from diagnosis saw both general and specialist doctors, only 51.6% of survivors at 5 or more years saw both, and 43.5% saw only a general doctor.

Accumulation of lipid-laden foam cells in cutaneous LE is a rare phenomenon that has been reported in discoid LE and lupus panniculitis, each only once in the literature. It has also been described within lesions of various other dermatoses in patients without lipid, hepatic, or endocrine abnormalities. Its mechanism remains unclear, but it has been hypothesized that intracellular lipids released from degenerating cells contribute to lipidization of mononuclear scavengers. Xanthomatous infiltration in cutaneous LE is an unusual feature, and its presence may not necessarily signify an underlying metabolic disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393858>Dual peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-α/γ activation inhibits SIRT1-PGC1α axis and causes cardiac dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α/γ agonists that were developed to target  and hyperglycemia in type  diabetes patients, caused cardiac dysfunction or other adverse effects. We studied the mechanisms that underlie the cardiotoxic effects of a dual PPARα/γ agonist, tesaglitazar, in wild type and diabetic (leptin receptor deficient - db/db) mice. Mice treated with tesaglitazar-containing chow or high fat diet developed cardiac dysfunction despite lower plasma triglycerides and glucose levels. Expression of cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, had the most profound reduction among various fatty acid metabolism genes. Furthermore, we observed increased acetylation of PGC1α, which suggests PGC1α inhibition and lowered sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. This change was associated with lower mitochondrial abundance. Combined pharmacological activation of PPARα and PPARγ in C57BL/6 mice reproduced the reduction of PGC1α expression and mitochondrial abundance. Resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 activation attenuated tesaglitazar-induced cardiac dysfunction and corrected myocardial mitochondrial respiration in C57BL/6 and diabetic mice but not in cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt1-/- mice. Our data shows that drugs, which activate both PPARα and PPARγ lead to cardiac dysfunction associated with PGC1α suppression and lower mitochondrial abundance likely due to competition between these two transcription factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553600>Molecular Dynamics Study of the Hybridization between RNA and Modified Oligonucleotides.</a></h1><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are attractive drug candidates for many diseases as they can modulate the expression of gene networks. Recently, we discovered that DNAs targeting microRNA-22-3p (miR-22-3p) hold the potential for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders (type  diabetes mellitus, , and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) by turning fat-storing white adipocytes into fat-burning adipocytes. In this work, we explored the effects of chemical modifications, including phosphorothioate (PS), locked nucleic acid (LNA), and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), on the structure and energy of DNA analogs by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To achieve a reliable prediction of the hybridization free energy, the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the free energy perturbation technique were employed. The calculated hybridization free energies are generally compatible with previous experiments. For LNA and PNA, the enhanced duplex stability can be explained by the preorganization mechanism, i.e., the single strands adopt stable helical structures similar to those in the duplex. For PS, the S and R isomers (Sp and Rp) have preferences for C2'-endo and C3'-endo sugar puckering conformations, respectively, and therefore Sp is less stable than Rp in DNA/RNA hybrids. In addition, the solvation penalty of Rp accounts for its destabilization effect. PS-LNA is similar to LNA as the sugar puckering is dominated by the locked sugar ring. This work demonstrated that MD simulations with polarizable force fields are useful for the understanding and design of modified nucleic acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602839>[Mechanism of Danzhi Jiangtang Capsules on improving liver injury in  rats based on MAPK pathway].</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and preliminary mechanism of Danzhi Jiangtang Capsules( DJC) on liver of hyperlipidemic rats. The  models were successfully made by high-fat diet for 12 weeks in male SD rats,and then divided into model control group and DJC treatment groups( 500 and 1 000 mg·kg~(-1)·d-1) via gavage administration for additional 8 weeks.The levels of serum lipid and liver metabolism indices were detected; HE and oil red O staining were used to observe the pathological changes of liver. Expression levels of extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/( ERK1/),c-Jun N-terminal kinase( JNK),and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase( p38 MAPK) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction( RT-PCR). Expression of MCP-1,phosphorylated ERK( p-ERK),phosphorylated JNK( p-JNK),and phosphorylated p38 MAPK( p-p38) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The results showed that DJC decreased body weight and serum levels of total cholesterol( TC),triglyceride( TG),alanine aminotransferase( ALT),aspartate aminotransferase( AST),increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol( HDL-C) level,ameliorate injury and lipid deposition in the liver induced by the high-fat diet,decreased mRNA expression of ERK1/,JNK and p-38 MAPK as well as protein expression of p-ERK,p-JNK,p-p38,and MCP-1,somewhat showing a dose-dependent effect. Therefore,DJC has an obvious protective effect on liver of hyperlipidemic rats with certain dose-dependent effect,and the mechanism may be related with inhibiting MAPK pathways and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369843>Autophagy protects peripheral blood mononuclear cells against inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress in diabetic dyslipidemia.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results in severe oxidative and nitrosative stress and inflammation when associated with . In this study, we have attempted to explore the role of autophagy in T2DM subjects with or without dyslipidemia.Experiments were carried out in isolated Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from study subjects and insulin resistant HepG2 cells utilizing flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and molecular biology techniques like western blotting, immunofluorescence and real time PCR.In case of T2DM with dyslipidemia, higher population of autophagy positive cell was detected compared to T2DM which may have been originated due to higher stress. Flow cytometric data indicated autophagy to be triggered by both oxidative and nitrosative stress in PBMC of diabetic dyslipidemic patients, which is a novel finding of our work. Expression of LC3 puncta, a hallmark of autophagy was observed at periphery of PBMC and Hep G2 cells in case of diabetic dyslipidemic condition. Increased expression of ATG5, LC3B and Beclin1 supports the autophagic pathway in both PBMC and Hep G2 cells. Upon blocking autophagy by 3-methyl adenine (3MA), the apoptotic cell population increased significantly. Autophagy was also been evidenced to control oxidative stress mediated up-regulation of inflammatory markers like IL-6, TNF-α.Induction of autophagy emerged to be a protective mechanism for the diabetic cells coupled with dyslipidemia. Not only Reactive oxygen species, but also reactive nitrogen species was involved in autophagy induction process. Moreover inhibition study documented autophagy to have a protective role in pro-inflammatory responses. Thus, enhancing autophagic activity may be an efficient mechanism leading to new therapeutic strategy to restore the glycemic regulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TLR2-deficient mice were shown to have improved insulin sensitivity and reduced diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Previous studies demonstrated that prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure causes dyslipidemia accompanied by increased body weight and insulin resistance in offspring. To determine whether TLRs are involved in this complex abnormal phenotype, we analyzed TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels in adipose tissues from offspring with prenatal LPS-exposure (offspring-pLPS) and compared these levels to those of control offspring with prenatal saline-exposure (offspring-pSaline). TLR2 expression was specifically upregulated in the adipose tissue of offspring-pLPS mice. However, unexpectedly, TLR2-deficient offspring-pLPS mice not only presented with an abnormal phenotype comparable to that of wild-type offspring-pLPS mice but also exhibited significantly more severe . Our further analyses revealed a dramatic upregulation of TLR4 expression and overactivation of the TLR4/Myd88 signaling pathway in TLR2-deficient offspring-pLPS adipose tissue. Our finding suggests a compensatory genetic interaction between TLR2 and TLR4 in the context of prenatal inflammatory stimulation, and this interaction likely contributes to the prenatal inflammation-induced  and lipid overload-induced obesity, thus providing a potential mechanism for the fetal origin of adult metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619421>Multiple chronic conditions at a major urban health system: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of frequencies, costs and comorbidity patterns.</a></h1><p>To (1) examine the burden of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) in an urban health system, and () propose a methodology to identify subpopulations of interest based on diagnosis groups and costs.Retrospective cross-sectional study.Mount Sinai Health System, set in all five boroughs of New York City, USA.192 085 adult (18+) plan members of capitated Medicaid contracts between the Healthfirst managed care organisation and the Mount Sinai Health System in the years 2012 to 2014.We classified adults as having 0, 1, , 3, 4 or 5+ chronic conditions from a list of 69 chronic conditions. After summarising the demographics, geography and prevalence of MCC within this population, we then described groups of patients (segments) using a novel methodology: we combinatorially defined 18 768 potential segments of patients by a pair of chronic conditions, a sex and an age group, and then ranked segments by (1) frequency, () cost and (3) ratios of observed to expected frequencies of co-occurring chronic conditions. We then compiled pairs of conditions that occur more frequently together than otherwise expected.61.5% of the study population suffers from two or more chronic conditions. The most frequent dyad was hypertension and  (19%) and the most frequent triad was diabetes, hypertension and  (10%). Women aged 50 to 65 with hypertension and  were the leading cost segment in the study population. Costs and prevalence of MCC increase with number of conditions and age. The disease dyads associated with the largest observed/expected ratios were pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction. Inter-borough range MCC prevalence was 16%.In this low-income, urban population, MCC is more prevalent (61%) than nationally (42%), motivating further research and intervention in this population. By identifying potential target populations in an interpretable manner, this segmenting methodology has utility for health services analysts.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) are a sensitive neuroimaging marker of SVD. We aimed to explore the risk factors and associations with other SVD markers of PVS in two topographical regions (in the basal ganglia [BG] and centrum semiovale [CS]) in a cohort of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients.  We included 306 consecutive patients from a prospective spontaneous ICH cohort. We rated PVS, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), and lacunes with validated visual rating scale. We collected clinical information using standardized forms. We predefined severe PVS as score >  and examined associations between PVS in both BG and CS regions and clinical and imaging markers of SVD by logistic regression.  In the multivariable logistic regression, increasing age (OR = 1.075; 95% CI = 1.038-1.113,  < 0.001), high CS PVS degrees (OR = 6.906; 95% CI = 3.024-15.774,  < 0.001), extensive periventricular WMH (OR = .878; 95% CI = 1.298-6.379,  = 0.009), and the presence of CMB (OR = 4.073, 95% CI = 1.869-8.877,  < 0.001) were independently associated with BG PVS severity. Alcohol-drinking habit (OR = .805; 95% CI = 1.451-5.422,  = 0.002),  history (OR = 3.782; 95% CI = 1.582-8.783,  = 0.003), high BG PVS degrees (OR = 6.293; 95% CI = .755-14.371,  < 0.001) and the presence of strictly lobar CMB (OR = .556, 95% CI = 1.285-5.085,  = 0.008) were independent predictors of increased CS PVS severity.  MRI-visible PVS in BG and CS regions are inter-related and have different risk factors in spontaneous ICH patients. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanism and clinical importance of PVS, with possible implications for cerebrovascular disease prevention and effective treatments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501611>Contribution of genetics to visceral adiposity and its relation to cardiovascular and metabolic disease.</a></h1><p>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-fat stored around the internal organs-has been suggested as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, as well as all-cause, cardiovascular-specific and cancer-specific mortality. Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobank cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type  diabetes and , and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type  diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95% CI = 4.48-12.0) in females and an odds ratio of .50 (95% CI = 1.98-3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type  diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412679>Vindoline-A Natural Product from Catharanthus Roseus Reduces  and Renal Pathophysiology in Experimental Type  Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and kidney diseases in diabetes are linked to increased mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vindoline derived from   in diabetes-induced CVDs and kidney disease through assessing inflammation, oxidative stress,  and kidney function parameters. Type  diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by 10% fructose water intake for two weeks, followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of 40mg/kg body weight of streptozotocin (STZ). Six groups ( = 8) of randomly divided rats received vindoline (20mg/kg) or glibenclamide (5mg/kg) daily for 6 weeks via oral gavage. Lipid profile markers and markers of atherogenic index were decreased in diabetic rats after treatment with vindoline and glibenclamide. The levels of urea were significantly increased in the diabetic control group (13.66 ± 0.9) compared to the diabetic groups treated with vindoline and glibenclamide (10.62 ± 0.6 and 10.82 ± 0.8), respectively. Vindoline did not significantly alter the levels of inflammatory cytokines; however glibenclamide lowered the levels of TNF-α in kidney and heart tissues. Vindoline improved the ferric reducing antioxidant power in diabetic hearts, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) oxygen radical absorbance capacity was increased in the kidneys. Lipid peroxidation was reduced when compared to the diabetic controls. Vindoline restored the structure of the renal parenchyma and was accompanied by significant decrease in the expression of caspase 9 in diabetic rats when compared to the diabetic controls.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477022>Clinical outcomes of coronary artery bifurcation disease patients underwent Culotte two-stent technique: a single center experience.</a></h1><p>Percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary artery bifurcation disease (CABD) remains challenging. In patients of CABD with situations that two-stent strategy is needed, the culotte technique is a widely used method and also as the majority at out institution. We sought to take a look of the clinical outcomes of our culotte stenting patients.This retrospective study analyzed 238 consecutive CABD patients who underwent culotte two-stent technique at a tertiary medical center between July 2008 and November 2015.Culotte technique was used in 238 lesions in 238 patients. Of these patients, all DES were implanted for culotte two-stent technique. Most of these patients were elderly, male gender, ACS on admission and multiple vessel disease. The bifurcation lesions were mostly located at left coronary artery (51.3%), categorized as true bifurcation lesion (92%) and calculated less than 70 degree of bifurcation angle (74.4%). During a medium 3.27-year follow up, the angle of bifurcation lesion ≥70° and body mass index were positively independent predictors for target lesion failure (TLF), diabetes mellitus was an independent predictor of target vessel revascularization, and statin therapy for , hemoglobin and EF were negatively independent factors associated to total mortality. The rates of in-hospital and total mortalities were 4. and 17.6%.In this cohort of CABD patients with most left main and left anterior descending artery lesions treated by culotte stenting, the procedural success rate was high and the intermediate clinical outcomes were acceptable.

We sought to assess the image quality, luminal stenosis and utility of CCTA in elderly patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable chest pain.Retrospective analysis of elderly patients (> 75 years) who underwent 320-detector row CCTA between 2012-2017 at MonashHeart. The CCTA was analysed for degree maximal coronary stenosis by CAD-RADS classification, image quality by a 5-point Likert score (1-poor, -adequate, 3-good, 4-very good, 5-excellent) and presence of artefact limiting interpretability.1011 elderly patients (62% females, 78.8 ± 3.3 years) were studied. Cardiovascular risk factor prevalence included: hypertension (65%),  (48%), diabetes (19%) and smoking (21%). The CCTA was evaluable in 68% of patients which included 52% with non-obstructive CAD (< 50% stenosis), 48% with obstructive CAD (> 50%) stenosis. Mean Likert score was 3.1 ± 0.6 corresponding to good image quality. Of the 323 (32%) of patients with a non-interpretable CCTA, 80% were due to calcified plaque and 20% due to motion artefact. Male gender ( = 0.009), age ( = 0.02), excess motion ( < 0.01) and diabetes mellitus ( = 0.03) were associated with non-interpretable CCTA.Although CCTA is a feasible non-invasive tool for assessment of elderly patients with stable chest pain, clinicians should still be cautious about referring elderly patients for CCTA.

Extensive clinical data suggests that the prevalence of  in CKD patients is significantly higher than in the general population. Lipid metabolism disorders can damage the renal parenchyma and promote the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cyanate is a uremic toxin that has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Usually, 0.8% of the molar concentration of urea is converted into cyanate, while myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate to produce cyanate at the site of inflammation during smoking, inflammation, or exposure to environmental pollution. One of the important physiological functions of cyanate is protein carbonylation, a non-enzymatic post-translational protein modification. Carbamylation reactions on proteins are capable of irreversibly changing protein structure and function, resulting in pathologic molecular and cellular responses. In addition, recent studies have shown that cyanate can directly damage vascular tissue by producing large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress leads to the disorder of liver lipid metabolism, which is also an important mechanism leading to cirrhosis and liver fibrosis. However, the influence of cyanate on liver has remained unclear. In this research, we explored the effects of cyanate on the oxidative stress injury and abnormal lipid metabolism in mice and HL-7702 cells. In results, cyanate induced  and oxidative stress by influencing the content of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) in liver. Cyanate inhibited NF-E2-related factor  (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), activated the mTOR pathway. Oxidative stress on the cells reduced significantly by treating with TBHQ, an antioxidant, which is also an activator of Nrf2. The activity of Nrf2 was rehabilitated and phosphorylation of mTOR decreased. In conclusion, cyanate could induce oxidative stress damage and lipid deposition by inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which was rescued by inhibitor of Nrf2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361624>Intestinal lymphatic vessels and their role in chylomicron absorption and lipid homeostasis.</a></h1><p>In this review, we describe novel findings related to intestinal lipid transport in lymphatic vessels.Studies have shown that chylomicron entry to lacteals and lymph movement in intestinal lymphatic capillaries is an active process. Regulators of this intestinal chylomicron transport include among others the autonomous nervous system, transcription factors like PLAGL2, and molecular regulators, such as VEGF-A/Nrp1/VEGFR1, VEGF-C/VEGFR3, DLL4, CALCRL and GLP-. Chylomicron transport in intestinal lymphatics is now emerging not only as an option for drug delivery but also as a new candidate for drug targeting in lipid-related disorders.Dysfunctions of lymphatic lipid transport can result in conditions such as dyslipidaemia. Intestinal lymphatics also provide several potential therapeutic possibilities: molecular regulation of lacteal cell-to-cell junctioning and lymph flow could provide new ways of treating conditions like  and associated diseases, such as atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and fatty-liver disease. The intestinal lymphatic system can also be employed to deliver lipid nanoparticles as drug carriers to the venous circulation for improved treatment outcome.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D status on lipid profile in premenopausal women.A total of 315 nonsmoking premenopausal female volunteers without diabetes mellitus were included in the study. Patients were divided into four subgroups. The groups were as follows: patients with less than or equal to 12 ng/ml (group 1, =126) vitamin D levels, between 20 and 12 ng/ml (group , =48), between 30 and 20 ng/ml (group 3, =21), and at least 30 ng/ml (group 4, =120) vitamin D levels. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively). In unadjusted analysis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were found to be correlated negatively with BMI (=0.0005), LDL-C (=0.01), and non-HDL-C (=0.003) and correlated positively with HDL-C levels (=0.006). After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, and log parathormone levels were made, no correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and lipid (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG) levels (=0.91, 0.06, 0.95, 0.79, respectively).There may be an association between vitamin D insufficiency and dyslipidemia.

The extent of  in these very high-risk patients in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), along with the treatment strategies employed, is not clear.The Dyslipidemia International Study II was a multinational observational analysis carried out from 2012 to 2014. Patients were enrolled if they had either stable CHD or an ACS. Patient characteristics, lipid levels, and use of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were recorded at enrollment. For the ACS patients, the LLT used during the 4 months' follow-up period was documented, as were any cardiovascular events.A total of 416 patients were recruited from two centers in the UAE, 216 with stable CHD and 200 hospitalized with an ACS. Comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors were extremely common. A low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of <70 mg/dl, recommended for patients at very high cardiovascular risk, was attained by 39.3% of the LLT-treated CHD patients and 33.3% of the LLT-treated ACS patients at enrollment. The mean atorvastatin-equivalent daily statin dose was 29 ± 15 mg for the CHD patients, with 13.7% additionally using ezetimibe. For the ACS patients, the daily dosage was 23 ± 13 mg at admission, rising to 39 ± 12 mg by the end of the 4-month follow-up. The use of nonstatin agents was extremely low in this group.Despite LLT being widely used,  was found to be prevalent in ACS and CHD patients in the UAE.

A probable protective role may be played by the Mediterranean diet. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of dyslipidaemia, assess blood lipid status and treatment and examine the association between blood lipids, dyslipidaemia and Mediterranean diet.Data were from the Hellenic National Nutrition and Health Survey (HNNHS). Data from 3775 adults (40.8% males) were obtained by trained personnel and disease status was categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases codes (10th version). Blood lipid measurements were obtained from a subsample ( = 1080, mean age 40.1 years; 37.8% male). The Mediterranean diet score (MedDiet score) was calculated from 24-h recalls. The relationships between higher MedDiet score (>23), lipid levels and status were examined using linearized multiple linear and logistic regressions, respectively.In total, 20.7% of the population was dyslipidaemic, with 59.0% (no sex differences) receiving treatment, and 46.6% of the treated having a normal lipid profile. Lipid status awareness was 35.5% (64.5% unaware). Males aged 19-39 had higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than females (in mg/dl;  for all <0.05); these were significantly higher in overweight and obese individuals in all age groups, except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( for all <0.001). Higher MedDiet score was associated with significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the pooled sample (-6.39 mg/dl; 95% confidence interval (CI): -12.60, 0.17), in all males (-10.61 mg/dl; 95% CI: -19.89, -1.34) and in overweight and obese males (-15.6 mg/dl; 95% CI: -29.25, -1.94).This study underlines the abnormal lipid profile in the young, mostly male, population who are highly unaware and under-treated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494031>Smoking and Diabetes Control in Adults With Type 1 and Type  Diabetes: A Nationwide Study From the 2018 National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran.</a></h1><p>Smoking is among the top leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, studies on the association between smoking and diabetes complications and metabolic control have shown conflicting results. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of smoking with micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes and lipid and glycemic indices.We used the National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran database of 99,651 adult patients with diabetes across Iran. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between smoking and diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy. This association was adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), hypertension, , medication, obesity and type of diabetes.Smoking was associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy (odds ratios [ORs] for patients with type 1 diabetes were 1.51, .29, .70 and .40, respectively; for patients with type  diabetes, ORs were 1.27, 1.21, 1.51 and 1.70, respectively; all with p values <0.001). Among patients with type 1 diabetes, smoking was significantly (p<0.05) associated with A1C (OR, .12), -h postglucose level (OR, 1.30), triglycerides (OR, 1.48) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) control (OR, 1.34). Among patients with type  diabetes, smoking was significantly associated with A1C (OR, 1.09) and HDL control (OR, 1.21).Smoking was associated with multiple diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy and worse A1C and HDL control in both patients with type 1 and type  diabetes.

Here, we report the therapeutic effect of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter  inhibitor (SGLT2i), on hypertension + -induced HFpEF in a pig model.HFpEF pigs were established by infusing a combination of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II), and Western diet (WD) feeding for 18 weeks. In the 9th week, half of the HFpEF pigs were randomly assigned to receive additional dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/day) by oral gavage daily for the next 9 weeks. Blood pressure, lipid levels, echocardiography and cardiac hemodynamics for cardiac structural and functional changes, as well as epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations in the plasma and tissues were measured. After sacrifice, cardiac fibrosis, the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activity in the cardiovascular system were also determined.Blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were markedly increased in HFpEF pigs, but only blood pressure was significantly decreased after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment. By echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment, dapagliflozin significantly attenuated heart concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs, but failed to improve diastolic function and compliance with the left ventricle (LV). In the dapagliflozin treatment group, TH expression and norepinephrine concentration in the aorta were strongly mitigated compared to that in the HFpEF group. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in aortic tissue were markedly elevated in HFpEF pigs and inhibited by dapagliflozin. Furthermore, the reduced expression of eNOS and the PKG-1 protein and the cGMP content in the aortas of HFpEF pigs were significantly restored after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment.9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment decreases hypertension and reverses LV concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs partly by restraining sympathetic tone in the aorta, leading to inhibition of the inflammatory response and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593012>The Prevalence of Nonalcoholic Fatty Pancreas by Endoscopic Ultrasonography.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic steatosis or fatty pancreas refers to the fat accumulation in the pancreas, which can lead to inflammation and fibrosis, β-cell dysfunction, fibrosis, and, possibly, pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to study the prevalence of fatty pancreas and its risk factors in patients referred to an endosonography center.During 18 months, 228 patients who were referred to our endosonography center for various reasons were evaluated for fatty pancreas. Fatty pancreas was defined as hyperechoic pancreas echotexture compared with spleen echotexture. Demographic characteristics, past medical history, and laboratory measurements were compared between groups with and without fatty pancreas to determine the risk factors for fatty pancreas.The prevalence of fatty pancreas was 25.9%. Patients with fatty pancreas had a significantly higher mean level of uric acid (P = 0.04), frequency of ischemic heart disease (P = 0.03),  (P = 0.04), frequency of fatty liver (P < 0.001), and aortic intima thickness (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, substance abuse, and use of oral contraceptives in the  groups.Fatty pancreas is a common disorder.

Many diabetic complications and comorbidities are attributable to poor glycemic control. The aim of this study was to update and extend the national diabetes reports on the status of comorbidities, diabetes care and complications in Iran. Moreover, we investigated the risk factors of poor glycemic control in the Iranian population.National database of 99,651 patients with diabetes who attended university-affiliated clinics between April 1, 2017 and February 30, 2018 was used to carry out a cross-sectional study. Stepwise backward selection logistic regression model was used to examine the associated factors of glycemic control.In this study 73.0% and 56.5% of the enrolled population with diabetes, had hypertension and , respectively. The prevalence of patients who received education for nutrition therapy or diabetes self-management was 16.3% and 23.3% respectively. Poor glycemic control was associated with male gender (OR=1.06, p=0.001), obesity (OR=1.03, p=0.05), duration of diabetes (OR=1.018, p<0.001), smoking (OR=1.08, p=0.041), hypertension (OR=1.53, p<0.001),  (OR=1.15, p<0.001), insulin therapy (OR=1.26, p<0.001) and combination of insulin and oral anti-diabetic agents compared to oral anti-diabetic agents alone (OR=.36, p<0.001).We demonstrated that the prevalence of diabetes comorbidities is high in Iranian population and that a great proportion of Iranian patients with diabetes had not reached the goal of glycemic control. Our findings provide a starting point from which to investigate the obstacles that prevent patients with diabetes from reaching metabolic targets.Copyright © 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

It is unknown whether customized birth weight charts better identify newborns at risk of long-term adverse outcomes than population birth weight charts. We aimed to examine whether birth weight classification according to customized charts is superior to population charts at identification of newborns at risk of adverse cardio-metabolic and respiratory health outcomes.In a population-based prospective cohort study among 6052 pregnant women and their children, we measured infant catch-up growth, overweight, high blood pressure, , liver steatosis, clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors, and asthma at age 10. Small size and large size for gestational age at birth was defined as birth weight in the lowest or highest decile, respectively, of population or customized charts. Association with birth weight classification was assessed using logistic regression models.Of the total of 605 newborns classified as small size for gestational age by population charts, 150 (24.8%) were reclassified as appropriate size for gestational age by customized charts, whereas of the total of 605 newborns classified as large size for gestational age by population charts, 129 (21.3%) cases were reclassified as appropriate size for gestational age by customized charts. Compared to newborns born appropriate size for gestational age, newborns born small size for gestational age according to customized charts had increased risks of infant catch-up growth (odds ratio (OR) 5.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.22 to 6.29)), high blood pressure (OR .05 (95% CI 1.55 to .72)), and clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors at 10 years (OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.18 to .34)). No associations were observed for overweight, , liver steatosis, or asthma. Newborns born large-size for gestational age according to customized charts had higher risk of catch-down-growth only (OR 3.84 (95% CI 3.22 to 4.59)). The direction and strength of the observed associations were largely similar when we used classification according to population charts.Small-size-for-gestational-age newborns seem to be at risk of long-term adverse cardio-metabolic health outcomes, irrespective of the use of customized or population birth weight charts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584433>Relationship of serum salusin beta levels with coronary slow flow.</a></h1><p>The pathophysiology of coronary slow flow (CSF) has not been clarified. Salusin-β is released predominantly from the atheroma plaques and influences the pathophysiologic processes of atherosclerosis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine serum salusin-β levels in CSF and its correlation with CSF.The study included 39 patients with CSF, and the control group (n=42) consisted of consecutive subjects with normal coronary arteriogram. We measured salusin-β and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count (TFC).Age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diabetes, , and smoking rates were similar (p values>0.05) in both groups.

Results from an eight-week group program utilizing an ad-libitum whole-food plant-based dietary pattern, were reviewed. There were 79 participants, all self-referred from the community, including 24 (30.4%) who were already vegetarian or vegan at baseline. Seventy-eight participants (98.7%) completed the eight-week program. Among completers, those with higher BMI at baseline lost a larger percentage of their body weight (total body weight loss of 3.0 ± SD .1%, 5.8 ± .8%, and 6.4 ± .5% for participants who had baseline BMI in normal, overweight, and obese range, respectively). The average weight loss for all the completers was 5.5 ± 3.0 kg ( 0.0001). Final blood pressure and plasma lipids were reduced compared to baseline (SBP decreased 7.1 ± 15.5 mmHg ( = 0.0002), DBP decreased 7.3 ± 10.9 mmHg ( 0.0001), total cholesterol decreased 25. ± 24.7 mg/dL ( 0.0001), LDL decreased 15.3 ± 21.1 mg/dL ( 0.0001)). Twenty-one (26.9%) participants were able to decrease or stop at least one chronic medication compared to two (.6%) participants who required an increased dose of a chronic medication. Participants who were already vegetarian or vegan at baseline experienced statistically significant weight loss and reductions in total and LDL cholesterol. There was a non-significant trend toward less weight loss in these participants compared to participants who were non-vegetarian at baseline. Reductions in total and LDL cholesterol were not significantly different when comparing vegetarian or vegan and non-vegetarian participants. A whole-food plant-based dietary intervention may provide significant short-term benefits for both non-vegetarian, vegetarian, and vegan individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532959>Polypill for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in an Underserved Population.</a></h1><p>Persons with low socioeconomic status and nonwhite persons in the United States have high rates of cardiovascular disease. The use of combination pills (also called "polypills") containing low doses of medications with proven benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular disease may be beneficial in such persons. However, few data are available regarding the use of polypill therapy in underserved communities in the United States, in which adherence to guideline-based care is generally low.We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving adults without cardiovascular disease. Participants were assigned to the polypill group or the usual-care group at a federally qualified community health center in Alabama. Components of the polypill were atorvastatin (at a dose of 10 mg), amlodipine (.5 mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg). The two primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level at 12 months.The trial enrolled 303 adults, of whom 96% were black. Three quarters of the participants had an annual income below $15,000. The mean estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk was 12.7%, the baseline blood pressure was 140/83 mm Hg, and the baseline LDL cholesterol level was 113 mg per deciliter. The monthly cost of the polypill was $26. At 12 months, adherence to the polypill regimen, as assessed on the basis of pill counts, was 86%. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 9 mm Hg in the polypill group, as compared with  mm Hg in the usual-care group (difference, -7 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -12 to -; P = 0.003). The mean LDL cholesterol level decreased by 15 mg per deciliter in the polypill group, as compared with 4 mg per deciliter in the usual-care group (difference, -11 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, -18 to -5; P<0.001).A polypill-based strategy led to greater reductions in systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol level than were observed with usual care in a socioeconomically vulnerable minority population.

We investigated the effect of amygdalin on the cell death and the level of pro-apoptotic Bax protein and anti-apoptotic Bcl- protein in SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell line. The cell viability of SK-BR-3 cells was evaluated by MTT assay in different concentration of amygdalin. The level of Bax and Bcl- in SK-BR-3 cells were measured by western blot analysis. For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of Bax and Bcl- protein level and percent of cell viability between groups. The molecular docking studies of amygdalin within the Bcl- (PDB ID: 4LVT) and HER2 (PDB ID: 3RCD) active site, were performed using AutoDock 4..5. Amygdalin induced a significant reduction of cell viability in SK-BR-3 after 24-h treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Also, amygdalin causes an increase in pro-apoptotic Bax protein and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl- protein expression in the SK-BR-3 cells. Molecular docking studies showed that amygdalin interacts with the active site amino acids of Bcl- and HER2 through hydrogen bonding and some hydrophobic interactions. Amygdalin can induce apoptotic death in SK-BR-3 cells by increasing pro-apoptotic Bax protein and decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl- protein expression. The results suggest that amygdalin may be a valuable candidate for the treatment of breast cancer, especially in HER2 positive cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337059>Anti-Diabetic Effects and Mechanisms of Dietary Polysaccharides.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial, heterogeneous metabolic disorder, causing various health complications and economic issues, which apparently impacts the human's life. Currently, commercial diabetic drugs are clinically managed for diabetic treatment that has definite side effects. Dietary polysaccharides mainly derive from natural sources, including medicinal plants, grains, fruits, vegetables, edible mushroom, and medicinal foods, and possess anti-diabetic potential. Hence, this review summarizes the effects of dietary polysaccharides on diabetes and underlying molecular mechanisms related to inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and diabetes in various animal models. The analysis of literature and appropriate data on anti-diabetic polysaccharide from electronic databases was conducted. In vivo and in vitro trials have revealed that treatment of these polysaccharides has hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, which enhance pancreatic -cell mass and alleviates -cell dysfunction. It enhances insulin signaling pathways through insulin receptors and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, and eventually modulates ERK/JNK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, dietary polysaccharides can effectively ameliorate hyperglycemia, , low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and, thus, consumption of polysaccharides can be a valuable choice for diabetic control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468074>Case-control study on the association between the GATA2 gene and premature myocardial infarction in the Iranian population.</a></h1><p>In recent decades, due to the high prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), numerous studies have attempted to elucidate genetic contributing factors in these complex disorders. A very interesting gene in this regard is GATA-binding protein  (GATA2), an important regulator of various gene expressions in vascular endothelial cells. Accordingly, the association of different GATA2 polymorphisms with CAD and MI has already been evaluated. Rs2713604 is a genetic marker whose association with CAD has not been reproduced in previous studies. Considering the importance of replicating the initial association, the present case-control study aimed to examine the association of this intronic variant with premature MI in a sample of the Iranian population. In this study, 193 participants from Jahrom Hospital (Jahrom, Iran) were consecutively recruited during a 1.5-year period, and, following blood sampling, genomic DNA was extracted. We then proceeded to genotype rs2713604 using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and statistically analyzed the data. After adjustment for , hypertension, and type  diabetes mellitus, the results of the multivariate regression analysis showed no significant association between rs2713604 and premature MI.

Identifying those at risk of developing active CHB requiring antiviral therapy is important. In this study, we prospectively characterize incidence rates and predictors of transitioning from inactive to active CHB in a North American adult cohort.Participants in the multicenter National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Hepatitis B Research Network cohort who were HBeAg negative with baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA ≤ 10,000 IU/mL were included in the study. Cox regression models were used to estimate the proportion of individuals in 3 baseline HBV DNA categories (≤100, 101 to ≤,000, and ,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL) who developed phase transition defined by HBV DNA > 10,000 IU/mL and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > × upper limit of normal or initiated treatment during follow-up.Of 970 participants meeting inclusion criteria, 15% experienced phase transition or initiated treatment over a median follow-up of 4 years: 9% of those with baseline HBV DNA ≤ 100 IU/mL, 14% with HBV DNA 101 to ≤,000 IU/mL, and 24% with HBV DNA ,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL (P < 0.001). The overall rate of phase transition or treatment initiation was 7.6 per 100 person-years: 4.6 in those with HBV DNA ≤ 100 IU/mL, 6.8 in those with HBV DNA 101 to ≤,000 IU/mL, and 12. in those with HBV DNA ,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL (P < 0.001). Factors independently associated with higher rate of phase transition or treatment initiation included HBV genotype B or C, higher baseline ALT and HBV DNA levels, lower platelet count, quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen > 1,000 IU/mL, and . Only higher ALT, higher HBV DNA, and lower platelets were associated with phase transition when patients starting treatment were censored.Most adults in this North American cohort with HBeAg-negative CHB and low-level viremia remained inactive and off treatment over 4 years.

GLP-1 RAs are listed as second-line treatment in the 2017 Chinese Guideline for patients with T2DM in whom prior oral antidiabetic therapy has failed. This study compares the baseline characteristics of Chinese patients with T2DM taking different prescriptions of first injectable therapy (GLP-1-RA or insulin).The IQVIA Patient Diary Study database, which captures data from a patient medical record-based physician online survey, was the data source used in this study. Cross-sectional patient data were collected from hospitals in 15 major Chinese cities from June 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018. Adults with T2DM commencing either GLP-1-RA or insulin use as their first injectable antidiabetic therapy were included. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the GLP-1-RA and insulin treatment groups, using t tests and χ or Fisher exact tests.Overall, 563 patients using GLP-1-RAs and 2387 using insulin were identified. In general, patients using GLP-1-RA were younger (mean [SD], 49.6 [10.8] years vs 59.3 [10.9] years), had lower mean (SD) glycosylated hemoglobin levels (8.5% [1.%] vs 9.6 [1.7%]), had lower mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels (9.0 [1.9] mmol/L vs 10.8 [.6] mmol/L), higher mean (SD) body mass indexes (29.4 [3.9] kg/m vs 24.6 [3.1] kg/m), had higher comorbidity of obesity (75% vs 15%), had a higher occurrence of  (63% vs 44%), and had lower occurrence of neuropathy (13% vs 34%) when compared with those using insulin (P < 0.0001 for all). The results of multivariate logistic regression model indicate that when controlling other variables in the multivariate logistic regression model, a higher fasting plasma glucose level and a longer diagnosis duration are associated with higher odds of insulin therapy commencement, but higher body mass index and some comorbidities, such as obesity and , are associated with higher odds of being a GLP-1-RA user.Significant differences were identified between selected baseline characteristics of patients initiating GLP-1-RA and insulin therapy, suggesting that these medicines are more likely to be prescribed to different types of patients with T2DM in China. These findings may help to inform Chinese physicians regarding the characteristics of those patients with T2DM who are initiating treatment with a GLP-1-RA or insulin. Because the Patient Diary Study data were collected from hospitals in 15 major cities in China, one noteworthy limitation is that the results may not represent the overall treatment pattern in rural areas of China.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The left eyes of phakic adult subjects without media opacity were analyzed. Subjective undilated manifest refraction was performed, and refractive errors were defined as myopia (spherical equivalent [SE], <-1 D), emmetropia (SE between -1 D and +1 D) and hyperopia (SE >+1 D). Retinal oximetry was performed using the Oxymap system (Oxymap Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland). Multivariate linear regression models were constructed to assess the relationship between retinal vascular oxygen saturation, SE, and AL obtained with optical biometry, with adjustments for age, sex, race, blood pressure, , and diabetes mellitus.There were 85 subjects, with mean age of 66.1 ± 11.3 years. The majority were female (60%) and Chinese (84%). A total of 60% were myopic, 28% emmetropic, and 12% hyperopic. Mean SE was -5.29 ± 6.51 D and mean AL was 25.30 ± .99 mm. In multivariate analyses, more myopic SE and longer AL were associated with lower retinal arteriolar oxygen saturation (regression coefficient B = 0.61 [95% confidence interval, 0.28, 0.95],  = 0.001; and B = -1.13 [95% confidence interval, -1.71, -0.56],  < 0.001, respectively). Subjects with myopic SE and AL also had lower retinal arteriolar oxygen saturation than emmetropes and hyperopes ( = 0.03 and  = 0.02, respectively).Eyes with more myopic SE and longer AL have lower retinal arteriolar oxygen saturation.This study provides direct evidence of a link between retinal oxygenation and hypoxia and myopia by using a novel device that quantifies retinal vascular oxygenation in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634601>Retrograde popliteal access and balloon dilatation of chronic total occlusion of superficial femoral arteries.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of retrograde popliteal access in subjects with chronic total occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.A retrospective review of subjects who underwent balloon dilatation via PPA is included. Age, gender, tobacco use, comorbid diseases, body mass index (BMI), ejection fraction (EF), claudication distance (0 to 50 metres, 50 to 100 metres and 100 to 150 metres), preoperative Rutherford scale and Ankle-brachial index (ABI) are noted for each subject. A duplex ultrasound (DUS) was performed preoperatively. The localization side of the lesion (right-left), the length of the atherosclerotic segment (CM) and the localization of the diseased segment (proximal superficial femoral artery-SFA, mid SFA, distal SFA, popliteal-above the knee) were noted. Subjects were followed for at least one year after the procedure. Subjects were reevaluated in the 1, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. In control subjects, Rutherford class and ABI were noted. A DUS was performed to detect restenosis. The subjects' preoperative Rutherford class and ABI and restenosis degree were compared with their postoperative values.A total of 93 subjects (75.3% male, 24.7% female; mean age 68.57±8.70 years old) were evaluated. In all 93 (100%) subjects, successful RPA access was achieved. Overall, balloon dilatation via PPA was successful in 86 (92.47%) of the 93 subjects. The procedural success rate was 92.47%. The occluded segment was on the right side in 49.5% of the subjects (n = 46) and on the left side in 50.5% (n = 47) of the subjects. The mean length of the lesion was 10.77 ± .21 cm, and the average stenosis degree was 95.9 ± 5.05%. The localization of the occluded segment was in the proximal SFA, mid SFA, distal SFA and popliteal above the knee in 45.%, 50.5%, 25.8% and 10.8% of the patients, respectively. When comparing the successful and unsuccessful groups, target lesion length (10.48±.01 vs 14.43±0.79, p <0.001), mid SFA localization (n=40 vs n=7, p=0,012) and claudication distance in the first 50 metres (p=0,003) were significantly higher in subjects with failed balloon dilatation via RPA. When the Rutherford scale was examined, the mild, moderate and severe claudication ratios were 23.7%, 29% and 47.3%, respectively. After the procedure, 61.3% of the cases were asymptomatic, and 38.7% had mild claudication. The change in the Rutherford scale was statistically significant (p<0,001). When the ABI measurements were examined pre-procedure, it increased from 0,63 ± 0,08 before to 0,90 ± 0,06 after the procedure, indicating a statistically significant difference (p <0,001). When Doppler findings were examined, in the successful RPA group, the no stenosis percentages were 82.6%, 72.1% and 65.1 at the 1, 6 and 12 month follow-up, respectively. The mean disease-free survival time was 9,80±0,39 months. In the first year, subjects were divided according to stenosis degree. Subjects with less than 50% stenosis were compared with subjects with more than 50% stenosis to detect the preprocedural characteristics that affect the re-stenosis degree. Tobacco use, COPD, , chronical renal insufficiency and popliteal above the knee localization were significantly higher in subjects that had more than 50% stenosis 1 year after the procedure (p=0,009, p=0,015, p=0,044, p=0,001 and p=0,017, respectively).Retrograde popliteal access(RPA) under DUS guidance is an effective method. RPA have high procedural success rate with low morbidity. Longer target lesion length, mid SFA locatization and claducation distance in first 50 meters found to be related factors with RPA balloon dilatation failure. Re-stenosis rates after 12 months follow-up is low and comparable with literature.Copyright © 2019.

Clinical factors, including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, , current smoking status, and history of taking aspirin, were gathered and stratified. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between various risk factors and the occurrence of preoperative hemorrhage. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors of preoperative hemorrhage in MMD.Among the 86 MMD hemispheres, t-ASL revealed 137 perfusion territory shifts in 79 hemispheres. Five distinct categories of perfusion territory shifts were observed on t-ASL maps. The subtypes of perfusion territory shift on t-ASL maps were further subdivided into  different categories, group A and group B, in combination with findings on 3D-TOF-MRA. A perfusion territory shift attributable solely to the secondary collaterals was a potential independent risk factor for preoperative hemorrhage (p = 0.026; 95% CI 1.201-18.615; OR 4.729). After eliminating the influence of the secondary collaterals, the primary collaterals had no significant effect on the risk of preoperative hemorrhage (p = 0.182).t-ASL could reveal comprehensive MMD cerebral blood perfusion and the vivid perfusion territory shifts fed by the unilateral ICA and ECA and bilateral VAs in a noninvasive, straightforward, nonradioactive, and nonenhanced manner. 3D-TOF-MRA could subdivide t-ASL perfusion territory shifts according to their shunt arteries. A perfusion territory shift attributable to the secondary collaterals is a potential independent risk factor for preoperative hemorrhage in MMD patients. A perfusion territory shift fed by the primary collaterals may not have a strong effect on preoperative hemorrhage in MMD patients. These findings make the combined modalities of t-ASL and 3D-TOF-MRA a feasible tool for MMD disease assessment, management, and surgical strategy planning.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628943>Micro(RNA) management and mismanagement of the islet.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic β-cells located within the islets of Langerhans play a central role in metabolic control. The main function of these cells is to produce and secrete insulin in response to a rise in circulating levels of glucose and other nutrients. The release of insufficient insulin to cover the organism needs results in chronic hyperglycemia and diabetes development. β-cells insure a highly specialized task and to efficiently accomplish their function they need to express a specific set of genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs and key regulators of gene expression. Indeed, by partially pairing to specific sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, each of them can control the translation of hundreds of transcripts. In this review, we focus on few key miRNAs controlling islet function and discuss: their differential expression in Type  diabetes (T2D), their regulation by genetic and environmental factors, and their therapeutic potential. Genetic and epigenetic changes or prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia and/or  can affect the β-cell miRNA expression profile, resulting in impaired β-cell function and survival leading to the development of T2D. Experimental approaches permitting to correct the level of mis-expressed miRNAs have been shown to prevent or treat T2D in animal models, suggesting that these small RNAs may become interesting therapeutic targets. However, translation of these experimental findings to the clinics will necessitate the development of innovative strategies allowing safe and specific delivery of compounds modulating the level of the relevant miRNAs to the β-cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This article aims to evaluate the possibility of Sirt1 serum levels predicting high-risk coronary plaques revealed through computed tomography angiography (CTA).The current cross-sectional investigation was performed on patients from non high-risk plaque (HRP) group (control group) as well as HRP group. CTA was conducted and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was generated each patient. Serum Sirt1 level was determined through ELISA. Univariate analysis and receiver-operating characteristic curve were used to examine the role of Sirt1 to predict HRP.Lower Sirt1 serum levels were observed in patients in the HRP group in comparison with those in the control group. Gender, , age, the total cholesterol to high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, HDL-C, apolipoprotein B and Sirt1 displayed independent association with HRP as revealed by the univariate analysis.

Elabela has an important role in the early embryonic stages. Elabela's beneficial effects in cardiovascular system were shown in some animal models or in vitro studies. Lately, some investigational studies in humans are started to be seen in literature. Our aims were to investigate serum Elabela levels in the first day of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), to compare with healthy controls, and to see if there is a correlation between other cardiac biomarkers in humans.The study was planned as cross-sectional. The patients group had 124 STEMI subjects. They were grouped as inferior (n = 59) and anterior myocardial infarction (n = 65) groups, and compared with the healthy control population (n = 77). Routine blood tests and serum Elabela levels were measured. Transthoracic echocardiography performed to all subjects.Frequency of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, and  in both STEMI groups were significantly higher than control subjects. Glucose, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, high sensitive C reactive protein (Hs-CRP), troponin I, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP), and Elabela levels were significantly higher in both STEMI groups. Other laboratory parameters were similar. Group  and 3 had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than group 1. Group 3 had also significantly lower LVEF than group . There was a positive but moderate correlation between Elabela, troponin I, and NT-ProBNP. Elabela was negatively correlated with LVEF.

A total of 14,620 men had their abdominal aortas screened with ultrasound and completed a health questionnaire containing information on smoking habits and medical history. They were categorized based on the aortic diameter: normal aorta (<.5 cm;  = 14,129), SAA (.5-.9 cm;  = 258), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (≥3.0 cm;  = 233). The SAA-group was rescanned after 5 years. Associated risk factors were analyzed.  The SAA-prevalence was 1.9% (95% confidence interval 1.7%-.1%), with 57.0% (50.7%-63.3%) expanding to ≥3.0 cm within 5 years. Frequency of smoking, coronary artery disease, hypertension, , and claudication were significantly higher in those with SAA and AAA compared to those with normal aortic diameter. Current smoking was the strongest risk factor for SAA (odds ratio [OR] .8;  < 0.001) and even stronger for AAA (OR 3.6;  < 0.001). Men with SAA expanding to AAA within 5 years presented pronounced similarities to AAA at baseline.  Men with SAA and AAA presented marked similarities in the risk factor profile. Smoking was the strongest risk factor with an incremental association with disease severity, and disease progression. This indicates that SAA and AAA may have the same pathophysiological origin and that SAA should be considered as an early stage of aneurysm formation. Further research on the cost-effectiveness and potential benefits of surveillance as well as smoking cessation and secondary cardiovascular prevention in this subgroup is warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630897>NAFLD and Atherosclerosis: Two Sides of the Same Dysmetabolic Coin?</a></h1><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly increasing and may put patients at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (asCVD).

Insulin resistance is thought to be a pathogenic factor in women having PCOS along with increased incidence of metabolic disturbances.After obtaining ethical clearance, the girls of various colleges in Patiala were verbally sensitized to the symptoms of PCOS, and then given semistructured proformas subsequent to written informed consent. The students suspected on self-evaluation, and on evaluation of the proformas were investigated in the Out Patient Department, and patients reporting to Obstetrics and Gynecology Department with similar symptoms were also included after written informed consent. The patients were divided with simple randomization into two groups of 25 each. Group 1 (treatment group) was put on metformin therapy for three months (500 mg thrice a day), and Group  (control group) were given placebo thrice a day for the same duration. The patients were followed up after three months of metformin therapy (500 mg thrice a day) in Group 1, and placebo therapy in Group . Body weight, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose after  h of 75 g of glucose, and fasting serum insulin levels were assessed initially, and then after three months.The mean age of patients in the present study was 21.46 ± 4.45 years. About 54% patients in the present study had BMI ≥25 kg/m. About 68% of the patients had menstrual irregularity and PCO on ultrasonography (USG). About 44% patients in Group 1 (metformin) had increased insulin levels initially (>20 μU/ml), which were decreased to 16% after three months of metformin therapy. About 52% patients in Group  had increased insulin levels that were decreased to 48% after the placebo therapy.It has been concluded from this study that metformin significantly lowers insulin levels in patients with PCOS; in both obese and nonobese; which points towards its potential usefulness in treatment of PCOS patients, though it had no significant effect on body mass index in 12 weeks.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520816>Formononetin alleviates hepatic steatosis by facilitating TFEB-mediated lysosome biogenesis and lipophagy.</a></h1><p>Formononetin has been reported to ameliorate  and obesity, but its effect and mechanism of action in anti-non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain unclear. Lipophagy is a critical protective mechanism during steatosis development that results in the decomposition of lipid droplets through autophagy and the prevention of cellular lipid accumulation. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial role of formononetin in treating NAFLD and explore the mechanism of lipophagy in formononetin anti-hepatic steatosis effects. Formononetin treatment significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis in HFD mice. Consistently, formononetin also reduced FFAs-stimulated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. Further analysis revealed that steatosis increased LC3B-II, a marker of autophagy, but caused blockade of autophagic flux associated with a lack of lysosomes. Treatment with formononetin promoted lysosome biogenesis and autophagosome-lysosome fusion, relieving the blockade in autophagic flux and further induced lipophagy. Mechanistically, formononetin activated adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and promoted subsequent nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a key regulator of lysosome biogenesis. TFEB inhibition markedly abolished formononetin-induced lysosome biogenesis, autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lipophagy and concomitantly alleviated lipid accumulation. Formononetin improved hepatic steatosis via TFEB-mediated lysosome biogenesis, which provides new evidence regarding formononetin's anti-NAFLD effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, CKD is not recognized as an ASCVD risk equivalent by most lipid guidelines. Statin medications, especially when combined with ezetimibe, significantly reduce ASCVD risk in patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD. Unless physicians recognize the heightened ASCVD risk in this population, statins may not be prescribed in the absence of clinical cardiovascular disease or diabetes, a recognized ASCVD risk equivalent. We examined statin use in adults with nondialysis-dependent CKD and examined whether the use differed in the presence of clinical ASCVD and diabetes.This study ascertained statin use from pharmacy dispensing records during fiscal years 2012 and 2013 from the US Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. The study included 581 344 veterans aged ≥50 years with nondialysis-dependent CKD Stages 3-5 with no history of kidney transplantation or dialysis. The 10-year predicted ASCVD risk was calculated with the pooled risk equation.Of veterans with CKD, 62.1% used statins in 2012 and 55.4% used statins continuously over  years (2012-13). Statin use in 2012 was 76. and 75.5% among veterans with CKD and ASCVD or diabetes, respectively, but in the absence of ASCVD, diabetes or a diagnosis of , statin use was 21.8% (P < 0.001). The 10-year predicted ASCVD risk was ≥7.5% in 95.1% of veterans with CKD, regardless of diabetes status.Statin use is low in veterans with nondialysis-dependent CKD in the absence of ASCVD or diabetes despite high-predicted ASCVD risk.

Metabolism of tryptophan (Trp) via the kynurenine pathway has shown immunomodulatory properties and the ability to modulate atherosclerosis. We identified 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) as a key metabolite of Trp modulating vascular inflammation and lipid metabolism. The molecular mechanisms driven by 3-HAA in atherosclerosis have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether two major signalling pathways, activation of SREBPs and inflammasome, are associated with the 3-HAA-dependent regulation of lipoprotein synthesis and inflammation in the atherogenesis process. Moreover, we examined whether inhibition of endogenous 3-HAA degradation affects  and atherosclerosis.In vitro, we showed that 3-HAA reduces SREBP- expression and nuclear translocation, and apolipoprotein B secretion in HepG2 cell cultures, and inhibits inflammasome activation and IL-1β production by macrophages. Using Ldlr-/- mice, we showed that inhibition of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), which increases the endogenous levels of 3-HAA, decreases atherosclerosis and plasma lipids. Notably, HAAO inhibition led to decreased hepatic SREBP- mRNA levels and lipid accumulation, and improved liver pathology scores.We discovered that the activity of SREBP- and the inflammasome can be regulated by 3-HAA metabolism. Moreover, our study highlights that targeting HAAO is a promising strategy to prevent and treat hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by maladaptive immune responses in the artery wall. Novel insights into cellular processes driving immune cell activation revealed that intracellular metabolic pathways regulate immune cell functions and inflammation. Thus, our present work identifies 3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-Dioxygenase (HAAO) and promising immunometabolic target to combat atherosclerotic CVD. Importantly, our findings indicate targeting tryptophan metabolism offers the possibility affect both lipid metabolism and vascular inflammation in the course of disease. Our findings encourage further investigations that can lead to novel drugs to tested in humans in the near future.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the relation between arterial calcifications observed on routine hand and upper-extremity radiographs and atherosclerosis has not been determined. This study examined whether arterial calcifications found on hand radiographs are associated with CAD.A record review from a single institution identified 345 patients with both hand radiographs and CAD screening with cardiac stress testing or coronary angiography. Patients with chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or incomplete hand films were excluded. We reviewed x-rays for findings of arterial calcifications. Cardiac testing results were used to establish a baseline diagnosis of CAD. We made group comparisons and employed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between upper-extremity calcification and CAD.A total of 210 patients met inclusion criteria: 155 with CAD and 55 without it. Mean age was 72 years, body mass index was 28.8, and 54% were male. Patients had comorbidities of hypertension (91%),  (87%), diabetes (39%), cerebrovascular accident (9%), and a history of tobacco use (53%). Of 155 CAD patients, 67 had arterial calcifications on hand radiographs (43%), compared with 6 of 55 without it (11%). In a multivariable model controlling for sex, , and diabetes, the presence of arterial calcifications on hand plain films indicated a 6.-fold increased odds of CAD.The current data demonstrate that arterial calcifications on hand radiographs are independently associated with CAD. This may represent an opportunity to the treating physician as a point of referral or investigation for underlying or occult CAD.Prevalence III.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

Whether this phenomenon is independent of statin use is unknown. We investigated the association between low TC levels and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a prospective study of men aged ≥70 years without ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and whether this was influenced by statin use.The CHAMP (Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project) cohort is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling men aged ≥70 years. The relationship between TC and long-term MACE was analysed using Cox-regression modelling adjusted for comorbidities and stratified by statin use.The study cohort comprised 1289 men (mean (±SD) age, 77.0±5.5 years; mean follow-up, 6.4±.7 years). Decreasing TC level was associated with increased comorbidity burden, frailty and MACE (linear trend p<0.001). In men not on statin therapy (n=731), each 1 mmol/L decrease in TC was associated with increased MACE (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.45, p=0.001) and mortality (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.44, p=0.02) adjusted for comorbidities. In contrast, low TC in men on statins (n=558) was not associated with MACE (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11) or mortality (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09).Low TC is associated with increased risk of MACE in older men without IHD who are not taking statin therapy but not in those on statins.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We aimed to investigate whether a simple calculation of conventional risk factors, PARADOCS (Pressure of ARtery elevAtion, Diabetes, Obesity, Cholesterol, Smoking) score, would improve the ability to predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in post-MI patients. Between November 2011 and December 2015, 13,104 patients with diagnosis of AMI were analyzed in this study from Korean AMI Registry - National Institute of Health database. PARADOCS score was calculated as follows: (number of nonparadoxical risk factors - number of paradoxical risk factors) + 3 where nonparadoxical risk factors are hypertension and diabetes, and paradoxical risk factors are , smoking, and obesity. PARADOCS score was significantly greater in patients with 1-year MACCEs compared with those without MACCEs (3.43 ± 1.03 vs .88 ± 1.11, p <0.001). In Cox proportional hazards model, PARADOCS score was an independent predictor of 1-year MACCEs (hazards ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.30; p <0.001) after adjusting for confounding variables. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve, patients with greater PARADOCS score had worse clinical outcome. In conclusion, although it needs more validation, a simple calculation of risk factors, PARADOCS score, could provide useful prognostic information of MI patients to clinicians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with CKD also develop other comorbidities, such as hypertension, , liver and cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems, and cognitive deterioration, which worsens their health. Therapy includes reducing comorbidities or using replacement therapy, such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and organ transplant. Health care systems are searching for alternative treatments for CKD patients to mitigate or retard their progression. One new topic is the study of uremic toxins (UT), which are excessively produced during CKD as products of food metabolism or as a result of the loss of renal function that have a negative impact on the kidneys and other organs. High urea concentrations significantly modify the microbiota in the gut also, cause a decrease in bacterial strains that produce anti-inflammatory and fuel molecules and an increase in bacterial strains that can metabolize urea, but also produce UT, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate. UT activates several cellular processes that induce oxidative environments, inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis development, and apoptosis; these processes mainly occur in the gut, heart, and kidney. The study of the microbiota during CKD allowed for the implementation of therapy schemes to try to reduce the circulating concentrations of UT and reduce the damage.

In contrast, smoking, qat chewing, physical activity, and the consumption of fast food, fruits and vegetables, and fish were not significantly associated with dyslipidemia.To our knowledge, this is the first human study conducted at Ibb University during wartime in Yemen. Dyslipidemia was highly prevalent among healthy Yemeni university students in Ibb city. Low HDL-C was the most prevalent type of dyslipidemia, followed by increased levels of LDL-C. Gender, age, residence, and type of faculty were also closely related to dyslipidemia. These results indicate the need for specialized programs to determine blood lipid levels and initiate intervention programs to reduce the prevalence and prevent the complications of dyslipidemia among Yemeni university students.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492387>Effect of clinical signs, endocrinopathies, timing of surgery, , and hyperbilirubinemia on outcome in dogs with gallbladder mucocele.</a></h1><p>Gallbladder mucocele (GBM) is a common extra-hepatic biliary syndrome in dogs with death rates ranging from 7 to 45%. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the association of survival with variables that could be utilized to improve clinical decisions. A total of 1194 dogs with a gross and histopathological diagnosis of GBM were included from 41 veterinary referral hospitals in this retrospective study. Dogs with GBM that demonstrated abnormal clinical signs had significantly greater odds of death than subclinical dogs in a univariable analysis (OR, 4.; 95% CI, .14-8.23; P<0.001). The multivariable model indicated that categorical variables including owner recognition of jaundice (OR, .12; 95% CI, 1.19-3.77; P=0.011), concurrent hyperadrenocorticism (OR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.08-3.47; P=0.026), and Pomeranian breed (OR, .46; 95% CI 1.10-5.50; P=0.029) were associated with increased odds of death, and vomiting was associated with decreased odds of death (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.72; P=0.001). Continuous variables in the multivariable model, total serum/plasma bilirubin concentration (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P<0.001) and age (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.26; P<0.001), were associated with increased odds of death. The clinical utility of total serum/plasma bilirubin concentration as a biomarker to predict death was poor with a sensitivity of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.54-0.69) and a specificity of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.59-0.66). This study identified several prognostic variables in dogs with GBM including total serum/plasma bilirubin concentration, age, clinical signs, concurrent hyperadrenocorticism, and the Pomeranian breed.

We investigated the role of gravin in the development of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis and . Five-week-old male wild-type (WT) and gravin-t/t mice were fed a normal diet or an HFD for 16 wk. Gravin-t/t mice showed significantly lower liver-to-body-weight ratio, cholesterol, triglyceride, and very low-density lipoprotein levels in serum as compared with WT mice on HFD. Furthermore, there was less aortic plaque formation coupled with decreased lipid accumulation and liver damage, as the gravin-t/t mice had lower levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Additionally, gravin-t/t HFD-fed mice had decreased expression of liver 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, an essential enzyme for cholesterol synthesis and lower fatty acid synthase expression. Gravin-t/t HFD-fed mice also exhibited inhibition of sterol regulatory element binding protein- (SREBP-) expression, a liver transcription factor associated with the regulation of lipid transportation. In response to platelet-derived growth factor receptor treatment, gravin-t/t vascular smooth muscle cells exhibited lower intracellular calcium transients and decreased protein kinase A- and protein kinase C-dependent substrate phosphorylation, notably involving the Erk1/ signaling pathway. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of gravin-dependent regulation of lipid metabolism via the reduction of SREBP- expression. The absence of gravin-mediated signaling lowers blood pressure, reduces plaque formation in the aorta, and decreases lipid accumulation and damage in the liver of HFD mice. Through these processes, the absence of gravin-mediated signaling complex delays the HFD-induced  and atherosclerosis. The gravin scaffolding protein plays a key role in the multiple enzymatic pathways of lipid metabolism. We have shown for the first time the novel role of gravin in regulating the pathways related to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Specifically, an absence of gravin-mediated signaling decreases the lipid levels (cholesterol, triglyceride, and VLDL) that are associated with sterol regulatory element binding protein- downregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534622>Antiobesity, Regulation of Lipid Metabolism, and Attenuation of Liver Oxidative Stress Effects of Hydroxy--sanshool Isolated from  on High-Fat Diet-Induced Hyperlipidemic Rats.</a></h1><p> is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to relieve pain, dispel dampness, stop diarrhea, and prevent itching. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiobesity and hypolipidemic effects of hydroxy--sanshool (HAS) isolated from  on hyperlipidemic rats. Wistar rats ( = 48) were randomly divided into six groups: (1) normal diet rats (ND), () high-fat diet- (HFD-) treated rats, (3) HFD+fenofibrate-treated rats (HFD+FNB), (4) HFD+low dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+LD, 9 mg/kg), (5) HFD+middle dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+MD, 18 mg/kg), and (6) HFD+high dose of HAS-treated rats (HFD+HD, 36 mg/kg). The body weight and food intake of the rats were recorded during the treatment period. After 4 weeks of HAS treatment, abdominal adipose tissues were observed and total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) of serum and liver tissues were determined. Furthermore, histochemical examinations using oil red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) were carried out and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver were determined. After HFD feeding, the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio of HFD rats were significantly enhanced ( < 0.05 ND rats) and HAS treatment (18 and 36 mg/kg) significantly decreased the body weight gain and food efficiency ratio ( < 0.05 HFD rats). In addition, HAS treatment could decrease the abdominal adipose tissues and liver adipocytes. Furthermore, HAS treatment significantly decreased the T-CHO, TG, and LDL-C, whereas it increased HDL-C ( < 0.05 HFD rats) in serum and the liver. HAS treatment increased the GSH level and SOD activity in the liver ( < 0.05 HFD rats), whereas it decreased the levels of MDA ( < 0.05 HFD rats). mRNA analyses suggested that HAS treatment increases the expression of  (proliferator-activated receptor ) and  (peroxisome apolipoprotein E). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting indicated that HAS stimulation increased the levels of PPAR and APOE in the liver, as a stress response of the body defense system. These results revealed that HAS exerts antiobesity and hypolipidemic activities in HFD rats by reducing liver oxidative stress and thus could be considered as a potential candidate drug to cure or prevent obesity and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662386>Prevalence and coprevalence of chronic comorbid conditions in patients with type  diabetes in Catalonia: a population-based cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the prevalence and coprevalence of several chronic conditions in patients with type  diabetes in a Mediterranean region.A cross-sectional study.Two hundred and eighty-six primary care teams of the Catalonian Health Institute (Catalonia, Spain).We included patients aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of type  diabetes by 31 December, 2016, who were registered in the Information System for the Development of Research in primary care (SIDIAP) database.

In this study, the combination of serum lipidomic and metabolomic approach was employed to investigate the effect of arabinoxylan on type  diabetic rats and identify the critical biomarkers of T2D. Metabolomics analysis revealed that branched-chain amino acids, 12α-hydroxylated bile acids, ketone bodies, and several short- and long-chain acylcarnitines were significantly increased in T2D, whereas lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were significantly decreased. Lipidomics analysis indicated T2D-related dyslipidemia was mainly associated with the increased levels of acetylcarnitine, free fatty acids (FFA), diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters and the decreased levels of some unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (less than 22 carbons). These variations indicated the disturbed amino acid and lipid metabolism in T2D, and the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipid species might eventually contribute to impaired insulin action and glucose homeostasis. Arabinoxylan treatment decreased the concentrations of 12α-hydroxylated bile acids, carnitines, and FFAs and increased the levels of LPCs. The improved bile acid and lipid metabolism by arabinoxylan might be involved in the alleviation of hypercholesterolemia and  in T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626710>The Curative Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Liver Transplantation.</a></h1><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by premature mortal cardiovascular complications.

Although the benefit of intensively lowering blood glucose is unclear, newer antidiabetic drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter- inhibitors) have shown cardiovascular benefits in addition to their antihyperglycemic effect. Yet, studies suggest that recent use of evidence-based therapy and management of cardiovascular risk among individuals with type  diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains largely suboptimal. The following narrative review first identifies barriers to translating research evidence to clinical practice at the levels of provider, health system, patient, and cost. Then it synthesizes previous implementation strategies that addressed multifaceted barriers and attempted to improve care for patients with T2D and CVD. In conclusion, team-based care coordination, reminding systems in combination to pharmacist consultation and patient education, provider education compatible with clinical workflow, and coupled incentives between providers and patients appeared to be effective in reducing cardiovascular risks for patients with T2D and CVD, though the scalability and long-term clinical effect of these strategies as well as the possibility of interventions involving payers and health systems remain uncertain.© 2019 The Authors.

The surgeon had 20 years of experience in this field and he had performed over 5000 major laparoscopic bariatric procedures before starting this new bariatric program. The concept of enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery (ERABS) was applied from the beginning of the program. We decided to analyze the first  years of ERAS activity after having split them in two different periods: the 1st year of activity included restrictive procedures and the 2nd year associated malabsorptive surgeries.  The results of the use of a fast-track program could be measured by different parameters like operative time, length of hospital stay, rate of complications, and rate of readmission and reoperation.  Between January and December 2015, 116 patients underwent a bariatric procedure. The mean age was 34.6 years (16-61) and average body mass index (BMI) was 41.7 kg/sqm (32-72.). Sixty percent of patients were women and 37% of patients had at least one comorbidity (diabetes type , high blood pressure, , or sleep apnea). Ninety-four percent of the procedures were laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), .6% were laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 3.4% band removal. The mean operative time was 20 minutes for an LSG (14-45 minutes) and the average hospital stay was 1. days (standard deviation [SD]: 0.9-3.3). The rate of complications was 1.7% with 1 postoperative hematoma drained by CT scan on day 14 after the surgery and 1 relative stenosis endoscopically dilated on postoperative day 45. No reoperation was done. No leak was observed. At 1 year, the mean excess weight loss (EWL) was 64% (47-124) in 89 patients with a 76% rate of follow-up. For the 2nd year of activity in 2016, 142 patients went in the program. The mean age was 32.7 years (17-64) and average BMI was 42.3 kg/sqm (31-68). Seventy-two percent were women and 41% of the patients had one comorbidity or more. The majority of surgeries performed were LSG for 83.1% of the patients. RYGB was realized in 4.% of cases, resleeve gastrectomy in 4.%, and band removal in 1.4%. Some malabsorptive surgeries were performed as well, such as one anastomosis gastric bypass for 3 patients (4.%), and single anastomosis duodeno-ilelal in  cases (.8%). The average hospital stay was 1.5 days (SD: 0.9-3.5). No complication was observed. No reoperation was done. Two patients (1.4%) came back to the hospital on postoperative day  and 8 after a LSG for one or several episodes of vomiting without further complication. At 1 year, the mean EWL was 68% (49-154) in 98 patients with a 69% rate of follow-up.  This new program of bariatric surgery in two steps using fast-track protocols, respecting international guidelines and with an experienced surgeon showed on its 1st year of implementation a 1.7% rate of readmission on 116 patients without reoperation or major complication and a hospital stay of 1. days. For the 2nd year of implementation with the inclusion of malabsorptive procedures only  patients (1.4%) were readmitted for a short episode of vomiting and the hospital stay was 1.5 days.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535499>Effect Of Three Pakistani Date-Seed Varieties On Lipid Profile Of Diet Induced Hyperlipidemic Rabbits.</a></h1><p> is one of the major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.

Macular and peripapillary SD-OCT measurements (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), DM duration, HbA1c levels and presence of HT and/or HL were used for statistical analyses.The MA (+), MA (-) and control groups had similar age and gender distribution (p > 0.05). The differences in SD-OCT measurements among the MA (+), MA (-) and control groups were insignificant (p > 0.05). However, diabetic patients (n = 95) had significantly thinner inferior-temporal peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) (p = 0.042) than in the controls (n = 91). Superior peripapillary RNFL was significantly thinner in patients with an HbA1c level > 7% (p = 0.049). However, 3 mm-nasal, temporal and superior perifoveal thicknesses were significantly lower in patients with DM duration over 10 years (p < 0.05). HT and/or HL coexistence did not lead a significant difference in SD-OCT parameters among the groups.In diabetic patients without DR, peripapillary inferior-temporal RNFL thinning might be an early sign of neuroretinal degeneration and it seems to be independent from vascular endothelial damage (MA). Poor metabolic control appears to lead superior peripapillary RNFL thinning, while perifoveal thicknesses tend to decrease with longer DM duration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582390>Placement of a Stent within a Flow Diverter Improves Aneurysm Occlusion Rates.</a></h1><p>Placement of a stent within a flow diverter has been described previously but its consequences have not been analyzed.

Stents were placed inside the Surpass flow diverter for a variety of reasons at the operator's discretion. No statistical difference was noted between the  groups in age, body weight, sex, history of thromboembolic events, smoking, platelet inhibition levels, hypertension, , diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and aneurysm location. Aneurysms in the stented group were larger than those in the monotherapy group (14.8 versus 9.1 mm,  < .001). The rate of clinically significant adverse events and complete aneurysm occlusion rates at 0-3 and 3-6 months (73.3% versus 61.3%,  = .31, and 84.8% versus 70.%,  = .14) were similar. At 9-12 months, a significantly higher proportion of aneurysms in the stented group achieved complete occlusion (93.9% versus 73.%,  = .019). There was a trend toward a higher obliteration rate on final follow-up in the stented group (93.9% versus 82.9%,  = .14).Placement of a stent within a flow diverter increases the rate of aneurysm occlusion. We propose that these results are from improved flow-diverter apposition due to the higher radial force of intracranial stents.© 2019 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380253>Omega-3 Fatty Acid Based Nanolipid Formulation of Atorvastatin for Treating .</a></h1><p> In the current study, attempts have been made to formulate an omega-3 fatty acid based nanostructured lipid carriers of atorvastatin (AT), for treating ; and to evaluate their antihyperlipidemic activity using in vitro and in vivo studies.  Omega-3 fatty acid based AT-loaded nanolipid carriers (NLC) were formulated by the melt emulsification ultrasonication technology. The prepared NLC consist of stearic acid (as solid lipid), omega-3 fatty acid (as liquid lipid), Tween 80, poloxamer 188 (surfactants) and soya-lecithin (co-surfactant).  AT loaded NLCs have a particle size of 74.76 ± 4.266 nm, a zeta potential value of -36.03 ± 1.504 mV and a high drug entrapment efficiency (EE) of 86.70 % ± 0.155. The release of AT from NLCs exhibited a sustained behaviour, which made it an ideal vehicle for drug delivery. MTT assay results indicated that NLCs are compatible with L929 (mouse fibroblast) cell lines. Anti-hyperlipidemic study showed a significant reduction in LDL and TG levels in serum with the orally administered Omega-3 fatty acid based AT loaded NLCs when compared to marketed formulation.

We randomly selected 84 248 subjects matching in gender, age and baseline year as comparison cohort. The cohorts were followed up until CRC occurrence, withdrawal from the system of National Health Insurance, or Dec. 31, 2013.Cumulative incidences and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of CRC between two cohorts were examined. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate risk factors associated with CRC development.During the 13-year follow-up, the incidence rate of CRC development in the gout cohort reached .44 per 1000 person-years, which was higher than the .13 per 1000 person-years in the control cohort (IRR=1.15; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.26). After adjusting for age, gender, urbanisation status and comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes and , gout showed no significant association with increased risk of CRC occurrence (adjusted HR=1.03; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14).Similar risks of CRC incidence were observed in patients with and without gout in Taiwan. Allopurinol and colchicine are commonly used as urate-lowering drug and anti-inflammation medication in Taiwan and had been shown to reduce the risk of CRC incidence. Thus, further pharmaco-epidemiological studies should be carried out to specifically assess the role of allopurinol in the relationship between gout and CRC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Using a computerized semi-automated method, instant IMT changes were extracted in the two walls of the left CCA (240 consecutive patients) using B-mode ultrasound images. We found that CCA ΔIMT increased from 8 ± 4% of IMT in the controls to 15 ± 6% of IMT in the severe stenosis group. According to the multiple ordinal regression analysis, ΔIMT was associated with the severity of carotid artery stenosis (odds ratio [OR], 4.95; p < 0.001), independent of sex (OR, 1.11; p = 0.04), age (OR, 1.14; p < 0.001), body mass index; OR, 1.13; p = 0.036), hypertension (OR, .04; p < 0.001), diabetes (OR, 1.38; p = 0.045) and  (OR, 1.54; p = 0.002). We concluded that increment of CCA ΔIMT during the cardiac cycle was strongly and independently associated with severity of carotid artery stenosis or atherosclerosis progression.Copyright © 2019 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Reduced vibration perception results in less sensitivity to pressure and is a known risk factor for diabetic foot ulcers. Improving vibration perception in the feet of people with SPN could be protective against foot ulcers. The aim of this study was to determine if a therapeutic vibrating insole, used for 35 consecutive days, could improve vibration perception in a patient with type  DM.The patient was a 63 year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, controlled hypertension, , artherosclerosis and SPN secondary to controlled type  diabetes.The patient used the insoles for 20 min a day for 35 consecutive days. Vibration perception thresholds were measured four times in total: once at baseline, immediately post intervention, 1 month and 10 months later. Vibration perception threshold decreased with an average of 22 V (range 6 V-34 V) dependant on the tested location and time after intervention. The improvement remained after 1 and 10 months.The use of a vibrating insole as a therapeutic device improved this patient's perception of vibration in his feet. Clinically, vibrating insoles potentially might reduce the risk for ulcer formation and subsequent lower limb amputation in patients with DM and SPN.Using a vibrating insole therapeutically, can potentially improve the perception of vibration and pressure in patients with sensory peripheral neuropathy secondary to type  diabetes mellitus.

A total of 23 patients in the MDR group and 28 patients in the non-MDR group were reviewed. The risk factors for MDR pathogen-induced infections in SAP patients were analyzed. was the leading cause of SAP in our study. The mean duration of hospital stay was significantly longer in the patients with MDR pathogen infections (P=0.0135). The hospitalization expenses of MDR group were much higher than those in non-MDR group. The mortality of MDR group (56.5%) was higher than that in non-MDR group (28.6%) (P=0.0436). Gram-negative isolates (63.8%) were commonly detected in SAP patients. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common MDR pathogens. Systemic disease (P = 0.0136), initial use of carbapenem (P = 0.0438), and open necrosectomy (P = 0.0002) were the potential risk factors for MDR pathogen-induced infections in SAP.

This retrospective study included 59 AI patients who received CMR and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations from June 2011 to February 2015. AI patients were divided into  groups: bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) group (30) and non-BAV group (29). Patients were also divided into late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) group (27) and non-LGE group (32). The baseline clinical characteristics were collected through electronic medical records. Hemodynamic parameters such as grade of AI, cardiac functional parameters and LGE mass fraction (LGE%) were measured by CMR post-processing analysis. Kappa test was used to assess the consistency of AI severity between CMR and TTE, and the multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate influence factors of myocardial fibrosis in AI patients.  (1) 56 (94.9%) patients were male, and the mean age was (44.±11.0) years old. There was no significant difference in age and gender, hypertension, , alcoholic consumption between BAV and non-BAV group (all 0.05). There were a higher proportion of smoking history (0.008), a lower body mass index (BMI) (0.020) in the LGE group than in the non-LGE group. () The accuracy of CMR in diagnosis of BAV was 96.7% (29/30) compared to the gold standard. In the BAV group, 20 patients (66.7%) were with fusion of left and right cusp (L-R), 5 patients (16.7%) were with fusion of right and noncoronary cusp (R-N), 5 patients (16.7%) were with fusion of left and noncoronary cusp (L-N); patients with BAV had larger left ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVi), left ventricular end systolic volume index (LVESVi), higher proportion of LGE and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than those in non-BAV group (all 0.05). There were 19 patients with BAV in the LGE group, the cases of L-R, R-N, L-N were 10 (52.6%), 5 (26.3%), and 4 (21.1%), respectively. In the non-LGE group, patients with BAV of L-R, R-N, L-N were 10 (90.9%), 0, and 1 (9.1%), respectively. Patients with LGE had lower body surface area (BSA), LVEF and larger LVEDVi, LVESVi, left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and higher proportion of BAV compared patients without LGE. In addition, the proportion of moderate and severe AI patients was significantly higher in BAV group than in non-BAV group (0.009). (3) The consistency of CMR and TTE in evaluating the severity of AI patients: the agreement between TTE and CMR regarding AI severity was satisfactory (kappa value was 0.624, 95 0.402-0.831, <0.001). (4) The linear regression analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between LVEF and LGE% in BAV and non-BAV group (0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of BAV was an independent risk factor of left ventricucar fibrosis (5.050, 95 1.220-20.908, 0.025) after adjustment for LVEF, hypertension, LVEDVi and LVMi.

Use was defined as a mammogram within the previous 1 or  years, analyzed separately. A logit model was employed to evaluate associations between use and comorbidities and age. Statistical significance was defined by a P value < .05 by two-sided test.Of the 36,575 women in our study sample, 45.9%, 43.6%, 3.9%, and 5.7% reported a history of hypertension (HTN),  (HLD), prior heart attack (MI), and prior stroke, respectively. Among women without a comorbid condition, there was 47.3% annual mammography use. HTN and HLD were associated with increased use (.5 and 6.8 percentage points [pp], P< .01). In comparison, prior MI was associated with decreased annual use (-8. pp, P < .01). Prior stroke was not significantly associated with annual mammography (-1.5 pp, P = .42). Results were similar for biennial use. The age trend in use showed that the age with maximum screening use was approximately 60 years.Mammography use was higher in patients with HTN and HLD, and lower in patients with prior MI and stroke, which may reflect differences in comorbidity-related general health care use. Use increased until it peaked around age 60. An understanding of how mammography use naturally evolves as people age may help better target specific populations and improve overall use of preventive care.Copyright © 2019 American College of Radiology.

Methods We evaluated the association between statin use and risk of glioma in the female Nurses' Health Study (NHS, n = 114,419) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII, n = 115,813) and the male Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, n = 50,223). Glioma cases were confirmed by medical record review. Age and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of glioma by statin use were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results In 4,430,700 person-years of follow-up, we confirmed 483 incident cases of glioma. Compared with never-users, ever statin use was associated with borderline increased risk of glioma in the combined cohorts (age-adjusted HR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.99-1.54), as was longer duration of statin use (HR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-.03 comparing > 8 years of use to never use, p-trend = 0.01). We also observed a significant inverse association between  and glioma in multivariable models (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 in combined cohorts), which was attenuated in lagged analyses. Compared to never use, in multivariable-adjusted models, ever statin use (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-1.86) and statin use duration (HR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.21-.45, for > 8 years of use, p-trend = 0.003) were each significantly associated with increased glioma risk. Conclusion In contrast to case-control studies reporting inverse associations, we found borderline increased risk of glioma with statin use. Results were strengthened after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors due to an unexpected inverse association between  and glioma risk.

Adenoma detection rates and characteristics such as location, histologic type, and size were compared in the resulting 123 NAFLD patients against controls without liver disease matched by age, gender, and endoscopist.Adenoma prevalence was significantly higher in the NAFLD group at 40.7 versus 28.1% in controls (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.15-3.03, p = 0.01) and remained significant on multivariable analysis controlling for rates of , diabetes, and obesity (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05-.88, p = 0.032). Comparing NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis to those with simple steatosis, there was a trend toward higher adenoma prevalence in advanced fibrosis (50.0 vs. 36.8%; OR 1.84, 95% CI 0.50-6.70, p = 0.36).Patients with histologically demonstrated NAFLD had a significantly higher adenoma prevalence on colonoscopy compared to matched controls, which remained significant after adjusting for rates of diabetes, obesity, and . NAFLD should be investigated further as an independent risk factor for colorectal neoplasia.© 2019 S.

Less is known about the impact on atrial fibrillation (AF) outcomes and resource utilization of repeated DCCVs that are often required for long-term rhythm control.A total of 4,135 AF patients >18 years of age that underwent DCCV with long-term system follow-up were evaluated. Patients were stratified by the number of DCCVs received: 1 (n=,201), -4 (n=1,748), and ≥5 (n=186). Multivariable Cox hazard regression was used to determine the association of DCCV categories to the outcomes of death, AF hospitalization, AF ablation, DCCVs, and stroke/transient ischemic attack.The average follow-up of the patient population was 1,633.1±1,232.9 (median: 1,438.0) days. Patients who underwent -4 and ≥5 DCCVs had more comorbidities, namely hypertension,  and heart failure. Anticoagulation use was common at the time of DCCV in all groups (89.1%, 91.%, 91.9%, p=0.06) and amiodarone use increased with increasing DCCV category (30.1%, 43.4%, 52., p<0.0001). At 5 years, patients that received more DCCVs had higher rates of repeat DCCVs, AF hospitalizations, and ablations. Stroke rates were not increased. Though not statistically significant, 5-year death was increased when comparing DCCV >5 vs. 1, (HR=1.32 [0.89-1.94], p=0.17).This study found that the increasing number of DCCVs, despite escalation of other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, is a long-term independent risk factor for repeat DCCVs, ablations, and AF hospitalizations among AF patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662779> Standardised Extract Reduces Cholesterol Levels and Modulates Oxidative Status in Postmenopausal Rats Fed with Cholesterol Diet Enriched with Repeatedly Heated Palm Oil.</a></h1><p> (Lour.) Merr. (GP) has been reported in previous studies to possess antihyperlipidaemic, antioxidative, and cardioprotective properties. This study was aimed to determine the effect of standardised 80% ethanol extract of GP on lipid profiles and oxidative status of hypercholesterolemic rats. Postmenopausal (PM) Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomised and fed with % cholesterol diet fortified with five times heated palm oil to develop  status. Two doses of the extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) and atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) were administered once daily via oral gavage for 24 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was increased during the first month in the postmenopausal group and decreased with GP supplementation. Lipid droplets accumulation was shown at the tunica media (TM) area of the aorta in the postmenopausal group and reduced with GP supplementation. Total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased ( < 0.05) at 3 and 6 months in the postmenopausal group and were reduced with GP supplementation. GP also increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level in the postmenopausal group. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were reduced in the postmenopausal group compared to control in the sham group but increased ( < 0.05) with GP supplementation. The results showed that the higher dose of GP (500 mg/kg) gave better effect. GP has the ability to reduce oxidative stress and prevent membrane cell damage through antioxidant enzyme activity modification and lipid profile changes in postmenopausal rats related to atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 Khuzaidatul Azidah Ahmad Nazri et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395489>Associations among antipsychotics, metabolism-related diseases, and cataracts in patients with schizophrenia: A retrospective cohort study.</a></h1><p>Long-term cataract risks associated with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), and their associations with metabolism-related diseases are not yet elucidated.Using Taiwan National Health Insurance data, we conducted a propensity score matched population-based cohort study consisting of 10,014 patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia from 2005 to 2009 and followed them until the end of 2013. A Cox hazard model with metabolism-related diseases as time-dependent covariates was adapted to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of cataracts between SGAs and FGAs groups.During the 8-year follow-up, patients receiving SGAs were associated with a higher risk of cataract than those receiving FGAs with an adjusted HR of 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-.36). Patients receiving high-metabolic-risk SGAs (clozapine and olanzapine) showed the highest risk of cataracts among SGAs when compared with those receiving FGAs (aHR = .57, 95% CI: 1.35-4.88). SGAs demonstrated a stronger contribution in the risk of cataract in patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) and  than in those developed these diseases. Patients who developed DM or  after receiving antipsychotics had an approximately .5-fold increased cataract risk over those who did not develop these diseases.Regardless of the condition of metabolic-related diseases, SGAs were independently associated with an increased risk of cataract. DM and  developed after antipsychotics contributed to the risk of cataract risk.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Results from the SITS-MENA Registry.</a></h1><p>Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in the Middle-East and North African (MENA) countries is still confined to the main urban and university hospitals. This was a prospective observational study to examine outcomes of intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients in the MENA region compared to the non-MENA stroke cohort in the SITS International Registry.Of 32,160 patients with ischemic stroke registered using the SITS intravenous thrombolysis protocol between June 2014 and May 2016, 500 (1.6%) were recruited in MENA. Compared to non-MENA (all  < 0.001), median age in MENA was 55 versus 73 years, NIH Stroke Scale score 12 versus 9, onset-to-treatment time 138 versus 155 min and door-to-needle time 54 min versus 64 min. Hypertension was the most reported risk factor, but lower in MENA (51.7 vs. 69.7%). Diabetes was more frequent in MENA (28.5 vs. 20.8%) as well as smoking (20.8 vs. 15.9%).  was less observed in MENA (17.6 vs. 29.3%). Functional independence (mRS 0-) at seven days or discharge was similar (53% vs. 52% in non-MENA), with mortality slightly lower in MENA (.3% vs. 4.8%). SICH rates by SITS-MOST definition were low (<1.4%) in both groups.Intravenous thrombolysis patients in MENA were younger, had more severe strokes and more often diabetes. Although stroke severity was higher in MENA, short-term functional independency and mortality were not worse compared to non-MENA, which could partly be explained by younger age and shorter OTT in MENA. Decreasing the burden of stroke in this young population should be prioritized.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515763>Is everolimus linked to metabolic syndrome in liver transplant recipients?</a></h1><p>As the mortality rates after liver transplantation (LT) have been reduced, the attention has shifted to additional conditions which still compromise the quality of life and the survival of these patients, such as the post-LT metabolic syndrome (MS). In order to determine the prevalence and the factors associated with the post-LT MS, we carried out the present study.One hundred and six LT recipients, after completing at least 1 year follow up after LT, were included in the study. Data on clinical, laboratory parameters and immunosuppressive therapy before and after LT were recorded. MS was defined as per current diagnostic criteria.MS was prevalent in 47.% (50 of 106 patients) and was not associated with the LT indications and the time period after LT. Univariate analysis showed that history of diabetes mellitus before (odds ratio [OR] 3., 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.046-9.918, p = 0.042) and after LT (OR 6.03, 95% CI .18-16.67, p = 0.001), the age at the time of baseline visit (OR 1.077, 95% CI 1.033-1.124, p = 0.001) and the everolimus-based immunosuppression (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.003-1.33, p = 0.019) were significantly associated with MS. Notably, everolimus administration was the only factor independently associated with the presence of post-LT MS (OR 1.026, 95% CI 1.004-1.047, p = 0.019). More specifically, everolimus was linked to the presence of arterial hypertension (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.0-1.03, p = 0.05) and  (OR .87, 95% CI 1.28-6.56, p = 0.011).Our study demonstrated for the first time that everolimus was independently associated with post-LT MS. Nevertheless, more robust studies are required to confirm these findings.</p></html>
