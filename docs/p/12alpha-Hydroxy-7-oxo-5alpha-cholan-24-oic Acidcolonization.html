Recent studies have shown the emergence of reversible phenotypic heterogeneity in the QS-responding pathogenic microbial population under laboratory conditions as a possible bet-hedging survival strategy. However, very little is known about the dynamics of QS-response and the nature of phenotypic heterogeneity in an actual host-pathogen interaction environment. Here, we investigated the dynamics of QS-response of a Gram-negative phytopathogen Xanthomonas pv. campestris (Xcc) inside its natural host cabbage, that communicate through a fatty  signal molecule called DSF (diffusible signal factor) for coordination of several social traits including virulence functions. In this study, we engineered a novel DSF responsive whole-cell QS dual-bioreporter to measure the DSF mediated QS-response in Xcc at the single cell level inside its natural host plant in vivo. Employing the dual-bioreporter strain of Xcc, we show that QS non-responsive cells coexist with responsive cells in microcolonies at the early stage of the disease; whereas in the late stages, the QS-response is more homogeneous as the QS non-responders exhibit reduced fitness and are out competed by the wild-type. Furthermore, using the wild-type Xcc and its QS mutants in single and mixed infection studies, we show that QS mutants get benefit to some extend at the early stage of disease and contribute to localized . However, the QS-responding cells contribute to spread along xylem vessel. These results contrast with the earlier studies describing that expected cross-induction and cooperative sharing at high cell density in vivo may lead to synchronize QS-response. Our findings suggest that the transition from heterogeneity to homogeneity in QS-response within a bacterial population contributes to its overall virulence efficiency to cause disease in the host plant under natural environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk Microbiota is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h1><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut microbiota. We evaluated the effect of the maternal diet during pregnancy and during the first month of lactation on the human milk microbiota in a cross-sectional study including 94 healthy lactating women. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rDNA profiling and nutrient intake assessed through food questionnaires. Thirteen genera were present in at least 90% of all samples, with three genera present in all samples: , , and . Cluster analysis indicated two distinct compositions: one marked by a high abundance of  (cluster 1), and other by a high abundance of  (cluster 2). A global association with milk microbiota diversity was observed for vitamin C intake during pregnancy ( = 0.029), which was higher for cluster 2 individuals (cluster 2 median = 232 mg/d; cluster 1 = 175 mg/d;  = 0.02). Positive correlations were found between  in the milk and intake of polyunsaturated and linoleic fatty  during the lactation period ( < 0.01). We show that maternal diet influences the human milk microbiota, especially during pregnancy, which may contribute in shaping the gut microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293552>Early Intervention With Cecal Fermentation Broth Regulates the  and Development of Gut Microbiota in Broiler Chickens.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fermentation broth from broiler cecal content on the  and development of the gut microbiota in newly hatched broiler chicks. The fermentation broth was made by a chemostat system using the cecal content from a donor chicken as the source of inoculum. A total of 120 newly hatched broiler chicks were randomly divided into two groups. One group (F group) was orally inoculated with the fermentation broth, and the other (C group) was treated with an equal amount of sterile PBS solution. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate the differences in the cecal microbiota of the broiler chickens between the two groups on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Moreover, the concentrations of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in the cecal contents were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the abundances of genera  and  decreased sharply in the F group on days 1 and 3 by the early intervention with cecal fermentation broth. In contrast, the relative abundance of the genus  on days 1, 3, and 7, and the family Ruminococcaceae on days 1, 3, and 28 increased in the F group, respectively. In terms of SCFAs, the concentrations of acetate on day 28, propionic  on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28, butyrate on day 1, and isovalerate on day 14 were significantly higher in the F group compared with the C group. Overall, these results suggest that early intervention with cecal fermentation broth could have beneficial effects on broilers gut health, which might be attributed to the alterations in the gut microbial composition and the increased concentrations of SCFAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149755>Protein elicitor PeaT1 enhanced resistance against aphid (Sitobion avenae) in wheat.</a></h1><p>Sitobion avenae, a dominant aphid in wheat that causes huge annual losses in agriculture, is mainly controlled using chemical pesticides. In this study, we investigated a protein elicitor, PeaT, for its induction of the defense response in wheat against Sitobion avenae.Intrinsic rates of increase in second and third generations of S. avenae decreased in the PeaT1 (second generation 0.31 ± 0.01, third generation 0.28 ± 0.01) treatment compared with controls (second generation 0.28 ± 0.01, third generation 0.26 ± 0.01). S. avenae preferred to colonize control rather than PeaT1-treated wheat seedlings in a host selection test. PeaT1-treated wheat leaves possessed more trichomes and wax that formed a disadvantageous surface environment for S. avenae. Both salicylic  (SA) and jasmonic  (JA) accumulated significantly in PeaT1-treated wheat seedlings.These results showed that PeaT1 modified physical surface structures in wheat to reduce reproduction and deter  by S. avenae. SA and JA were involved in the induced physical defense process. This study provided evidence for use of PeaT1 as a 'vaccine' to protect wheat from Sitobion avenae. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213554>Identification of Pneumococcal Factors Affecting Pneumococcal Shedding Shows that the  Locus Promotes Inflammation and Transmission.</a></h1><p>Host-to-host transmission is a necessary but poorly understood aspect of microbial pathogenesis. Herein, we screened a genomic library of mutants of the leading respiratory pathogen  generated by mariner transposon mutagenesis (Tn-Seq) to identify genes contributing to its exit or shedding from the upper respiratory tract (URT), the limiting step in the organism's transmission in an infant mouse model. Our analysis focused on genes affecting the bacterial surface that directly impact interactions with the host. Among the multiple factors identified was the  locus, which adds d-alanine onto lipoteichoic  (LTA) and thereby increases Toll-like receptor 2-mediated inflammation and resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The more robust proinflammatory response in the presence of d-alanylation promotes secretions that facilitate pneumococcal shedding and allows for transmission. Expression of the  locus is controlled by the CiaRH system, which senses cell wall stress in response to antimicrobial activity, including in response to lysozyme, the most abundant antimicrobial along the URT mucosa. Accordingly, in a  host, there was no longer an effect of the  locus on pneumococcal shedding. Thus, our findings demonstrate how a pathogen senses the URT milieu and then modifies its surface characteristics to take advantage of the host response for transit to another host.  (the pneumococcus) is a common cause of respiratory tract and invasive infection. The overall effectiveness of immunization with the organism's capsular polysaccharide depends on its ability to block  of the upper respiratory tract and thereby prevent host-to-host transmission. Because of the limited coverage of current pneumococcal vaccines, we carried out an unbiased  transposon mutagenesis screen to identify pneumococcal factors other than its capsular polysaccharide that affect transmission. One such candidate was expressed by the  locus, previously shown to add d-alanine onto the pneumococcal lipoteichoic  present on the bacterial cell surface. This modification protects against host antimicrobials and augments host inflammatory responses. The latter increases secretions and bacterial shedding from the upper respiratory tract to allow for transmission. Thus, this study provides insight into a mechanism employed by the pneumococcus to successfully transit from one host to another.Copyright © 2019 Zafar et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613012>Understanding interaction effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in rice under elevated carbon dioxide conditions.</a></h1><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), particularly the Glomerales group, play a paramount role in plant nutrient uptake, and abiotic and biotic stress management in rice, but recent evidence revealed that elevated CO concentration considerably reduces the Glomerales group in soil. In view of this, the present study was initiated to understand the interaction effect of native Glomerales species application in rice plants (cv. Naveen) under elevated CO concentrations (400 ± 10, 550 ± 20, and 700 ± 20 ppm) in open-top chambers. Three different modes of application of the AMF inoculum were evaluated, of which, combined application of AMF at the seedling production and transplanting stages showed increased AMF , which significantly improved grain yield by 25.08% and also increased uptake of phosphorus by 18.2% and nitrogen by 49.5%, as observed at 700-ppm CO concentration. Organic  secretion in rice root increased in AMF-inoculated plants exposed to 700-ppm CO concentration. To understand the overall effect of CO elevation on AMF interaction with the rice plant, principal component and partial least square regression analysis were performed, which found both positive and negative responses under elevated CO concentration.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the safety profile with the use of live probiotics is still a matter of debate. Main risks include: Cases of systemic infections due to translocation, particularly in vulnerable patients and pediatric populations; acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes; or interference with gut  in neonates. To avoid these risks, there is an increasing interest in non-viable microorganisms or microbial cell extracts to be used as probiotics, mainly heat-killed (including tyndallized) probiotic bacteria (lactic  bacteria and bifidobacteria). Heat-treated probiotic cells, cell-free supernatants, and purified key components are able to confer beneficial effects, mainly immunomodulatory effects, protection against enteropathogens, and maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity. At the clinical level, products containing tyndallized probiotic strains have had a role in gastrointestinal diseases, including bloating and infantile coli-in combination with mucosal protectors-and diarrhea. Heat-inactivated probiotics could also have a role in the management of dermatological or respiratory allergic diseases. The reviewed data indicate that heat-killed bacteria or their fractions or purified components have key probiotic effects, with advantages versus live probiotics (mainly their safety profile), positioning them as interesting strategies for the management of common prevalent conditions in a wide variety of patients´ characteristics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675630>Metabolites in the root exudates of groundnut change during interaction with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in a strain-specific manner.</a></h1><p>Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are extensively used as biofertilizers to improve the soil nutrition for a variety of crop plants. The plant-PGPR interaction, with special reference to chemical signalling molecules is not understood clearly, unlike other beneficial plant-microbe interactions. Chemo-attraction of a PGPR from soil microbial pool towards a plant could be dependent on some of the molecules in the plant root exudates (REs), similar to the beneficial association of legume-rhizobia. In this study, a few functional properties of PGPR like growth, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation by two PGPR strains viz., Bacillus sonorensis RS4 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa RP2 were assessed in the presence of groundnut REs. Functional properties of both the strains were significantly influenced by the REs in a strain-dependent manner. Metabolite profiling of the REs from PGPR-bacterized (RS4 or RP2) and non-bacterized seedlings was performed with GC-MS/MS after 12 and 24 days of growth. A total of 75 metabolites were detected in groundnut REs. Threonine and glyoxylic oxime  were detected in RP2-bacterized REs, while serine, pentanoic , glucopyranoside, tartaric , and 2-pyrrolidinone were detected in REs of seedlings bacterized with RP2 and RS4. The results suggested that the PGPR induced distinct variations in the REs. Identification of the interaction-specific metabolites will be useful to develop effective PGPR based bio-formulations for better PGPR  and improving crop yields.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Its intensive production is challenged by numerous diseases. One of the most lethal and difficult to control is verticillium wilt, a vascular disease caused by the fungal pathogen Verticillium nonalfalfae. The disease can be successfully controlled by the host resistance. Despite various studies that already researched resistance mechanisms of hops, only limited number of resistance genes and markers that could be utilized for efficient resistance breeding has been identified. In this study we aimed to follow fungus  pattern and the differential expression of selected genes during pre-symptomatic period of susceptible (Celeia) and resistant (Wye Target) hop cultivars. Results of gene expressions and fungal colonisation of compatible and incompatible interactions with V. nonalfalfae suggest that the hop plant is challenged already at the very early fungal colonisation stages. In total, nine out of 17 gene targets investigated in our study resulted in differential expression between inoculated and control plants of susceptible and resistant cultivars. The difference was the most evident in stems at an early stage of colonisation (6 dpi), showing relatively stronger changes in targeted gene expression to infection in the resistant cultivar than in the susceptible one. Analysed gene targets are involved in the overall defence response processes of nucleic  binding, signalling, protein ubiquitination, cell oxidative burst, hydroxylation, peroxidation, alternative splicing, and metabolite biosynthesis. The up-regulation of some genes (e.g. glycine-rich RNA-binding family protein, protein phosphatase, cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase, zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 40, cinnamic  4-hydroxylase, class III peroxidase, putative MAPK2, peroxiredoxin-2F) upon infection in incompatible interactions might reflect defence activation, restriction of disease spreading throughout the plant and successful response of resistant genotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Flagella are considered a primary virulence factor in  as these organelles are required for pathogenicity-related phenotypes including motility, biofilm formation, host cell interactions, and host . The post-transcriptional regulator CsrA regulates the expression of the major flagellin FlaA by binding to  mRNA and repressing its translation. Additionally, CsrA has previously been shown to regulate 120-150 proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. The amino  sequence of  CsrA is significantly different from that of  CsrA, and no previous research has defined the amino  of  CsrA that are critical for RNA binding. In this study, we used  SELEX to identify the consensus RNA sequence mAwGGAs to which  CsrA binds with high affinity. We performed saturating site-directed mutagenesis on  CsrA and assessed the regulatory activity of these mutant proteins, using a reporter system encoding the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) upstream of  linked translationally to the  gene. These assays allowed us to identify 19 amino  that were involved in RNA binding by CsrA, with many but not all of these amino  clustered in predicted beta strands that are involved in RNA binding by  CsrA.

These effector proteins modulate host cell biology in order to promote  and infection, hence type III secretion systems are often essential bacterial pathogenicity factors. The core of type III secretion systems is a cell envelope-spanning macromolecular machine called injectisome. It consists of almost twenty different components in a stoichiometry of one to more than one hundred. Assembly of this 6 MDa complex requires the coordinated integration of components from the cytoplasm, the inner membrane, the periplasm, the outer membrane and even the extracellular space of Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we review injectisome assembly with an emphasis on the techniques that were employed towards its investigation. In particular, we focus on in vivo photocrosslinking, a technique that exploits the encoding of the artificial UV-inducible crosslinking amino  p-benzoyl-phenylalanine to identify protein-protein interactions and to delineate assembly pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Fused deposit modeling (FDM) was used to produce polyvalent test plates for investigation of the physical, chemical, and in-vitro biological properties of printed materials. The polyvalent test plates (PVTPs) are poly-lactic  cylinders, 14 mm in diameter and 3 mm in height. The polymer ester backbone was surface modified by a series of ramified and linear oligoamines to increase its hydrophilicity and introduce a positive charge. The chemical modification was verified by FT-IR spectroscopy, showing the introduction of amide and amine functions, and contact angle measurements confirmed increased hydrophilicity. Morphology studies (SEM, optical microscopy) indicated that the modification of PVTP possessed a planar morphology with small pits. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy demonstrated that the polymeric free volume decreased on modification. An MTT-based prolonged cytotoxicity test using Caco-2 cells showed that the PVTPs are non-toxic at the cellular level. The presence of surface oligoamines on the PVTPs reduced biofilm formation by  SC5314 significantly. The results demonstrate that 3D printed objects may be modified at their surface by a simple amidation reaction, resulting in a reduced propensity for biofilm  and cellular toxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263924>Isolation and Identification of Protein L-Isoaspartate-O-Methyltransferase (PIMT) Interacting Proteins in Salmonella Typhimurium.</a></h1><p>Protein L-isoaspartate-O-methyltransferase (PIMT) plays an important role in restoration of covalently damaged Asn/Asp residues. It repairs the racemized forms of these amino  in protein by forming a labile isoAsp methyl ester which readily converts back to the succinimide intermediate. Spontaneous hydrolysis of the intermediate further restores a minor portion to the normal Asp residues. While significant numbers of PIMT targets have been identified in eukaryotes, very few are documented from prokaryotes. Temperature (42 °C) induced elevation in PIMT expression level has been recently shown in a poultry isolate of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST). The enzyme was also found to be crucial for survival, virulence and  of ST in poultry. In the present study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) approach was used (for isolation) followed by LC-MS analysis to identify the PIMT interacting proteins of ST. Four different proteins were identified among which cytochrome C biogenesis protein A (CcmA) was further expressed in recombinant form and analysed for interaction with recombinant PIMT (rPIMT) by microtiter plate assay.

YR343 results in altered lipid composition and changes in membrane biophysical properties.</a></h1><p>Bacterial membranes are complex mixtures of lipids and proteins, the combination of which confers biophysical properties that allows cells to respond to environmental conditions. Carotenoids are sterol analogs that are important for regulating membrane dynamics. The membrane of Pantoea sp. YR343 is characterized by the presence of the carotenoid zeaxanthin, and a carotenoid-deficient mutant, ΔcrtB, displays defects in root , reduced secretion of indole-3-acetic , and defects in biofilm formation. Here we demonstrate that the loss of carotenoids results in changes to the membrane lipid composition in Pantoea sp. YR343, including increased amounts of unsaturated fatty  in the ΔcrtB mutant membranes. These mutant cells displayed less fluid membranes in comparison to wild type cells as measured by fluorescence anisotropy of whole cells. Studies with artificial systems, however, have shown that carotenoids impart membrane rigidifying properties. Thus, we examined membrane fluidity using spheroplasts and vesicles composed of lipids extracted from either wild type or mutant cells. Interestingly, with the removal of the cell wall and membrane proteins, ΔcrtB vesicles were more fluid than vesicles made from lipids extracted from wild type cells. In addition, carotenoids appeared to stabilize membrane fluidity during rapidly changing temperatures. Taken together, these results suggest that Pantoea sp. YR343 compensates for the loss of carotenoids by changing lipid composition, which together with membrane proteins, results in reduced membrane fluidity. These changes may influence the abundance or function of membrane proteins that are responsible for the physiological changes observed in the ΔcrtB mutant cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin barrier integrity in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin barrier integrity in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH.A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic ) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment.In both groups, transepidermal water loss increased and pH decreased at 0 minutes post-ACV treatment, but these effects were not sustained at 60 minutes. In total, 72.7% (16/22) of subjects reported mild side effects from ACV with improvement after discontinuing the soaks.Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects. Study limitations include analysis of a single brand, dilution, and application of ACV. Future studies are needed to explore whether lower concentrations of ACV soaks or other applications such as a leave-on acidic ointment could improve skin barrier integrity in a safe, nonirritating way.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625833>Adaptive laboratory evolution of  under  stress.</a></h1><p>The ability of  to tolerate  stress is important for its survival and  in the human digestive tract.

Thus, the prevention and inhibition of Salmonella enteritidis infection are of great concern. Lactic  bacteria have anti-pathogenic activity; however, their underlying mechanisms and modes of action have not yet been clarified. In this study, the antibacterial mechanism of Lactobacillus reuteri S5 (L. reuteri S5) against Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076 (S. enteritidis ATCC13076) was studied by different methods. We found that L. reuteri S5 was able to form a stable biofilm formation, colonizing the entire intestinal tract of chickens. In addition, bacterial cultures and the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of L. reuteri S5 inhibited SE ATCC13076 growth, and this growth inhibition was also observed in the co-culture assay. This effect may be predominantly caused by antimicrobial metabolites produced by L. reuteri S5. Furthermore, treatment with the CFS of L. reuteri S5 resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of Salmonella virulence, motility and adhesion genes and a significant reduction in the motility ability and inhibitory effect on biofilm formation. In addition, the damage to the membrane structure and intracellular structure induced by the CFS of L. reuteri S5 could be observed on Transmission electron microscopy images and dodecyl sulfate, sodium salt (SDS)-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the disruptive action of the CFS of L. reuteri S5 on the cytoplasmic membrane. Our findings demonstrate that L. reuteri S5, an intestinal Lactobacillus species associated with chicken health, is able to form biofilm and stably colonize chicken intestines. It also possesses anti-SE activity, preventing SE growth, inhibits the expression of SE genes involved in adhesion and invasion, virulence and cell membrane integrity, inhibits SE biofilm formation and motility, damages or destroys bacterial structures, and inhibits intracellular protein synthesis. L. reuteri S5 therefore has potential applications as a probiotic agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these data have remained contentious due to underlying contamination issues. Here, we have used a previously described method for reducing contamination in microbiome workflows to determine if there is a fetal bacterial microbiome beyond the level of background contamination.

This study aims to understand alfalfa's response to P. medicaginis infection, the  of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) and the effect of AMF on plant-pathogen interactions.Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in alfalfa infected by P. medicaginis and colonized by AMF Rhizophagus intraradices. AMF ameliorated the effects of P. medicaginis infection on alfalfa by reducing leaf spot incidence and disease index by 39·48 and 56·18% respectively. Inoculation with pathogen and AMF induced the activity of defence pathways, including peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase activities and jasmonic  (JA), salicylic  concentration. Plants showed differential expression of P. medicaginis resistance-related genes, including genes belonging to pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, chitinase activity, flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism and photosynthesis. Inoculation with AMF led to changes in the expression of genes involved in PR proteins, chitinase activity, phenylalanine metabolism and photosynthesis.The physiological and transcriptional changes caused by P. medicaginis infection in non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal alfalfa provides crucial information for understanding AMF's association with pathogenic systems.This study showed that AMF alleviated alfalfa leaf spots demonstrating that AMF can serve as a biocontrol strategy for alfalfa disease management.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058101>Selection of New Probiotics for Endometrial Health.</a></h1><p>Microbiota is a crucial player in gynecologic health, in which bacteria can shift to a dysbiotic state triggering a pathogenic process. Based on an ecological understanding of the problem, the aim of this study is to select a potential probiotic strain to improve female reproductive tract based on its capacity to initially lower pH and to promote the reduction of pathogenic bacteria. Based on this rationale, strain  BPL005 was initially selected for its capacity to reduce  pH levels and produce organic . Subsequently, strain  BPL005 (CECT 8800) was demonstrated to have a protective role on endometrial infections in an  model of bacterial  of primary endometrial epithelial cells with , and . In this model, BPL005 when co-cultured with those pathogens was shown to lower pH and to produce organic , being lactic  the most relevant. The co-cultivation of strain  BPL005 with tested reference pathogens produced a significant reduction in  and  levels and a non-significant reduction in  and . The  of  BPL005 in the culture decreased IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, heightened in the presence of pathogens, and increased IL-1RA and IL-1 beta. Finally, safety was evaluated showing no signs of cytotoxicity, irritation in vaginal tests, or allergic contact dermatitis potential through the Local Lymph Node Assay. Overall, these results show the potential of  BPL005 strain as a probiotic in gynecological health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298570>Role of  DesB in Adaptation to Osmotic Stress.</a></h1><p>Proper membrane fluidity is maintained by adjusting the ratio of saturated fatty  to unsaturated fatty  (UFAs), and the control of membrane fluidity plays an important role in bacterial adaptation to stress. Adaptability to these stresses involves survival and  of bacteria, thus contributing to bacterial contamination in food. UFAs are synthesized by FabAB- and Des-mediated pathways in . Therefore, in this study, the roles of UFA-synthesizing proteins of  in resistance to stresses were examined. The growth and transcription levels of wild-type (WT)  PAO1 and its mutants were compared. The growth of all strains was inhibited by exposure to 0.5 or 1.0 M sodium chloride, but it was not affected by oxidative or pH stress. In particular, growth was impaired more substantially in the  mutant than in the WT strain and other mutants, suggesting that DesB has a role in response to salt stress. A comparative transcriptional analysis showed that genes involved in the synthesis of osmoprotectants (trehalose, -acetylglutaminylglutamine amide, and hydrophilin) were highly expressed in WT  in response to high salt, but they were rarely expressed in the  mutant. Furthermore, decreases in osmoprotectant production by the  mutant were partially complemented by the addition of betaine. These results indicate that  DesB contributes to adaptation to high salinity by positively regulating the synthesis of osmoprotectants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279995>Rapid Detection of Clostridium difficile Toxins in Stool by Raman Spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Clinical practice guidelines define Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) as diarrhea (≥3 unformed stools in 24 h) with either a positive C difficile stool test or detection of pseudomembranous colitis. Diagnostic modalities such as toxigenic culture and nucleic  amplification testing can identify the presence of toxigenic C difficile in stools. But these tests are confounded by the presence of asymptomatic  of toxigenic C difficile and lead to overdiagnosis of CDI. The presence of two large toxins, toxin A and B (TcdA and TcdB) is necessary for pathogenicity. Detection of toxins using toxin enzyme immunoassay is difficult as it has low sensitivity and moderate specificity. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a novel technology that is used to detect bacteria and their toxins. RS does not require any reagents for detection such as antibodies, enzymes, primers, or stains. We hypothesize that RS is a sensitive method to detect C difficile toxins in stool and will solve the problem of overdiagnosis of CDI.CDI negative stool samples were spiked with concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL) of TcdA and TcdB. RS was performed on air-dried smeared samples of stool supernatant on a mirror-polished stainless-steel slide. As RS of feces is difficult because of confounding background material and autofluorescence, samples were photo-bleached before spectral acquisition to reduce autofluorescence. Raman spectra were obtained, background corrected, and vector normalized. The data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. The machine learning methods used on the training data set were Support Vector Machine with Linear and Radial Kernels, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine, and Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results were validated using a test data set. The best model was chosen, and its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined.In our preliminary results, at all concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL), TcdA or TcdB spiked stool was distinguished from unspiked stool by all models with accuracies ranging from 64% to 77%. Gradient Boosting Machine, Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine Linear Kernel performed best with sensitivities ranging from 69% to 90% and specificities ranging from 43% to 78%.Using RS, we successfully detected TcdA and TcdB in stool samples albeit with moderate-to-high sensitivity and low-to-moderate specificity. Sensitivity and specificity could be further increased with the implementation of deep learning methods, which require large sample sizes. In terms of sensitivity, RS performs better than toxin enzyme immunoassay and has the potential to rapidly detect C difficile toxins in stool at clinically relevant concentrations and thereby help mitigate overdiagnosis of CDI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite its importance, little information is available on the establishment of microbial populations in the goat GIT or on changes occurring during early development. Therefore, this study investigated the bacterial community dynamics of the rumen, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon in 15 goats at five developmental stages (0, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days old) by using 16S rDNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR technology. 940 genera were found to belong to 44 phyla distributed along the GIT. As a whole, the microbial richness and diversity showed a clear increasing trend as the kids aged and alpha diversity differed significantly among GIT compartments mainly occurring at middle day ages (14 and 28 days). Principal coordinate analysis indicated that the bacterial community displayed distinct temporal and spatial specificity along the GIT in preweaning goats. As kids aged, the phylum Firmicutes was replaced by Bacteroidetes in rumen, whereas Proteobacteria in the large intestine was displaced by Firmicutes. The phylum Proteobacteria was mainly present in the small intestine in older animals. In the rumen, taxa, such as  and  decreased and , and unclassified Prevotellaceae increased with the age of kids. Furthermore, a lower proportion of taxa, such as  and  was observed with higher abundances of both  and  in duodenum and jejunum in older animals. In the large intestine, the microbiota displayed taxonomic dynamics with increases of , unclassified , and  as kids aged. Predicted pathway analysis suggested that genes involved in amino  metabolism, and translation were abundant in both rumen and duodenum, while genes involved in membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in the large intestine. These results indicate that both the microbial  process and potential function exert a temporal-spatial specificity throughout the GIT of goats. This study provides new insight into the temporal dynamics of GIT microbiota development during preweaning and will aid to develop strategies for improving animal health and downstream production.Copyright © 2019 Li, Zhang, Li, Wang, Chen and Yang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167904>Gut Microbiota and  Resistance against Bacterial Enteric Infection.</a></h1><p>SUMMARYThe gut microbiome is critical in providing resistance against  by exogenous microorganisms. The mechanisms via which the gut microbiota provide  resistance (CR) have not been fully elucidated, but they include secretion of antimicrobial products, nutrient competition, support of gut barrier integrity, and bacteriophage deployment. However, bacterial enteric infections are an important cause of disease globally, indicating that microbiota-mediated CR can be disturbed and become ineffective. Changes in microbiota composition, and potential subsequent disruption of CR, can be caused by various drugs, such as antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, antidiabetics, and antipsychotics, thereby providing opportunities for exogenous pathogens to colonize the gut and ultimately cause infection. In addition, the most prevalent bacterial enteropathogens, including ,  serovar Typhimurium, enterohemorrhagic , , , , , and , can employ a wide array of mechanisms to overcome  resistance. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on how the gut microbiota can mediate  resistance against bacterial enteric infection and on how bacterial enteropathogens can overcome this resistance.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417594>Endophyte-Mediated Resistance in Tomato to  Is Independent of ET, JA, and SA.</a></h1><p>Root endophytes can confer resistance against plant pathogens by direct antagonism or via the host by triggering induced resistance. The latter response typically relies on jasmonic  (JA)/ethylene (ET)-depended signaling pathways, but can also be triggered via salicylic  (SA)-dependent signaling pathways. Here, we set out to determine if endophyte-mediated resistance (EMR), conferred by the Fusarium endophyte Fo47, against Fusarium wilt disease in tomato is mediated via SA, ET or JA. To test the contribution of SA, ET, and JA in EMR we performed bioassays with Fo47 and  f. sp.  in tomato plants impaired in SA accumulation (), JA biosynthesis () or ET-production () and -sensing (. We observed that the  pattern of Fo47 in stems of wildtype plants was indistinguishable from that of the hormone mutants. Surprisingly, EMR was not compromised in the lines affected in JA, ET, or SA signaling. The independence of EMR on SA, JA, and ET implies that this induced resistance-response against Fusarium wilt disease is distinct from the classical Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR) response, providing exciting possibilities for control of wilt diseases independent of conventional defense pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31057582>Plant Hormones in Phytoplasma Infected Plants.</a></h1><p>Phytoplasmas are bacterial plant pathogens that need a plant host and an insect vector for their spread and survival. In plants, the physiological responses that phytoplasmas trigger result in symptom development through effects on hormonal, nutritional, and stress signaling pathways, and the interactions between these. In this review, recent advances on the involvement of plant hormones together with their known and deduced roles in plants infected with phytoplasmas are discussed. Several studies have directly, or in many cases indirectly, addressed plant hormone systems in phytoplasma-infected plants. These have provided accumulating evidence that phytoplasmas extensively affect plant hormone pathways. Phytoplasmas thus, with disturbing complex plant hormone networks, suppress plant immunity and modify plant structure, while optimizing their nutrient acquisition and facilitating their  of the plants, and their dissemination among plants by their insect vectors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440221>The Inducible Response of the Nematode  to Members of Its Natural Microbiota Across Development and Adult Life.</a></h1><p>The biology of all organisms is influenced by the associated community of microorganisms. In spite of its importance, it is usually not well understood how exactly this microbiota affects host functions and what are the underlying molecular processes. To rectify this knowledge gap, we took advantage of the nematode  as a tractable, experimental model system and assessed the inducible transcriptome response after  with members of its native microbiota. For this study, we focused on two isolates of the genus . These bacteria are known to be abundant in the nematode's microbiota and are capable of colonizing and persisting in the nematode gut, even under stressful conditions. The transcriptome response was assessed across development and three time points of adult life, using general and -specific enrichment analyses to identify affected functions. Our assessment revealed an influence of the microbiota members on the nematode's dietary response, development, fertility, immunity, and energy metabolism. This response is mainly regulated by a GATA transcription factor, most likely ELT-2, as indicated by the enrichment of (i) the GATA motif in the promoter regions of inducible genes and (ii) of ELT-2 targets among the differentially expressed genes. We compared our transcriptome results with a corresponding previously characterized proteome data set, highlighting a significant overlap in the differentially expressed genes, the affected functions, and ELT-2 target genes. Our analysis further identified a core set of 86 genes that consistently responded to the microbiota members across development and adult life, including several C-type lectin-like genes and genes known to be involved in energy metabolism or fertility. We additionally assessed the consequences of induced gene expression with the help of metabolic network model analysis, using a previously established metabolic network for . This analysis complemented the enrichment analyses by revealing an influence of the  isolates on  energy metabolism and furthermore metabolism of specific amino , fatty , and also folate biosynthesis. Our findings highlight the multifaceted impact of naturally colonizing microbiota isolates on  life history and thereby provide a framework for further analysis of microbiota-mediated host functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189981>Identification of specific protein amino  substitutions of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli ST131: a proteomics approach using mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>The global pandemic of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli is associated with sequence type 131 (ST131). However, mechanisms of ST131 spread remain unclear. This study searched for proteins with amino  substitutions specific for ST131 and used proteomics analysis to clarify ST131 characteristics. Five proteins had ST131-specific amino  substitutions: uncharacterized protein YahO with E34A (m/z 7655); UPF0337 protein YjbJ with V59D, D60S and T63K (m/z 8351); uncharacterized protein YnfD with S106T (m/z 8448); and  stress chaperone HdeA with Q92K and N94S (m/z 9714). Soluble cytochrome b562 (m/z 11783) showed seven amino  substitutions, and the sequence differed between clade C of the pandemic clade and non-C. In silico analysis showed YahO protein-protein interaction with YjbJ, possibly related to biofilm formation. Although the function of soluble cytochrome b562 is electron transport of unknown function, its involvement in biofilm formation was predicted. HdeA was a gastric  resistance-related protein. The function of YnfD was completely unclear. In conclusion, ST131-specific protein amino  substitutions consisted mainly of a gastric  resistance protein and proteins of unknown function (possibly involved in biofilm formation), which might be mechanisms for long-term  in the human intestinal tract.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188484>Potential antigen candidates for subunit vaccine development against Helicobacter pylori infection.</a></h1><p>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a resident bacterium in the stomach that accounts for 75% cases of gastric cancer. In this review, we comprehensively studied published papers on H. pylori vaccines using Google Scholar and NCBI databases to gather information about vaccines against H. pylori. Considering the pivotal roles of the enzyme urease (in production of NH and neutralization of the acidic medium of the stomach), cytotoxin-associated gene A, and vacuolating cytotoxin A proteins in H. pylori infection, they could be the best candidates for the construction of recombinant vaccines. The outer membrane porins (Hop), blood group antigen-binding adhesin (BabA), sialic -binding adhesin (SabA), and outer inflammatory protein A, play significant roles in binding of bacterium to human gastric tissues, and because binding is the first step in bacterial fixation and , these antigens also can be considered as suitable candidates for designing vaccines. Likely, other significant bacterial antigens, such as NapA (chemotactic factor for recruitment of human neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection), duodenal ulcer promoting protein A (to promote duodenal ulcer), and Hsp60 (as a molecular chaperon for activation of urease enzyme), can be used in the construction of subunit vaccines. New vaccines in use currently, such as DNA vaccines and subunit vaccines, can efficiently replace the dead and attenuated vaccines. Nonetheless, the results show that urease enzyme is most used compared with bacterial components in the designing and construction of recombinant vaccines. The BabA and SabA antigens belong to the outer membrane porins family in H. pylori and are required for binding and fixation of the bacterium to the human gastric tissues.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502576>Impact of  RRF3 on the root transcriptome of rice plants: Insights into defense response, secondary metabolism and root exudation.</a></h1><p> is widely used as a biocontrol agent, however, mechanisms by which it initiates the plants' defense response remains obscure. To gain an insight into the molecular changes that occur in plants upon plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria , root transcriptome analysis by using a microarray was performed in rice using  RRF3 (a rice rhizosphere isolate). Data analysis revealed a differential regulation of 61 transcripts (48 h post-treatment), of which, majority corresponded to defense response, cell wall modification and secondary metabolism. Seven genes encoding salicylic  (SA) responsive pathogenesis-related proteins were up-regulated significantly (fold change ranges from 1 to 4), which suggests that RRF3 has a profound impact on a SA-mediated defense signaling mechanism in rice. Investigations performed at later stages of RRF3  by real-time polymerase chain reaction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis confirmed the above results, demonstrating RRF3 as a potent biocontrol agent. Further, the impact of RRF3  on root exudation, in particular, exudation of SA was investigated by HPLC. However, analysis revealed RRF3 to have a negative impact on root exudation of SA. Overall, this study shows that  RRF3 immunizes the rice plants by re-organizing the root transcriptome to stimulate plant defense responses ('priming'), and simultaneously protects itself from the primed plants by altering the rhizosphere chemical constituents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411526>Prevention of enteric bacterial infections and modulation of gut microbiota with conjugated linoleic  producing  in mice.</a></h1><p>Probiotics are recognized for outcompeting pathogenic bacteria by competitive receptor-mediated  and secretion of functional metabolites which are antimicrobial against certain microbes as well as improving host's gut health and immunity. Recently, we have constructed a bioactive  (LC) strain, LC, by inserting  (myosin cross-reactive antigen) gene, which stimulates the conversion of conjugated linoleic . In this study, we evaluated the modulation of gut microbiome and protective roles of LC against pathogenic  serovar Typhimurium (ST) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) infections in BALB/cJ mice. We observed that LC colonized efficiently in mice gut intestine and competitively reduced the infection with ST and EHEC in various locations of small and large intestine, specifically cecum, jejunum, and ileum ( < 0.05). Positive modulation of the cecal microbiota, for example, higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria, and increased bacterial species diversity/richness, was detected in ST-challenged mice pretreated with LC based on 16S metagenomic sequencing. Cytokine gene expression analysis indicated that mice pretreated with LC associated with attenuated bacterial pathogen-induced gut inflammation. Furthermore, mice fed daily with LC for one week could protect themselves from the impairments caused by enteric infections with ST or EHEC. These impairments include weight loss, negative hematological changes, intestinal histological alterations, and potential death. This  study suggests that daily consumption of novel conjugated linoleic  over-producing probiotic effectively improves intestinal microbiota composition and prevents/combats foodborne enteric bacterial infections with pathogenic  and diarrheagenic .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671281>Combined effects of Rhizo-competitive Rhizosphere and Non-rhizosphere Bacillus in Plant Growth Promotion and Yield Improvement of Eleusine coracana (Ragi).</a></h1><p>This study emphasizes on the beneficial role of rhizo-competitive Bacillus spp. isolated from rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric soil in plant growth promotion and yield improvement via nitrogen fixation and biocontrol of Sclerotium rolfsii causing foot rot disease in Eleusine coracana (Ragi). The selection of potent rhizobacteria was based on plant growth-promoting attributes using Venn Set Diagram (VSD) and Bonitur Scale (BS). Bacillus pumilus MSTA8 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MSTD26 were obtained as persuasive in root , rhizosphere competence and biofilm formation using root exudates of E. coracana L. rich with carbohydrates, proteins, and amino . The relative chemotaxis index (RCI) of the isolates understood invasive behavior to the rhizosphere. During pot and field trials, the consortia of rhizobacteria in a vermiculite carrier increased the grain yield by 37.87% with a significant Harvest Index (HI) 16.45.

However, probiotics or prebiotics or their combination offer a potential alternative intervention strategy for improving the host health and preventing foodborne pathogen /infections in reservoir. Further, bioengineered probiotics expressing bioactive products to achieve specific function is highly desirable. Recently, we over-expressed  (myosin cross-reactive antigen) gene in s  (Lc) and developed a bioengineered probiotics Lc + CLA which produce higher amounts of metabolites including conjugated linoleic  (CLA). Furthermore, we also reported that prebiotic like components such as berry pomace (byproduct) phenolic extracts (BPEs) can enhance the growth of probiotics and improved the beneficial effects of probiotics. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial effect of modified Lc + CLA in combination of BPEs on growth, survival and pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC).In mixed culture condition, the growth of EHEC was significantly reduced in the presence Lc + CLA and/or BPEs. Cell-free cultural supernatant (CFCS) collected from Lc or Lc + CLA strain also inhibited the growth and survival of EHEC and the inhibitory effects of CFCSs against EHEC were enhanced in the presence of BPEs in concentration dependent manner. Interaction between EHEC and intestinal epithelial INT-407 cells were also altered significantly in the presence of either Lc or Lc + CLA strain or their CFCSs with or without BPEs. The expression of multiple virulence genes and physicochemical properties of EHEC were also altered when the bacterial cells were pretreated with CFCSs and/or BPEs.These results showed that diet containing bioactive Lc + CLA and natural prebiotic like component such as BPEs might be an effective way to prevent foodborne infections with EHEC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265361>The Modification of the Flavonoid Naringenin by  sp.

However, in addition to the control of expression of  genes, many other effects of flavonoids on rhizobial cells have been described. Here, we show that the flavonoid naringenin stimulates the growth of the photosynthetic  sp. strain ORS285. This growth-stimulating effect was still observed for strain ORS285 with , , or the naringenin-degrading  operon deleted. Phenotypic microarray analysis indicates that in cells grown in the presence of naringenin, the glycerol and fatty  metabolism is activated. Moreover, electron microscopic and enzymatic analyses show that polyhydroxy alkanoate metabolism is altered in cells grown in the presence of naringenin. Although strain ORS285 was able to degrade naringenin, a fraction was converted into an intensely yellow-colored molecule with an  (+) of 363.0716. Further analysis indicates that this molecule is a hydroxylated and O-methylated form of naringenin. In contrast to naringenin, this derivative did not induce  gene expression, but it did stimulate the growth of strain ORS285. We hypothesize that the growth stimulation and metabolic changes induced by naringenin are part of a mechanism to facilitate the  and infection of naringenin-exuding host plants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511334>Dual Reporting of Clostridioides difficile PCR and Predicted Toxin Result Based on PCR Cycle Threshold Reduces Treatment of Toxin-Negative Patients without Increases in Adverse Outcomes.</a></h1><p>Nucleic  amplification tests are commonly used to diagnose  infection (CDI).

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of this reporting, all adult patients with positive GeneXpert PCR results from October 2016 through October 2017 underwent a chart review to measure the recurrence of or conversion to a CT-toxin result and 30-day all-cause mortality. There were 482 positive PCR tests in 430 unique patients, 282 CT-toxin and 200 CT-toxin Patient characteristics were similar at testing, though CT-toxin patients had higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (12.5 × 10 versus 9.3 × 10 cells/μl;  = 0.001). All cases ( = 21) of fulminant CDI had a CT-toxin result. Index CT-toxin patients were significantly more likely to have a CT-toxin result within 90 days than CT-toxin patients (17.4% [ = 49] versus 8.0% [ = 16], respectively;  = 0.003). Thirty-day all-cause mortality was higher in CT-toxin patients (11.1% versus 6.8%;  = 0.1), though no deaths in CT-toxin patients were directly attributable to CDI.

The present study investigated diversity of human vaginal microbiota among females of Northeast India, who are distinct in dietary habits, lifestyle, and genomic composition from rest of India.Altogether, 154 bacterial isolates were obtained from vaginal swab samples of 40 pregnant and 29 non-pregnant females. The samples were sequenced for 16 s rRNA gene and analysed for identification using a dual approach of homology search and maximum likelihood based clustering. Molecular identification based on 16S rRNA gene sequence confirmed the isolates belonging to 31 species. Lactobacilli constituted 37.7% of the bacterial isolates with 10 species and other Lactic  Bacteria (39.61%) represented another 10 species, some of which are opportunistic pathogens. The remaining of the communities are mostly dominated by species of Staphylococcus (14.28%) and rarely by Propionibacterium avidum (3.90%), Bacillus subtilis, Escherchia coli, Janthinobacterium lividum, and Kocuria kristinae (each 0.64%). Interestingly Lactobacillus mucosae and Enterococcus faecalis, which are globally uncommon vaginal microbes is found dominant among women of Northeast India. This tentatively reflects adaptability of particular Lactobacillus species, in distinct population, to better compete for receptors and nutrients in vaginal epithelium than other species. Further, intrageneric 16S rRNA gene exchange was observed among Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and two species of Lactobacillus, and deep intraspecies divergence among L. mucosae, which pinpointed possibility of emergence of new strains with evolved functionality. Lactobacilli percentage decreased from young pregnant to aged non-pregnant women with maximum  in trimester II.The study highlighted importance of assessment of vaginal microbiota, Lactobacillus in particular, across different population to gain more insight on female health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655732>Periodontal disease: From the lenses of light microscopy to the specs of proteomics and next-generation sequencing.</a></h1><p>Periodontal disease entails the inflammatory destruction of the tooth supporting (periodontal) tissues as a result of polymicrobial  of the tooth surface in the form of biofilms. Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic  sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the microbiome. The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other.

Disequilibrium of gut microbiota in early life has been implicated in the incidence of inflammation and metabolic diseases in adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the difference in gut microbiota , cytokines and plasma metabolome between IUGR and normal birth weight (NBW) piglets in early life. At birth, reduced (P < 0.05) body, jejunum, and ileum weights, as well as decreased (P < 0.05) small intestinal villi and increased (P < 0.05) ileal crypt depth were observed in IUGR piglets compared with their NBW counterparts. Imbalanced inflammatory and plasma metabolome profile was observed in IUGR piglets. Furthermore, altered metabolites were mainly involved in fatty  metabolism and inflammatory response. At 12 h after birth and after suckling colostrum, reduced (P < 0.05) postnatal growth and the small intestinal maturation retardation (P < 0.05) continued in IUGR piglets in comparison with those in NBW littermates. Besides, the gut microbiota structure was significantly altered by IUGR. Importantly, the disruption of the inflammatory profile and metabolic status mainly involved the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IFN-γ) and amino  metabolism. Moreover, spearman correlation analysis showed that the increased abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and decreased abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 in IUGR piglets was closely associated with the alterations of slaughter weight, intestinal morphology, inflammatory cytokines, and plasma metabolites. Collectively, IUGR significantly impairs small intestine structure, modifies gut microbiota , and disturbs inflammatory and metabolic profiles during the first 12 h after birth. The unbalanced gut microbiota mediated by IUGR contributes to the development of inflammation and metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608569>Linking lipid transfer with reduced arbuscule formation in tomato roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus under low pH stress.</a></h1><p>Arbuscules are the core structures of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), and arbuscule development is regulated by environmental stress, e.g., low pH. Recent studies indicate that lipid transfer from plants is essential for AM fungal ; however, the role of lipid transfer in arbuscule formation and the dynamics of lipid accumulation in arbuscules under low pH stress are far from well understood. In the symbiosis of tomato and Rhizophagus intraradices under contrasting pH conditions (pH 4.5 vs. pH 6.5), we investigated arbuscule formation, nutrient uptake, alkaline phosphatase activity and lipid accumulation; examined the gene expression involved in phosphate transport, lipid biosynthesis and transfer and sugar metabolism; and visualized the lipid dynamics in arbuscules. Low pH greatly inhibited arbuscule formation, in parallel with reduced phospholipid fatty  accumulation in AM fungus and decreased P uptake. This reduction was supported by the decreased expression of plant genes encoding lipid biosynthesis and transfer. More degenerating arbuscules were observed under low pH conditions, and neutral lipid fatty  accumulated only in degenerating arbuscules. These data reveal that, under low pH stress, reduced lipid transfer from hosts to AM fungi is responsible for the inhibited arbuscule formation.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531187>Betulinic  Suppresses Breast Cancer Metastasis by Targeting GRP78-Mediated Glycolysis and ER Stress Apoptotic Pathway.</a></h1><p>Targeting aberrant metabolism is a promising strategy for inhibiting cancer growth and metastasis. Research is now geared towards investigating the inhibition of glycolysis for anticancer drug development. Betulinic  (BA) has demonstrated potent anticancer activities in multiple malignancies. However, its regulatory effects on glycolysis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. BA inhibited invasion and migration of highly aggressive breast cancer cells. Moreover, BA could suppress aerobic glycolysis of breast cancer cells presenting as a reduction of lactate production, quiescent energy phenotype transition, and downregulation of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In this study, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was also identified as the molecular target of BA in inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. BA treatment led to GRP78 overexpression, and GRP78 knockdown abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on glycolysis. Further studies demonstrated that overexpressed GRP78 activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor PERK. Subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2 led to the inhibition of -catenin expression, which resulted in the inhibition of c-Myc-mediated glycolysis. Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that BA interrupted the binding between GRP78 and PERK, thereby initiating the glycolysis inhibition cascade. Finally, the lung  model validated that BA inhibited breast cancer metastasis , as well as suppressed the expression of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In conclusion, our study not only provided a promising drug for aerobic glycolysis inhibition but also revealed that GRP78 is a novel molecular link between glycolytic metabolism and ER stress during tumor metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355114>Effectiveness of  PDSLzg-1, an innovative Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacterium conferring antifungal and plant growth-promoting function.</a></h1><p>Genome of the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium  PDSLzg-1 was analyzed. A group of gene clusters and pathways associated with nitrogen fixation, plant-bacterial interactions, plant growth-promoting hormone synthesis, antibiotics, secondary metabolite, and disease resistance were identified. In addition, 0.06 mg/L of 3-indoleacrylic  (IAA) and 2 mg/L of gibberellin (GA) were, respectively, detected in PDSLzg-1 fermentation broth by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Up-regulated expression levels of 11 key genes related to GA and IAA biosynthesis pathways were detected after the induction of 0.2% n-hexadecane. Furthermore, bioassays showed that PDSLzg-1 fermentation could significantly promote the length and biomass of the stems and roots of  L., while inhibited  .

Moench (Asteraceae) might be related to different plant metabolites contained in plant samples, extracts and products. The influence of bacterial endophytes on the synthesis of bioactive compounds in the medicinal plants has been previously demonstrated but there are only few studies addressing anticancer effects and mechanisms of E. purpurea extracts following endophytic . The present study aimed to test and compare the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibition potential of n-hexane and methanol extracts from in vitro endophyte non-inoculated and inoculated E. purpurea plants. An in vitro model was previously set up to perform the infection of axenic E. purpurea plants with bacterial endophytic strains isolated from E. purpurea aerial part. Only methanol extracts showed LDH5 inhibition, in particular the richest in chicoric  and most strongly inhibiting extract was obtained from inoculated stem and leaves of E. purpurea (IC = 0.9 mg/ml). Chicoric  showed an IC value (66.7 µM) in enzymatic assays better than that of the reference compound galloflavin. Modeling studies were carried out to suggest the putative interaction mode of chicoric  in the enzyme active site. This in vitro model on plant-bacterial interaction may lead to obtain extracts from plants enriched in bioactive compounds and it is a new approach for the discovery of novel anticancer compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654610>Associations between the vaginal microbiome and Candida  in women of reproductive age.</a></h1><p>The composition of bacteria within the vaginal microbiome has garnered a lot of recent attention and has been associated with reproductive health and disease. Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal microbiome, there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal microbiome and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida . In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida . 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida . In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The microbiome, race and Candida  co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic  and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida  more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite these relevant implications, no information is currently available on the architecture of -based dual biofilms. In addition to this, there is a limited amount of information regarding the estimation of the temporal changes in the relative abundances of the partners in such binary systems. To address these issues, a dual biofilm model system with this fungus was prepared by using  34 as the bacterial partner due to its very fast biofilm-forming ability. The application of the bacterial inoculum to already settled fungal biofilm on a polystyrene surface coated with hydroxyapatite was the most efficient approach to the production of the mixed system the ultrastructure of which was investigated by a multi-microscopy approach. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the adhesion of bacterial cells onto the mycelial cell wall appeared to be mediated by the presence of an abundant layer of extracellular matrix (ECM). Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that ECM filaments of bacterial origin formed initially a reticular structure that assumed a tabular semblance after 72 h, thus overshadowing the underlying mycelial network. Across the thickness of the mixed biofilms, the presence of an extensive network of channels with large aggregates of viable bacteria located on the edges of their lumina was found by confocal laser scanning microscopy; on the outermost biofilm layer, a significant fraction of dead bacterial cells was evident. Albeit with tangible differences, similar results regarding the estimation of the temporal shifts in the relative abundances of the two partners were obtained by two independent methods, the former relying on qPCR targeting of 16S and 18S rRNA genes and the latter on ester-linked fatty  methyl esters analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387457>A Decade Decoded: Spies and Hackers in the History of TAL Effectors Research.</a></h1><p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) from the genus  are proteins with the remarkable ability to directly bind the promoters of genes in the plant host to induce their expression, which often helps bacterial .

This is a multistep process that involves aberrant cell communication, leading to tumor cell dissemination from the primary tumor and  of distinct organs for secondary tumor formation. The mechanisms promoting this pathological process are not fully understood, although they may be of obvious therapeutic interest. Exosomes are small cell-secreted vesicles that contain a large variety of proteins, lipids, and nucleic  with important signaling activities, and that represent an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell-to-cell communication. Not surprisingly, exosome activities have gained strong interest in cancer biology and might play essential roles in metastasis development. Here, we will describe recent findings on the role of exosomes in cancer metastasis formation, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC).

This study evaluated the implication of combining the mycoremediated dry olive residue (MDOR) amendment application with the inoculation of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) Funneliformis mosseae in restoring the quality, composition, and functionality of soil microbial communities. To achieve this aim, a mesocosms experiment was set up that included three variations: i) with and without application of Penicillium chrysogenum-10-transformed MDOR (MDOR_Pc), and Chondrosterum purpureum-transformed MDOR (MDOR_Cp) amendments; ii) with and without F. mosseae inoculation; and iii) 30-day and 60-day soil treatment time. As a result of this combined treatment, changes in the soil labile organic C and N fractions were observed throughout the experiment. Increases in the abundance of phospholipid fatty  (PLFAs) for bacteria, actinobacteria, and Gram- and Gram+ bacteria were also recorded at the end of the experiment. The addition of MDOR amendments boosted fungal and AM fungi communities. AM fungi root and soil  was also enhanced as the result of improvement nutrient turnover and spatial conditions caused by adding MDOR in combination with an inoculation of F. mosseae. The composition and functionality of microbial communities seemed to be an important ecological attribute indicating an apparently fully functional restoration of this metal-polluted soil and therefore suggesting the suitability of the combined MDOR and AM fungus treatment as a reclamation practice.Copyright © 2019.

The effect of the polymerization of the structural units of POS contained in the AP hydrolysate on the growth and metabolism of microbiota from the human gastrointestinal tract and the adhesion of lactic  bacteria (LAB) or pathogens to human gut epithelial cells was investigated in vitro. Mild  hydrolysis followed by pectinolysis with Rohapect MaPlusT yielded the highest concentration of POS. In contrast, pure enzymatic processing of the AP performed with a mixed preparation of cellulase and Rohapect MaPlusT resulted in 1.8-fold lower overall POS. The concentration of higher-order oligosaccharides (degree of polymerization (DP) 7-10), however, was 1.7-fold higher. The increased ratio of higher-order oligosaccharides caused an increase in the bifidogenic effect, as well as affecting the amount and nature of short-chain fatty  produced. Inhibition of  was also observed. The strongest stimulation of LAB adhesion to the human epithelial cells occurred in the presence of the preparation containing the highest concentration of higher-order oligosaccharides. The fecal bacteria and pathogens showed much weaker adhesion to intestinal cells in the presence of all the tested AP hydrolysates. Both of the tested POS preparations, containing structurally different oligosaccharides (DPs 2-10 with different ratios of higher-order oligosaccharides), have the potential to be used as prebiotics for humans and animals.

Bacillomycin D showed a direct inhibitory effect on R. stolonifer spore germination and mycelial growth in vitro. It conferred both a direct inhibitory effect on R. stolonifer growth in cherry tomato in vivo and induced host resistance in cherry tomato. Moreover, Bacillomycin D treatment significantly increased the activities of plant defense-related enzymes, including chitinase (CHI), β-1,3-glucanase (GLU), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and peroxidase (POD). Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) showed that defense-related genes involved in the salicylic  defense signaling pathway and genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins were up-regulated in Bacillomycin D treatment. Furthermore, Bacillomycin D-C16 resulted in direct inhibition and a remarkable induced resistance to R. stolonifer which was higher than as induced by Bacillomycin D-C14. Together, the data indicated that Bacillomycin D can control the growth of R. stolonifer through both the direct inhibition of the fungus and the activation of defense-related genes and enzymes in cherry tomato.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231345>Mucosa-Associated Microbiota in Gastric Cancer Tissues Compared With Non-cancer Tissues.</a></h1><p>The link between microbiota and gastric cancer (GC) has attracted widespread attention. However, the phylogenetic profiles of niche-specific microbiota in the tumor microenvironment is still unclear. Here, mucosa-associated microorganisms from 62 pairs of matched GC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Functional profiles of the microbiota were predicted using PICRUSt, and a co-occurrence network was constructed to analyze interactions among gastric microbiota. Results demonstrated that mucosa-associated microbiota from cancerous and non-cancerous tissues established micro-ecological systems that differed in composition, structure, interaction networks, and functions. Microbial richness and diversity were increased in cancerous tissues, with the co-occurrence network exhibiting greater complexity compared with that in non-cancerous tissue. The bacterial taxa enriched in the cancer samples were predominantly represented by oral bacteria (such as , , and ), while lactic -producing bacteria (such as  and ) were more abundant in adjacent non-tumor tissues.  by , which is a GC risk factor, also impacted the structure of the microbiota. Enhanced bacterial purine metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and denitrification functions were predicted in the cancer associated microbial communities, which was consistent with the increased energy metabolism and concentration of nitrogen-containing compounds in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the microbial co-occurrence networks in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues of GC patients were described for the first time. And differential taxa and functions between the two groups were identified. Changes in the abundance of certain bacterial taxa, especially oral microbiota, may play a role in the maintenance of the local microenvironment, which is associated with the development or progression of GC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177380>The nematicide Serratia plymuthica M24T3 colonizes Arabidopsis thaliana, stimulates plant growth, and presents plant beneficial potential.</a></h1><p>Nine bacterial strains were previously isolated in association with pinewood nematode (PWN) from wilted pine trees. They proved to be nematicidal in vitro, and one of the highest activities, with potential to control PWN, was showed by Serratia sp. M24T3. Its ecology in association with plants remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of strain M24T3 to colonize the internal tissues of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using confocal microscopy. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) functional traits were tested and retrieved in the genome of strain M24T3. In greenhouse conditions, the bacterial effects of all nematicidal strains were also evaluated, co-inoculated or not with Bradyrhizobium sp. 3267, on Vigna unguiculata fitness. Inoculation of strain M24T3 increased the number of A. thaliana lateral roots and the confocal analysis confirmed effective bacterial  in the plant. Strain M24T3 showed cellulolytic activity, siderophores production, phosphate and zinc solubilization ability, and indole acetic  production independent of supplementation with L-tryptophan. In the genome of strain M24T3, genes involved in the interaction with the plants such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, chitinolytic activity, and quorum sensing were also detected. The genomic organization showed ACC deaminase and its leucine-responsive transcriptional regulator, and the activity of ACC deaminase was 594.6 nmol α-ketobutyrate μg protein μl. Strain M24T3 in co-inoculation with Bradyrhizobium sp. 3267 promoted the growth of V. unguiculata.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic  and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487045>Sex-specific strategies of phosphorus (P) acquisition in Populus cathayana as affected by soil P availability and distribution.</a></h1><p>Soil phosphorus (P) availability and its distribution influence plant growth and productivity, but how they affect the growth dynamics and sex-specific P acquisition strategies of dioecious plant species is poorly understood. In this study, the impact of soil P availability and its distribution on dioecious Populus cathayana was characterized. P. cathayana males and females were grown under three levels of P supply, and with homogeneous or heterogeneous P distribution. Females had a greater total root length, specific root length (SRL), biomass and foliar P concentration under high P supply. Under P deficiency, males had a smaller root system than females but a greater exudation of soil  phosphatase, and a higher  rate and arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal biomass, suggesting a better capacity to mine P and a stronger association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to forage P. Heterogeneous P distribution enhanced growth and root length density (RLD) in females. Female root proliferation in P-rich patches was related to increased foliar P assimilation. Localized P application for increasing P availability did not enhance the biomass accumulation and the morphological plasticity of roots in males, but it raised hyphal biomass. The findings herein indicate that sex-specific strategies in P acquisition relate to root morphology, root exudation and mycorrhizal symbioses, and they may contribute to sex-specific resource utilization patterns and niche segregation.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125997>Diversity, distribution and multi-functional attributes of bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere and endosphere of timothy (Phleum pratense L.).</a></h1><p>To characterize the bacterial communities of the rhizosphere and endosphere of the forage grass timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and evaluate the functional attributes with respect to growth promotion properties, antimicrobial and biosurfactant capacities.A total of 254 culturable bacteria were identified using 16S rRNA sequencing and grouped into 16 taxa that shared high homology of 98-99% with other known sequences.

Second, all the communities were dominated by aero-tolerant taxa such as Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Abiotrophia, and Lactobacillus, although there was preferential  of specific taxa observed. Finally, the primary SCFA produced throughout the intestinal tract was acetic , with some propionic  and butyric  detected in the colon regions. The small intestine microbiota produced significantly less SCFAs compared to the communities in the colon.

L. rhamnosus is an acidogenic bacterium that produces copious amounts of lactic . The organism is also considered as aciduric, since it can survive prolonged exposure to an acidic environment. For a probiotic bacterium such as L. rhamnosus, it is necessary to understand how this organism survives  stress. In this study we used L. rhamnosus LRB to isolate one spontaneous mutant that was sensitive to  stress. The mutant, which we named RBM1, also displayed sensitivity to a wide range of stresses including osmotic, thermal, and others. Using whole genome sequencing, we mapped the putative mutations in the mutant strain. It appears that three single nucleotide substitutions occurred in the mutant as compared to the wild-type LRB strain. Among those, the most relevant mutation occurred in the ftsH gene that created a single amino  change in the protein. We performed a comparative proteomic study to understand the molecular basis for stress sensitivity and found that ~15% of the proteome is altered in the mutant strain. Our study suggests that generation of spontaneous mutants during L. rhamnosus  could drastically affect bacterial physiology and survival under stress conditions.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Orally delivered  can reach the colon and maintain a long-lasting  there. However,  with mutations in chromosomal genes  and  (designated a chromosomal mutant) or deficient in plasmid-encoded pGP3 (designated a plasmid mutant) is unable to do so. We now report that the chromosomal mutant is still able to reach the colon while the plasmid mutant fails to do so following an oral delivery, suggesting that lack of colon  by different mutants may involve distinct mechanisms. Consistently, a direct intracolonic delivery selectively restored the ability of the plasmid mutant, but not the chromosomal mutant, to colonize the colon. The chromosomal mutant was rescued only in the colon of mice deficient in gamma interferon (IFN-γ). Thus, the chromosomal mutant's deficiency in colonizing colonic mucosal tissue is likely due to its increased susceptibility to IFN-γ-mediated immunity. Furthermore, IFN-γ deficiency was sufficient for rescuing colon  of an orally delivered chromosomal mutant but not plasmid mutant while mice deficient in gastric  production rescued the plasmid mutant but not the chromosomal mutant. Both mutants are attenuated in inducing genital tract pathology. Thus, we propose that chlamydial chromosomal-gene-encoded genital tract virulence factors may be essential for  to maintain long-lasting  in the colon while the plasmid may enable  to reach the colon by promoting evasion of gastric barriers.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611277> Requires Lipid Metabolism Genes to Replicate in Pro-inflammatory Macrophages and Mice.</a></h1><p>To survive and replicate during infection, pathogens utilize different carbon and energy sources depending on the nutritional landscape of their host microenvironment.  serovar Typhimurium () is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that occupies diverse cellular niches. While it is clear that  requires access to glucose during systemic infection, data on the need for lipid metabolism are mixed. We report that  strains lacking lipid metabolism genes were defective for systemic infection of mice. Bacterial lipid import, β-oxidation and glyoxylate shunt genes were required for tissue  upon oral or intraperitoneal inoculation. In cultured macrophages, lipid import and β-oxidation genes were required for bacterial replication and/or survival only when the cell culture medium was supplemented with non-essential amino . Removal of glucose from tissue culture medium further enhanced these phenotypes and, in addition, conferred a requirement for glyoxylate shunt genes. We also observed that  needs lipid metabolism genes in pro-inflammatory but not anti-inflammatory macrophages. These results suggest that during systemic infection, the  that rely upon host lipids to replicate are within pro-inflammatory macrophages that have access to amino , but not glucose. An improved understanding of the host microenvironments in which pathogens have specific metabolic requirements may facilitate the development of targeted approaches to treatment.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345412>Penicillium digitatum infection mechanisms in citrus: What do we know so far?</a></h1><p>Penicillium digitatum is the major source of postharvest decay in citrus fruits worldwide. This fungus shows a limited host range, being able to infect mainly mature fruit belonging to the Rutaceae family. This highly specific host interaction has attracted the interest of the scientific community. Researchers have investigated the chemical interactions and specialized virulence strategies that facilitate this fungus's fruit , thereby leading to a successful citrus infection. There are several factors that mediate and affect the interaction between P. digitatum and its host citrus, including hydrogen peroxide modulation, secretion of organic  and consequently pH control, and other strategies described here. The recently achieved sequencing of the complete P. digitatum genome opened up new possibilities for exploration of the virulence factors related to the host-pathogen interaction. Through such techniques as RNAseq, RT-PCR and targeted gene knockout mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, important genes involved in the fungal infection process in citrus have been reported, helping to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, metabolites and genetic components that are involved in the pathogenicity of P. digitatum. Understanding the infection process and fungal strategies represents an important step in developing ways to protect citrus from P. digitatum infection, possibly leading to more productive citriculture.Copyright © 2019 British Mycological Society.

Candidatus. L. asiaticus, L. americanus, L. africanus cause citrus greening disease, while Ca. L. solanacearum causes potato Zebra chip disease. None of the pathogens grows in axenic culture. L. crescens grows in three media: a BM-7, a serum-free Hi® Grace's Insect Medium (Hi-GI), and a chemically-defined medium called M15. To date, no optimal growth parameters of the model species L. crescens have been reported. Studying the main growth parameters of L. crescens in axenic culture will give us insights into the lifestyle of the Ca. Liberibacter pathogens.The evaluation of the growth parameters-pH, aeration, temperature, and buffering capacity-reflects the optimal living conditions of L. crescens. These variables revealed that L. crescens is an aerobic, neutrophilic bacterium, that grows optimally in broth in a pH range of 5.8 to 6.8, in a fully oxygenated environment (250 rpm), at 28 °C, and with monosodium phosphate (10 mM or 11.69 mM) as the preferred buffer for growth. The increase of pH in the external media likely results from the deamination activity within the cell, with the concomitant over-production of ammonium in the external medium.L. crescens and the Ca. Liberibacter pathogens are metabolically similar and grow in similar environments-the phloem and the gut of their insect vectors. The evaluation of the growth parameters of L. crescens reveals the lifestyle of Liberibacter, elucidating ammonium and phosphate as essential molecules for  within the hosts. Ammonium is the main driver of pH modulation by active deamination of amino  in the L. crescens amino  rich media. In plants, excess ammonium induces ionic imbalances, oxidative stress, and pH disturbances across cell membranes, causing stunted root and shoot growth and chlorosis-the common symptoms of HLB-disease. Phosphate, which is also present in Ca. L. asiaticus hosts, is the preferred buffer for the growth of L. crescens. The interplay between ammonium, sucrose, potassium (K), phosphate, nitrate (NO), light and other photosynthates might lead to develop better strategies for disease management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428100>Fecal Changes Following Introduction of Milk in Infants With Outgrowing Non-IgE Cow's Milk Protein Allergy Are Influenced by Previous Consumption of the Probiotic LGG.</a></h1><p>Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the most common allergy in the first year of life. Non-IgE mediated CMPA is characterized by digestive symptoms and tolerance development before the age of three. Gut microbiota composition in early life has been associated with food allergy. The ingestion of different foods/nutrients may mark different shifts in the microbial  of the infant intestine as well as the consumption of probiotics.  To analyze changes in microbiota composition and metabolic and cytokine profiles in fecal samples from infants with non-IgE mediated CMPA after successful milk challenges, tolerance acquisition, and increasing dairy introduction in their diet.  Twelve children with CMPA, aged between 1 and 2 years old, were recruited for the study. Participants were initially consuming hypoallergenic hydrolyzed formulas (four of them supplemented with the probiotic  GG), before being exposed to a standardized oral challenge (SOC) with cow's milk. Fecal samples were collected before, 1 week, and 1 month after performing the SOC. Changes in gut microbiota were determined by high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Levels of lactobacilli were also determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microbial metabolites were analyzed by chromatographic methods and fecal cytokines related to the Th1/Th2 balance were determined by immunoassay.  Lactic  bacteria significantly increased in infants who outgrew non-IgE CMPA, after the introduction of milk. Microbial metabolites derived from the fermentation of proteins, such as branched chain fatty , and -cresol, diminished. After the SOC, some cytokines related to inflammation (TNF-α, IFN-γ) increased. Accompanying the introduction of an unrestricted diet, we found significant differences in fecal microbial composition, metabolites, and cytokines between infants who did not consume the probiotic  GG and those that did.  These findings indicate that the introduction of intact milk proteins is followed by modifications in the infant gut environment through changes in immune mediators, microbiota, and its metabolic end-products. Consumption of probiotics during CMPA may contribute to gut homeostasis by fine-tuning these profiles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552069>An Imaging Approach to Identify Mechanisms of Resistance to Pineapple Fruitlet Core Rot.</a></h1><p>Fruitlet core rot is one of the major postharvest disease of pineapple ( var. ). In the past, control strategies were designed to eliminate symptoms without addressing their causes or mechanisms, thus achieving only moderate success. In this study, (i) we focused on the anatomy of the fruitlets in the resistant "MD-2" and susceptible "Queen" pineapple cultivars; (ii) we identified the key role of the carpel margin in the infection process; (iii) we identified the key role of the sinuous layer of thick-walled cells in the inhibition of  ; and (iv) we linked the anatomy of the fruitlets with the phenolic content of cell walls. The fruitlet anatomy of the two cultivars was studied using X-ray, fluorescence, and multiphoton microscopy. Sepals and bracts were not perfectly fused with each other, allowing the pathogen to penetrate the fruit even after flowering. In fact, the fungi were found in the blossom cups of both cultivars but only became pathogenic in the flesh of the "Queen" pineapple fruit under natural conditions. The outer layer of the "MD-2" cavity was continuous with thick cell walls composed of ferulic and coumaric . The cell walls of the "Queen" blossom cup were less lignified at the extremities, and the outer layer was interspersed with cracks. The carpel margins were fused broadly in the "MD-2" pineapple, in contrast to the "Queen" pineapple. This blemish allows the fungus to penetrate deeper into the susceptible cultivar. In pineapple fruitlets, the hyphae of  mainly progressed directly between cell walls into the parenchyma but never reached the vascular region. A layer of thick-walled cells, in the case of the resistant cultivar, stopped the , which were probably the infralocular septal nectaries. Anatomical and histochemical observations coupled with spectral analysis of the hypodermis suggested the role of lignin deposition in the resistance to . The major phenolics bound to the cell walls were coumaric and ferulic  and were found in higher amounts in the resistant cultivar postinoculation. The combination of fruitlet anatomy and lignification plays a role in the mechanism of host resistance to fruitlet core rot.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589309>Salmonella adapts to plants and their environment during  of tomatoes.</a></h1><p>Humans and animals are considered typical hosts for Salmonella, however, also plants can be colonized. Tomatoes were linked to salmonellosis outbreaks already on several occasions. The aim of this study was, therefore, to establish a comprehensive view on the interaction between Salmonella enterica and tomatoes, and to test the hypothesis that  of plants is an interactive process. We assessed the persistence of Salmonella in agricultural soil, the  pattern in and on tomatoes, as well as the reciprocal responses of tomatoes to different Salmonella strains and Salmonella to root exudates and tomato-related media. This study revealed that Salmonella can persist in the soil and inside the tomato plant. Additionally, we show that Salmonella strains have particular  pattern, although the persistence inside the plant differs between the tested strains. Furthermore, the transcriptome response of tomato showed an up-regulation of several defense-related genes. Salmonella transcriptome analysis in response to the plant-based media showed differentially regulated genes related to amino  and fatty  synthesis and stress response, while the response to root exudates revealed regulation of the glyoxylate cycle. Our results indicate that both organisms actively engage in the interaction and that Salmonella adapts to the plant environment.© FEMS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059877>Invasion of Rosa rugosa induced changes in soil nutrients and microbial communities of coastal sand dunes.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of R. rugosa invasion on soil physicochemical and microbial properties of coastal sand dunes. The study was performed at 25 paired invaded-native plots along the Hel Peninsula at the coast of the Baltic Sea. A number of soil physicochemical and microbial parameters were measured, namely organic matter layer thickness, pH, electrical conductivity, organic C, total Ca, N, Na, P, N-NH, N-NO and P-PO concentrations, phospholipid and neutral fatty  (PLFA, NLFA) markers of total microbial, bacterial, fungal biomass and microbial community structure, as well as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore and species numbers, and the degree of AMF root . Since potential alterations in soil parameters induced by R. rugosa may be related to large amounts of secondary metabolites provided to the soil with litter or root exudates, total phenolic concentration in senescing tissues of R. rugosa and native species was compared. Rosa rugosa invasion was associated with increased organic C, total N and P-PO concentrations in mineral soil relative to native vegetation. Organic matter layer under R. rugosa was thicker, had higher pH and Ca concentration. Rosa rugosa invasion was associated with reduced total microbial, bacterial and G+ bacterial biomass and increased AMF biomass markers (16:1ω5 NLFA and 16:1ω5 NLFA/PLFA), and changes in microbial community structure in mineral soil. The reduction in total and bacterial biomass under R. rugosa might have been related to the production of secondary metabolites as total phenolic concentration was approx. 5 times higher in senescing tissues of R. rugosa than in native vegetation. The observed increase in element concentrations and alterations in microbial community structure suggest that invasion of R. rugosa may threaten nutrient-poor habitats of coastal dunes. Changes in the soil environment may hinder restoration of these valuable habitats after invader removal.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the interaction of maize root exudates and  of the strain S3-1 has not yet been investigated. In our study, strain S3-1 effectively colonized both rhizosphere soil and root tissue. Collected maize root exudates significantly induced the chemotaxis, cluster movement, and biofilm formation of strain S3-1, showing increases of 1.43, 1.6, and 2.08 times, respectively, compared with the control. In addition, the components of root exudates (organic : citric , malic , and oxalic ; amino : glycine, proline and phenylalanine; sugars: glucose, fructose, and sucrose) were tested. Each of these compounds could induce chemotactic response, swarming motility, and biofilm formation significantly. The strongest chemotactic response and swarming motility were found when malic  was applied, but maximal ability of biofilm formation was stimulated by proline. Furthermore, we found that these compounds of root exudates stimulated the population of S3-1 adhering to the maize root surface, especially in the presence of malic .

Here, we have evaluated riboflavin (B2 vitamin) production by five  strains isolated from , a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from north-western Argentina and their isogenic riboflavin-overproducing derivatives previously selected using roseoflavin. A direct fluorescence spectroscopic detection method to quantify riboflavin production in bacterial culture supernatants has been tested. Comparison of the efficiency for riboflavin fluorescence quantification with and without prior HPLC fractionation showed that the developed method is a rapid and easy test for selection of B2 vitamin-producing strains. In addition, it can be used for quantitative detection of the vitamin production in real time during bacterial growth. On the basis of this and previous analyses, the  M5MA1-B2 riboflavin overproducer was selected for  and  studies after being fluorescently labeled by transfer of the pRCR12 plasmid, which encodes the mCherry protein. The labeling did not affect negatively the growth, the riboflavin production nor the adhesion of the strain to Caco-2 cells. Thus,  M5MA1-B2[pRCR12] was evaluated for its survival under digestive tract stresses in the presence of microbiota in the dynamic multistage BFBL gut model and in a murine model. After exposure to both models, M5MA1-B2[pRCR12] could be recovered and detected by the pink color of the colonies. The results indicated a satisfactory resistance of the strain to gastric and intestinal stress conditions but a low  capability observed both  and .

AG may reflect the significant deficiencies of some major nutrients including riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, vitamin B12, folic , iron, zinc, and vitamin E. Moreover, protein-calorie malnutrition, candidiasis, Helicobacter pylori , xerostomia, and diabetes mellitus are also the etiologies of AG.

Moreover, GPCA-positive AG patients tended to have relatively higher frequencies of hemoglobin, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies and hyperhomocysteinemia than GPCA-negative AG patients. Supplementations with vitamin BC capsules plus corresponding deficient hematinics for those AG patients with hematinic deficiencies can achieve complete remission of oral symptoms and AG in some AG patients.

Fusobacterium gastrosuis is highly abundant in the gastric microbiota of H. suis-infected pigs and it was hypothesized that this micro-organism could play a role in the development of gastric ulceration. The aim of this study was to obtain further insights in the influence of a naturally acquired H. suis infection on the microbiota of the non-glandular part of the porcine stomach and in the pathogenic potential of F. gastrosuis. Infection with H. suis influenced the relative abundance of several taxa at phylum, family, genus and species level. H. suis-infected pigs showed a significantly higher  rate of F. gastrosuis in the non-glandular gastric region compared to non-infected pigs. In vitro, viable F. gastrosuis strains as well as their lysate induced death of both gastric and oesophageal epithelial cell lines. These gastric cell death inducing bacterial components were heat-labile. Genomic analysis revealed that genes are present in the F. gastrosuis genome with sequence similarity to genes described in other Fusobacterium spp. that encode factors involved in adhesion, invasion and induction of cell death as well as in immune evasion. We hypothesize that, in a gastric environment altered by H. suis,  and invasion of the non-glandular porcine stomach region and production of epithelial cell death inducing metabolites by F. gastrosuis, play a role in gastric ulceration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257773>[Soil microbial community characteristics in degraded karst tiankeng invaded by Eupatorium adenophorum.]</a></h1><p>After invading the grand negative landform karst degraded tiankeng, Eupatorium adenophorum will affect the plant diversity, community succession and natural ecological restoration of degraded tiankeng by changing soil microbial community. Taking the degraded tiankeng "Bajiaxiantang" as the research area, the soil around E. adenophorum roots in different habitats was selected to explore the microbial community characteristics of E. adenophorum roots using the Biolog-ECO micro-plate method. The results showed that the invasion degree of E. adenophorum was in order of pit slope shrub-grassland > pit bottom grassland > pit slope forest > pit head shrub-grassland. The characteristics of E. adenophorum varied among different habitats due to habitat heterogeneity.

In this work, findings on the structural and functional characterization of CMP-N-acetylneuraminate synthetase (CMAS), a key enzyme in the incorporation pathway, from Vibrio cholerae are reported. CMAS catalyzes the synthesis of CMP-sialic  by utilizing CTP and sialic . Crystal structures of the apo and the CDP-bound forms of the enzyme were determined, which allowed the identification of the metal cofactor Mg in the active site interacting with CDP and the invariant Asp215 residue. While open and closed structural forms of the enzyme from eukaryotic and other bacterial species have already been characterized, a partially closed structure of V. cholerae CMAS (VcCMAS) observed upon CDP binding, representing an intermediate state, is reported here. The kinetic data suggest that VcCMAS is capable of activating the two most common sialic  derivatives, Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc. Amino- sequence and structural comparison of the active site of VcCMAS with those of eukaryotic and other bacterial counterparts reveal a diverse hydrophobic pocket that interacts with the C5 substituents of sialic .

In this study, we tested the asymbiotic sporulation of Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198 and further investigated the influences of abscisic  (ABA), the exudates, and volatiles of tomato hairy roots on asymbiotic or pre-symbiotic sporulation in vitro. Results indicated that mother spores asymbiotically and pre-symbiotically produced daughter spores singly or in pairs. Compared with symbiotically produced spores, pre-symbiotically produced spores were significantly smaller (43.1 μm vs. 89.2 μm in diameter). Exogenous ABA applied to mother spores significantly increased the number of daughter spores, and root volatiles also significantly promoted pre-symbiotic sporulation. Our results provide the first evidence that exogenous ABA can promote AM fungal asymbiotic and pre-symbiotic sporulation, which highlights the potential role of phytohormones in AM fungal propagation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649634>Yeasts of Burden: Exploring the Mycobiome-Bacteriome of the Piglet GI Tract.</a></h1><p>Interactions between the bacteria and fungi in the gut microbiome can result in altered nutrition, pathogenicity of infection, and host development, making them a crucial component in host health. Associations between the mycobiome and bacteriome in the piglet gut, in the context of weaning, remain unknown. Weaning is a time of significant stress, dietary changes, microbial alterations, and a predisposition to infection. The loss of animal health and growth makes potential microbial interventions of interest to the swine industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity and development of the microbiome in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of piglets during weaning, resulting from the dietary and physiological changes. Despite these advances, the role of the mycobiota in piglet health and its contribution to overall microbiome development remains mostly unknown. In this study we investigated the bacteriome and the mycobiome after weaning in the GI tract organs and feces from 35-day old piglets. Following weaning, the α-diversity and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) counts of the bacteriome increased, proximally to distally, from the stomach to the feces along the GI tract, while the mycobiome α-diversity and ASV counts were highest in the porcine stomach. β-diversity analyses show distinct clusters based on organ type in the bacteriome and mycobiome, but dispersion remained relatively constant in the mycobiome between organ/fecal sites. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Epsilonbacteraeota were the most abundant bacterial phyla present in the GI tract and feces based on mean taxonomic composition with high variation of composition found in the stomach. In the mycobiome, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the stomach mycobiome did not demonstrate the same high level of variation observed in the bacteriome. Potential interactions between genera were found in the lower piglet GI bacteriome and mycobiome with positive correlations found between the fungus, , and several bacterial species, including .  demonstrated negative correlations with the short chain fatty -producing bacteria , , and . This study demonstrates the distinct  dynamics between fungi and bacteria in the GI tract and feces of piglets directly following weaning and the potential interactions of these microbes in the porcine gut ecosystem.Copyright © 2019 Arfken, Frey, Ramsay and Summers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406170>Trichoderma harzianum favours the access of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to non-host Brassicaceae roots and increases plant productivity.</a></h1><p>The family Brassicaceae includes plants that are non-host for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) such as the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) and the economically important crop plant Brassica napus (rapeseed). It is well known that Trichoderma species have the ability to colonize the rhizosphere of Brassicaceae plants, promoting growth and development as well as stimulating systemic defenses. The aim of the present work is to ascertain that Brassicaceae plants increase productivity when AMF and Trichoderma are combinedly applied, and how such an effect can be ruled. This simultaneous application of a Trichoderma harzianum biocontrol strain and an AMF formulation produces a significant increase in the  by Trichoderma and the presence of AMF in arabidopsis and rapeseed roots, such  accompanied by improved productivity in both Brassicaceae species.

Because Nicotiana attenuata plants do not respond to herbivory-elicited volatiles from neighbours, we used this ecological model system to evaluate if CMNs function in interplant transmission of herbivory-elicited responses. A mesocosm system was designed to establish and remove CMNs linking N. attenuata plants to examine the herbivory-elicited metabolic and hormone responses in CMNs-connected "receiver" plants after the elicitation of "donor" plants by wounding (W) treated with Manduca sexta larval oral secretions (OS). AMF  increased constitutive jasmonate (JA and JA-Ile) levels in N. attenuata roots but did not affect well-characterized JAs-regulated defensive metabolites in systemic leaves. Interestingly, larger JAs bursts, and higher levels of several amino  and particular sectors of hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycoside metabolism were elevated in the leaves of W + OS-elicited "receivers" with CMN connections with "donors" that had been W + OS-elicited 6 hr previously. Our results demonstrate that AMF  alone does not enhance systemic defence responses but that sectors of systemic responses in leaves can be primed by CMNs, suggesting that CMNs can transmit and even filter defence signalling among connected plants.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070991>A Phosphate-Dependent Requirement for Transcription Factors IPD3 and IPD3L During Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis in .</a></h1><p>During arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, activation of a symbiosis signaling pathway induces gene expression necessary for accommodation of AM fungi.

We conducted a pilot study to determine the prevalence of GBS among pregnant women in Amman, Jordan, where GBS testing is not routine. We also explored GBS serotypes and the performance of a rapid GBS antigen diagnostic test.We collected vaginal-rectal swabs from women who presented for labor and delivery at Al-Bashir Hospital. Three methods were used to identify GBS: Strep B Rapid Test (Creative Diagnostics), blood agar media (Remel) with confirmed with BBL Streptocard  latex test (Becton Dickinson), and CHROMagar StrepB (Remel). Results were read by a senior microbiologist. We defined our gold standard for GBS-positive as a positive blood agar culture confirmed by latex agglutination and positive CHROMagar. PCR testing determined serotype information. Demographic and clinical data were also collected.In April and May 2015, 200 women were enrolled with a median age of 27 years (IQR: 23-32); 89.0% were Jordanian nationals and 71.9% completed secondary school. Median gestational age was 38 weeks (IQR: 37-40); most women reported prenatal care (median 9 visits; IQR: 8-12). Median parity was 2 births (IQR: 1-3). Pre-pregnancy median BMI was 24.1 (IQR: 21.5-28.0) and 14.5% reported an underlying medical condition. Obstetric complications included gestational hypertension (9.5%), gestational diabetes (6.0%), and UTI (53.5%), of which 84.5% reported treatment. Overall, 39 (19.5%) of women were GBS-positive on blood agar media and CHROMagar, while 67 (33.5%) were positive by rapid test (36% sensitivity, 67% specificity). Serotype information was available for 25 (64%) isolates: III (48%), Ia (24%), II (20%), and V (8%). No demographic or clinical differences were noted between GBS+ and GBS-negative women.Nearly one in five women presenting for labor in Jordan was colonized with GBS, with serotype group III as the most common. The rapid GBS antigen diagnostic had low sensitivity and specificity. These results support expanded research in the region, including defining GBS resistance patterns, serotyping information, and risk factors. It also emphasizes the need for routine GBS testing and improved rapid GBS diagnostics for developing world settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31233555>Recognition of specific sialoglycan structures by oral streptococci impacts the severity of endocardial infection.</a></h1><p>Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis are primary colonizers of the tooth surface. Although generally non-pathogenic in the oral environment, they are a frequent cause of infective endocarditis. Both streptococcal species express a serine-rich repeat surface adhesin that mediates attachment to sialylated glycans on mucin-like glycoproteins, but the specific sialoglycan structures recognized can vary from strain to strain. Previous studies have shown that sialoglycan binding is clearly important for aortic valve infections caused by some S. gordonii, but this process did not contribute to the virulence of a strain of S. sanguinis. However, these streptococci can bind to different subsets of sialoglycan structures. Here we generated isogenic strains of S. gordonii that differ only in the type and range of sialoglycan structures to which they adhere and examined whether this rendered them more or less virulent in a rat model of endocarditis. The findings indicate that the recognition of specific sialoglycans can either enhance or diminish pathogenicity. Binding to sialyllactosamine reduces the initial  of mechanically-damaged aortic valves, whereas binding to the closely-related trisaccharide sialyl T-antigen promotes higher bacterial densities in valve tissue 72 hours later. A surprising finding was that the initial attachment of streptococci to aortic valves was inversely proportional to the affinity of each strain for platelets, suggesting that binding to platelets circulating in the blood may divert bacteria away from the endocardial surface. Importantly, we found that human and rat platelet GPIbα (the major receptor for S. gordonii and S. sanguinis on platelets) display similar O-glycan structures, comprised mainly of a di-sialylated core 2 hexasaccharide, although the rat GPIbα has a more heterogenous composition of modified sialic . The combined results suggest that streptococcal interaction with a minor O-glycan on GPIbα may be more important than the over-all affinity for GPIbα for pathogenic effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147520>A key metabolic gene for recurrent freshwater  and radiation in fishes.</a></h1><p> of new ecological niches has triggered large adaptive radiations.

The molecular mechanisms controlling the early stage of   in the root remain unknown. Aiming to better understand the mechanism of the establishment of  infection in root, we established four stages in the early interaction of the pathogen with  roots and determined the transcriptional profiles of these stages of infection. A total 2,698 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes during the initial 96 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring after pathogen-triggered root-hair development observed. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated sequential activation of multiple hormone signaling cascades, including abscisic  (ABA), auxin, jasmonic , and ethylene. Simultaneous impairment of ABA receptor genes promoted plant wilting symptoms after  infection but did not affect primary root growth inhibition or root-hair and lateral root formation caused by . This indicated that ABA signaling positively regulates root defense to . Moreover, transcriptional changes of genes involved in primary root, lateral root, and root-hair formation exhibited high temporal dynamics upon infection.

Because of the scanty information regarding the nasal carriage sate of MRSA in the west of Iran, the purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of CA-MRSA in Sanandaj city.Swabs collected from anterior nares of 600 volunteers were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. The isolates were further investigated for methicillin resistance by using the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, followed by PCR-amplification of the mecA gene. SCCmec types and the presence of the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (pvl) encoding genes were determined through PCR. Finally, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the agar diffusion method.Nasal screening identified 181 S. aureus, of which 55 isolates were MRSA. SCCmec types IV and V were detected in MRSA at frequencies of 80 and 20%, respectively. The overall frequency of pvl genes among the MRSA isolates was 14.54%. MRSA isolates were highly susceptible (98.18%) to mupirocin, gentamicin, and fusidic .The high prevalence of CA-MRSA carriage in the population could pose a serious public health concern for the region.

The analysis of pili structural proteins involved in bacterial adherence to host cells and related to various types of infections was also performed. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to amplify the genes encoding the 67-72p protein and three pili structural proteins (SpaC, SpaI, SapD) and the products obtained were sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of the particular genes were translated into amino  sequences, which were then matched among all the tested strains using bioinformatics tools. In the last step, the affinity of the tested proteins to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II, and linear B-cell epitopes was analyzed. The variations in the nucleotide sequence of the 67-72p protein and pili structural proteins among  strains isolated from various infections were noted. A transposition of the insertion sequence within the gene encoding the SpaC pili structural proteins was also detected. In addition, the bioinformatics analyses enabled the identification of epitopes for B-cells and T-cells in the conserved regions of the proteins, thus, demonstrating that these proteins could be used as antigens in the potential vaccine development.

S. aureus strains isolated from patients with chronic skin  and intermittent infection were used to determine the staphylococcal genotypes or phenotypes associated with adaptation to human skin. We demonstrate that polymorphisms in metabolic genes, particularly those involved in the tricarboxylic  cycle, the fumarate-succinate axis, and the generation of terminal electron transporters, are unexpectedly common. These skin-adapted strains activated glycolysis and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-18 release from keratinocytes and promoted dermatopathology equivalent to a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300 control in a murine model of infection. However, in contrast to USA300, a skin-adapted isolate failed to generate protection from a secondary infectious challenge.

Commercial practices in chicken production may alter or delay microbial  by pioneer colonizing bacteria that can have an impact on the development and maturation of the GIT and intestinal microflora. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of apathogenic Gram-negative isolates or lactic  bacteria (LAB) as pioneer colonizers on the microbiome at the day of hatch (DOH) and evaluate the influence through 10 D of age on ceca. At 18 embryonic days (E), the amnion of embryos was inoculated with either saline (S), approximately 102 CFU of LAB (L), Citrobacter freundii (C), or Citrobacter species (C2). Once DNA was isolated from mucosal and digesta contents, samples underwent 2 × 300 paired-end Illumina MiSeq library preparation for microbiome analysis. An increased abundance of Lactobacillaceae family and Lactobacillus genus was observed in the L group at DOH (P < 0.05), whereas the abundance of Enterococcaceae and Enterococcus was numerically decreased. While Lactobacillus salivarius was one of the pioneer colonizers in the L group at 18E, the population decreased by 10 D (39.59 to 0.09%) and replaced with a population of undefined Lactobacillus (10.36%) and Lactobacillus reuteri (3.63%). Results suggest that L treatment may have accelerated a mature microbiota. Enterobacteriaceae was the dominant family (57.44%) in C group at DOH (P < 0.05). The C2 group only showed some abundance of the C2 species (7.92%) at DOH but had the highest overall abundance of undefined Lactobacillus in the ceca by 10 D (25.28%).

However, common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which is the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa), has significant potential as a genetic source of resistance to M. oryzae. Recent studies have shown that the domestication of rice has altered its relationship to symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizae. A comparative response of wild and domestic rice inhabited by mycorrhizae to infection by M. oryzae has not been documented.In the current study, roots of wild and cultivated rice colonized with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (AMF) Rhizoglomus intraradices were used to compare the transcriptomic responses of the two species to infection by M. oryzae. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the  of wild and cultivated rice with R. intraradices improved the resistance of both genotypes to M. oryzae. Wild AM rice, however, was more resistant to M. oryzae than the cultivated AM rice, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots of wild rice. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the mechanisms regulating the responses of wild and cultivated AM rice to M. oryzae invasion were significantly different. The expression of a greater number of genes was changed in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to the pathogen. Both wild and cultivated AM rice exhibited a shared response to M. oryzae which included genes related to the auxin and salicylic  pathways; all of these play important roles in pathogenesis-related protein synthesis. In wild AM rice, secondary metabolic and biotic stress-related analyses indicated that the jasmonic  synthesis-related α-linolenic  pathway, the phenolic and terpenoid pathways, as well as the phenolic and terpenoid syntheses-related mevalonate (MVA) pathway were more affected by the pathogen. Genes related to these pathways were more significantly enriched in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to M. oryzae. On the other hand, genes associated with the 'brassinosteroid biosynthesis' were more enriched in cultivated AM rice.The AMF R. intraradices-colonized rice plants exhibited greater resistance to M. oryzae than non-AMF-colonized plants. The findings of the current study demonstrate the potential effects of crop domestication on the benefits received by the host via root  with AMF(s), and provide new information on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, results of this study can also help develop guidelines for the applications of AMF(s) when planting rice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601882>Microbial metabolite deoxycholic  controls Clostridium perfringens-induced chicken necrotic enteritis through attenuating inflammatory cyclooxygenase signaling.</a></h1><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics under consumer preferences and regulatory pressures. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile  deoxycholic  (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal . Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596574>Antimicrobial Peptide-Conjugated Hierarchical Antifouling Polymer Brushes for Functionalized Catheter Surfaces.</a></h1><p>Catheter-related infection is a great challenge to modern medicine, which causes significant economic burden and increases patient morbidity. Hence, there is a great requirement for functionalized surfaces with inherently antibacterial properties and biocompatibility that prevent bacterial  and attachment of blood cells. Herein, we developed a strategy for constructing polymer brushes with hierarchical architecture on polyurethane (PU) via surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Surface-functionalized PU (PU-DMH) was readily prepared, which comprised of poly(3-[dimethyl-[2-(2-methylprop-2-enoyloxy)ethyl]azaniumyl]propane-1-sulfonate) (PDMAPS) brushes as the lower layer and antimicrobial peptide-conjugated poly(methacrylic ) (PMAA) brushes as the upper layer. The PU-DMH surface showed excellent bactericidal property against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and could prevent accumulation of bacterial debris on surfaces. Simultaneously, the PU-DMH samples possessed good hemocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the integrated antifouling and bactericidal properties of PU-DMH under hydrodynamic conditions were confirmed by an in vitro circulating model. The functionalized surface possessed persistent antifouling and bactericidal performances both under static and hydrodynamic conditions. The microbiological and histological results of animal experiments also verified the in vivo anti-infection performance.

Stream mesocosms were used to expose naturally colonized benthic communities to a gradient of ferric Fe (0-15 mg/L) for 14 days to estimate the effects of Fe precipitates on primary production, larval and emerging adult aquatic insects, and the macroinvertebrate community structure. Community composition was significantly altered at concentrations near or below the US Environmental Protection Agency chronic Fe criterion (1.0 mg/L). Iron exposure significantly decreased larval and emerging adult abundances of Baetidae (mayfly) and Chironomidae (Diptera); however, while Simuliidae (Diptera) larvae were not reduced by the Fe treatments, abundance of emerged adults significantly decreased. Iron substantially decreased the  biomass of green algae and diatoms, with estimated EC values well below the Fe criterion. In contrast, cyanobacteria were stimulated with increasing Fe concentration. By integrating environmentally realistic exposure conditions to native benthic communities that have complex structural and functional responses, the ability to predict the effects of Fe in the field is improved. Traditional toxicity testing methodologies were not developed to evaluate indirect effects of contaminants, and modernized approaches such as community mesocosm experiments better characterize and predict responses in aquatic ecosystems outside the laboratory. Therefore, the development of water quality standards would benefit by including mesocosm testing results.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591555>Escherichia coli limits Salmonella Typhimurium infections after diet shifts and fat-mediated microbiota perturbation in mice.</a></h1><p>The microbiota confers  resistance, which blocks Salmonella gut .

Both E. coli and Salmonella show much higher bile resistance than the microbiota. Correspondingly, competitive E. coli can be protective in the fat-challenged gut. Diet shifts and fat-elicited bile promote S. Typhimurium gut infections in mice lacking E. coli in their microbiota.

Compared to non-stressed culture, 30% of the E. faecalis genes were differentially expressed. The transcriptome analysis reveals common but also specific responses, depending on stresses encountered: thus, urine exposure has the most important impact, and the highest number of genes with modified expression is involved in transport and metabolism. The results also pinpoint many stress-related sRNA or intergenic regions not yet characterized. This study identified the general stress stimulon related to infection: when the commensal bacterium initiates its response to stress related to infection, it increases its ability to survive to rough conditions for , rather than promoting expression of virulence factors, and becomes this opportunistic pathogen that thrives in hospital settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316477>Probiotic Properties of Lactic  Bacteria Isolated From Neera: A Naturally Fermenting Coconut Palm Nectar.</a></h1><p>Probiotic bacteria were isolated from different traditional fermented foods as there are several such foods that are not well explored for their probiotic activities. Hence, the present study was conducted to find the potential of lactic  bacteria (LAB) as probiotics that were isolated from the sap extract of the coconut palm inflorescence - Neera, which is a naturally fermented drink consumed in various regions of India. A total of 75 isolates were selected from the Neera samples collected aseptically in the early morning (before sunrise). These isolates were initially screened for cultural, microscopic, and biochemical characteristics. The initial screening yielded 40 Gram-positive, catalase-negative isolates that were further subjected to  - bile tolerance with resistance to phenol. Among 40 isolates, 16 survived screening using analysis of cell surface hydrophobicity, auto aggregation with adhesion to epithelial cells, and gastric-pancreatic digestion for gastrointestinal . The isolates were also assessed for antimicrobial, antibiotic sensitivity, and anti-oxidative potential. The safety of these isolates was evaluated by their hemolytic and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activities. Based on these results, seven isolates with the best probiotic attributes were selected and presented in this study. These LAB isolates, with 51.91-70.34% survival at low pH, proved their resistance to gastric conditions. The cell surface hydrophobicity of 50.32-77.8% and auto aggregation of 51.02-78.95% represented the adhesion properties of these isolates. All the seven isolates exhibited good antibacterial and antifungal activity, showing hydroxyl-scavenging activity of 32.86-77.87%. The results proved that LAB isolated from Neera exhibited promising probiotic properties and seem favorable for use in functional fermented foods as preservatives.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354650>The Nuclear-Localized RxLR Effector PvAvh74 From  Induces Cell Death and Immunity Responses in .</a></h1><p>Downy mildew is one of the most serious diseases of grapevine ( spp). The causal agent of grapevine downy mildew, , is an obligate biotrophic oomycete. Although oomycete pathogens such as  are known to secrete RxLR effectors to manipulate host immunity, there have been few studies of the associated mechanisms by which these may act. Here, we show that a candidate  RxLR effector, PvAvh74, induces cell death in  leaves. Using agroinfiltration, we found that nuclear localization, two putative -glycosylation sites, and 427 amino  of the PvAvh74 carboxyl terminus were necessary for cell-death-inducing activity. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we found that PvAvh74-induced cell death in  requires EDS1, NDR1, SGT1, RAR1, and HSP90, but not BAK1. The MAPK cascade components MEK2, WIPK, and SIPK were also involved in PvAvh74-induced cell death in . Transient expression of PvAvh74 could suppress   of , which suggests that PvAvh74 elicits plant immune responses. Suppression of   also was dependent on nuclear localization of PvAvh74. Additionally, PvAvh74-triggered cell death could be suppressed by another effector, PvAvh8, from the same isolate. This work provides a framework to further investigate the interactions of PvAvh74 and other RxLR effectors with host immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089309>Antiseptic effect of natural teat dip containing lactic  against mastitis-causing .</a></h1><p>This study aimed to estimate the enumeration of total bacteria and coliform on teat skin from dairy cows and evaluate the efficacy of the natural rice gel containing 5% v/v lactic  (NGL) against  standard and field strains isolated from bovine teat skin.A total of 100 bacterial teat skin samples (25 cows) were collected from dairy cows in smallholder farm. The cows were housed in freestall barns. The  of total bacteria and  on teat skin was measured by 3M Petrifilm method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of lactic  were evaluated for reference strain of  ATCC 25922 and two field strains of . The natural teat sanitizer was formulated using 5% NGL with modified rice gel.  antiseptic efficacy of 5% NGL was determined by time-kill kinetic assay.  morphology after exposure with 5% NGL was examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM).The total bacteria and coliform counts from bovine teat skin were 2.11×10 and 1.54×10 colony-forming units/ml, respectively. The MIC and MBC of lactic  on the tested bacteria were 0.5% v/v. The natural teat dip was successfully prepared with minimum change in consistency after 1 year of storage at 4°C. The reduction rate of 5% NGL on  ATCC 25922 and field strain showed 32.77% and 27.58%, respectively. An appearance under SEM of non-viable  after being incubated with 5% NGL clearly showed atypical form and rough surface cell membrane.The rice gel containing 5% v/v lactic  is a promising preparation as a natural teat antiseptic for reducing bacteria on teat skin.

Sparse data support this recommendation.Patients with new-onset diarrhea (≥3 bowel movements in any 24 hour period in the 48 hours before stool collection) and a positive stool C. difficile nucleic  amplification test (NAAT) were enrolled. Laxative use within 48 hours prior to stool testing, severity of illness (defined by four distinct scoring methods), and clinical outcomes were recorded.209 patients with CDI were studied, 65 of whom had received laxatives. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients meeting severe CDI criteria by four severity scoring methods, in patients receiving versus not receiving laxatives (66.2% vs 56.3%, respectively, p = 0.224) by IDSA-SHEA, the primary scoring system. Similar rates of serious outcomes attributable to CDI, including death, ICU admission, and colectomy, were observed in the laxative and no laxative groups.Our study found similar rates of severe CDI and serious CDI-attributable clinical outcomes in CDI-diagnosed patients who did or did not receive laxatives. Precluding recent laxative users from CDI testing, as proposed by the IDSA-SHEA guideline, carries a potential for harm due to delayed diagnosis and treatment.© The Author(s) 2019.

In humans, LR reduces crying time in breastfed infants with colic, modifies severity in infants with acute diarrheal illnesses, and improves pain in children with functional bowel disorders. In healthy breastfed newborns with evolving microbial , it is unclear if early administration of LR can modulate gut microbiota and their metabolites in such a way as to promote homeostasis. We gavaged LR (10 CFU/day, daily) to C57BL/6J mice at age of day 8 for 2 weeks. Both male and female mice were investigated in these experiments. We found that feeding LR did not affect clinical phenotype or inflammatory biomarkers in plasma and stool, but LR increased the proportion of Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestine. LR also increased bacterial diversity and the relative abundance of p_Firmicutes, , , and genera  and , while decreasing the relative abundance of p_Bacteriodetes, , , and genera ,   and . Finally, LR exerted a major impact on the plasma metabolome, upregulating amino  metabolites formed via the urea, tricarboxylic , and methionine cycles and increasing tryptophan metabolism. In conclusion, early oral administration of LR to healthy breastfed mice led to microbial and metabolic changes which could be beneficial to general health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521311>Biofunctional catheter coatings based on chitosan-fatty  derivatives.</a></h1><p>Multifunctional and biofunctional coatings for medical devices are an attractive strategy towards tailoring the interactions of the device with the body, thereby influencing the host response, and the susceptibility to microbial . Here we describe the development of a coating process to yield amphiphilic, lubricious coatings, resistant to bacterial , based on chitosan. Chitosan-fatty  derivatives were obtained by simultaneous N,O-acylation of chitosan with either linoleic, α-linolenic, or dilinoleic . Chemical characterization of new materials was carried out using H NMR, FTIR, and XPS. Surface properties of coated polyester samples were studied using SEM and contact angle measurements, which indicated that the incorporation of hydrophobic constituents into chitosan macromolecules led to a decrease of both surface roughness and water contact angle. Importantly, tribological testing demonstrated that these new coatings decrease the coefficient of friction due to the self-organization of fatty  (from 0.53 for the neat chitosan to 0.35 for chitosan-fatty  derivative). Meanwhile, preliminary bacterial  tests indicated significant-over 80%-reduction in E. coli  following coating with chitosan-linoleic and chitosan-α-linolenic derivatives. Finally, cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility studies confirmed that all amphiphilic chitosan-fatty  derivatives were non-toxic and non-hemolytic. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of the developed coating strategy, particularly the chitosan-linoleic and chitosan-α-linolenic  derivatives, for applications as biofunctional catheter coatings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, most available oral vaccines comprises of live attenuated pathogens as oppose to peptide-based vaccines due to its low bioavailability within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Over the years, probiotic-based peptide delivery vehicles comprising of lactic  bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis has emerged as an interesting alternative due to its generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, a fully sequenced genome, transient gut  time, and is an efficient cellular factory for heterologous protein production. However, its survivability through the GI tract is low, thus better delivery approaches are being explored to improve its bioavailability. In this study, we employ the incorporation of a double coated mucoadhesive film consisting of sodium alginate and Lycoat RS 720 film as the inner coat. The formulated film exhibits good mechanical properties of tensile strength and percent elongation for manipulation and handling with an entrapment yield of 93.14±2.74%. The formulated mucoadhesive film is subsequently loaded into gelatin capsules with an outer enteric Eudragit L100-55 coating capable of a pH-dependent breakdown above pH 5.5 to protect against gastric digestion. The final product and unprotected controls were subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestions to assess its survivability. The product demonstrated enhanced protection with an increase of 69.22±0.67% (gastric) and 40.61±8.23% (intestinal) survivability compared to unprotected controls after 6 hours of sequential digestion. This translates to a 3.5 fold increase in overall survivability. Owing to this, the proposed oral delivery system has shown promising potential as a live gastrointestinal vaccine delivery host. Further studies involving in vivo gastrointestinal survivability and mice immunization tests are currently being carried out to assess the efficacy of this novel oral delivery system in comparison to parenteral routes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433298>B cell receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling coordinate to control distinct B-1 responses to both self and the microbiota.</a></h1><p>B-1a cells play an important role in mediating tissue homeostasis and protecting against infections. They are the main producers of 'natural' IgM, spontaneously secreted serum antibodies predominately reactive to self antigens, like phosphatidylcholine (PtC), or antigens expressed by the intestinal microbiota. The mechanisms that regulate the B-1a immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire and their antibody secretion remain poorly understood. Here, we use a novel reporter mouse to demonstrate that production of self- and microbiota-reactive antibodies is linked to BCR signaling in B-1a cells. Moreover, we show that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical for shaping the Ig repertoire of B-1a cells as well as regulating their antibody production. Strikingly, we find that both the  of a microbiota as well as microbial-sensing TLRs are required for anti-microbiota B-1a responses, whereas nucleic- sensing TLRs are required for anti-PtC responses, demonstrating that linked activation of BCR and TLRs controls steady state B-1a responses to both self and microbiota-derived antigens.© 2019, Kreuk et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234790>Dual species transcript profiling during the interaction between banana (Musa acuminata) and the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense.</a></h1><p>Banana wilt disease, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4), is one of the most devastating diseases in banana (Musa spp.). Foc is a soil borne pathogen that causes rot of the roots or wilt of leaves by colonizing the xylem vessels. The dual RNA sequencing is used to simultaneously assess the transcriptomes of pathogen and host. This method greatly helps to understand the responses of pathogen and host to each other and discover the potential pathogenic mechanism.Plantlets of two economically important banana cultivars, Foc TR4 less susceptible cultivar NK and susceptible cultivar BX, were used to research the Foc-banana interaction mechanism. Notably, the infected NK had more significantly up-regulated genes on the respiration machinery including TCA cycle, glyoxylate, glycerol, and glycolysis compared to BX at 27 h post inoculation (hpi). In addition, genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction, starch, sucrose, linolenic  and sphingolipid metabolisms were uniquely more greatly induced in BX than those in NK during the whole infection. Genes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of SA and JA were greatly induced in the infected NK; while auxin and abscisic  metabolisms related genes were strongly stimulated in the infected BX at 27 hpi. Furthermore, most of fungal genes were more highly expressed in the roots of BX than in those of NK. The fungal genes related to pathogenicity, pectin and chitin metabolism, reactive oxygen scavenging played the important roles during the infection of Foc. CCP1 (cytochrome c peroxidase 1) was verified to involve in cellulose utilization, oxidative stress response and pathogenicity of fungus.The transcriptome indicated that NK had much faster defense response against Foc TR4 than BX and the expression levels of fungal genes were higher in BX than those in NK. The metabolisms of carbon, nitrogen, and signal transduction molecular were differentially involved in pathogen infection in BX and NK. Additionally, the putative virulence associated fungal genes involved in , nutrition acquirement and transport provided more insights into the infection process of Foc TR4 in banana roots.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603283>Suppression of abscisic  biosynthesis at the early infection stage of Verticillium longisporum in oilseed rape (Brassica napus).</a></h1><p>Verticillium longisporum infects oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and Arabidopsis thaliana. To investigate the early response of oilseed rape to the fungal infection, we determined transcriptomic changes in oilseed rape roots at 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) by RNA-Seq analysis, in which non-infected roots served as a control. Strikingly, a subset of genes involved in abscisic  (ABA) biosynthesis was found to be down-regulated and the ABA level was accordingly attenuated in 6 dpi oilseed rape as compared with the control. Gene expression analysis revealed that this was mainly attributed to the suppression of BnNCED3-mediated ABA biosynthesis, involving, for example, BnWRKY57. However, this down-regulation of ABA biosynthesis could not be observed in infected Arabidopsis roots. Arabidopsis ABA- defective mutants nced3 and aao3 displayed pronounced tolerance to the fungal infection with delayed and impeded symptom development, even though fungal  was not affected in both mutants. These data suggest that ABA appears to be required for full susceptibility of Arabidopsis to the fungal infection. Furthermore, we found that in both 6 dpi oilseed rape and the Arabidopsis nced3 mutant, the salicylic  (SA) signalling pathway was induced while the jasmonic  (JA)/ethylene (ET) signalling pathway was concomitantly mitigated. Following these data, we conclude that in oilseed rape the V. longisporum infection triggers a host-specific suppression of the NCED3-mediated ABA biosynthesis, consequently increasing plant tolerance to the fungal infection. We believe that this might be part of the virulence strategy of V. longisporum to initiate/establish a long-lasting compatible interaction with oilseed rape (coexistence), which appears to be different from the infection process in Arabidopsis.© 2019 The Authors.

The outbreak strain consisted in an EAEC capable to produce the Shiga toxin (Stx) subtype 2a, a characteristic from enterohemorrhagic  QseBC two-component system detects AI-3/Epi/NE and mediates the chemical signaling between pathogen and mammalian host. This system coordinates a cascade of virulence genes expression in important human enteropathogens. The blocking of QseC of EAEC C227-11 (Stx) strain by -phenyl-4-{[(phenylamino) thioxomethyl]amino}-benzenesulfonamide (also known as LED209)  demonstrated a lower efficiency of . The periplasmic protein VisP, which is related to survival mechanisms in a colitis model of infection, bacterial membrane maintenance, and stress resistance, here presented high levels of expression during the initial infection within the host. Under  stress conditions,  expression levels were differentiated in an Stx-dependent way. Together, these results emphasize the important role of VisP and the histidine kinase sensor QseC in the C227-11 (Stx) outbreak strain for the establishment of the infectious niche process in the C57BL/6 mouse model and of LED209 as a promising antivirulence drug strategy against these enteric pathogens. EAEC is a remarkable etiologic agent of acute and persistent diarrhea worldwide. The isolates harbor specific subsets of virulence genes and their pathogenesis needs to be better understood. Chemical signaling via histidine kinase sensor QseC has been shown as a potential target to elucidate the orchestration of the regulatory cascade of virulence factors.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265468>Proteomic analysis of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex isolates: Correlation of the levels of differentially expressed proteins with in vivo virulence.</a></h1><p>Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis commonly found in Latin America that is caused by distinct species of Paracoccidioides genus: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex (S1, PS2, PS3 and PS4) and Paracoccidioides lutzii. Its pathobiology has been recently explored by different approaches to clarify the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions underpinning PCM. The diversity of clinical forms of this disease has been attributed to both host- and fungus-related factors.For better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of host-fungus interactions, we evaluated in vivo virulence of nine Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex isolates and correlated it to protein expression profiles obtained by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Based on the recovery of viable fungi from mouse organs, the isolates were classified as those having low, moderate, or high virulence. Highly virulent isolates overexpressed proteins related to adhesion process and stress response, probably indicating important roles of those fungal proteins in regulating the  capacity, survival, and ability to escape host immune system reaction. Moreover, highly virulent isolates exhibited enhanced expression of glycolytic pathway enzymes concomitantly with repressed expression of succinyl-CoA ligase beta chain, a protein related to the tricarboxylic  cycle.Our findings may point to the mechanisms used by highly virulent P. brasiliensis isolates to withstand host immune reactions and to adapt to transient iron availability as strategies to survive and overcome stress conditions inside the host.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143198>The Effect of Plant Genotype, Growth Stage, and  Strains on the Efficiency and Durability of Wheat-Induced Resistance by  sp. Strain B2.</a></h1><p>Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria are known as potential biofertilizers and plant-resistance inducers. The current work aims to study the durability of the resistance induced as a response to the inoculation of wheat grains with  sp. strain B2 (PB2) and its influence by plant genotype, growth stage, and  strain (the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch or STB). The results of the plate-counting method showed that PB2 has high potential for wheat-root external  [>10 colony-forming unit (CFU)/g of root], and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis demonstrated its internal root- capacity on all tested cultivars. However, the  seems to be dependent on wheat-growth stage. The durability of PB2-induced resistance (PB2-IR) was tested at the 3-leaf, tillering, and flag-leaf-growth stages. Additionally, the results showed that the PB2-IR is durable and able to protect the flag leaf, the most important leaf layer during grain fill. It conferred a high protection efficiency (55-94%) against four virulent strains of  and over 11 wheat cultivars with different resistance levels to STB. Although, PB2-IR is dependent on  strains, wheat genotypes and growth stages, its efficiency, under field conditions, at protecting the last wheat-leaf layers was not an influence. However, it showed 71-79% of protection and reached 81-94% in association with half of the recommended dose of Cherokee fungicide. This may be explained using laboratory results by its direct impact on  strains in these leaf layers and by the indirect reduction of the inoculum coming from leaves infected during the earlier growth stages. Gene expression results showed that PB2-IR is correlated to upregulation of genes involved in defense and cell rescue and a priming effect in the basal defense, jasmonic  signaling, phenylpropanoids and phytoalexins, and reactive oxygen species gene markers. To conclude, PB2 induces a high and durable resistance against  under controlled and field conditions. The PB2-IR is a pathogen strain and is plant-growth-stage and genotype dependent. These results highlight the importance of taking into consideration these factors so as to avoid losing the effectiveness of induced resistance under field conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555243>Exposure to Bile Leads to the Emergence of Adaptive Signaling Variants in the Opportunistic Pathogen .</a></h1><p>The chronic  of the respiratory tract by the opportunistic pathogen  is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.  has been shown to undergo extensive genomic adaptation facilitating its persistence within the CF lung allowing it to evade the host immune response and outcompete co-colonizing residents of the lung microbiota. However, whilst several studies have described the various mutations that frequently arise in clinical isolates of , the environmental factors governing the emergence of these genetic variants is less well characterized. Gastro-oesophageal reflux has recently emerged as a major co-morbidity in CF and is often associated with the presence of bile  in the lungs most likely by (micro) aspiration. In order to investigate whether bile may select for genetic variants,  was experimentally evolved in artificial sputum medium, a synthetic media resembling environmental conditions found within the CF lung. Pigmented derivatives of  emerged exclusively in the presence of bile. Genome sequencing analysis identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in quorum sensing () and both the pyocyanin () and pyomelanin () biosynthetic pathways. Phenotypic analysis revealed an altered bile response when compared to the ancestral  progenitor strain. While the recovered pigmented derivatives retained the bile mediated suppression of swarming motility and enhanced antibiotic tolerance, the biofilm, and redox responses to bile were abolished in the adapted mutants. Though loss of pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) production in the pigmented isolates was not linked to the altered biofilm response, the loss of redox repression could be explained by defective alkyl-quinolone (AQ) production in the presence of bile. Collectively, these findings suggest that the adaptive variants of  that arise following long term bile exposure enables the emergence of ecologically competitive sub-populations. Altered pigmentation and AQ signaling may contribute to an enhancement in fitness facilitating population survival within a bile positive environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163274>Diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases in Arkhangelsk, Russia.</a></h1><p>Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are -fast bacilli (AFB) that can cause disease in human.

Based on the results, ETA-PLGA can act as a suitable immunogen to stimulate the humoral and cellular immune response. The antibodies raised against ETA-PLGA significantly decreased bacterial titer in the spleens of the immunized mice after challenge with PAO1 strain, compared to the control groups. The encapsulation of PLGA into ETA led to a significantly higher production of INF-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-17A cytokine responses compared to the ETA group.

The 2020 ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover includes within its payload three IR spectrometers in the form of ISEM (Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars), MicrOmega, and Ma-MISS (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies). The use of this technique in the detection and characterization of biosignatures is of great value. Organic materials are often co-deposited in terrestrial evaporites and as such have been proposed as relevant analogs in the search for life on Mars. This study focuses on Ca-sulfates collected from the hypersaline Tírez Lake in Spain. Mid infrared and visible near infrared analysis of soils, salt crusts, and crystals with green and red layering indicative of microbial  of the samples was acquired from across the lake and identified the main mineral to be gypsum with inputs of carbonate and silica. Organic functional groups that could be attributed to amides and carboxylic  were identified as well as chlorophyll; however, due to the strong mineralogical absorptions observed, these were hard to unambiguously discern. Taxonomical assignment demonstrated that the archaeal community within the samples was dominated by the halophilic extremophile Halobacteriaceae while the bacterial community was dominated by the class Nocardiaceae. The results of this research highlight that sulfates on Mars are a mixed blessing, acting as an effective host for organic matter preservation but also a material that masks the presence of organic functional groups when analyzed with spectroscopic tools similar to those due to fly on the 2020 ExoMars rover. A suite of complementary analytical techniques therefore should be used to support the spectral identification of any candidate extraterrestrial biosignatures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244935>CD137 promotes bone metastasis of breast cancer by enhancing the migration and osteoclast differentiation of monocytes/macrophages.</a></h1><p> Bone is one of the most common metastatic sites of breast cancer. CD137 (4-1BB), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is mainly expressed in activated leukocytes. Previous study demonstrates the effect of CD137-CD137L bidirectional signaling pathway on RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. However, the role of CD137 in bone metastasis of breast cancer needs further study.  Stable monocyte/macrophage cell lines with  overexpression and silencing were established. Western blot, real-time PCR, transwell and tartrate-resistant  phosphatase staining were used to detect the regulatory effect of CD137 on migration and osteoclastogenesis of monocytes/macrophages . Spontaneous bone metastasis mouse model was established, bioluminescent images, immunohistochemistry and histology assay were performed to detect the function of CD137 in bone metastasis .  We found that CD137 promotes the migration of monocytes/macrophages to tumor microenvironment by upregulating the expression of Fra1. It also promoted the differentiation of monocytes/macrophages into osteoclasts at the same time, thus providing a favorable microenvironment for the  and growth of breast cancer cells in bone. Based on these findings, a novel F4/80-targeted liposomal nanoparticle encapsulating the anti-CD137 blocking antibody (NP-αCD137 Ab-F4/80) was synthesized. This nanoparticle could inhibit both bone and lung metastases of 4T1 breast cancer cells with high efficacy . In addition, it increased the therapeutic efficacy of Fra1 inhibitor on tumor metastasis.  Taken together, these findings reveal the promotion effect of macrophage/monocyte CD137 on bone metastases and provide a promising therapeutic strategy for metastasis of breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608089>Monitoring of Rice Transcriptional Responses to Contrasted Colonizing Patterns of Phytobeneficial  Reveals a Temporal Shift in JA Systemic Response.</a></h1><p>In the context of plant-pathogen and plant-mutualist interactions, the underlying molecular bases associated with host  have been extensively studied. However, it is not the case for non-mutualistic beneficial interactions or associative symbiosis with plants. Particularly, little is known about the transcriptional regulations associated with the immune tolerance of plants towards beneficial microbes. In this context, the study of the  rice model is very promising to describe the molecular mechanisms involved in associative symbiosis. Indeed, several species of the  () genus can colonize rice tissues and have beneficial effects; particularly, two species have been thoroughly studied:  and . This study aims to compare the interaction of these species with rice and especially to identify common or specific plant responses. Therefore, we analyzed root  of the rice cultivar Nipponbare using DsRed-tagged bacterial strains and produced the transcriptomes of both roots and leaves 7 days after root inoculation. This led us to the identification of a co-expression jasmonic  (JA)-related network exhibiting opposite regulation in response to the two strains in the leaves of inoculated plants. We then monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) the expression of JA-related genes during time course  by each strain. Our results reveal a temporal shift in this JA systemic response, which can be related to different  strategies of both strains.Copyright © 2019 King, Wallner, Rimbault, Barrachina, Klonowska, Moulin and Czernic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445119>In-vitro effect of vaginal lactobacilli against group B Streptococcus.</a></h1><p>Streptococcus agalactiae(GBS) is a leading cause of infection during pregnancy, preterm birth and neonatal infection, with a significant clinical and socio-economic impact. To prevent maternal GBS vaginal , new antibiotic-free approaches, based on lactobacilli probiotics, are advisable. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-GBS activity of 14 vaginal Lactobacillus strains, belonging to different species (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis), isolated from healthy pre-menopausal women. In particular, we performed 'inhibition' experiments, evaluating the ability of both Lactobacillus cells and culture supernatants in reducing Streptococcus viability, after 60 min contact time. First, we demonstrated that the acidic milieu, produced by vaginal lactobacilli metabolism, is crucial in counteracting GBS growth in a pH-dependent manner. Experiments with organic/inorganic  solutions confirmed the strict correlation between pH levels and the anti-GBS activity. GBS was more sensitive to lactic  than to hydrochloric , indicating that the presence of H ions is necessary but not sufficient for the inhibitory activity. Moreover, experiments with Lactobacillus pH-adjusted supernatants led to exclude a direct role in the anti-GBS activity by other bioactive molecules. Second, we found that only a few Lactobacillus strains were able to reduce Streptococcus viability by means of cell pellets. The anti-GBS effect displayed by Lactobacillus cells was related to the their ability to interact and aggregate with Streptococcus cells. We found that the anti-GBS activity was retained after methanol/proteinase K treatment, but lost after lysozyme exposure of Lactobacillus cells. Therefore, we supposed that non-proteinaceous components of Lactobacillus cell wall could be responsible for the anti-GBS activity. In conclusion, we identified specific Lactobacillus strains able to interfere with GBS viability by multiple strategies and we elucidated some of the mechanisms of action. These strains could serve as probiotic formulations for the prevention of GBS vaginal .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Complementation and substitution mutations in LapB and LpxC generally restored the phospholipid and LPS assembly defects for the  mutants.

Here, we investigated the genetic basis for phenotypic variation in larval development in the moor frog Rana arvalis from five regions along a latitudinal gradient from Germany to northern Sweden. We focused on the C/EBP-1 gene, a transcription factor associated with larval development time. Allele frequencies at C/EBP-1 varied strongly among geographical regions. Overall, the distribution of alleles along the gradient was in concordance with the dual post-glacial  routes into Scandinavia, with a large number of alleles exclusively present along the southern  route. Only three of 38 alleles were shared between the routes. Analysis of contemporary selection on C/EBP-1 showed divergent selection among the regions, probably reflecting adaptation to the local environmental conditions, although this was especially strong between southern and northern regions coinciding also with lineages from different  routes. Overall, the C/EBP-1 gene has historically been under purifying selection, but two specific amino  positions showed significant signals of positive selection. These positions showed divergence between southern and northern regions, and we suggest that they are functionally involved in the climatic adaptation of larval development. Using phenotypic data from a common garden experiment, we found evidence for specific C/EBP-1 alleles being correlated with larval development time, suggesting a functional role in adaptation of larval development to large-scale climatic variation.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160397>Flexible Metabolism and Suppression of Latent Enzymes Are Important for  Adaptation to Diverse Environments within the Host.</a></h1><p>Bacterial metabolism is necessary for adaptation to the host microenvironment. Flexible metabolic pathways allow uropathogenic  (UPEC) to harmlessly reside in the human intestinal tract and cause disease upon extraintestinal .  intestinal  requires carbohydrates as a carbon source, while UPEC extraintestinal  requires gluconeogenesis and the tricarboxylic  cycle. UPEC containing disruptions in two irreversible glycolytic steps involving 6-carbon (6-phosphofructokinase; ) and 3-carbon (pyruvate kinase; ) substrates have no fitness defect during urinary tract infection (UTI); however, both reactions are catalyzed by isozymes: 6-phosphofructokinases Pfk1 and Pfk2, encoded by  and , and pyruvate kinases Pyk II and Pyk I, encoded by  and  UPEC strains lacking one or both phosphofructokinase-encoding genes ( and ) and strains lacking one or both pyruvate kinase genes ( and ) were investigated to determine their regulatory roles in carbon flow during glycolysis by examining their fitness during UTI and  growth requirements. Loss of a single phosphofructokinase-encoding gene has no effect on fitness, while the  double mutant outcompeted the parental strain in the bladder. A defect in bladder and kidney  was observed with loss of , while loss of  resulted in a fitness advantage. The  mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type , suggesting that the presence of Pyk II rather than the loss of Pyk I itself is responsible for the fitness defect in the  mutant.

Urinary tract infections are the most frequently diagnosed urologic disease, with uropathogenic  (UPEC) infections placing a significant financial burden on the health care system by generating more than two billion dollars in annual costs. This, in combination with steadily increasing antibiotic resistances to present day treatments, necessitates the discovery of new antimicrobial agents to combat these infections. By broadening our scope beyond the study of virulence properties and investigating bacterial physiology and metabolism, we gain a better understanding of how pathogens use nutrients and compete within host microenvironments, enabling us to cultivate new therapeutics to exploit and target pathogen growth requirements in a specific host environment.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417511>- and Methyl Jasmonate-Induced Resistance to  Through Enhanced Phenylpropanoid Activities in Bread Wheat ( L.).</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of  UBSTH-501- and methyl jasmonate-induced systemic resistance and their integration on the spot blotch pathogen,  through enhanced phenylpropanoid activities in bread wheat ( L.). It was found that the application of MeJA (>100 mg L) inhibits the germination of  spores under controlled laboratory conditions. To assess the effect of MeJA (150 mg L) in combination with the biocontrol agent  UBSTH-501 , a green house experiment was conducted. For this, biocontrol agent  UBSTH-501 was applied as seed treatment, whereas MeJA (150 mg L) was applied 5 days prior to pathogen inoculation. Results indicated that application of MeJA (150 mg L) did not affect the root  of wheat by  UBSTH-501 in the rhizosphere. The combined application of  UBSTH-501 and MeJA also enhanced indole acetic  production in the rhizosphere (4.92 μg g of soil) which in turn helps in plant growth and development. Further, the combined application found to enhance the activities of defense related enzymes  catalase (5.92 EU min g fresh wt.), ascorbate peroxidase [μmol ascorbate oxidized (mg prot) min], phenylalanine ammonia lyase (102.25 μmol cinnamic  h mg fresh wt.) and peroxidase (6.95 Unit mg min fresh wt.) significantly in the plants under treatment which was further confirmed by assessing the transcript level of  and  genes using semi-quantitative PCR approach. The results showed manifold increase in salicylic  (SA) along with enhanced accumulation of total free phenolics, ferulic , caffeic , coumaric , and chlorogenic  in the leaves of the plants treated with the biocontrol agent alone or in combination with MeJA. A significant decrease in the disease severity (17.46%) and area under disease progress curve (630.32) were also observed in the treatments with biocontrol agent and MeJA in combination as compared to  alone treated plant (56.95% and 945.50, respectively). Up-regulation of phenylpropanoid cascades in response to exogenous application of MeJA and the biocontrol agent was observed. It was depicted from the results that PAL is the primary route for lignin production in wheat which reduces cell wall disruption and tissue disintegration and increases suberization and lignification of the plant cell as seen by Scanning Electron microphotographs. These results clearly indicated that exogenous application of MeJA with  inducing JA- and/or SA-dependent defense signaling after pathogen challenge may increase the resistance to spot blotch by stimulating enzymatic activities and the accumulation of phenolic compounds in a cooperative manner. This study apparently provides the evidence of biochemical cross-talk and physiological responses in wheat following MeJA and biocontrol agent treatment during the bio-trophic infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178889>Contribution of Maize Polyamine and Amino  Metabolism Toward Resistance Against  Infection and Aflatoxin Production.</a></h1><p>Polyamines (PAs) are ubiquitous polycations found in plants and other organisms that are essential for growth, development, and resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses. The role of PAs in plant disease resistance depends on the relative abundance of higher PAs [spermidine (Spd), spermine (Spm)] vs. the diamine putrescine (Put) and PA catabolism. With respect to the pathogen, PAs are required to achieve successful pathogenesis of the host. Maize is an important food and feed crop, which is highly susceptible to  infection. Upon infection, the fungus produces carcinogenic aflatoxins and numerous other toxic secondary metabolites that adversely affect human health and crop value worldwide. To evaluate the role of PAs in aflatoxin resistance in maize,  kernel infection assays were performed using maize lines that are susceptible (SC212) or resistant (TZAR102, MI82) to aflatoxin production. Results indicated significant induction of both PA biosynthetic and catabolic genes upon  infection. As compared to the susceptible line, the resistant maize lines showed higher basal expression of PA metabolism genes in mock-inoculated kernels that increased upon fungal infection. In general, increased biosynthesis and conversion of Put to Spd and Spm along with their increased catabolism was evident in the resistant lines vs. the susceptible line SC212. There were higher concentrations of amino  such as glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln) and γ-aminobutyric  (GABA) in SC212. The resistant lines were significantly lower in fungal load and aflatoxin production as compared to the susceptible line. The data presented here demonstrate an important role of PA metabolism in the resistance of maize to   and aflatoxin contamination. These results provide future direction for the manipulation of PA metabolism in susceptible maize genotypes to improve aflatoxin resistance and overall stress tolerance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668625>Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas Suppress Local Root Immune Responses by Gluconic -Mediated Lowering of Environmental pH.</a></h1><p>The root microbiome consists of commensal, pathogenic, and plant-beneficial microbes [1]. Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic  and its derivative 2-keto gluconic . Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic  and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic -mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates  by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, the hydrophilic sugars are anchored to a lipid phosphate carrier (undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P)), yielding membrane intermediates which are translocated to the outer face of the membrane. Finally, the glycan moiety is transferred to a nascent acceptor polymer, releasing the carrier in the "inactive" undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP) form. Thus, C55-P is generated through the dephosphorylation of C55-PP, itself arising from either de novo synthesis or recycling. Two types of integral membrane C55-PP phosphatases were described: BacA enzymes and a sub-group of PAP2 enzymes (type 2 phosphatidic  phosphatases). The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori does not contain BacA homologue but has four membrane PAP2 proteins: LpxE, LpxF, HP0350 and HP0851. Here, we report the physiological role of HP0851, renamed HupA, via multiple and complementary approaches ranging from a detailed biochemical characterization to the assessment of its effect on cell envelope metabolism and microbe-host interactions. HupA displays a dual function as being the main C55-PP pyrophosphatase (UppP) and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate phosphatase (PGPase). Although not essential in vitro, HupA was essential in vivo for stomach . In vitro, the remaining UppP activity was carried out by LpxE in addition to its lipid A 1-phosphate phosphatase activity. Both HupA and LpxE have crucial roles in the biosynthesis of several cell wall polysaccharides and thus constitute potential targets for new therapeutic strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180129>Structural analysis of broiler chicken small intestinal mucin O-glycan modification by Clostridium perfringens.</a></h1><p>Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that is the principal etiological agent of necrotic enteritis (NE) in poultry. The ability of C. perfringens to incite NE depends upon its ability to penetrate the protective mucus barrier within the small intestine, which is largely composed of heavily glycosylated proteins called mucins. Mucins are decorated by N- and O-linked glycans that serve both as a formidable gel-like barrier against invading pathogens and as a rich carbon source for mucolytic bacteria. The composition of avian O-linked glycans is markedly different from mucins in other vertebrates, being enriched in sulfated monosaccharides and N-acetyl-d-neuraminic  (Neu5Ac, sialic ). These modifications increase the overall negative charge of mucins and are believed to impede  by enteric pathogens. The mechanism by which C. perfringens penetrates the poultry intestinal mucus layer during NE is still unknown. However, the CAZome (i.e., the total collection of proteins encoded within a genome active on carbohydrates) of C. perfringens strain CP1 encodes several putative and known enzymes with activities consistent with the modification of mucin. To further investigate this relationship, O-glycans from Gallus gallus domesticus mucus were extracted from the small intestine and characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Chicken mucin monosaccharides included l-fucose (Fuc), d-mannose (Man), d-galactose (Gal), N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc), N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and Neu5Ac (sialic ). Using these monosaccharides as sole carbon sources, we showed that C. perfringens CP1 grew on Neu5Ac, Man, Gal, and GlcNAc but not on Fuc and GalNAc. We also demonstrated C. perfringens grew on different native-state preparations of intestinal mucins and mucus including porcine mucins, chicken mucus, and chicken mucins. Finally, anaerobic incubation of chicken mucin O-glycans with C. perfringens and subsequent analysis of the glycans revealed that there was preferential removal of Neu5Ac. These observations are discussed in the context of the predicted metabolic potential of C. perfringens CP1 and the mucolytic enzymes encoded within its CAZome.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465435>Helicobacter pylori senses bleach (HOCl) as a chemoattractant using a cytosolic chemoreceptor.</a></h1><p>The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori requires a noncanonical cytosolic chemoreceptor transducer-like protein D (TlpD) for efficient  of the mammalian stomach. Here, we reconstituted a complete chemotransduction signaling complex in vitro with TlpD and the chemotaxis (Che) proteins CheW and CheA, enabling quantitative assays for potential chemotaxis ligands. We found that TlpD is selectively sensitive at micromolar concentrations to bleach (hypochlorous , HOCl), a potent antimicrobial produced by neutrophil myeloperoxidase during inflammation. HOCl acts as a chemoattractant by reversibly oxidizing a conserved cysteine within a 3His/1Cys Zn-binding motif in TlpD that inactivates the chemotransduction signaling complex. We found that H. pylori is resistant to killing by millimolar concentrations of HOCl and responds to HOCl in the micromolar range by increasing its smooth-swimming behavior, leading to chemoattraction to HOCl sources. We show related protein domains from Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli possess similar reactivity toward HOCl.

A significant (P = 0.05) increase in the root-shoot lengths, fresh and dry weights and chlorophyll content of pearl millet seedlings was noticed after  by A. terreus under normal conditions. At 100 mM NaCl stress and A. terreus inoculation, the growth rate of pearl millet seedlings were significantly (P = 0.05) inhibited. Furthermore, the IAA production, relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, soluble sugar, phenol and flavonoid contents were significantly decreased, whereas proline content and lipid peroxidation were increased. On the contrary, pearl millet seedlings inoculated with A. terreus retained significantly (P = 0.05) higher amounts of RWC, chlorophyll, soluble sugar, phenol and flavonoid contents under 100 mM salt stress. The higher IAA production in A. terreus associated seedlings rescued the plant growth and development under salt stress. Moreover, the LC MS/MS analysis of A. terreus cultural filtrate revealed the presence of quinic , ellagic , calycosin, wogonin, feruloylquinic , caffeic  phenylethyl ester, D-glucoside, myricetin, propoxyphene and aminoflunitrazepam.

In pathogenic  species, the BvgAS TCS regulates expression of hundreds of genes, including those encoding all known protein virulence factors, and its kinase activity is essential for respiratory infection. Maintenance of BvgS kinase activity in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) depends on the function of another TCS, PlrSR. While the periplasmic Venus flytrap domains of BvgS have been implicated in responding to so-called modulating signals  (nicotinic  and MgSO), a role for the cytoplasmic Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain in signal perception has not previously been demonstrated. By comparing  strains with mutations in the PAS domain-encoding region of  with wild-type bacteria  and , we found that although the PAS domain is not required to sense modulating signals , it is required for the inactivation of BvgS that occurs in the absence of PlrS in the LRTs of mice, suggesting that the BvgS PAS domain functions as an independent signal perception domain. Our data also indicate that the BvgS PAS domain is important for controlling absolute levels of BvgS kinase activity and the efficiency of the response to modulating signals  Our results provide evidence that BvgS integrates sensory inputs from both the periplasm and the cytoplasm to control precise gene expression patterns under diverse environmental conditions.

These environmental fluxes affect bacterial communities who respond in a predictive manner associated with the time since organismal death, or the postmortem interval (PMI). Profiles of microbial taxonomic turnover and transmigration are currently being studied in decomposition ecology, and in the field of forensic microbiology as indicators of the PMI. We monitored bacterial community structural and functional changes taking place during decomposition of the intestines, bone marrow, lungs, and heart in a highly controlled murine model. We found that organs presumed to be sterile during life are colonized by  during later decomposition as the fluids from internal organs begin to emulsify within the body cavity. During  of previously sterile sites, gene transcripts for multiple metabolism pathways were highly abundant, while transcripts associated with stress response and dormancy increased as decomposition progressed. We found our model strengthens known bacterial taxonomic succession data after host death. This study is one of the first to provide data of expressed bacterial community genes, alongside transmigration and structural changes of microbial species during laboratory controlled vertebrate decomposition. This is an important dataset for studying the effects of the environment on bacterial communities in an effort to determine which bacterial species and which bacterial functional pathways, such as amino  metabolism, provide key changes during stages of decomposition that relate to the PMI.

We previously showed that carbenoxolone reduces the metastatic burden in the lungs of mice through its antagonistic effect on high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). To further enhance carbenoxolone's activity and localization in the lungs, thereby reducing the potential adverse side effects resulting from systemic exposure, we developed a poly(lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) slow-release system for pulmonary delivery which maintains drug activity in-vitro, as demonstrated in the anoikis assay. Both systemic and intranasal administrations of carbenoxolone effectively minimize metastatic formation in a lung  model in mice. Our results show a decrease in the metastatic burden in the lung tissue. Notably, the therapeutic effect of a single intranasal administration of 25 mg/kg carbenoxolone, in the form of drug-loaded particles, had a similar effect in reducing metastatic lesions in the lungs to that of a 10-fold dose of the free drug via intraperitoneal injections, three times per week over the course of four weeks.

Results showed that H. huttiense RCA24 performed best. Improvement in nitrogen-fixation and changes in physiological parameters such as chlorophyll, nitrogen content and shoot dry weight were observed for plants co-inoculated with strains RCA25 and RCA24 in a 10:1 ratio. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, strain RCA24 was the best colonizer of the root interior and the only IAA producer located in the same root niche occupied by RCA25 cells.

Swab specimens from nasopharyngeal and hands of food handlers working in food establishments were collected for isolation and identification of S. aureus using standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was done using disc diffusion method. Associations of selected variables for S. aureus  were determined using SPSS version 20 with p ≤ 0.05 taken as statistically significant.Among the 300 food handlers working in hotels and restaurants in Jimma Town, 86(28.7%) were colonized by S. aureus. The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from nose, hand and both parts (nose and hand) were 27(9%), 34(11.3%) and 25(8.3%), respectively. There was strong association (P=0.00336) between carriage rate of S. aureus and food handlers' job category. The majority (90.7%) of the isolates were resistant to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Increased levels of sensitivity were observed against Ciprofloxacin (96.5%), Cefoxitin (95.3%) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic  (94.2%).This study revealed a high prevalence of S. aureus carriers among food handlers and high antibacterial resistance towards commonly prescribed drugs, justifying the screening of food handlers to detect and treat carriers and protect restaurant customers from staphylococcal food poisoning.© 2019 Getenet Beyene, et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484768>Genome-wide identification of  genes required for fitness during  of the leaf surface and apoplast.</a></h1><p>The foliar plant pathogen  can establish large epiphytic populations on leaf surfaces before apoplastic .

Numerous other genes that had not been previously associated with  growth were also required for maximum epiphytic or apoplastic fitness. Fourteen hypothetical proteins and uncategorized glycosyltransferases were also required for maximum competitive fitness in and on leaves. For most genes, no relationship was seen between fitness  and either the magnitude of their expression  or degree of induction  compared to in vitro conditions measured in other studies. A lack of association of gene expression and fitness has important implications for the interpretation of transcriptional information and our broad understanding of plant-microbe interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121479>miR-150-5p Inhibits Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Metastasis and Recurrence by Targeting HMGA2 and β-Catenin Signaling.</a></h1><p>Dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the regulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), and CSCs are closely associated with tumor initiation, metastasis, and recurrence. Here we found that miR-150-5p was significantly downregulated in CSCs of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its expression level was negatively correlated with disease progression and poor survival in patients with NSCLC. Inhibition of miR-150-5p increased the CSC population and sphere formation of NSCLC cells in vitro and stimulated NSCLC cell tumorigenicity and metastatic  in vivo. In contrast, miR-150-5p overexpression potently inhibited sphere-formed NSCLC cell tumor formation, metastatic , and recurrence in xenograft models. Furthermore, we identified that miR-150-5p significantly inhibited wingless (Wnt)-β-catenin signaling by simultaneously targeting glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta interacting protein (GSKIP) and β-catenin in NSCLC cells. miR-150-5p also targeted high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), another regulator of CSCs, and Wnt-β-catenin signaling. The restoration of HMGA2 and β-catenin blocked miR-150-5p overexpression-induced inhibition of CSC traits in NSCLC cells. These findings suggest that miR-150-5p functions as a CSC suppressor and that overexpression of miR-150-5p may be a novel strategy to inhibit CSC-induced metastasis and recurrence in NSCLC.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

This study investigated the effect of the administration of FMT from highly feed efficient donors early in life on the jejunal and cecal microbiota, visceral organ size, intestinal morphology, permeability, and expression of genes for nutrient transporters, barrier function and innate immune response in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; a metric for FE). Chicks ( = 110) were inoculated with the FMT or control transplant (CT) on 1, 6, and 9 days posthatch (dph), from which 56 chickens were selected on 30 dph as the extremes in RFI, resulting in 15 low and 13 high RFI chickens receiving the FMT and 14 low and 14 high RFI chickens receiving the CT. RFI rank and FMT only caused tendencies for alterations in the jejunal microbiota and only one unclassified  genus in cecal digesta was indicative of high RFI. By contrast, the FMT caused clear differences in the short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile in the crop and cecal microbiota composition compared to the CT, which indicated alterations in amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria such as , , and . Moreover, the FMT caused alterations in intestinal development as indicated by the longer duodenum and shallower crypts in the ceca. From the observed RFI-associated variation, energy-saving mechanisms and moderation of the mucosal immune response were indicated by higher jejunal permeability, shorter villi in the ileum, and enhanced cecal expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine  in low RFI chickens. Relationships obtained from supervised multigroup data integration support that certain bacteria, including , and unclassified -phylotypes, and SCFA in jejunal and cecal digesta modulated expression levels of cytokines, tight-junction protein  and nutrient transporters for glucose and SCFA uptake. In conclusion, results suggest that the intestine only played a moderate role for the RFI-associated variation of the present low and high RFI phenotypes, whereas modulating the early microbial  resulted in long-lasting changes in bacterial taxonomic and metabolite composition as well as in host intestinal development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346512>Indigenous Subarctic Food Systems in Transition: Amino  Composition (Including Tryptophan) in Wild-Harvested and Processed Meats.</a></h1><p>Indigenous people of northern Canada traditionally lived a nomadic lifestyle subsisting on wild game and fish for thousands of years. With  came an increasing dependence on imported processed foods. This dietary change has often been reported to be one of the factors leading to Indigenous health and wellbeing disparities worldwide. We determined the amino  (AA) profile including tryptophan (Trp) of wild meats (game and fish) and processed meats found in the traditional and modern diets of Indigenous subarctic communities in Canada. Trp is a limited essential AA necessary for synthesis of serotonin (5-HT), an important neurotransmitter and homeostatic regulator. The dietary ratio of Trp relative to other large neutral AAs (LNAA) can alter Trp transport and 5-HT synthesis in the brain. We determined AA composition of wild meats and processed meats using standardized NaOH and HCl hydrolysis for Trp and other AAs, respectively, followed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography. A Principal Components Analysis revealed that overall AA composition is significantly different between wild and processed meats. (M)ANOVA showed significantly higher protein in wild meats (wet weight, ww). Trp was significantly lower in processed meat samples (n=15; 0.18g/100g ± 0.02 ww) compared to wild meat samples (n=25; 0.24g/100g ± 0.06 ww). The proportion of Trp:LNAA and Trp in sample protein were not significantly different between wild (1:21-1:27, 0.92-1.27 g/100g protein) and processed (1:20-1:24, 1.03-1.27 g/100g protein) meats. Within wild meats, AA composition is significantly different between fish and waterfowl, fish and moose, and moose and goose. (M)ANOVA results indicate significantly higher protein in goose compared to moose and fish and in moose compared to fish. We compared our Trp findings to previous analyses and discuss the substantial gap in human nutritional studies of Trp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594814>An Amyloid Core Sequence in the Major Candida albicans Adhesin Als1p Mediates Cell-Cell Adhesion.</a></h1><p>The human fungal commensal  can become a serious opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised hosts. The  cell adhesion protein Als1p is a highly expressed member of a large family of paralogous adhesins. Als1p can mediate binding to epithelial and endothelial cells, is upregulated in infections, and is important for biofilm formation. Als1p includes an amyloid-forming sequence at amino  325 to 331, identical to the sequence in the paralogs Als5p and Als3p. Therefore, we mutated Val326 to test whether this sequence is important for activity. Wild-type Als1p (Als1p) and Als1p with the V326N mutation (Als1p) were expressed at similar levels in a  surface display model. Als1p cells adhered to bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coated beads similarly to Als1p cells. However, cells displaying Als1p showed visibly smaller aggregates and did not fluoresce in the presence of the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin-T. A new analysis tool for single-molecule force spectroscopy-derived surface mapping showed that statistically significant force-dependent Als1p clustering occurred in Als1p cells but was absent in Als1p cells. In single-cell force spectroscopy experiments, strong cell-cell adhesion was dependent on an intact amyloid core sequence on both interacting cells. Thus, the major adhesin Als1p interacts through amyloid-like β-aggregation to cluster adhesin molecules in  on the cell surface as well as in  to form cell-cell bonds. Microbial cell surface adhesins control essential processes such as adhesion, , and biofilm formation. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen , the gglutinin-ike equence () gene family encodes eight cell surface glycoproteins that mediate adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces and cell-cell aggregation. Als proteins are critical for commensalism and virulence. Their activities include attachment and invasion of endothelial and epithelial cells, morphogenesis, and formation of biofilms on host tissue and indwelling medical catheters. At the molecular level, Als5p-mediated cell-cell aggregation is dependent on the formation of amyloid-like nanodomains between Als5p-expressing cells. A single-site mutation to valine 326 abolishes cellular aggregation and amyloid formation. Our results show that the binding characteristics of Als1p follow a mechanistic model similar to Als5p, despite its differential expression and biological roles.Copyright © 2019 Ho et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362856>Function and regulation of Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic  and capsular polysaccharides.</a></h1><p>Staphylococcus aureus produces different secondary cell wall glycopolymers such as wall teichoic  (WTA) and capsular polysaccharides (CP). These structures play an important role in S. aureus , pathogenesis and bacterial evasion of the host immune defences. To fulfil their diverse functions, biosynthesis of both glycopolymers has to be tightly controlled. Regulation of WTA biosynthesis and modification is only partially understood. The transcription factor MgrA and the two-component systems (TCS) Agr, GraRS, and ArlRS control WTA export, chain-length and modification. CP synthesis is determined by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory circuits. On the transcriptional level expression of the capA-P operon is mainly driven by the alternative Sigma factor B and modulated by several transcriptional factors and TCS. Post-transcriptional mechanisms are in place to avoid conflict between precursor usage by the CP synthesis machinery and the synthesis machinery of other cell wall glycopolymers. The complex interplay of these regulatory systems determines the peculiar, strictly temporal expression of CP in the late growth phase and the high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity. Differential expression of CP, WTA and its modification systems during infection and colonisation are likely important for disease development, immune escape and survival within the host.Copyright © 2019.

However, less is known about the effects of sustained exposure to gaseous ammonia on nasal microbiota  in growing pigs. A total of 120 Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire pigs were housed in 24 separate chambers and continuously exposed to gaseous ammonia at 0,5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 ppm (four groups per exposure level) for 4 weeks. Then, we used high-throughput sequencing to perform 16S rRNA gene analysis in nasal swabs samples from 72 pigs ( = 12). The results of the nasal microbiota analysis showed that an increase in ammonia concentration, especially at 20 and 25 ppm, decreased the alpha diversity and relative abundance of nasal microbiota. , and  were the most abundant phyla. In addition, the relative abundances of 24 microbial genera significantly changed as the ammonia level increased. Four microbial genera (, and ) were significantly decreased at 25 ppm, while only two genera ( and ) were increased at 25 ppm. PICRUSt analyses showed that the relative abundances of the nasal microbiota involved in cell motility, signal transduction, the nervous system, environmental adaptation, and energy and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly decreased, while genes involved in the immune system, endocrine system, circulatory system, immune system diseases and metabolism of vitamins, lipid, and amino  were increased with increased ammonia levels. The results of  tests showed that an increase in ammonia levels, especially an ammonia level of 25 ppm, caused respiratory tract injury and increase the number of  and  species, while simultaneously decreasing respiratory immunity and growth performance, consistent with the increased presence of harmful bacteria identified by nasal microbiota analysis.

To investigate bacterial traits associated with successful  of plants, we sequenced the genome of 26 bacteria of a synthetic microbial community (SynCom), 12 of which displayed robust and 14 displayed non-robust  lifestyles when inoculated in maize plants. We examined the  profile of individual bacteria in inoculated plants and inspected their genomes for traits correlated to the  lifestyle. Comparative genomic analysis between robust and non-robust bacteria revealed that commonly investigated plant growth-promoting features such as auxin production, nitrogen (N) fixation, phosphate acquisition, and ACC deaminase are not deterministic for robust . Functions related to carbon (C) and N acquisition, including transporters of carbohydrates and amino , and kinases involved in signaling mechanisms associated with C and N uptake, were enriched in robust colonizers. While enrichment of carbohydrate transporters was linked to a wide range of metabolites, amino  transporters were primarily related to the uptake of branched-chain amino .

Lipoteichoic  (LTA) is a Gram-positive cell wall component that can be measured in serum. The purpose of this pilot study was to characterize LTA concentrations in hemodialysis (HD) patients with TCVCs compared to other access types and to evaluate biofilm morphology and microbiology in TCVCs removed by clinical decision. The study enrolled patients with TCVCs (18), grafts (19), and fistulas (18). Blood samples were collected before HD, at 30 minutes, 2 hours, and end of HD. Catheters removed by clinical decision were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for biofilm morphology, and portions of the catheter were cultured. LTA was detectable in all samples and concentrations increased significantly in all access types during HD (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Patients with TCVCs that had a >30% increase in LTA concentration from baseline also had the greatest rate of increase (slope) compared to grafts and fistulas (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). Catheters removed by clinical decision (n = 7) and examined by SEM had deposition of fibrin. Cultures revealed polymicrobial . TCVCs had the highest rate of increase of LTA during HD.

Helicobacter pylori infection is such a well-known biotic factor. However, not all H. pylori-infected individuals develop gastric diseases and not all individuals with gastric diseases are infected with H. pylori. Therefore, it is possible that other gastric bacteria may contribute to the formation and progression of gastric disease. The aim of this study was to isolate prevalent gastric bacteria under microaerobic condition and identify them by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Analysis of gastric biopsies showed infection of Mycobacterium abscessus (phylum Actinobacteria) to be highly prevalent in the stomachs of subjects included. Our data show that of 129 (67 male and 62 female) patients with gastric symptoms, 96 (51 male and 45 female) showed the presence of M. abscessus in stomach tissues. Infection of M. abscessus in gastric epithelium was further confirmed by imaging with  fast staining, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Our imaging data strongly suggested that M. abscessus is an intracellular colonizer residing inside the gastric epithelial cells rather than in macrophages. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the mycobacterial hsp65 gene showed that the nearest match to the M. abscessus strains isolated from our study subjects is the M. abscessus strain ATCC 19977. Surprisingly, the subjects studied, the prevalence of M. abscessus infection in stomach is even higher than the prevalence of H. pylori infection. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study showing the  of M. abscessus in human gastric mucosa among patients with various gastric symptoms.

TolC is the outer membrane channel component of type 1 secretion systems and multidrug efflux pumps that plays critical roles during the infection process in many pathogens. However, little is known about the exact roles of TolC1 in the pathogenicity of A. pleuropneumoniae, an etiological agent of the porcine contagious pleuropneumoniae that causes severe respiratory disease. In this study, deletion of tolC1 causes apparent ultrastructural defects in A. pleuropneumoniae cell examined by transmission electron microscopy. The tolC1 mutant is hypersensitivity to oxidative, osmotic and  challenges by in vitro stress assays. Analysis on secreted proteins shows that the excretion of ApxIIA and an ApxIVA-like protein, ApxIVA-S, is abolished in the absence of TolC1. This result confirms the essential role of TolC1 in the secretion of Apx toxins and this is the first identification of an ApxIVA-like protein in in vitro culture of A. pleuropneumoniae. Besides, disruption of TolC1 leads to a significant attenuation of virulence in mice by an intraperitoneal route of A. pleuropneumoniae. The basis for the attenuation is further investigated using a mouse intranasal infection model, which reveals an impaired ability to colonize and induce lesions in the lungs for the loss of TolC1 of A. pleuropneumoniae. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate significant roles of TolC1 in facilitating bacterial survival in hostile conditions, maximum  as well as pathogenicity during the infection of A. pleuropneumoniae.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AM fungi isolated from naturally occurring Al acidic soils in conferring host tolerance to Al toxicity in 3 wheat cultivars differing in Al sensitivity. The experiment was conducted in a soil-less substrate (vermiculite/perlite, 2:1, v/v) using two Al -tolerant genotypes and one Al -sensitive wheat genotype. The wheat was colonized with a consortium of AM fungi isolated from an andisol, with or without Al at a concentration of 200 μM.The wheat response to Al in the medium was dependent on both the plant genotype and AM . The benefits of the AM fungi to the wheat cultivars included an increased P concentration and relatively low Al accumulation in the plants. This was achieved through two mechanisms. First, the metal chelating capacity of the AM fungi was clear in some cultivars ('Tukan' and 'Porfiado'), in which the enhanced extraradical mycelium development was able to retain Al in the glomalin and hyphae. Second, the increased AM-induced  phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of the other cultivar ('Atlas 66') increased host nutrition possibly by hyphae-mediated nutrient uptake and GRSP CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the role of AM fungi in cultivar-specific Al detoxification can be achieved by increased extraradical mycelial filters and enhanced bioavailability of the host rhizosphere P.

The transcriptional or translational programming of wheat roots inoculated with beneficial  showed mild alterations compared with that of pathogenic  var. . However, the combination of  and  var.  activated a larger transcriptional or translational program than for each single microorganism, although the gene expression pattern was similar to that of individual infection by  var. , suggesting a prioritization of defense against  var.  infection.

Several effectors interact with host proteins to suppress host immunity and inhibit plant growth. However, little is known about how  regulates the host transcriptome. Here, we identified an RXLR effector, , which is upregulated and maintains a high expression level throughout the infection. Stable transgenic potato () lines expressing  show enhanced leaf  by  and reduced vegetative growth. We further investigated the transcriptional changes between three  transgenic lines and the wild type Désirée by using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Compared with Désirée, 190 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 158 upregulated genes and 32 downregulated genes in  transgenic lines. Eight upregulated and nine downregulated DEGs were validated by real-time RT-PCR, which showed a high correlation with the expression level identified by RNA-Seq. These DEGs will help to explore the mechanism of PITG_15718.2-mediated immunity and growth inhibition in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443695>Regulation of rumen development in neonatal ruminants through microbial metagenomes and host transcriptomes.</a></h1><p>In ruminants, early rumen development is vital for efficient fermentation that converts plant materials to human edible food such as milk and meat. Here, we investigate the extent and functional basis of host-microbial interactions regulating rumen development during the first 6 weeks of life.The use of microbial metagenomics, together with quantification of volatile fatty  (VFAs) and qPCR, reveals the  of an active bacterial community in the rumen at birth.  of active complex carbohydrate fermenters and archaea with methyl-coenzyme M reductase activity was also observed from the first week of life in the absence of a solid diet. Integrating microbial metagenomics and host transcriptomics reveals only 26.3% of mRNA transcripts, and 46.4% of miRNAs were responsive to VFAs, while others were ontogenic. Among these, one host gene module was positively associated with VFAs, while two other host gene modules and one miRNA module were negatively associated with VFAs. Eight host genes and five miRNAs involved in zinc ion binding-related transcriptional regulation were associated with a rumen bacterial cluster consisting of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus.This three-way interaction suggests a potential role of bacteria-driven transcriptional regulation in early rumen development via miRNAs. Our results reveal a highly active early microbiome that regulates rumen development of neonatal calves at the cellular level, and miRNAs may coordinate these host-microbial interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410554>Metabolic responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are shifted in roots of contrasting soybean genotypes.</a></h1><p>Modern breeding programs have reduced genetic variability and might have caused a reduction in plant  by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM). In our previous studies, mycorrhizal  was affected in improved soybean genotypes, mainly arbuscule formation. Despite substantial knowledge of the symbiosis-related changes of the transcriptome and proteome, only sparse clues regarding metabolite alterations are available. Here, we evaluated metabolite changes between improved (I-1) and unimproved (UI-4) soybean genotypes and also compare their metabolic responses after AM root . Soybean genotypes inoculated or not with AM were grown in a chamber under controlled light and temperature conditions. At 20 days after inoculation, we evaluated soluble metabolites of each genotype and treatment measured by GC-MS. In this analysis, when comparing non-AM roots between genotypes, I-1 had a lower amount of 31 and higher amount of only 4 metabolites than the UI-4 genotype. When comparing AM roots, I-1 had a lower amount of 36 and higher amount of 4 metabolites than UI-4 (different to those found altered in non-AM treated plants). Lastly, comparing the AM vs non-AM treatments, I-1 had increased levels of three and reduced levels of 24 metabolites, while UI-4 only had levels of 12 metabolites reduced by the effect of mycorrhizas. We found the major changes in sugars, polyols, amino , and carboxylic . In a targeted analysis, we found lower levels of isoflavonoids and alpha-tocopherol and higher levels of malondialdehyde in the I-1 genotype that can affect soybean-AM symbiosis. Our studies have the potential to support improving soybean with a greater capacity to be colonized and responsive to AM interaction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535105>One-step hydrophobization of tannic  for antibacterial coating on catheters to prevent catheter-associated infections.</a></h1><p>Catheter-associated infections (CAIs) caused by bacterial  are significant problems in clinics. Thus, effective antibacterial coatings for biomedical catheters to prevent bacterial infections are urgently needed. Ideal coatings should include the advantage of potent antibacterial properties and being easily and economically modified on the catheter surface. Due to their advantages of adhesive capability on various substrates, an increasing number of coatings based on plant polyphenols have been developed. However, the hydrophilicity of plant polyphenols limits their utilization in coatings. Herein, hydrophobic tannic  (TA) was synthesized via the one-step electrostatic assembly of TA and benzalkonium chloride (BAC) with the green solvent water as the medium. The as-prepared hydrophobic TA (TBA) facilely formed a stable and colorless coating on the luminal and outer surface of biomedical catheters with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and biocompatiblity. It was demonstrated that the TBA-coated surfaces displayed excellent bactericidal activity toward Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli), and more than 99% of the above bacteria were killed by the TBA-coated films. The test of the coated catheters in vitro also showed the excellent antibacterial activity of both the outer and luminal surfaces of the catheter. Moreover, in an in vivo mouse model, the coated catheters relatively prevented bacterial  compared to the uncoated catheters. Meantime, no significant cytotoxicity and host response for Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and tissue compatibility in vivo were observed, indicating the better biocompatibility of the TBA coating. This preparation method overcomes the limitation of the traditional hydrophilic tannic  as a coating and provides a new method for preventing medical indwelling device-associated infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430055>A new approach to the production of a biovital skin graft based on human acellular dermal matrix produced in-house, in vitro revitalized internally by human fibroblasts and keratinocytes on the surface.</a></h1><p>Patients with extensive and deep burns who do not have enough donor sites for autologous skin grafts require alternative treatment methods. Tissue engineering is a useful tool to solve this problem. The aim of this study was to find the optimal method for the production of a biovital skin substitute based on acellular dermal matrix (ADM) and in vitro cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes. In this work, nine methods of ADM production were assessed. The proposed methods are based on the use of the following enzymes: Dispase II, collagenase I/ethylenediaminetetraacetic  (EDTA), collagenase II/EDTA, and mechanical perforation using DermaRoller and mesh dermatome. The obtained ADMs were examined (both on the side of the basement membrane and on the "cut-off" side) by means of scanning electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry tests and strength tests. ADM was revitalized with human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The ability of in-depth revitalization of cultured fibroblasts and their ability to secrete collagen IV was examined.

Relative to wild type, the selected complex I, II, and III mutants showed decreased total respiration, increased alternative respiration, as well as increased redox charge of the NADP(H) pool and decreased redox charge of the NAD(H) pool in the dark. In the light, mETC mutants accumulated free amino , albeit to varying degrees. Glycine and serine, which are involved in carbon recycling from photorespiration, and N-rich amino  were predominantly increased in mETC mutants compared to the wild type. Taking together the physiological phenotypes of all examined mutants, our results suggest a connection between the limitation in the re-oxidation of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial matrix and the induction of nitrate assimilation into free amino  in the cytosol, which seems to be engaged as an additional sink for reducing power. The  mutant was less susceptible to  and did not show hampered salicylic  (SA) accumulation as previously reported for  knock-down plants. The ROS burst remained unaffected in , emonstrating that subunit SDH2 is not involved in the control of ROS production and SA signaling by complex II. Moreover, the  mutant showed only 20% of   compared to wild type, with the ROS burst and the production of callose papillae being significantly increased compared to wild type. This indicates that a restriction of respiratory metabolism can positively affect pre-penetration resistance of . Taking metabolite profiling data from all investigated mETC mutants, a strong positive correlation of resistance toward  with NADPH pool size, pyruvate contents, and other metabolites associated with redox poise and energy charge was evident, which fosters the hypothesis that limitations in the mETC can support resistance at post-penetration stages by improving the availability of metabolic power.Copyright © 2019 McCollum, Geißelsöder, Engelsdorf, Voitsik and Voll.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533370>Isolation and Identification of Lactic  Bacteria Probiotic Culture Candidates for the Treatment of   Serovar Enteritidis in Neonatal Turkey Poults.</a></h1><p>The effect of  spp.-based probiotic candidates on  enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE)  was evaluated in two separate experiments. In each experiment, sixty-one day-of-hatch female turkey poults were obtained from a local hatchery. In both experiments, poults were challenged via oral gavage with 10 cfu/poult of SE and randomly allocated to one of two groups ( = 30 poults): (1) the positive control group and (2) the probiotic treated group. Heated brooder batteries were used for housing each group separately and poults were allowed ad libitum access to water and unmedicated turkey starter feed. 1 h following the SE challenge, poults were treated with 10 cfu/poult of probiotic culture via oral gavage or phosphate-buffered saline （PBS）to control groups. A total of 24 h post-treatment, poults were euthanized and the ceca and cecal tonsils from twenty poults were collected aseptically for SE recovery. In both trials, a significant reduction in the incidence and log cfu/g of SE were observed in poults treated with the probiotic when compared with control poults ( ≤ 0.05).

Although lactobacilli and bifidobacteria produce beneficial lactic and short-chain fatty  in the mammalian gut, the significance of intestinal Escherichia coli producing these  is debatable. Taking a Koch's postulates approach in reverse, we define Escherichia coli as health-promoting for naturally colonizing the gut of healthy mice and protecting them against intestinal  and concomitant mortality by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reintroduction of faecal bacteria and E. coli in antibiotic-treated mice establishes a high titre of E. coli in the host intestine and increases defence against P. aeruginosa  and mortality. Strikingly, high sugar concentration favours E. coli fermentation to lactic and acetic  and inhibits P. aeruginosa growth and virulence in aerobic cultures and in a model of aerobic metabolism in flies, while dietary vegetable fats - not carbohydrates or proteins - favour E. coli fermentation and protect the host in the anaerobic mouse gut. Thus E. coli metabolic output is an important indicator of resistance to infection. Our work may also suggest that the lack of antimicrobial bacterial metabolites in mammalian lungs and wounds allows P. aeruginosa to be a formidable microbe at these sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531771>A pilot study to assess oral  and pH buffering by the probiotic Streptococcus dentisani under different dosing regimes.</a></h1><p>Bacterial  in the oral cavity is critical for efficient action of probiotics. However, limited  rates have been reported in many clinical trials. The aim of this pilot clinical study was to evaluate the  efficiency of Streptococcus dentisani under different dosing schedules and pre-treatment conditions. Eleven adult volunteers enrolled in the study. A professional ultrasound cleaning was performed in quadrants 1 and 4. The probiotic was applied in all four quadrants at a total dose of 10 CFUs, administered in a buccoadhesive gel for 5 min, either in a single dose (n = 5) or daily for a week (n = 6). Dental plaque and saliva samples were collected at baseline and after 14 and 28 days of first application. Amounts of S. dentisani and the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutans were measured by qPCR and salivary pH was measured by reflectometry. There was a significant increase in S. dentisani cells at day 14 but not at day 28 under both dosing schedules. A non-significant higher  was found in the half-mouth with previous professional cleaning as compared to the intact half. There was a significant increase in salivary pH at day 14 (p = 0.024) and day 28 (p = 0.014), which was stronger in multi-dose patients, and a significant decrease in S. mutans at day 28 (p < 0.01). The results indicate that S. dentisani is transiently able to colonize the oral cavity and that it buffers oral pH, especially after multiple dosing.

We aimed to identify the quinolone that by disk diffusion best discriminates phenotypic wild-type isolates (ciprofloxacin MIC ≤ 0.06 mg/L) of E. coli from isolates with acquired resistance, and to determine the resistance genotype of each isolate. The susceptibility of 108 E. coli isolates was evaluated by ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nalidixic , and pefloxacin disk diffusion and correlated to ciprofloxacin MIC (broth microdilution) using EUCAST methodology. Genotypic resistance was identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. The specificity was 100% for all quinolone disks. Sensitivity varied substantially, as follows: ciprofloxacin 59%, levofloxacin 46%, moxifloxacin 59%, nalidixic  97%, and pefloxacin 97%. We suggest that in situations where low-level quinolone resistance might be of importance, such as when screening for quinolone resistance in fecal samples pre-TRUS-B, a pefloxacin (S ≥ 24 mm) or nalidixic  (S ≥ 19 mm) disk, or a combination of the two, should be used.

Nonetheless, life spans of bonded restorations are limited mainly because of the eventual incidence of recurrent caries. Over time, water and waterborne agents (, enzymes) degrade the components of the dentin/restoration interface, allowing bacterial  and dentin reinfection at the margins of the restoration. We developed a 2-tier protective technology consisting of priming/coating dentin with amphipathic and antimicrobial peptides (AAMPs) to obtain hydrophobic/water-repellent and antibiofilm dentin-resisting recurrent caries around bonded restorations. We tested a series of AAMPs to assess their structure-function relationships as well as the effects of different dentin-conditioning methods on the structural features of AAMP-coated dentin. We found relation between the secondary structure of AAMPs (high portion of β-sheet), the antimicrobial potency of AAMPs, and the AAMPs' ability to form hydrophobic coatings on dentin. We also determined that AAMPs had preferential adsorption on the mineral phase of dentin, which suggested that peptides arrange their cationic and hydrophilic motifs in direct contact with the negatively charged minerals in the hydrophilic dentin. These results led us to explore different dentin-conditioning methods that would increase the mineral/collagen ratio and their effect on AAMP immobilization. We innovatively imaged the spatial distribution of the AAMPs in relation to the dentinal tubules and collagen network using a minimally invasive multimodal imaging technique: multiphoton-second harmonic generation. Using multiphoton-second harmonic generation imaging, we determined that partial deproteinization of dentin increased the amount of immobilized AAMPs as compared with the total etched dentin at the dentin surface and extended deeply around dentinal tubules. Last, we analyzed the release rate of AAMPs from dentin coatings in artificial saliva to predict their stability in the clinical setting. In conclusion, priming dentin with AAMPs is a versatile new approach with potential to fortify the otherwise vulnerable adhesive-based interfaces.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109795>Shape Follows Function: Gastrointestinal Signals for Enterococcal .</a></h1><p>Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) is a major cause of nosocomial infections.

They significantly improve the patients' comfort and quality of life, but also constitute a significant risk factor for biofilm-associated infections. Currently, intensive research on the development of novel materials resistant to microbial  as well as new compounds that are active against biofilms is being carried out. Within this research, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and their analogues are being intensively investigated due to their promising antimicrobial activities. The main goal of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of short cationic lipopeptides that were designed to imitate the features of AMPs responsible for antimicrobial activities: positive net charge and amphipacity. The positive charge of the molecules results from the presence of basic amino  residues: arginine and lysine. Amphipacity is provided by the introduction of decanoic, dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, and hexadecanoic  chains to the molecules. Lipopeptides (C-KR-NH, C-KKK-NH, C-KKC-NH, C-KGK-NH, C-KR-NH, C-KKC-NH, C-KR-NH, C-KKC-NH, and (C)-KKKK-NH) were synthesized using a novel solid-phase temperature-assisted methodology. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs), and minimum biofilm formation inhibitory concentrations (MBFICs) were determined for the following bacterial strains:  ATCC 25923,  ATCC 14990,  ATCC 29212,  ATCC 25922,  ATCC 9027, and  PCM 543. The biofilms were cultured on two types of surfaces: polystyrene plates (PS) and contact lenses (CL). The lipopeptides exhibited the ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria in a liquid medium as well as on the PS and CL. The compounds also eliminated the bacterial biofilm from the surface of both materials. In general, the activity against gram-positive bacteria was stronger in comparison to that against gram-negative strains. There were certain discrepancies between the activity of compounds against the biofilm cultured on PS and CL. This was especially noticeable for staphylococci-the lipopeptides presented much higher activity against biofilm formed on the PS surface. It is worth noting that the obtained MBEC values for lipopeptides were usually only a few times higher than the MICs. The results of the performed experiments suggest that further studies on lipopeptides and their potential application in the treatment and prophylaxis of biofilm-associated infections should be conducted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273308>Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Trigger Transcriptional Expression of Flavonoid and Chlorogenic  Biosynthetic Pathways Genes in Tomato against Tomato Mosaic Virus.</a></h1><p>Tomato mosaic disease, caused by Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV), is one of the most destructive diseases which results in serious crop losses. Research investigations dealing with the biocontrol activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) against this viral disease are limited. In this study, the biocontrol activity of AMF on tomato plants infected with ToMV was evaluated in the greenhouse. In addition, their impacts on the transcriptional expression levels of thirteen genes controlling the phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and chlorogenic  biosynthetic pathways were also investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. Transcriptional expressions of the majority of the studied genes were up-regulated by mycorrhizal  in the presence of ToMV, particularly PAL1 and HQT, suggesting their pathogen-dependent inducing effect. Under greenhouse conditions, a significant reduction in the disease severity and incidence, as well as the viral accumulation level was observed as a response to the mycorrhizal  of the infected plants. Moreover, the evaluated growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, and flavonoid content were significantly enhanced by AMF . The obtained results demonstrated the protective role of AMF in triggering the plant immunity against ToMV in a pathogen-dependent manner. Beside their protective and growth-promotion activities, AMF are characterized by low-cost and environment-friendly properties which support their possible use for control of tomato mosaic disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140746>Modulation of Intestinal Epithelial Glycocalyx Development by Human Milk Oligosaccharides and Non-Digestible Carbohydrates.</a></h1><p>The epithelial glycocalyx development is of great importance for microbial . Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) may modulate glycocalyx development.The effects of hMOs and NDCs on human gut epithelial cells (Caco2) are investigated by quantifying thickness and area coverage of adsorbed albumin, heparan sulfate (HS), and hyaluronic  (HA) in the glycocalyx. Effects of hMOs (2'-FL and 3-FL) and NDCs [inulins with degrees of polymerization (DP) (DP3-DP10, DP10-DP60, DP30-DP60) and pectins with degrees of methylation (DM) (DM7, DM55, DM69)] are tested using immunofluorescence staining at 1 and 5 days stimulation. HMOs show a significant enhancing effect on glycocalyx development but effects are structure-dependent. 3-FL induces a stronger albumin adsorption and increases HS and HA stronger than 2'-FL. The DP3-DP10, DP30-60 inulins also increase glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent manner as DP3-DP10 selectively increases HS, while DP30-DP60 specifically increases HA. Pectins have less effects, and only increase albumin adsorption.Here, it is shown that 2'-FL and 3-FL and inulins stimulate glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent fashion. This may contribute to formulation of effective hMO and NDC formulations in infant formulas to support microbial  and gut barrier function.© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The improvement of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)  in poly-l-lactic- (PLLA)/nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) composite scaffold was evaluated in terms of cell proliferation (dsDNA content), bone differentiation (gene expression and protein synthesis) and ultrastructural analysis by comparing static (s3D) and dynamic (d3D) 3D culture conditions at 7 and 21 days. The  rate of hMSCs and osteogenic differentiation were amplified by d3D when physical stimulation was provided by a perfusion bioreactor. Increase in dsDNA content (p < 0.0005), up-regulation of RUNX2, ALPL, SPP1 (p < 0.0005) and SOX9 (p < 0.005) gene expression, and more calcium nodule formation (p < 0.0005) were observed in d3D cultures in comparison to s3D ones over time. Dynamic 3D culture, mimicking the mechanical signals of bone environment, improved significantly osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs on PLLA/nHA scaffold, without the addition of growth factors, confirming this composite scaffold suitable for bone regeneration.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

However, it remains unclear how perturbations of the gut microbiota compromise host infection resistance, especially through changes at species and metabolite levels.Here, we illustrate how Bacteroides vulgatus, a dominant species of the Bacteroidetes phylum in mouse intestine, suppresses infection by Vibrio cholerae, an important human pathogen. Clindamycin (CL) is an antibiotic that selectively kills anaerobic bacteria, and accordingly Bacteroidetes are completely eradicated from CL-treated mouse intestines. The Bacteroidetes-depleted adult mice developed severe cholera-like symptoms, when infected with V. cholerae. Germ-free mice mono-associated with B. vulgatus became resistant to V. cholerae infection. Levels of V. cholerae growth-inhibitory metabolites including short-chain fatty  plummeted upon CL treatment, while levels of compounds that enhance V. cholerae proliferation were elevated. Furthermore, the intestinal  process of V. cholerae was well-simulated in CL-treated adult mice.Overall, we provide insights into how a symbiotic microbe and a pathogenic intruder interact inside host intestine. We identified B. vulgatus as an indigenous microbial species that can suppress intestinal infection. Our results also demonstrate that commensal-derived metabolites are a critical determinant for host resistance against V. cholerae infection, and that CL pretreatment of adult mice generates a simple yet useful model of cholera infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128607>Risk factors for respiratory tract bacterial  in adults with neuromuscular or neurological disorders and chronic tracheostomy.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to describe the endotracheal respiratory flora in a population of adults suffering from neuromuscular or neurological disorders requiring a long-term tracheostomy and to identify risk factors for . We conducted a prospective and single-center observational study among patients with chronic tracheostomy admitted for planned respiratory assessment between February 2015 and December 2016. Data were collected from patient interview and medical charts with a standardized questionnaire. A tracheal aspiration was performed for each patient. Humidifiers were analysed for bacteriological contamination. Overall 77 tracheal aspirates (TA) were obtained from patients included. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 90% of cases (69/77) with a majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32/77, 41%), Staphylococcus aureus (34/77, 44%) and Serratia marcesens. (22/79, 38%) Amoxicillin + Clavulanic- and Cefotaxime were adapted for respectively in only 28% and 35% of the subjects due to the natural resistance of organisms. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from humidifier samples. Risk factors significantly associated with P. aeruginosa  were residence in a medical-care home (p = 0.01, OR = 3.8 [1.1; 15.1]) and the presence of a cuff (p = 0.003, OR = 4.4 [1.1; 20.6]). Significant quantities of pathogenic bacteria are frequently isolated from TA of tracheostomised patients in the absence of infection.

Both mammalian and fungal cells can convert arachidonic  into the lipid mediator, prostaglandin E2 (PGE), but the physiological significance of fungus-derived PGE remains elusive. Here we report that a  mutant deficient in PGE production suffered a loss of competitive fitness in the murine gastrointestinal (GI) tract and that PGE supplementation mitigated this fitness defect. Impaired fungal PGE production affected neither the  fitness of  nor hyphal morphogenesis and virulence in either systemic or mucosal infection models.

Although C. difficile can be an asymptomatic colonizer, its pathogenic potential is most commonly manifested in patients with antibiotic-modified intestinal microbiomes. In a cohort of 186 hospitalized patients, we showed that host and microbe-associated shifts in fecal metabolomes had the potential to distinguish patients with CDI from those with non-C. difficile diarrhea and C. difficile . Patients with CDI exhibited a chemical signature of Stickland amino  fermentation that was distinct from those of uncolonized controls. This signature suggested that C. difficile preferentially catabolizes branched chain amino  during CDI. Unexpectedly, we also identified a series of noncanonical, unsaturated bile  that were depleted in patients with CDI. These bile  may derive from an extended host-microbiome dehydroxylation network in uninfected patients. Bile  composition and leucine fermentation defined a prototype metabolomic model with potential to distinguish clinical CDI from asymptomatic C. difficile .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159213>A Derivative of Butyric , the Fermentation Metabolite of , Inhibits the Growth of a  Strain Isolated from Atopic Dermatitis Patients.</a></h1><p>The microbiome is a rich source of metabolites for the development of novel drugs. Butyric , for example, is a short-chain fatty  fermentation metabolite of the skin probiotic bacterium  (). Glycerol fermentation of  resulted in the production of butyric  and effectively hindered the growth of a  () strain isolated from skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) in vitro and in vivo. This approach, however, is unlikely to be therapeutically useful since butyric  is malodorous and requires a high concentration in the mM range for growth suppression of AD . A derivative of butyric , BA-NH-NH-BA, was synthesized by conjugation of two butyric  to both ends of an -NH-O-NH- linker. BA-NH-NH-BA significantly lowered the concentration of butyric  required to inhibit the growth of AD . Like butyric , BA-NH-NH-BA functioned as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor by inducing the acetylation of Histone H3 lysine 9 (AcH3K9) in human keratinocytes. Furthermore, BA-NH-NH-BA ameliorated AD -induced production of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 and remarkably reduced the  of AD  in mouse skin. These results describe a novel derivative of a skin microbiome fermentation metabolite that exhibits anti-inflammatory and  bactericidal activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247644>Fermented soybean meal ameliorates Salmonella Typhimurium infection in young broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>The present study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of dietary fermented soybean meal (FSBM) in comparison with prebiotic (Xylooligosaccharide; XOS) and probiotic (Lactic  bacteria-based probiotic; LAC) for prevention of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) infection in young broiler chickens from 1 to 24 d. The in vitro study revealed that soybean meal (SBM) fermentation increased the number of lactic  bacteria (LAB) and lactic  content and inhibited the growth of enterobacteria such as coliforms in SBM. A total of 450 day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were placed in 30 pens (15 birds/pen) and allocated to 5 experimental treatments that consisted an un-supplemented basal diet and not infected (NC) or infected with ST (IC); IC plus 2 g XOS/kg; IC plus 0.2 g LAC/kg; and IC containing a complete replacement of SBM with FSBM. All birds (except NC) were orally administered with 0.5 mL of the ST solution (1 × 106 CFU/mL) at d 3 post-hatch. The ST challenge decreased body weight gain and feed intake (P < 0.05). The impairment of feed conversion ratio was alleviated by the addition of XOS, LAC, and FSBM in broiler diets compared with IC birds (P < 0.05). The ST infection reduced duodenum and jejunum villus height and increased Salmonella  throughout the gut as well as internal organ invasion compared with NC birds (P < 0.05). However, ST-infected broilers fed the XOS, LAC, and FSBM-containing diets showed a significant decrease in gut Salmonella , and internal organ invasion, an increase in LAB counts, and improvement in intestinal mucosa morphology (P < 0.05). The tested feed additives or FSBM reduced heterophil to lymphocyte ratio compared with the IC group (P < 0.05). The results suggest that XOS, LAC, and FSBM improve growth performance, lower Salmonella , and improve intestinal characteristics and immune response in ST-challenged broiler chicks. Therefore, fermented feeds due to having functional ingredients can be considered as an effective strategy to lessen the  of gut pathogens in broiler chickens.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379755>Archaeal Communities in Deep Terrestrial Subsurface Underneath the Deccan Traps, India.</a></h1><p>Archaeal community structure and potential functions within the deep, aphotic, oligotrophic, hot, igneous provinces of ∼65 Myr old basalt and its Archean granitic basement was explored through archaeal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from extracted environmental DNA of rocks. Rock core samples from three distinct horizons, basaltic (BS), transition (weathered granites) (TZ) and granitic (GR) showed limited organic carbon (4-48 mg/kg) and varied concentrations (<1.0-5000 mg/kg) of sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, iron and metal oxides. Quantitative PCR estimated the presence of nearly 10-10 archaeal cells per gram of rock. Archaeal communities within BS and GR horizons were distinct. The absence of any common OTU across the samples indicated restricted dispersal of archaeal cells.

Changes in diversity pattern among the BS and GR horizons highlighted the significance of local rock geochemistry, particularly the availability of organic carbon, FeO and other nutrients as well as physical constraints (temperature and pressure) in a niche-specific  of extremophilic archaeal communities. The study provided the first deep sequencing-based illustration of an intricate association between diverse extremophilic groups (acidophile-halophile-methanogenic), capable of sulfur/iron/methane metabolism and thus shed new light on their potential role in biogeochemical cycles and energy flow in deep biosphere hosted by hot, oligotrophic igneous crust.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176179>Composition and function of soil fungal community during the establishment of Quercus acutissima (Carruth.) seedlings in a Cd-contaminated soil.</a></h1><p>This study was designed to explore the functions of soil fungal communities in the Cd tolerance of Q. acutissima seedling. Three Cd levels of 15, 30, and 40 mg kg were set up using the soils collected from Q. acutissima forests. The benomyl was applied to inhibit the fungal communities in the soil. Following a 100-day pot cultivation of Q. acutissima seedlings, the plant growth, Cd content, N uptake, and fungal communities were evaluated. The results showed that the root dry weights were significantly reduced after the benomyl addition at the Cd concentrations of 30 and 40 mg kg. Root fungi  was enhanced under higher Cd concentrations when soil fungi are present (without the benomyl treatment). The fungi associated with root increased the Cd accumulation in the roots while decreased the Cd transfer to the shoot at 40 mg Cd kg. The N enrichment in root tip was positively correlated with enzyme activities of soil catalase and urease. And the activities of  phosphatase, catalase, and urease were inhibited at each Cd level. The abundance of the dominant fungal genus differed in their response to Cd contamination. The ectomycorrhizal fungi of Tomentella and Cortinarius were identified under the higher Cd levels (40 mg kg). Our results implied Tomentella and Cortinarius could be applied to enhance the capacity of Quercus acutissima in the bioremediation of Cd polluted soil.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It plays an important role in gut microbiota and immunity. This paper provides a critical overview of experimental studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical) investigating the efficacy of glutamine and its effect on gut microbiota. As a result of this review, we have summarized that glutamine could affect gut microbiota via different mechanisms including the reduction in the ratio of  to  with the activation of NF-κB and PI3K-Akt pathways, reducing the intestinal  ( lesions) and bacterial overgrowth or bacterial translocation, increasing the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and immunoglobulin A+ (IgA) cells in the intestinal lumen, and decreasing asparagine levels. The potential applications of glutamine on gut microbiota include, but are not limited to, the management of obesity, bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods.

Low-molecular weight metabolites produced within plant tissues, such as salicylic , represent one such mechanism which likely mediates plant - microbe interactions above and below ground. Salicylic  is a ubiquitous phytohormone at low levels in most plants, yet are concentrated defense compounds in Populus, likely acting as a selective filter for rhizosphere microbiomes. We propagated twelve Populus trichocarpa genotypes which varied an order of magnitude in salicylic  (SA)-related secondary metabolites, in contrasting soils from two different origins. After four months of growth, plant properties (leaf growth, chlorophyll content, and net photosynthetic rate) and plant root metabolomics specifically targeting SA metabolites were measured via GC-MS. In addition, rhizosphere microbiome composition was measured via Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S and ITS2 rRNA-genes.Soil origin was the primary filter causing divergence in bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities with plant genotype secondarily influential. Both bacterial/archaeal and fungal evenness varied between soil origins and bacterial/archaeal diversity and evenness correlated with at least one SA metabolite (diversity: populin; evenness: total phenolics). The production of individual salicylic  derivatives that varied by host genotype resulted in compositional differences for bacteria /archaea (tremuloidin) and fungi (salicylic ) within one soil origin (Clatskanie) whereas soils from Corvallis did not illicit microbial compositional changes due to salicylic  derivatives. Several dominant bacterial (e.g., Betaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadete, Firmicutes) and one fungal phyla (Mortierellomycota) also correlated with specific SA secondary metabolites; bacterial phyla exhibited more negative interactions (declining abundance with increasing metabolite concentration) than positive interactions.These results indicate microbial communities diverge most among soil origin. However, within a soil origin, bacterial/archaeal communities are responsive to plant SA production within greenhouse-based rhizosphere microbiomes. Fungal microbiomes are impacted by root SA-metabolites, but overall to a lesser degree within this experimental context. These results suggest plant defense strategies, such as SA and its secondary metabolites, may partially drive patterns of both bacterial/archaeal and fungal taxa-specific  and assembly.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276498>Microbial metabolite deoxycholic  shapes microbiota against Campylobacter jejuni chicken .</a></h1><p>Despite reducing the prevalent foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni in chickens decreases campylobacteriosis, few effective approaches are available. The aim of this study was to use microbial metabolic product bile  to reduce C. jejuni chicken . Broiler chicks were fed with deoxycholic  (DCA), lithocholic  (LCA), or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). The birds were also transplanted with DCA modulated anaerobes (DCA-Anaero) or aerobes (DCA-Aero). The birds were infected with human clinical isolate C. jejuni 81-176 or chicken isolate C. jejuni AR101. Notably, C. jejuni 81-176 was readily colonized intestinal tract at d16 and reached an almost plateau at d21. Remarkably, DCA excluded C. jejuni cecal  below the limit of detection at 16 and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or UDCA altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken  level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28. Notably, DCA diet reduced phylum Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes compared to infected control birds.

However, little information is available regarding the cytological mechanisms of powdery mildew resistance in these wild relatives. Here, we studied the cytological responses of three wild Chinese grapevine accessions after they were infected with E. necator (En) NAFU1 in comparison to the susceptible V. vinifera cv. 'Thompson Seedless' grape. The hyphal growth and sporulation of En NAFU1 were significantly restricted in wild species compared to 'Thompson Seedless', which appears to be associated with early cell wall deposition at the attempt sites, encasement of haustoria, and hypersensitive response-like cell death of penetrated epidermal cells. Moreover, endogenous free salicylic  (SA) was more abundant in wild Chinese Vitis species than in 'Thompson Seedless' under pathogen-free condition. During En NAFU1 , SA conjugates accumulated higher in wild grapevines than in 'Thompson Seedless'. In addition, the species-specific expression patterns of defense-associated genes during En NAFU1  indicated that mechanisms underlying powdery mildew resistance are divergent among different wild Chinese Vitis species.

Suilysin, a pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of  infections. It is known that infection with influenza A viruses may favor susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection, resulting in more severe disease and increased mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these coinfections are incompletely understood. Applying highly differentiated primary porcine respiratory epithelial cells grown under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions, we analyzed the contribution of swine influenza viruses (SIV) to the virulence of , with a special focus on its cytolytic toxin, suilysin. We found that during secondary bacterial infection, suilysin of  contributed to the damage of well-differentiated respiratory epithelial cells in the early stage of infection, whereas the cytotoxic effects induced by SIV became prominent at later stages of infection. Prior infection by SIV enhanced the adherence to and  of porcine airway epithelial cells by a wild-type (wt)  strain and a suilysin-negative  mutant in a sialic -dependent manner. A striking difference was observed with respect to bacterial invasion. After bacterial monoinfection, only the wt  strain showed an invasive phenotype, whereas the mutant remained adherent. When the epithelial cells were preinfected with SIV, the suilysin-negative mutant also showed an invasion capacity. Therefore, we propose that coinfection with SIV may compensate for the lack of suilysin in the adherence and invasion process of suilysin-negative .Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680258>Effect of endophytic Bacillus megaterium  on structure strengthening, microbial community, chemical composition and stabilization properties of Hybrid Pennisetum.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to analyze the effects of endophytic Bacillus megaterium (BM 18-2)  on structure strengthening, microbial community, chemical composition and stabilization properties of Hybrid Pennisetum.The BM 18-2 had successfully colonized in the interior tissues in both leaf and stem of Hybrid Pennisetum.

Prey identification is fundamental for correlating the diet with the presence of particular microbial groups. The present study examined how diet influenced the composition and function of the gut microbiota of the Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii) in order to better understand the role of prey consumption in shaping its microbiota. This species is a good indicator of the quality of the local environment due to both its foraging and haul-out site fidelity. DNA was extracted from 20 fecal samples collected from five harbor seal colonies located in Baja California, Mexico. The V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina technology. Results showed that the gut microbiota of the harbor seals was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes (37%), Bacteroidetes (26%) and Fusobacteria (26%) and revealed significant differences in its composition among the colonies. Funtional analysis using the PICRUSt software suggests a high number of pathways involved in the basal metabolism, such as those for carbohydrates (22%) and amino  (20%), and those related to the degradation of persistent environmental pollutants. In addition, a DNA metabarcoding analysis of the same samples, via the amplification and sequencing of the mtRNA 16S and rRNA 18S genes, was used to identify the prey consumed by harbor seals revealing the consumption of prey with mainly demersal habits. Functional redundancy in the seal gut microbiota was observed, irrespective of diet or location. Our results indicate that the frequency of occurrence of specific prey in the harbor seal diet plays an important role in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota of harbor seals by influencing the relative abundance of specific groups of gut microorganisms.

The IHC scores of ZO-1 and Occludin in HP group was significantly lower than NC group (all 0.05), and that of ZO-1 and Occludin in the HP+SC group increased compared with HP group [(2.00±0.26) vs (1.17±0.48), 0.05; (3.50±0.43) vs (2.33±0.21), 0.05]. Compared with NC group, the diversity of gastric microbiota in HP group was significantly lower, and diversity of gut microbiota decreased insignificantly. There was no significant difference between HP+SC group and HP group in gastric or gut microbiota.  SC reduces  , protects -induced gastric mucosal injury, decreases -induced IL-8 expression, enhances Occludin. However, its effects on -induced gastrointestinal microbiota disorders are limited.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309500>Using Hemagglutination, Surface Shearing, and  Treatment to Study Fimbriae in Proteus mirabilis.</a></h1><p>A critical first step in bacterial virulence and  is adherence to mucosal surfaces, often mediated by fimbriae and other protein adhesins. Here are described three short methods for studying these surface proteins and their behaviors, using protocols developed for the opportunistic pathogen Proteus mirabilis. Unlike the mannose-binding type 1 fimbriae produced by Escherichia coli, most P. mirabilis strains produce mannose-resistant/Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae. Both types of fimbrial production and adhesion can be easily demonstrated by a simple and economical hemagglutination assay which uses a model system of erythrocytes. The second and third fimbrial methods presented here show how to shear surface-exposed proteins and use  treatment to separate interlocked fimbrial subunits into monomers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220352>Neuroinflammation in Murine Cirrhosis Is Dependent on the Gut Microbiome and Is Attenuated by Fecal Transplant.</a></h1><p>Cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with an altered gut-liver-brain axis. Fecal microbial transplant (FMT) after antibiotics improves outcomes in HE, but the impact on brain function is unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of  using human donors in germ-free (GF) mice on the gut-liver-brain axis. GF and conventional mice were made cirrhotic using carbon tetrachloride and compared with controls in GF and conventional state. Additional GF mice were colonized with stool from controls (Ctrl-Hum) and patients with cirrhosis (Cirr-Hum). Stools from patients with HE cirrhosis after antibiotics were pooled (pre-FMT). Stools from the same patients 15 days after FMT from a healthy donor were also pooled (post-FMT). Sterile supernatants were created from pre-FMT and post-FMT samples. GF mice were colonized using stools/sterile supernatants. For all mice, frontal cortex, liver, and small/large intestines were collected. Cortical inflammation, synaptic plasticity and gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) signaling, and liver inflammation and intestinal 16s ribosomal RNA microbiota sequencing were performed. Conventional cirrhotic mice had higher degrees of neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, GABA signaling, and intestinal dysbiosis compared with other groups. Cirr-Hum mice had greater neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, and GABA signaling and lower synaptic plasticity compared with Ctrl-Hum mice. This was associated with greater dysbiosis but no change in liver histology. Pre-FMT material  was associated with neuroinflammation and microglial activation and dysbiosis, which was reduced significantly with post-FMT samples. Sterile pre-FMT and post-FMT supernatants did not affect brain parameters. Liver inflammation was unaffected. Conclusion: Fecal microbial  from patients with cirrhosis results in higher degrees of neuroinflammation and activation of GABAergic and neuronal activation in mice regardless of cirrhosis compared with those from healthy humans. Reduction in neuroinflammation by using samples from post-FMT patients to colonize GF mice shows a direct effect of fecal microbiota independent of active liver inflammation or injury.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271109>Di--butyl phthalate degrading endophytic bacterium  strain JR20 isolated from garlic chive and its  in a leafy vegetable.</a></h1><p>Di--butyl phthalate (DBP) is one of the primary PAEs (phthalate  esters) pollutants. DBP can be absorbed by plants and threaten human health via the food chain. Some DBP-degrading bacteria have been successfully isolated from the environment (water, soil, etc.). However, only a few DBP-degrading plant endophytes have been isolated. In this study, an endophytic bacterium,  subsp. strain JR20, which was found capable of degrading DBP, was isolated from garlic chive. We found that strain JR20 metabolized 89.74% of DBP at a 5 mg/L concentration within 4 d in liquid mineral salts medium (MSM). The optimized conditions for maximum removal of DBP were as follows: DBP concentration, 5 mg/L; pH, 7-8; temperature, 30-40 °C. The  of strain JR20 significantly improved the degradation rate of DBP in the roots, stems and leaves of leafy vegetables.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310520>Targeted Acquisition of  f. sp.  Toxin-Deficient Mutant and Its Effects on Watermelon  Wilt.</a></h1><p>Watermelon  wilt is a common soil-borne disease that has significantly affected its yield. In this study, fusaric -deficient mutant designated as ΔFUBT (mutated from  f. sp. , FON) was obtained. The ΔFUBT mutant showed significant decrease in fusaric  production but maintained wild-type characteristics, such as in vitro colony morphology, size, and conidiation. A field pot experiment demonstrated that ΔFUBT could successfully colonize the rhizosphere and the roots of watermelon, leading to significant reduction in FON  in the watermelon plant. In addition, ΔFUBT inoculation significantly improved the rhizosphere microenvironment and effectively increased the resistance in watermelon. This study demonstrated that a nonpathogenic  mutant (ΔFUBT) could be developed as an effective microbial control agent to alleviate  wilt disease in watermelon and increase its yield.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504685>Feeding Mode, but Not Prebiotics, Affects Colonic Microbiota Composition and Volatile Fatty  Concentrations in Sow-Reared, Formula-Fed, and Combination-Fed Piglets.</a></h1><p>Many infants consume both human milk and infant formula (combination-fed); however, little is known about how combination-feeding affects the gut microbiota or prebiotic fermentation compared to formula feeding.We investigated the impact of feeding mode and prebiotics on bacterial  and volatile fatty  (VFA) concentrations.Newborn piglets (Large White and Landrace) were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n = 6/group): formula-fed (FF), formula-fed with prebiotics (FP), sow-reared (SR), combination-fed (CF), and combination-fed with prebiotics (CP). SR piglets remained with the sows 24 h/d. FF and FP were fed formula or formula with galactooligosaccharide and inulin (4 g/L in a 4:1 ratio). CF and CP were sow-reared for 5 d and then rotated between the sow and formula-feeding every 12 h. Ascending colon contents were collected at day 21. The microbiota was analyzed by pyrosequencing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). VFAs were determined by gas chromatography.Distance-based redundancy analysis of DGGE and pyrosequencing data separated microbiota of FF from CF and SR. CF differed from SR by DGGE, but only a trend (P = 0.09) by pyrosequencing. Bacterial composition of CF was more similar to SR than FF. No bacterial genera in CF significantly differed from SR; however, 9 genera differed between CF and FF, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium XIVa, and Fusobacterium. VFA concentrations were similar between CF and SR, while isovalerate and isobutyrate were 2-fold greater (P  < 0.05) in CF than FF. Neither microbiota nor VFA profile was affected by prebiotic supplementation.Microbial  patterns and VFA profiles of CF piglets were more similar to SR piglets than FF piglets. Prebiotics did not affect piglet bacterial composition and/or VFA concentrations relative to the main feeding modes (FF and CF). Thus, partial exposure to breast milk can be beneficial for microbiota development of FF neonates.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376060>Prevalence, virulence attributes, and antibiogram of Bordetella avium isolated from turkeys in Egypt.</a></h1><p>Turkey coryza is a major respiratory disease caused by Bordetella avium (B. avium). It occurs in all ages of turkeys and is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality rates. The present study aimed firstly at determination of the prevalence rates of B. avium in turkeys reared in Egypt at different ages using various diagnostic methods including clinical examination, histopathology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), bacterial culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using PCR, virulence-associated genes were detected in the confirmed B. avium isolates. Furthermore, the antibiotic resistance profiles of the confirmed B. avium isolates were examined. The achieved results indicated isolation and identification of B. avium infection at different ages of turkeys reared in Egypt. The overall PCR-confirmed prevalence rate of B. avium was 22.95%. The identified B. avium strains harbored virulence-associated genes responsible for  in the respiratory tract of turkeys including Bordetella virulence gene (100%), fimbriae (71.14%), and filamentous hemagglutinin (85.68%). The isolated B. avium strains showed multidrug resistance profiles. B. avium isolates were resistant to penicillin (92.82%), ceftiofur (85.68%), nalidixic  (78.54%), and lincomycin (71.40%). The identified B. avium strains showed clear sensitivities to both gentamicin and neomycin, suggesting these as possible antimicrobial candidates for the control of B. avium infection in turkeys.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514333>Identification of Long Non-Coding RNAs and the Regulatory Network Responsive to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi  in Maize Roots.</a></h1><p>Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as vital regulators of many biological processes in animals and plants. However, to our knowledge no investigations on plant lncRNAs which respond to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have been reported thus far. In this study, maize roots colonized with AM fungus were analyzed by strand-specific RNA-Seq to identify AM fungi-responsive lncRNAs and construct an associated regulatory network. A total of 1837 differentially expressed protein coding genes (DEGs) were identified from maize roots with  inoculation. Many AM fungi-responsive genes were homologs to , , , , and enriched pathways such as fatty  biosynthesis, response to phosphate starvation, and nitrogen metabolism are consistent with previous studies. In total, 5941 lncRNAs were identified, of which more than 3000 were new. Of those, 63 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. The putative target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were mainly related to phosphate ion transmembrane transport, cellular response to potassium ion starvation, and lipid catabolic processes. Regulatory network analysis showed that DELs might be involved in the regulation of bidirectional nutrient exchange between plant and AM fungi as mimicry of microRNA targets. The results of this study can broaden our knowledge on the interaction between plant and AM fungi.</p></html>
