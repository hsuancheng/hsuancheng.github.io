Female ICR mice, KM mice, and SD rats were treated by cyclophosphamide at 120 mg/kg, busulfan at 12 mg/kg, cisplatin at 3 or 4 mg/kg,  diepoxide at 160 mg/kg, 35% galactose food pellet, and tripterygium glycosides at 50 mg/kg, respectively. Parameters were analyzed by , serum concentration level of related hormones, ovarian and uterine pathological examination. The results indicated the  of mice increased very slowly following single dose of cyclophosphamide (p < 0.05) with damaged ovary; repeated doses of cisplatin could induce  significantly decreased (p < 0.01) with a rising trend of serum LH concentration, declining tendency of serum E2 concentration and injured ovary and uterus;  diepoxide also hindered the mice growing (p < 0.05) with damaged ovary and uterus; the  of mice feed by 35% galactose food pellet increased slowly (p < 0.05) with dramatically higher serum concentration level of galactose, albumin, and total protein (p < 0.001) and injured ovary. Busulfan and tripterygium glycosides did not present obvious evidences. In conclusion, the inducers presented their respective features in such animal models and should be appropriately applied in preventive methods.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we reported that a modified formulation of STH, Sutaehwan-Gami, has phytoestrogen-like properties in an ovariectomized menopausal rat model. However, the therapeutic effects of STH and the precise mechanisms by which STH affects various menopausal symptoms remain poorly understood. The current study was designed to explore the effects of a modified form of STH on menopausal anxiety, depression and heart hypertrophy and its mechanisms in  diepoxide (VCD)-induced menopausal mouse models. VCD-induced menopausal model mice were fed a modified form of STH, which contained water extract of 3 herbs (called STH_KP17001) at a dose of 100 or 300 mg/kg/d or as a positive control, estradiol at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/d with standard mouse pellets for 13 weeks. The results show that STH_KP17001 significantly restored the VCD-induced  reduction of uterine and ovary through the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) in the uterus and ovary. Moreover, STH_KP17001 showed slight proliferative effects and estrogen receptor α phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells. Treatment with STH_KP17001 reversed VCD-induced anxiety and depression through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the cerebral cortex, while improving heart hypertrophy through inactivation of inhibitor of kappaB α (IκBα) in the heart. The results indicate that STH_KP17001 improves menopause-induced anxiety, depression and heart hypertrophy, implying its protective role for the management of menopausal symptoms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27264932>Glucose homeostasis in rats treated with  diepoxide is not worsened by dexamethasone treatment.</a></h1><p>4-vinilcyclohexene diepoxide (4-VCD) causes premature ovarian failure and may result in estrogen deficiency, characterizing the transition to estropause in rodents (equivalent to menopause in women). Estropause/menopause is associated with metabolic derangements such as glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known to exert diabetogenic effects. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether rats with premature ovarian failure are more prone to the diabetogenic effects of GC. For this, immature female rats received daily injections of 4-VCD [160mg/kg  (b.w.), intraperitoneally (i.p.)] for 15 consecutive days, whereas control rats received vehicle. After 168days of the completion of 4-VCD administration, rats were divided into 4 groups: CTL-received daily injections of saline (1mL/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5days; DEX-received daily injections of dexamethasone (1mg/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5days; VCD-treated as CTL group; VCD+DEX-treated as DEX group. Experiments and euthanasia occurred one day after the last dexamethasone injection. 4-VCD-treated rats exhibited ovary hypotrophy and reduced number of preantral follicles (p<0.05). Premature ovarian failure had no impact on the  gain or food intake, but both were reduced by the effects of dexamethasone. The increase in blood glucose, plasma insulin and triacylglycerol levels as well as the reduction in insulin sensitivity caused by dexamethasone treatment was not exacerbated in the VCD+DEX group of rats. Premature ovarian failure did change neither the hepatic content of glycogen and triacylglycerol nor the glycerol release from perigonadal adipose tissue. Glucose intolerance was observed in the VCD group after an ipGTT (p<0.05), but not after an oral glucose challenge. Glucose intolerance and compensatory pancreatic β-cell mass caused by GC were not modified by ovarian failure in the VCD+DEX group. We conclude that reduced ovarian function has no major implications on the diabetogenic effects promoted by GC treatment, indicating that other factors related to aging may make rats more vulnerable to GC side effects on glucose metabolism.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, there is a risk of developing complications such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and ovarian cancer. Schisandrae Fructus (SF) is widely used in Korean medicine as a cure for such complications. This study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of SF against menopause symptoms associated with follicle depletion caused by the industrial chemical  diepoxide (VCD) in mice. VCD directly targets the preantral follicles. Mice were injected with VCD (160 mg/kg intraperitoneally) daily for 15 days and then with SF dosage 3 times/week for six weeks. To evaluate the effects of SF, , tail skin temperature, uterine , lipid profile, and osteocalcin levels were measured. A decrease in  and tail skin temperature and an increase in uterine  were observed upon SF treatment. Moreover, SF treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglyceride, osteocalcin, and low-density lipoprotein levels and low-density/high-density lipoprotein ratio. These results suggest the potential use of SF in the treatment of menopausal symptoms in women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797918>[Effects of electroacupuncture at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and "Tianshu" (ST 25) on ovarian function in rats with premature ovarian insufficiency].</a></h1><p>To explore the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and "Tianshu" (ST 25) on ovarian function in rats with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).A total of 48 SD female rats with regular estrus were divided into a blank group (=8), a model group (=10), an EA group (=10), a binding group (=10) and a tamoxifen (TAM) group (=10). The rats in the model group, EA group, binding group and TAM group were all treated with intraperitoneal injection of  diepoxide (VCD, 160 mg/kg) for 15 consecutive days to establish the model of POI; the rats in the blank group were treated with normal diet. After the model was established successfully, the rats in the EA group were treated with EA at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and "Tianshu" (ST 25) with continuous wave (1 to 3 Hz, 0.1 to 1 mA) for 20 minutes, once a day (five times a week) for the first two weeks and once every other day (three times a week) for the following two weeks. The rats in the TAM group were treated with subcutaneous injection of tamoxifen (1mg/kg), once a day (five times a week) for the first two weeks and once every other day (three times a week) for the following two weeks. The rats in the binding group were bound by a small sack as the EA group. The rats in the blank group and the model group were treated with normal diet. After four weeks, the sexual gland  and index were tested in each group; the ELISA method was applied to test the level of anti-mllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B; the morphology of ovary was observed; the number of primordial follicles, primary follicle, antral follicle and atretic follicle was counted; the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) were measured.(1) Compared with the blank group, the ovary , ovary index, uterus  and uterus index were significantly decreased after treatment in the model group, EA group, binding group and TAM group (all <0.01); but the differences between the model group and the EA group, binding group, TAM group were not significant (all >0.05). (2) Compared with the blank group, the levels of serum AMH, inhibin B and E were significantly reduced; the levels of FSH and LH were significantly increased in the model group; EA group, binding group and TAM group (all <0.01). Compared with the model group, the levels of serum AMH, inhibin B and E were significantly increased, the level of FSH and LH were significantly reduced in the EA group and TAM group (all <0.01). (3) Compared with the blank group, in the model group, EA group, binding group and TAM group the ovary was dark red and pale, surrounded by particle or not; the morphology was small and atrophic; the primordial follicles was reduced even vanished; the structure of primary follicle was damaged and loosely arranged; the mature follicle was few; the atretic follicle and interstitial gland were increased. (4) Compared with the blank group, the expressions of IGF-1 mRNA and IGF-1R mRNA were increased in the model group (all <0.01); compared with the blank group, the expression of IGF-1 mRNA was increased in the binding group (<0.05), but that of IGF-1R mRNA was not significantly different (>0.05); compared with the model group, the expression of IGF-1 mRNA was not significantly different in the EA group, binding group and TAM group (all >0.05), but that of IGF-1R mRNA was reduced (<0.05, <0.01).EA at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and "Tianshu" (ST 25) has improvement effect on ovarian function in rats with VCD-induced POI, which is likely to be related to regulating the IGF-1R mRNA expression to improve the IGF-1/ IGF-1R axis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29396126>Use of the REVERT total protein stain as a loading control demonstrates significant benefits over the use of housekeeping proteins when analyzing brain homogenates by Western blot: An analysis of samples representing different gonadal hormone states.</a></h1><p>Western blot is routinely used to quantify differences in the levels of target proteins in tissues. Standard methods typically use measurements of housekeeping proteins to control for variations in loading and protein transfer. This is problematic, however, when housekeeping proteins also are affected by experimental conditions such as injury, disease, and/or gonadal hormone manipulations. Our goal was to evaluate an alternative and perhaps superior method for conducting Western blot analysis of brain tissue homogenates from rats with distinct physiologically relevant gonadal hormone states. Tissues were collected from the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum of young adult female rats that either were ovariectomized to model surgical menopause, or were treated with the ovatotoxin  diepoxide (VCD) to model transitional menopause. Tissues also were collected from rats with a normal estrous cycle killed at proestrus when estradiol levels are high, and at diestrus when estradiol levels are low. Western blot detection of α-tubulin, β-actin, and GAPDH was performed and were compared for sensitivity and reliability with a fluorescent total protein stain (REVERT). Results show that the total protein stain was much less variable across samples and had a greater linear range than α-tubulin, β-actin, or GAPDH. The stain was stable and easy to use, and did not interfere with the immunodetection or multiplexed detection of the housekeeping proteins. In addition, we show that normalization of our data to total protein, but not to GAPDH, revealed significant differences in α-tubulin expression in the hippocampus as a function of treatment, and that gel-to-gel consistency in measuring differences between paired samples run on multiple gels was significantly better when data were normalized to total protein than when normalized to GAPDH. These results demonstrate that the REVERT total protein stain can be used in Western blot analysis of brain tissue homogenates to control for variations in loading and protein transfer, and provides significant advantages over the use of housekeeping proteins for quantifying changes in the levels of multiple target proteins.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The rats in the model group, EA group and immobilization group were treated with intraperitoneal injection of  diepoxide (160 mg/kg) for 15 days to establish the model. From the beginning of model establishment, the rats in the EA group were treated with EA pretreatment at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and "Tianshu" (ST 25), once a day for the first two weeks (5 treatments per week) and once every two days for the last two weeks (3 treatments per week). EA was given 20 min per treatment for four weeks. The rats in the immobilization group were treated with immobilization with identical duration, frequency and total amount as the EA group. No treatment was given in the blank group and model group. When model was successfully established in the model group, rats were sacrificed to test the  of sexual gland and the sexual gland index; the ELISA method was applied to test the level of anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B; the radioimmunoassay method was applied to test the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E), progesterone (P) and testosterone (T). In addition, the morphology and the number of ovarian follicles were observed; and western blot method was applied to test the expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in ovarian tissue.Compared with the blank group, the bilateral ovary , ovary index, uterus  and uterus index decreased (<0.05, <0.01); serum AMH, inhibin B, E and P reduced, while serum FSH, LH and T increased in the model group (all <0.01); primordial follicles and primary follicles decreased, while atretic follicles increased in the model group (all <0.01); the expression of Bax protein increased, while the expression of Bcl-2 protein decreased in the model group (both <0.01). Compared with the model group, the bilateral ovary , ovary index and uterus  increased (<0.05, <0.01); serum AMH, inhibin B, E and P increased, while serum FSH and LH reduced (<0.05, <0.01); primordial follicles and primary follicles increased, while atretic follicles reduced (<0.05, <0.01); the expression of Bax protein reduced, while the expression of Bcl-2 protein increased in the EA group (<0.05, <0.01). The differences of each outcome indexes were not significant between the model group and immobilization group (all >0.05).EA pretreatment at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and Tianshu (ST 25) for 4 weeks has certain protective effect on ovarian in POI rats, which is likely to be related with up-regulating ovarian granular cells, inhabiting the expression of Bcl-2 protein and down-regulating the expression of Bax protein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27892789> diepoxide disrupts sperm characteristics, endocrine balance and redox status in testes and epididymis of rats.</a></h1><p>Exposure to  diepoxide (VCD) was reported to induce testicular germ cell toxicity in rodents. However, there is paucity of information on the precise biochemical and molecular mechanisms of VCD-induced male reproductive toxicity.This study investigated the influence of VCD on testicular and epidydimal functions following oral exposure of Wistar rats to VCD at 0, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg for 28 consecutive days.Administration of VCD significantly decreased the  gain and organo-somatic indices of the testes and epididymis. When compared with the control, VCD significantly decreased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the testes whereas it significantly decreased superoxide dismutase activity but increased catalase activity in the epididymis. Moreover, while glutathione peroxidase activity and glutathione level remain unaffected, exposure of rats to VCD significantly increased glutathione S-transferase activity as well as hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde levels in testes and epididymis of the treated rats. The spermiogram of VCD-treated rats showed significant decrease in epididymal sperm count, sperm progressive motility, testicular sperm number and daily sperm production when compared with the control. Administration of VCD significantly decreased circulatory concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone along with testicular and epididymal degeneration in the treated rats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly increased cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, caspase-9 and caspase-3 protein expressions in the testes of VCD-treated rats.Exposure to VCD induces testicular and epidydimal dysfunctions via endocrine suppression, disruption of antioxidant enzymes activities, increase in biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25671506>Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on follicular dynamics in a diminished ovarian reserve in vivo model.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine whether there are changes in primary, primordial, and growing follicles after dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administration in rats that have diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) due to  diepoxide (VCD) application, and to examine the mechanism of the probable effect of DHEA on folliculogenesis. Two groups of Wistar rats were used. In Group A unilateral oophorectomy (eight rats) was carried out on day-0. The remaining study ovary was removed by relaparotomy after VCD (160 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered for 15 days. In Group B unilateral oophorectomy (eight rats) was carried out on day-0. The remaining study ovary was removed by relaparotomy after VCD (160 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) administration for 15 days followed by DHEA (60 mg/kg ) daily for 45 days. Primordial, primary, and growing (secondary+antral) follicles were counted in 1,664 sections from 32 ovaries. In all three types of follicles (primordial, primary, and growing), the number of follicles significantly decreased in the study ovaries compared to the control ovaries in both Group A and Group B. In Group B, atresia rates were significantly lower in the study ovary compared to the control ovary in all of the follicular groups: primordial (p=0.02), primary (p=0.01), and growing (p=.027). To demonstrate the probable effects of DHEA on follicular dynamics, we also compared the study ovaries in both groups; the primordial (p=0.027), primary (p=0.031), and growing (p=0.04) number of follicles were significantly higher in Group B compared to Group A. In conclusion, our findings suggest that DHEA administration in DOR rats due to VCD results in a larger follicular pool. Decreased atresia may be one of the possible effects of DHEA in DOR cases. Whatever the mechanism, DHEA treatment potentially may be useful clinically as a means to increase the number of gonadotropin-responsive follicles for ovarian stimulation.</p></html>
