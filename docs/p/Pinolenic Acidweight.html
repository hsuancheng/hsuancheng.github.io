Studies were conducted with tall oil fatty acids (TOFA) to determine their effect on broiler chicken performance and ileal microbiota. TOFA, a product originating from coniferous trees and recovered by fractional distillation of side-streams from pulp production, mainly comprises free long-chain fatty acids (~90%) and resin acids (~8%). Conjugated linolenic acids and  are characteristic fatty acid components of TOFA. 2. TOFA products at 750 mg/kg feed were tested in two 35-day broiler chicken trials, each using a wheat soya-based diet and with 12 replicate pens per treatment. In both trials, TOFA improved  gain at all time points (P < 0.001) and feed conversion efficiency during the first 21 days (P < 0.01). Two different dry TOFA formulations (silica carrier and palm oil coating) were tested and showed performance effects similar to liquid TOFA. 3. Ileal digesta of the broiler chickens was analysed for total eubacteria, Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens on days 14 and 35. TOFA significantly increased total eubacteria and lactobacilli density on day 14 (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between these bacterial groups and broiler  on day 14 (P < 0.01). 4. A numerical reduction in C. perfringens was observed. In vitro growth inhibition studies showed that C. perfringens was strongly inhibited by 10 mg/l TOFA (P < 0.001), while common lactobacilli were resistant to >250 mg/l. The in vitro results were thus in line with in vivo observations. 5. The mechanisms behind the bacterial shifts and their role in performance improvement are unknown. Further purification of TOFA components is needed to identify the effective agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404957>Preparation of  Concentrates from Pine Nut Oil Fatty Acids by Solvent Fractionation.</a></h1><p> (PLA), which is a fatty acid (FA) exclusively found in the oils of edible pine nuts, has an appetite-suppression effect, thereby being effective to reduce  in humans. PLA concentrates would be suitable for use in functional foods and nutraceuticals due to the health benefits of PLA. PLA concentrates were prepared from free FA (FFA) obtained from pine nut oil using solvent fractionation. Siberian pine nut oil containing 18.3 wt% PLA was used as the starting material for the fractionation. The fractionation was performed in n-hexane at ultra-low temperatures down to -85°C. The PLA concentrates produced under the optimal conditions established in this study (temperature, -85°C; n-hexane-to-FFA ratio (v/w), 30:1; fractionation time, 36 h) contained 69.8 wt% PLA. The yield of PLA was 77.4 wt% of the initial PLA  in the FFA. These results suggest that solvent fractionation is a more effective approach to prepare PLA concentrates with higher PLA contents at a particular yield of PLA than published methods using urea crystallization (e.g., PLA content = ~47 wt%, yield of PLA = ~77 wt%, Woo et al. (2016)) or lipase-catalyzed reactions (e.g., PLA content = ~30 wt%, yield of PLA = ~61 wt%, Lee et al. (2011)). The resulting PLA concentrates contained 11 of the 12 different species of FA present in the FFA, thereby indicating that the PLA concentrates prepared by solvent fractionation have more diverse FA profiles than those prepared by urea crystallization (e.g., 7 species of FA, Woo et al. (2016)).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29424439>Divergent Response of Murine and Porcine Adipocytes to Stimulation of Browning Genes by 18-Carbon Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Beta-Receptor Agonists.</a></h1><p>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are known to activate brown and beige adipocytes. However, very little is known about the effects of the number and the position of double bonds in LCFA with the same length on brown fat-specific gene expression. To determine the specificity of LCFA in the regulation of these genes in different adipocyte models, fully differentiated 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, murine, or porcine primary adipocytes (obtained from the subcutaneous fat pad of C57BL/6 mice or Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc crossbred piglets) were treated with 50 μM of the following 18-carbon fatty acids: stearic acid (STA; 18:0), oleic acid (OLA; 18:1, Δ9), linoleic acid (LNA; 18:2, Δ9,12), α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3, Δ9,12,15), γ-linolenic acid (GLA; 18:3, Δ6,9,12), or  (PLA; 18:3, Δ5,9,12) for 24 h with or without 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty acid effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty acid and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation. These results indicate that different adipocyte cell types have different levels of sensitivity to both LCFA and beta agonists in regard to induction of brown fat-specific gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404964>Preparation of High Purity Δ5-Olefinic Acids from Pine Nut Oil via Repeated Lipase-Catalyzed Esterification.</a></h1><p>Δ5-Olefinic acids have been characterized in gymnosperm plants and have been reported to have several biological health benefits. Δ5-Olefinic acids from pine nut oil were effectively concentrated by repeated lipase-catalyzed esterification. The pine nut oil contained three major Δ5-olefinic acids, namely taxoleic acid (C18:2 Δ5,9),  (C18:3 Δ5,9,12), and sciadonic acid (C20:3 Δ5,11,14). The fatty acids present in pine nut oil were selectively esterified with ethanol using Lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei as a biocatalyst. The Δ5-olefinic acids were concentrated in the unesterified fatty acid fraction. The optimum molar ratio of the substrates (fatty acid:ethanol), temperature, the enzyme loading, and the reaction time were 1:7, 25°C, 5% of total substrate , and 6 h, respectively. There was no significant effect in the concentration of Δ5-olefinic acids when water was added in the reaction mixture. The same protocol and optimum conditions were employed for two times repeated lipase-catalyzed esterifications. In first lipase-catalyzed esterification, the Δ5-olefinic acids content in the pine nut oil increased from 17 mol% to 51 mol% with a yield of 40 mol%. In a second lipase-catalyzed esterification, with the Δ5-olefinic acids-concentrated fatty acids obtained from the first reaction as the substrate, the Δ5-olefinic acids content increased to 86 mol% with a yield of 15 mol%. Finally, a maximum Δ5-olefinic acids content of ca. 96 mol% with a yield of 6 mol% was obtained via a third lipase-catalyzed esterification.</p></html>
