Here we aim to identify new molecular targets in  neuroendocrine carcinomas (co-NEC) and proof the efficacy of matching drugs.We performed a  analysis of co-NEC to identify genetic or epigenetic alterations that could be exploited as effective drug targets. We compared co-NEC samples with colorectal carcinomas (CRC) to identify neuroendocrine specific traits. Patients with co-NEC and derived-xenografts (PDX) were treated with a BRAFV600E blocking drug to demonstrate sensitivity.co-NEC and CRC are similar in their mutational repertoire, although co-NECs are particularly enriched in  mutations. We report for the first time that  mutant  neuroendocrine carcinomas may benefit from BRAF inhibition in monotherapy and how EGFR status is essential to predict innate sensitivity and acquired resistance by a differential methylation of its gene regulatory regions.The identification of  mutations in high grade  neuroendocrine carcinomas has allowed the description of radiological responses to combination therapy of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in basket clinical trials. However, the molecular rationale for this treatment combination was based on the presence of the BRAF mutation and the efficacy observed in other  types such as melanoma. Future drug development in this setting should test BRAF inhibitors upfront and the addition of anti-EGFR antibodies instead of MEK inhibitors for an efficient blockade of acquired resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662984>Spica Prunellae Extract Enhances Fluorouracil Sensitivity of 5-Fluorouracil-Resistant Human  Carcinoma HCT-8/5-FU Cells via TOP2 and miR-494.</a></h1><p>The use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been proven benefits, but it also has adverse events in colorectal  (CRC) chemotherapy. In this study, we explored the mechanism of 5-FU resistance by bioinformatics analysis of the NCBI public dataset series GSE81005. Fifteen hub genes were screened out of 582 different expressed genes. Modules of the hub genes in protein-protein interaction networks gathered to TOP2 showed a decrease in HCT-8 cells but an increase in 5-FU-resistant HCT-8/5-FU cells with 5-FU exposure. Downregulation of TOP2 with siRNA or miR-494 transfection resulted in an increase of cytotoxicity and decrease of cell colonies to 5-FU for HCT-8/5-FU cells. Moreover, we found that an ethanol extract of Spica Prunellae (EESP), which is a traditional Chinese medicine with clinically beneficial effects in various cancers, was able to enhance the sensitivity of 5-FU in HCT-8/5-FU cells and partly reverse the 5-FU resistance effect. It significantly helped suppress cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in HCT-8/5-FU cells with the expression of TOP2 being significantly suppressed, which increased by 5-FU. Consistently, miR-494, which reportedly regulates TOP2, exhibited reverse trends in EESP/5-FU combination treatment. These results suggested that Spica Prunellae may be beneficial in the treatment of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients.Copyright © 2019 Yi Fang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650063>The prediction incidence of the three most common cancers among Iranian military community during 2007-2019: a time series analysis.</a></h1><p>Cancers are one of the most important public health problems in Iran. Because of the importance of cancers, the purpose of the current study was to the prediction of the future incidence of the most common cancers among Iranian military community (MC) by using the time series analysis during 2007 to 2019.In the current cross-sectional study, all registered cancers among Iranian MC entered the study. To select the best model of prediction, various methods including autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and Akaike information criterion (AIC) statistics were used. All analysis was performed by using ITSM, stata14, and Excel2010 software.The most prevalent cancers among Iranian MC were breast, prostate, and  cancers respectively. The time series analysis was shown that the trend of all mentioned cancers in Iranian MC will increase in the coming years.The trend of most prevalent cancers among Iranian MC was increasing but the different factors like the growth of population size and improving the registration system should be regarded.©2019 Pacini Editore SRL, Pisa, Italy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693982>Use of Imaging During Staging and Surveillance of Localized  in a Large Insured Population.</a></h1><p>Adherence to surveillance guidelines in resected  has significant implications for patient morbidity, cost of care, and healthcare utilization. This study measured the underuse and overuse of imaging for staging and surveillance in stage I-II .The OptumLabs database was queried for administrative claims data on adult patients with stage I-II  who underwent surgery alone in 2008 through 2016. Use of PET and CT imaging was evaluated during both initial staging (n=6,921) and surveillance for patients with at least 1 year of follow-up (n=5,466). "High use" was defined as >2 CT abdominal/pelvic (CT A/P) or PET scans per year during surveillance.Overall, 27% of patients with stage I-II  did not have a staging CT A/P or PET scan and 95% did not have a CT chest scan. However, rates of staging CT A/P and CT chest scans increased from 62.0% (2008) to 74.8% (2016) and from 2.3% (2008) to 7.1% (2016), respectively. Staging PET use was overall very low (5.2%). During surveillance, approximately 30% of patients received a CT A/P or PET and 5% received a CT chest scan within the first year after surgery. Of patients who had surveillance CT A/P or PET scans, the proportion receiving >2 scans within the first year (high use) declined from 32.4% (2008) to 9.6% (2016) (P = .01).Although PET use remains appropriately low, many patients with stage I-II  do not receive appropriate staging and surveillance CT chest scans. Among those who do receive these scans during surveillance, high use has declined significantly over time.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671668>PFKFB3 Inhibition Attenuates Oxaliplatin-Induced Autophagy and Enhances Its Cytotoxicity in  Cells.</a></h1><p>6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), a glycolytic enzyme highly expressed in  cells, has been reported to participate in regulating metabolism, angiogenesis, and autophagy. Although anti- drug oxaliplatin (Oxa) effectively inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, the growing resistance and side-effects make it urgent to improve the therapeutic strategy of Oxa. Although Oxa induces the autophagy process, the role of PFKFB3 in this process remains unknown. In addition, whether PFKFB3 affects the cytotoxicity of Oxa has not been investigated. Here, we show that Oxa-inhibited cell proliferation and migration concomitant with the induction of apoptosis and autophagy in SW480 cells. Both inhibition of autophagy by small molecule inhibitors and siRNA modification decreased the cell viability loss and apoptosis induced by Oxa. Utilizing quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, we observed that Oxa increased PFKFB3 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, suppression of PFKFB3 attenuated both the basal and Oxa-induced autophagy, by monitoring the autophagic flux and phosphorylated-Ulk1, which play essential roles in autophagy initiation. Moreover, PFKFB3 inhibition further inhibited the cell proliferation/migration, and cell viability decreased by Oxa. Collectively, the presented data demonstrated that PFKFB3 inhibition attenuated Oxa-induced autophagy and enhanced its cytotoxicity in colorectal  cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667234>Experimental data demonstrating the effects of silver nanoparticles on basement membrane gene and protein expression in cultured , mammary and bronchial epithelia.</a></h1><p>This data article is related to the research article entitled "Silver nanoparticles alter epithelial basement membrane integrity, cell adhesion molecule expression and TGF-beta secretion", available in the journal  [1]. This Data in Brief consists of data that describe changes in the expression of basement membrane (BM)-associated genes and proteins in three non-transformed epithelial cell lines following acute (6 h) and chronic (24 h plus 7-day chase) exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Human BEAS2B (lung), MCF10AI (breast), and CCD-18Co () cultured epithelia were analyzed for protein expression by LC-MS/MS and for gene expression by pathway-focused QRT-PCR arrays of 168 focal adhesion, integrin, and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes known to be localized to the plasma membrane, the BM/ECM, or secreted into the extracellular space.

Current clinical methods rely on qualitative visual analysis of features such as glandular architecture and size that exist on a continuum from benign to malignant. Consequently, discordance between histopathologists is common. To provide more reliable analysis of  specimens, we propose an end-to-end computational pathology pipeline that encompasses gland segmentation,  detection, and then further breaking down the malignant samples into different  grades. We propose a multi-step gland segmentation method, which models tissue components as ellipsoids. For  detection/grading, we encode cellular morphology, spatial architectural patterns of glands, and texture by extracting multi-scale features: (i) Gland-based: extracted from individual glands, (ii) local-patch-based: computed from randomly-selected image patches, and (iii) image-based: extracted from images, and employ a hierarchical ensemble-classification method. Using two datasets (Rawalpindi Medical College (RMC),  = 174 and gland segmentation (GlaS),  = 165) with three  grades, our method reliably delineated gland regions (RMC = 87.5%, GlaS = 88.4%), detected the presence of malignancy (RMC = 97.6%, GlaS = 98.3%), and predicted tumor grade (RMC = 98.6%, GlaS = 98.6%). Training the model using one dataset and testing it on the other showed strong concordance in  detection (Train RMC - Test GlaS = 94.5%, Train GlaS - Test RMC = 93.7%) and grading (Train RMC - Test GlaS = 95%, Train GlaS - Test RMC = 95%) suggesting that the model will be applicable across institutions. With further prospective validation, the techniques demonstrated here may provide a reproducible and easily accessible method to standardize analysis of  specimens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692041>Combination of attenuated Salmonella carrying PD-1 siRNA with nifuroxazide for  therapy.</a></h1><p> is a member of malignant tumors in the digestive system. Traditional treatment strategies are ineffective and improving the treatment of  is an urgent need. Targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) by monoclonal antibodies has shown some therapeutic effectiveness and has advantages. Additionally, the Stat3 inhibitor nifuroxazide was employed to promote the antitumor activity. Here, we hypothesized that combining nifuroxazide with PD-1 small interfering RNA carried by attenuated Salmonella would exert a synergistic antitumor effect on . Indeed, treatment with this combination effectively inhibited the development of  in mice and improved the survival rate. These two novel anticancer agents worked synergistically to elicit potent antitumor immunity and achieve improved therapeutic efficacy. The underlying mechanisms are mainly involved with immune regulation and cell apoptosis.

We sought to determine if completeness of preoperative care was associated with pathologic specimen quality and postoperative morbidity.Clinical stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent elective low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection were identified from the 2016-2017 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. The 3 preoperative NSQIP variables (colonoscopy, stoma marking, and neoadjuvant chemoradiation) were used to divide patients into 2 cohorts: complete vs incomplete preoperative care. The primary outcome was a composite higher pathologic specimen quality score (>12 lymph nodes, negative circumferential, and negative distal margins). The secondary outcome was 30-day morbidity. Preoperative characteristics were compared with ANOVAs and chi-square tests. Outcomes measures were evaluated with logistic regression.We identified 1,125 patients: 591 (52.5%) complete and 534 (47.5%) incomplete. The complete group was younger, had more women, lower-third rectal tumors, clinical stage III disease, and neoadjuvant treatment. The complete group had higher odds of better pathologic specimen quality after adjusting for age, sex, tumor location, stage, and neoadjuvant therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.75, p = 0.001). The complete group had decreased rates of transfusions (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, p < 0.001), postoperative ileus (OR 0.67, p = 0.01), sepsis (OR 0.32, p = 0.01), and readmissions (OR 0.60, p = 0.003). Other complications did not statistically differ between groups.Complete preoperative care in rectal adenocarcinoma is associated with higher pathologic specimen quality and reduced postoperative morbidity. This highlights the importance of adherence to guideline-directed care.Copyright © 2019 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mice bearing subcutaneous CT26  tumors were injected i.v. with 1 g/kg (535 mg iodine/kg) IX-lipo, and  CT and CEST MR images were acquired on day 3. CT and CEST MR images were also acquired for tumor-bearing mice co-injected with IX-lipo and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α).In addition to CT contrast, IX-lipo exhibited a strong CEST contrast similar to its non-liposomal form, with a detectability of ~2 nM per liposome. Both CT imaging and CEST MRI showed that i.v. injection of IX-lipo resulted in a rim enhancement of CT26 tumors with a heterogeneous central distribution. In contrast, co-injection of TNF-α caused a significantly augmented CT/MRI contrast in the tumor center. The intratumoral biodistribution of IX-lipo correlated well to the rhodamine patterns observed with fluorescence microscopy.We have developed a CT/MRI bimodal imaging approach for monitoring the delivery and biodistribution of liposomes by loading them with the clinically approved X-ray/CT contrast agent iodixanol.

Nevertheless, the role of lipid metabolism that confers aggressive properties on human cancers still remains to be revealed. Natural compounds represent an abundant pool of agents for the discovery of novel lead compounds. Trichothecin (TCN) is a sesquiterpenoid originating from an endophytic fungus of the herbal plant Maytenus hookeri Loes. Here, we assess the association of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) over-expression with malignant progression of colorectal  (CRC). Based on this association, the effect of TCN on migration and invasion of  carcinoma cells closely related to the inhibition of SCD-1 is evaluated. We further demonstrate that reduced production of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) by blocking SCD-1 activity is beneficial for the anti-invasion effect of TCN. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanistic connection between metabolite alterations induced by metabolic rewiring and the aggressive tumor phenotype and further develop novel pharmacological tools for the intervention of tumor invasion associated with SCD-1-mediated metabolite alterations.Copyright © 2019.

Nanomedicine allows to overcome chemoresistance and is the focus of our investigation. Silica nanostructures have been highlighted as an interesting drug delivery platform in vitro and in vivo applications. Here we show the validity of nanomedicine approach for targeted chemotherapeutic cargo delivery to overcome chemoresistance in  cells both in vitro and in vivo. For demonstrating the concept, we functionalised ∼100 nm long porous silica nanoparticles (∼20 nm diameter ordered pore structure) by conjugating anticancer drug, cytochrome c enzyme and dual-function anticancer aptamer AS1411 in single supra-assembled nanocargos. The supra-assembly on the porous silica nanostructure allows for a high loading of catalytic enzyme cytochrome c, anticancer drug and aptamer. The silica supra-assembly is characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. Conjugation of cargoes has been monitored at each step by UV-vis and Fluorescence spectroscopy. Finally, the constructed supra-assembled nanocarrier tested on chemoresistance  (HCT116) cells. A pH-responsive, intracellular theranostic cargo delivery has been achieved and the triple action of the nanocargo made an efficient killing of drug resistance  cells in vitro (∼ 92% cell death) through triplex therapy effects by supressing the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) level. Furthermore, in vivo animal toxicity studies demonstrated, the supra-assembled nanocargos have encouraging safety index to be used in  therapy and drug delivery applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Two independent reviewers conducted study assessment and data extraction. Diagnosis-related indicators of FOBT for detecting proximal and distal colorectal  were summarized, and further stratified by the type of FOBT (guaiac-based FOBT (gFOBT) and immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT)). Pooled sensitivities and specificities were calculated using a random effect model. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted and area under the curves were calculated.Overall, 31 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review. For gFOBT, we found no site-specific difference (proximally vs distally located) of pooled sensitivities observed in the colorectal  (CRC), advanced adenomas, and advanced  groups. As for iFOBT, pooled sensitivities for detecting CRC located in the distal /rectum were comparable with that in the proximal  (proximal vs distal, 0.67, 95% CI 0.62-0.72 vs 0.72, 95% CI 0.68-0.75), while higher pooled sensitivities for detecting advanced adenomas and advanced  located in the distal /rectum than for detecting those in the proximal  were observed for iFOBT with the values of 0.24 (95% CI 0.22-0.25) vs 0.32 (95% CI 0.30-0.34) and 0.25 (95% CI 0.23-0.28) vs 0.38 (95% CI 0.36-0.40), respectively.

NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE to generate 15-keto PGE. 15-PGDH has been known as a tumor suppressor in various malignancies including . However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressive function of 15-PGDH remain largely unresolved. In this study, we found that 15-keto PGE upregulated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a representative antioxidative and anti-inflammatory enzyme, at both transcriptional and translational levels in human  epithelial CCD 841 CoN cells. A redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) plays a critical role in the regulation of HO-1 and other cytoprotective proteins. 15-Keto PGE induced translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and antioxidant response element-driven luciferase activity. Furthermore, the silencing of the Nrf2 gene abolished 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression in CCD 841 CoN cells. 15-Keto PGE activated AKT signaling, and the pharmacological AKT inhibitor, LY294002 suppressed the 15-keto PGE-induced HO-1 expression. 15-Keto PGE generates the reactive oxygen species which is suppressed by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment attenuated the 15-keto PGE-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β, transcriptional activity of Nrf2, and subsequently HO-1 expression. However, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE lacking the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety failed to induce reactive oxygen species, HO-1 expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. In conclusion, 15-keto PGE induces HO-1 expression through Nrf2 activation in human  epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019.

The major protease responsible for this cleavage is the membrane metalloprotease ADAM17, which also has been implicated in cleavage of TNFα and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. It has been recently shown that in the absence of ADAM17, the main protease for EGF-R ligand processing,  formation is largely abrogated. Intriguingly,  formation depends on EGF-R activity on myeloid cells rather than on intestinal epithelial cells. A major activity of EGF-R on myeloid cells is the stimulation of IL-6 synthesis. Subsequently, IL-6 together with the ADAM17 shed soluble IL-6 receptor acts on intestinal epithelial cells via IL-6 trans-signaling to induce  formation, which can be blocked by the inhibitor of IL-6 trans-signaling, sgp130Fc. Blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling therefore offers a new therapeutic window downstream of the EGF-R for the treatment of  and possibly of other EGF-R related neoplastic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663904>Novel Circulating Tumor Cell Assay for Detection of Colorectal Adenomas and .</a></h1><p>There is a significant unmet need for a blood test with adequate sensitivity to detect colorectal  (CRC) and adenomas.

The study population included healthy control subjects, patients with adenomas, and those with stage I-IV CRC. CTCs were isolated from the blood using the CellMax platform. The isolated cells were enumerated, and an algorithm was used to determine the likelihood of detecting adenoma or CRC. Nominal and ordinal logistic regression demonstrated that CTC counts could identify adenomas and CRC, including CRC stage.The CellMax test demonstrated a significant association between CTC counts and worsening disease status (Cuzick's P value < 0.0001) with respect to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The test showed high specificity (86%) and sensitivity across all CRC stages (95%) and adenomatous lesions (79%). The area under the curve was 0.940 and 0.868 for the detection of CRC and adenomas, respectively.The blood-based CTC platform demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting adenomas and CRC, as well as reasonable specificity in an enriched symptomatic patient population.If these results are reproduced in an average risk population, this test has the potential to prevent CRC by improving patient compliance and detecting precancerous adenomas, eventually reducing CRC mortality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677019>Factors affecting R0 resection of colorectal  with synchronous peritoneal metastases: a multicenter prospective observational study by the Japanese Society for  of the  and Rectum.</a></h1><p>In Japan, R0 resection has been recommended for colorectal  patients with peritoneal metastases confined to the adjacent peritoneum and those with a few metastases to the distant peritoneum.

Tattoo marking has been often used but the technique carries the risk of accidental peritoneal scattering or other organ injury. We have been involved in the development of a novel fluorescent clip for marking tumor sites and supposed that its usage would reduce risks related to other marking methods.A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with sigmoid  and polyp, and was scheduled for laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. On the day before operation, fluorescent clips (ZEOCLIP FS: Zeon Medical co, Ltd, Tokyo) were endoscopically placed around the tumor and polyp sites, 4 clips for each lesion attached every 90 degrees within the  lumen, respectively. During the operation, locations of the fluorescent clips were easily confirmed using a full-color fluorescent laparoscope, VISION SENSE (Medtronic Co., U.S.). Curative operation was performed accordingly with the preoperative pathological and radiological findings. The postoperative course was uneventful.Locations of intraluminally placed fluorescent clips were clearly and easily recognized through the serosal layer of the intestinal wall using a fluorescent laparoscope. Complications related to dye scattering or intestinal wall/other organ perforation were not observed suggesting that future incorporation of this tumor site marking technique into laparoscopic surgery might be beneficial.The fluorescent marking clips were easily placed and recognized with a fluorescent laparoscope. This method is expected to be safe and risks of accidental puncture related to tattoo marking method can be reduced or almost eliminated.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662819>Race, the microbiome and colorectal .</a></h1><p>In the past decade, more  researchers have begun to understand the significance of  prevention, which has prompted a shift in the increasing body of scientific literature. An area of fascination and great potential is the human microbiome. Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiota has significant roles in an individual's ability to avoid , with considerable focus on the gut microbiome and colorectal . That in mind, racial disparities with regard to colorectal  treatment and prevention are generally understudied despite higher incidence and mortality rates among Non-Hispanic Blacks compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. A comprehension of ethnic differences with relation to colorectal , dietary habits and the microbiome is a meritorious area of investigation. This review highlights literature that identifies and bridges the gap in understanding the role of the human microbiome in racial disparities across colorectal . Herein, we explore the differences in the gut microbiota, common short chain fatty acids produced in abundance by microbes, and their association with racial differences in  acquisition.©The Author(s) 2019.

However, hypoxia is one of the undesirable limitations of chemotherapy, which reduces the therapeutic efficiency in  treatment, ultimately leading to failure of the treatment. Herein, an ideal chemosensitization system capable of attenuating the tumor hypoxia microenvironment and enhancing chemotherapy effects in tumors was designed. This system (designated as the RA/RX Liposome) uses for the first time a pH-sensitive liposome to co-deliver cyclopeptide RA-V as chemotherapeutic drugs and antisense oligonucleotides as HIF-1α inhibitors (RX-0047) for attenuating tumor hypoxia, as well as a caspase-8 activation probe for therapeutic self-monitoring. After modification with death receptor 5-specific antibodies (anti-DR5) on the surface of the liposome, the RA/RX Liposome can successfully deliver components targeting  tumors in vivo. This work should synergistically enhance the therapeutic effects of the treatment by successfully down-regulating HIF-1α expression against tumor hypoxia during the RA-V-induced apoptotic process. More importantly, the RA/RX Liposome can be precisely applied for therapeutic self-monitoring with the light-up fluorescence of the caspase-8 probe.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673069>BCL11B regulates MICA/B-mediated immune response by acting as a competitive endogenous RNA.</a></h1><p> immune surveillance is an important host protection process that inhibits carcinogenesis and maintains cellular homeostasis. The major histocompatibility complex class I-related molecules A and B (MICA and MICB) are NKG2D ligands that play important roles in tumor immune surveillance. In the present study, by a combined bioinformatics prediction and experimental approach, we identify BCL11B 3'-UTR as a putative MICA and MICB ceRNA. We demonstrate in several human cell lines of different origins that the knockdown of BCL11B downregulates surface expression of MICA and MICB. Furthermore, we demonstrate miRNA dependency of BCL11B-mediated MICA and MICB regulation in Dicer knockdown HCT116 cells. In addition, MICA/B-targeting miRNAs (miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a, and miR-106b) repressed the expression of BCL11B by targeting its 3'-UTR. Moreover, we showed that the BCL11B knockdown-mediated downregulation of MICA/B resulted in reduced NK cell elimination in vitro and in vivo through reduced recognition of NKG2D. Of particular significance, BCL11B displays tumor-suppressive properties. The expression of BCL11B is downregulated in  tissues and associated with a reduced median survival of  patients. Taken together, our study revealed a new mechanism of BCL11B that prevents immune evasion of cancerous cells by upregulation of the NKG2D ligands MICA and MICB in a ceRNA manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689847>Diagnostic challenges in synchronous ovarian metastasis from rectal : A case report.</a></h1><p>Ovarian metastases from rectal  are infrequent; thus it might be hard to diagnose and treat them. Our study introduces a challenging case which highlights our method in addressing such an issue.A 74-year-old woman was admitted to our Unit showing abdominal pain, vomit, and a gross abdominal mass located in the right iliac fossa and mesogastrium. Oncological markers recorded following abnormalities: carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (Ca19.9) = 453.40 U/mL, carbohydrate antigen 125 (Ca125) = 88.3 U/mL.Such a metastatic tumor being difficult to diagnose, we could not achieve a precise preoperative diagnosis. We entered the operating room with a histologic diagnosis that was highly suspicious of  adenocarcinoma. During surgery, frozen section analysis was positive for primary ovarian . Thanks to the immunohistochemistry test on the histologic specimen, which might be very helpful in diagnosing such metastatic tumor, final pathology report documented ovarian metastasis from rectal .We performed total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and low anterior resection of the rectum with a terminal colostomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered for 6 months using FOLFOX plus panitumumab in first-line therapy.At 8 months from surgery, during follow-up, a local pelvic progression of disease was detected, leading to second-line chemotherapy treatment.Correct differential diagnosis between primary and metastatic ovarian tumors is paramount in choosing the best treatment which leads to the best possible outcome. In ovarian metastatic tumors, immunohistochemistry could represent an optimal diagnostic tool.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676071>Disruption of Core 1-mediated O-glycosylation oppositely regulates CD44 expression in human  cells and tumor-derived exosomes.</a></h1><p>Aberrant O-glycosylation truncates O-glycans and is known to be closely associated with colorectal  (CRC), a major gastrointestinal tumor. CD44 is one of the highly post-transcriptionally modified O-glycoproteins participating in a series of physiological and pathobiological processes. In this research, we aimed to investigate whether CD44 expression in cells and exosomes can be influenced by disruption of Core 1-mediated O-glycosylation. Exosomes derived from LS174T and LSC human  cell lines were isolated from cell culture supernatant and pulled down using tetraspanin-specific antibody CD63 immunoaffinity magnetic beads. Identifications have been performed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and flow cytometry. CD63 immunoaffinity-purified exosomes are examined for CD44 expression by flow cytometric analyses. The percentages of CD44 in exosomes derived from abnormally O-glycosylated cells are significantly higher compared with those derived from normal ones, however, which is surprisingly contrary to the cellular expression levels of CD44. The secretion of truncated glycoproteins to the extracellular environment via microvesicles may be most likely its underlying mechanism. CD44 in exosomes might be a potential biomarker of aberrant O-glycosylation. This is the first study indicating that aberrant O-glycosylation can affect expression or delivery of O-glycoproteins via exosomes, which provides us some new sights in therapeutic strategies for human .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Different sites of colorectal  (CRC) are different in many aspects, including clinical symptoms, biological behaviour, and prognosis.This study aimed to analyse prognosis, genes, bacteria, fungi, and microbial metabolome in different sites of CRC.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and STAT were used to statistically describe and analyse the prognosis in different sites of CRC. RNA sequences of CRC from Broad Institute's GDAC Firehose were re-annotated and reanalysed based on different sites using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse the prognosis and Cytoscape was used to construct a drug-target network based on DGIdb databases. Bacterial 16S V3-V4 and fungal ITS V3-V4 ribosomal RNA genes of stool samples were sequenced. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS) was performed to detect the microbial metabolites in stool samples. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare distinct gut microorganisms and microbial metabolites between rectal and sigmoid cancers.The prognosis in CRC with different sites is significantly different. The closer to the anus predicted longer survival time. The difference between genes and co-expression pairs in CRC with different sites were constructed. The relative abundance of 112 mRNAs and 26 lncRNAs correlated with the sites of CRC were listed. Nine differentially expressed genes at different sites of CRC were correlated with prognosis. A drug-gene interaction network contained 227 drug-gene pairs were built. The relative abundance of gut bacteria and gut fungus, and the content of microbe-related metabolites were statistically different between rectal and sigmoid cancers.There are many differences in prognosis, genome, drug targets, gut microbiome, and microbial metabolome in different colorectal  sites. These findings may improve our understanding of the role of the CRC sites in personalized and precision medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648389>Establishment and characterization of a novel neuroendocrine carcinoma cell line derived from a human ascending  tumor.</a></h1><p>The incidence of rare neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is rapidly increasing. Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a NET with poorly differentiated histological features, high proliferative properties and associated poor prognoses. Since these carcinomas are so rare, and thus, affect only a small number of patients allowing for few cell lines to be derived from patient biopsies, the histological, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics associated with colorectal NEC and NECs in other organs, have yet to be clearly defined. Herein, we describe the establishment of a novel NEC cell line (SS-2) derived from a tumor resection of the ascending  from a 59-year-old Japanese woman. The histological, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical features of chromogranin A (CgA) as well as the confirmation of synaptophysin positivity in this tumor were typical of those commonly observed in surgically resected colorectal NECs. Further, the Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumor was > 20 %, and thus, the tumor was diagnosed as an NEC of the ascending . The SS-2 cell line maintained characteristic features to those of the resected tumor, which were further retained following implantation into the subcutaneous tissues of nude mice. Additionally, when SS-2 cells were seeded into ultra-low attachment plates they formed spheres that expressed higher levels of the  stem cell (CSC) marker CD133 compared to SS-2 cells cultured under adherent conditions. SS-2 cells may, therefore, contribute to the current knowledge on midgut NEC biological behaviors, while providing a novel platform for examining the effects of colorectal NEC drugs, including CSC.© 2019 The Authors.

The primary aims of this population-based, observational study were to (a) investigate the association between the novel European Organisation for Research and Treatment of  Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30 (QLQ-C30) summary score and all-cause mortality, adjusting for the more traditional sociodemographic and clinical prognostic factors; and (b) compare the prognostic value of the QLQ-C30 summary score with the global quality of life (QoL) and physical functioning scales of the QLQ-C30.Between 2008 and 2015, patients with  (12 tumor types) were invited to participate in PROFILES disease-specific registry studies (response rate, 69%). In this secondary analysis of 6,895 patients, multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between the QLQ-C30 scores and all-cause mortality.In the overall Cox regression model including sociodemographic and clinical variables, the QLQ-C30 summary score was associated significantly with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 99% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.82). In stratified analyses, significant associations between the summary score and all-cause mortality were observed for , rectal, and prostate , non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. The QLQ-C30 summary score had a stronger association with all-cause mortality than the global QoL scale (HR, 0.82; 99% CI, 0.77-0.86) or the physical functioning scale (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85).In a real-world setting, the QLQ-C30 summary score has a strong prognostic value for overall survival for a number of populations of patients with  above and beyond that provided by clinical and sociodemographic variables. The QLQ-C30 summary score appears to have more prognostic value than the global QoL, physical functioning, or any other scale within the QLQ-C30.The finding that health-related quality of life provides distinct prognostic information beyond known sociodemographic and clinical measures, not only around  diagnosis (baseline) but also at follow-up, has implications for clinical practice. Implementation of  survivorship monitoring systems for ongoing surveillance may improve post-treatment rehabilitation that leads to better outcomes.© 2019 The Authors.

Its advantages over DNA transfection make it attractive in applications where transient expression is desired. However, this has proved challenging due to mRNA's instability and susceptibility to degradation. Selenium is important for immune function and modulation, with selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) finding a niche in biomedicine as drug delivery vehicles, owing to their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and biodegradability. In this investigation, we synthesized chitosan-coated SeNPs with a folic acid targeting moiety for F mRNA delivery to  cells in vitro. Synthesized SeNPs were stable and well dispersed, and ranged from 59 to 102 nm in size. Nanoparticles bound and protected mRNA from RNase degradation, while exhibiting low cytotoxicity in the human embryonic kidney (HEK293), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and nasopharyngeal (KB) cells in culture Moderate cytotoxicity evidenced in the colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2) and  carcinoma (HT-29) cells was attributed to apoptosis induction by selenium, as confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. Selenium uptake studies corroborated the transfection results, where significant transgene expression was evident for the overexpressed folate receptor-positive KB cells when compared to the other cells with less or no folate receptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663444>Berberine and  exert a potential anticancer effect on  cells by acting on specific pathways.</a></h1><p>Berberine (BBR) is a natural active principle with potential antitumor activity. The compound targets multiple cell signaling pathways, including proliferation, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms behind the anticancer activity of BBR by comparing the effects of purified BBR with those of the extract of , a medicinal plant that produces this metabolite. The expression levels of a panel of 44 selected genes in human  adenocarcinoma (HCA-7) cell line were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). BBR treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent down regulation of 33 genes differently involved in cell cycle, differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The trend was confirmed across the two types of treatment, the two time points, and the different absolute dosage of BBR. These findings suggest that the presence of BBR in  extract significantly contributes to its antiproliferative activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658363>PROX1 is a specific and dynamic marker of sacral neural crest cells in the chicken intestine.</a></h1><p>The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a complex network constituted of neurons and glial cells that ensures the intrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract. ENS cells originate from vagal and sacral neural crest cells that are initially located at the border of the neural tube. In birds, sacral neural crest cells (sNCCs) first give rise to an extramural ganglionated structure (the so-called Nerve of Remak [NoR]) and to the pelvic plexus. Later, sNCCs enter the  mesenchyme to colonize and contribute to the intrinsic innervation of the caudal part of the gut. However, no specific sNCC marker has been described. Here, we report the expression pattern of prospero-related homeobox 1 (PROX1) in the developing chick . PROX1 is a homeobox domain transcription factor that plays a role in cell type specification in various tissues. Using in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence techniques, we showed that PROX1 is expressed in sNCCs localized in the NoR and in the pelvic plexus. Then, using real-time quantitative PCR we found that PROX1 displays a strong and highly dynamic expression pattern during NoR development. Moreover, we demonstrated using in vivo cell tracing, that sNCCs are the source of the PROX1-positive cells within the NoR. Our results indicate that PROX1 is the first marker that specifically identifies sNCCs. This might help to better identify the role of the different neural crest cell populations in distal gut innervation, and consequently to improve the diagnosis of diseases linked to incomplete ENS formation, such as Hirschsprung's disease.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646798>Prognostic importance of tumor location and anti-EGFR therapy in patients with K-RAS wild type metastatic colorectal .</a></h1><p>To compare anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF agents in patients with K-RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal  (mCRC) with regards to tumor location.450 patients diagnosed with mCRC, who applied to our center were included in this retrospective study.

MRTX849 was identified as a potent, selective, and covalent KRASG12C inhibitor that exhibits favorable drug-like properties, selectively modifies mutant cysteine 12 in GDP-bound KRASG12C and inhibits KRAS-dependent signaling. MRTX849 demonstrated pronounced tumor regression in 17 of 26 (65%) of KRASG12C-positive cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models from multiple tumor types and objective responses have been observed in KRASG12C-positive lung and  adenocarcinoma patients. Comprehensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic profiling in sensitive and partially resistant non-clinical models identified mechanisms implicated in limiting anti-tumor activity including KRAS nucleotide cycling and pathways that induce feedback reactivation and/or bypass KRAS dependence. These factors included activation of RTKs, bypass of KRAS dependence, and genetic dysregulation of cell cycle.

Of note, AOM treatment specifically increased the tumor burden in the , but not in the small intestine. Histological grading and WNT-signaling activity did not differ significantly between small intestinal and  tumors with some lesions progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma in both locations. However, characterization of the intratumoral myeloid cell compartment revealed a massive infiltration of  tumors with neutrophils - 6-fold higher than in small intestinal tumors. Moreover, CCL17-expressing macrophages and dendritic cells accumulated in the tumors indicating the establishment of a tumor-promoting immunosuppressive environment.

Clinicopathological differences were reported as odds ratios (OR) and survival was presented as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Of 161 patients included, 25% were aged > 79 years. There was a large overlap in the prevalence of EMAST (31.7%) and MSI-H (27.3%) [82.4% of EMAST were also MSI-H]. EMAST had the highest prevalence in the proximal  (OR 15.9, 95% CI 5.6-45.1; p < 0.001) and in women (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9-8.6; p < 0.001), and were poorly differentiated (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.3-10.7; p < 0.001). Compared with EMAST-negative patients, EMAST-positive patients were older (median age 77 vs. 69 years; p < 0.001), leaner (median weight 67.5 vs. 77 kg; p = 0.001), had significantly higher rates of hypoalbuminemia (24% vs. 6%; OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.6; p = 0.002) and anemia (45% vs. 20%; OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.6-6.8; p = 0.001), and had elevated preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (51% vs. 34%; OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.9; p = 0.046).

Wheat bran (WB) is a rich source of dietary fiber and phytochemicals with health-promoting properties. However, the active components especially the interaction between different components in WG wheat have not been fully explored. Here, we investigated whether one of the major WB phytochemicals, alkylresorcinol (AR) C21, and the major active intestinal microbial metabolite of fiber, butyrate, could synergistically suppress human  cells. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the combination of C21 and butyrate synergistically inhibited the growth of human  cells and induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that the cotreatment of C21 and butyrate induced significant up-regulations in cleaved Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleaved caspase 3, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), cytochrome C, lipid-conjugated membrane-bound form of microtubule-associated protein 1/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expressions, indicating the synergistic anticancer effects of C21 and butyrate were associated with induction of apoptosis, autophagy, and ER stress pathways. Notably, the C21 concentrations in the large intestinal tract of mice treated with human relevant doses of C21, were from 0.86 to 1.78 μmol/g, suggesting the C21 doses used in vitro may be achievable after daily WG wheat intake.

In this study, consequences of deficiency and overexpression of  on cellular transformation was investigated using a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model of cellular transformation. We observed that neither deficiency nor overexpression of  was sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation, alone or in combination with   or  overexpression. However, -deficiency did cooperate with -mediated cellular transformation, a finding which was associated with increased phosphorylated-Akt levels. Transformation and phosphorylated-Akt levels were dampened upon overexpression of  in -MEF. Together, our findings support a model where INPP4B function suppresses transformation mediated by  , but is inconsequential for  and  mediated transformation.Copyright: © 2019 Mangliardi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686346>Robotic ALPPS.</a></h1><p>The associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure is a useful strategy to treat patients with advanced liver tumors and small future liver remnants. This video presents a robotic ALPPS procedure to treat synchronous colorectal liver metastases.A 71-year-old man with liver metastases from sigmoid  was referred. A multidisciplinary team decided on chemotherapy followed by liver resection (first), then  resection. After four cycles, objective response was observed and the multidisciplinary team then chose the ALPPS procedure. The future liver remnant (segments 3 and 4 and the Spiegel lobe) was 24%. A robotic approach was proposed.  resection was performed after the ALPPS procedure, also using the robotic approach.The duration of the first stage was 293 min, and the technique used in the first stage was partial ALPPS (parenchymal transection deep to 2 cm above the inferior vena cava) with preservation of the right hepatic duct. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. The second stage of the procedure took 245 min. Recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the fourth day. Finally, the patient underwent robotic resection of the primary colorectal neoplasm. The surgery lasted 182 min, recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Final pathology disclosed a T3N1bM1 adenocarcinoma. Liver pathology confirmed colorectal metastases with partial response. All surgical margins were free. Currently, the patient is well, with no signs of disease 5 months post-procedure.Robotic ALPPS is feasible and safe. The robotic approach may have some advantages over the laparoscopic and open ALPPS approaches. This video may help oncological surgeons to perform this complex procedure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691174>The hTERT-VNTR2-2 alleles are involved in genomic stability in gastrointestinal .</a></h1><p>hTERT contains a high density of minisatellites, of which rare alleles of hTERT-VNTR2-2 have been reported to be associated with prostate .

Therefore, we investigated the effects of hTERT-VNTR2-2 on gastrointestinal  and the relationship between repeated sequence and chromosome instability.A case-control study was performed using DNA from 818 -free controls, 539 cases with gastric , 275 cases with  and 274 cases with rectal . To determine whether minisatellites affect gene expression, expression levels were examined using TERT-reporter vectors in cell lines. In addition, the length of the hTERT-VNTR2-2 alleles were determined in blood and  tissues from 107 gastric cancers, 112  cancers and 76 rectal cancers patients to determine whether the repeat sequence was associated with genomic instability during  development.No statistically significant association between hTERT-VNTR2-2 and risk of gastrointestinal  was detected. However, it has been shown that VNTRs inserted into the enhancer region can regulate the expression of TERT in gastrointestinal  cells. Moreover, hTERT-VNTR2-2 was analyzed in matched blood and  tissue from patients with gastrointestinal  and in seven among 294 subjects, and hTERT-VNTR2-2 was found to be rearranged.We suggest that minisatellites are associated with genomic instability in  and that the hTERT-VNTRs region may increase hTERT expression in gastrointestinal  cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671862>Absence of the Tks4 Scaffold Protein Induces Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Like Changes in Human  Cells.</a></h1><p>Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a multipurpose process involved in wound healing, development, and certain pathological processes, such as metastasis formation. The Tks4 scaffold protein has been implicated in  progression; however, its role in oncogenesis is not well defined. In this study, the function of Tks4 was investigated in HCT116  cells by knocking the protein out using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Surprisingly, the absence of Tks4 induced significant changes in cell morphology, motility, adhesion and expression, and localization of E-cadherin, which are all considered as hallmarks of EMT. In agreement with these findings, the marked appearance of fibronectin, a marker of the mesenchymal phenotype, was also observed in Tks4-KO cells. Analysis of the expression of well-known EMT transcription factors revealed that Snail2 was strongly overexpressed in cells lacking Tks4. Tks4-KO cells showed increased motility and decreased cell-cell attachment. Collagen matrix invasion assays demonstrated the abundance of invasive solitary cells. Finally, the reintroduction of Tks4 protein in the Tks4-KO cells restored the expression levels of relevant key transcription factors, suggesting that the Tks4 scaffold protein has a specific and novel role in EMT regulation and  progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692079>DNA methylation and gene expression profiles characterize epigenetic regulation of lncRNAs in  adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>The long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with tumorigenesis and progression of . While DNA methylation is a common epigenetic regulator of gene expression, the methylation of lncRNAs was rarely studied. To address this gap, we integrated DNA methylation and RNA-seq data to characterize the landscape of lncRNA methylation in  adenocarcinoma (COAD). We collected and analyzed the lncRNA expression and methylation data from The  Genome Atlas and  Cell Line Encyclopedia to identify the epigenetically regulated lncRNAs. We further investigated the biological and clinical relevance of the identified lncRNAs via bioinformatics analysis. We identified 20 epigenetically upregulated lncRNAs in COAD, including several well-studied lncRNAs whose methylation regulation were poorly investigated, such as PVT1 and UCA1. We also revealed several novel tumor-associated lncRNAs in COAD, including GATA2-As1 and CYTOR. Next, we explored their biology function using gene set enrichment analysis and competitive endogenous RNA analysis. We characterized the methylation landscape of lncRNA in COAD and identified 20 epigenetically upregulated lncRNAs.

Therefore, developing anticancer agents which can selectively target the  cells and cause less side effects are the main objectives of the new therapeutic strategies for treatment advanced or metastatic cancers. Newcastle disease virus strains AF2240 and V4-UPM were shown to be cytolytic against various  cells in-vitro and very effective as antileukemicagents.45 rats at 6 weeks of age, were randomly assigned to nine groups with 5 rats in each group, both azoxymethane (AOM) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) were given to rats according to the body weight. NDV virus strains (AF2240 and V4-UPM) doses were determined to rats according to CD50 resulted from MTT assay. After 8 doses of NDV strians and 5-FU, tissue sections preparations and histopathological study of rats' organs were done.In this article morphological changes of rats' organs, especially in livers, after treatment with a  carcinogen (azoxymethane) and Newcastle disease virus strains have been recorded. We observed liver damage caused by AOM evidenced by morphological changes and enzymatic elevation were protected by the oncolytic viruses sections.

However, clinical use of 5-FU is limited because of the low efficacy of drug uptake and systemic toxic effects. Therefore, there is a critical need to find better drug delivery systems in order to improve the efficacy of the drug. In present study, we have developed a novel combination drug delivery system based on PHBV/PLGA NPs for delivery of 5-FU to  cells. NPs were prepared by the double emulsion method and their optimization of preparation was evaluated using Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM). 5-FU loaded NPs were characterized by SEM, DSC, TGA and FT-IR. SEM image implied that NPs were spherical in shape and the results of DSC, TGA and FT-IR suggest that 5-FU was encapsulated into NPs. The obtained results revealed that 5-FU loaded PHBV/PLGA NPs induced significant higher cell death at concentration much lower than free 5-FU. Results of hemolysis assay indicated that the NPs were hemo-compatible anti-tumor studies showed that 5-FU loaded NPs reduced tumor volume significantly in comparison with free 5-FU.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that  can increase the risk of diabetes. Consequently, diabetes and  share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating diabetes and  and rectal  (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on  cell aggressiveness in human  epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of  cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating diabetes and CRC.

This study aims to elucidate the prognostic implication of the mLNR in colorectal  (CRC) according to the tumor location.We evaluated the correlation between prognoses and the involved and examined LNs as well as mLNR according to the tumor location in 266 surgically resected human CRCs. Besides, to evaluate the optimal cutoff for high and low mLNRs, we investigated the correlation between mLNR and survival according to the various cutoffs.LN metastasis was found in 146 cases (54.9%), and  and rectal cancers were found in 116 (79.5%) and 30 (20.5%) of the cases, respectively. The mean mLNRs were significantly higher in rectal  than in  (0.38 ± 0.28 vs. 0.21 ± 0.24,  = 0.003). Besides this, the number of involved LNs in rectal  was significantly high compared to  (11.83 ± 10.92 vs. 6.37 ± 7.78,  = 0.014). However, there was no significant difference in the examined LNs between the rectal and  cancers (31.90 ± 12.28 vs. 36.60 ± 18.11,  = 0.181).

BrdU and Transwell assays were used to detect cell proliferation and invasion, respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of Vimentin.TUG1 expression was up-regulated in CaCO-2, SW620 and HT-29 cells, while miR-26a-5p was down-regulated. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-26a-5p was the target of TUG1, and the targeting relationship was further confirmed by dual-luciferase report analysis. Besides, matrix metalloproteinases-14 (MMP-14) was a target of mir-26a-5p. Knockdown of TUG1 by shRNA (sh-TUG1) inhibited MMP-14 expression. Functional analysis showed that sh-TUG1 significantly inhibited Cc cell proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Notably, miR-26a-5p inhibitor reversed the promotion of Cc caused by sh-TUG1. Mechanically, the overexpression of TUG1 significantly up-regulated the levels of MMP-14, VEGF, p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38 MAPK) and p-HSP27 (heat shock protein 27), and promoted the proliferation, invasion and EMT of Cc cells. However, MAPK pathway inhibitor SB203580 has shown the opposite effect.

However, the sequence in which they should be administrated first in late-line treatment for refractory mCRC remains unclear.This study was a single-center retrospective cohort study that reviewed data from patients at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, with mCRC refractory to fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, cetuximab (wild-type RAS), and bevacizumab. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a regorafenib-first group and a riFOLFOXIRI-first group. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze survival, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate, multivariate, and subgroup analyses.A total of 136 and 55 patients followed a regorafenib-first or riFOLFOXIRI-first treatment strategy, respectively. At baseline, patient characteristics were similar between the groups, except for younger age in the riFOLFOXIRI-first group. The regorafenib-first group had better overall survival (13.8 vs. 10.7 mo, P=0.038), whereas patients in the riFOLFOXIRI-first group had a better partial response rate (P=0.005) but a higher rate of discontinuation due to adverse effects (P=0.004) and cross-over to regorafenib (P<0.001). Thus, no significant difference was observed in progression-free survival (regorafenib-first strategy: 3.17 mo; riFOLFOXIRI-first strategy: 4.97 mo; P=0.624). Regorafenib-first strategy, sex, and pathology were identified as independent prognostic factors. Subgroup analysis indicated that younger age, better performance status, stage IV disease, and mutant RAS gene favored the regorafenib-first strategy.Treatment with regorafenib-first followed by riFOLFOXIRI resulted in better overall survival when given as late-line treatment for patients with refractory mCRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694526>Saccharomyces boulardii alleviates ulcerative colitis carcinogenesis in mice by reducing TNF-α and IL-6 levels and functions and by rebalancing intestinal microbiota.</a></h1><p>To explore the inhibition mechanism of Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) on ulcerative colitis (UC) carcinogenesis.C57BL/6 mice were treated with azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) to develop a UC carcinogenesis model. The treatment group was lavaged with S. boulardii (5 × 10 CFU/d) for 12 weeks. The mice were sacrificed and the tumor load in the treatment group was compared with that of a control group. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in  tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The influence of S. boulardii on TNF-α and IL-6 regulation was also investigated using different  cell lines. Differences in intestinal microbiota in both stool and intestinal mucosa samples were assessed using 16S rDNA sequencing.S. boulardii treatment reduced AOM/DSS-induced UC carcinogenesis in mice, as indicated by the reduced tumor load and reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels in vivo, as well its effects on TNF-α and IL-6 activities in vitro. Significant changes in both fecal and mucosal microbiota were observed among the control, the AOM/DSS treated, and AOM/DSS plus S. boulardii treated groups. For fecal microbiota, the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Lactobacillus, but higher in Oscillibacter and Lachnoclostridium than the control group. After intervention with S. boulardii, the percentage of Bacillus and Lactococcus increased, but Lachnoclostridium, Oscillibacter, Bacteroides, and Pseudomonas decreased. For the intestinal mucosal microbiota, the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and higher in Alloprevotella than the control group. After S. boulardii exposure, the percentage contributions of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 increased.S. boulardii effectively reduced UC carcinogenesis in an AOM/DSS induced mice model. This positive result can likely be attributed to the reduction of TNF-α and IL-6 levels or the blockade of their function combined with alterations to the intestinal microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696325>Transanal total mesorectal excision of giant villous tumor of the lower rectum with McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome: a case report of a novel surgical approach.</a></h1><p>McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome (MKWS) is caused by a villous tumor of the rectosigmoid  with hypersecretion of mucus containing electrolytes. Complete resection of the tumor is needed to cure this disease. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is currently a promising treatment for lower rectal tumor because of the reliability of its resection margin especially in bulky tumor. We present this first case report of a TaTME for MKWS with a lower rectal tumor.An 81-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with diarrhea and acute renal failure. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations revealed an 80-mm-sized enhanced tumor located in her lower rectum without lymph node swelling and distant metastasis. A giant villous tumor secreting mucus was seen in the lower rectum to the anal canal during colonoscopy. The result of tumor biopsy was adenocarcinoma. To preserve the anal function and ensure distal margin, we chose TaTME for curative resection.

The contribution of 1O2 and ˙OH to DNA degradation was proved using gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the pronounced generation of ROS by mouse  carcinoma cells (CT26) stimulated by both copper(ii) complexes was confirmed. A fluorescence method allowed the total amounts of ROS generated inside the CT26 cells to be detected, while the spin trapping technique proved that free radicals mainly attached to the membrane surface. These last results are in agreement with the data obtained from the ICP-MS method, which demonstrates that 1Cu and 2Cu complexes are not efficiently accumulated inside the cell. Furthermore, the role of ROS in lipid peroxidation was established.

GVHD is initiated by the interaction between recipient antigen presenting cells (APC) and donor T-cells, culminating in T-cell differentiation along pathogenic type-1 (Th1/Tc1) and type-17 (Th17/Tc17) paradigms, at the expense of tolerogenic regulatory T-cell (Treg/Tr1) patterns. Type-1 and type-17 T-cells secrete cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF and IFNg) critical to the cytokine storm that amplifies donor APC expansion and their alloantigen presentation. It is become increasingly clear that pathogenic donor T-cell differentiation is initiated by both professional recipient APC (e.g. dendritic cells (DC)) and non-professional APC (e.g. epithelial and mesenchymal), particularly within the GI-tract. In the immediate peri-transplant period, these APC are profoundly modified by PAMP/DAMP signals derived from conditioning and intestinal microbiota. Subsequently donor DC in the GI-tract are activated by DAMP/PAMP signals in the  that gain access to the lamina propria once the mucosal barrier mucosa is compromised by GVHD.

We investigated the mechanisms by which the western diet promotes tumor recurrence, including changes in the microbiome, in mice that underwent colorectal resections.BALB/c male mice were fed either standard chow diet or western-type diet (characterized by high fat, no fiber, and decreased minerals and vitamins) for 4 weeks; some mice were given antibiotics or ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 (Pi-PEG), which inhibits collagenase production by bacteria but not bacterial growth, in drinking water. Colorectal resections and anastomoses were then performed. The first day after surgery, mice were given enemas containing collagenolytic rodent-derived strain of Enterococcus faecalis (strain E2), and the second day they were given mouse  carcinoma cells (CT26). Twenty-one days later, distal colons were removed and  contents (feces, distal , and tumor) were collected.  tissues were analyzed by histology, for the presence of collagenolytic colonies, and by 16S rRNA sequencing. determined the anatomical distribution of E faecalis at the site of the anastomosis and within tumors using in situ hybridization. Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures.  tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the  microbiome.We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by  cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery. Strategies to prevent emergence of these microbe communities or their enzymatic activities might be used to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing colorectal  surgery.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The biological functions of miR-552 have been well documented in ; however, the role of miR-552 in HCC remains unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of miR-552 in HCC physiology, using HCC cell lines as model. An miR-552 inhibitor was transfected into HCC cell lines to knock down the expression of miR-552. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of miR-552 and Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), respectively. MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability, whilst Transwell and wound-healing assay were used to investigate cell migration. Flow cytometry was performed to measure cell apoptosis. The direct association between RUNX3 and miR-552 was evaluated using dual luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-552 was significantly elevated in HCC tumor tissues compared with the adjacent healthy samples. Additionally, transfection with the miR-552 inhibitor decreased cell viability and migration. miR-552 knockdown also increased HCC cell apoptosis . In conclusion, these results suggest that miR-552 has an oncogenic function in HCC and is a potential biomarker for detecting HCC.Copyright: © Ma et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666564>Characterisation of proguanylin expressing cells in the intestine - evidence for constitutive luminal secretion.</a></h1><p>Guanylin, a peptide implicated in regulation of intestinal fluid secretion, is expressed in the mucosa, but the exact cellular origin remains controversial. In a new transgenic mouse model fluorescent reporter protein expression driven by the proguanylin promoter was observed throughout the small intestine and  in goblet and Paneth(-like) cells and, except in duodenum, in mature enterocytes. In Ussing chamber experiments employing both human and mouse intestinal tissue, proguanylin was released predominantly in the luminal direction. Measurements of proguanylin expression and secretion in cell lines and organoids indicated that secretion is largely constitutive and requires ER to Golgi transport but was not acutely regulated by salt or other stimuli. Using a newly-developed proguanylin assay, we found plasma levels to be raised in humans after total gastrectomy or intestinal transplantation, but largely unresponsive to nutrient ingestion. By LC-MS/MS we identified processed forms in tissue and luminal extracts, but in plasma we only detected full-length proguanylin. Our transgenic approach provides information about the cellular origins of proguanylin, complementing previous immunohistochemical and in-situ hybridisation results. The identification of processed forms of proguanylin in the intestinal lumen but not in plasma supports the notion that the primary site of action is the gut itself.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680787>The Duplex Interaction of Microbiome with Chemoradiation and Immunotherapy: Potential Implications for Colorectal .</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota has the ability to modify the metabolism of wide array of therapeutic drugs. Current treatment modalities used in colorectal  have a narrow therapeutic index with a side effects profile that decreases tolerance to these treatments and adversely affects treatment outcome. Harnessing the gut microbiota ability to modify oncotherapeutic drugs metabolism and hence efficacy, could be potentially used to improve treatment outcomes in colorectal  patients. This review will shed lights on important findings from recent microbiome interaction studies which would hopefully serve as a useful tool to guide future translative colorectal  research.Recent advances in microbiome studies have revealed an interesting aspect of gut microbes carcinogenic properties in dysbiotic gut environment. Microbiota niche in colorectal  can also modify efficacy and toxicity profile of different oncotherapeutic treatment modalities from chemoradiotherapy to immunotherapy. Conversely, each of these treatment modalities has numerous effects on the gastrointestinal flora, causing changes in the gut microbial community that affects host morbidity and mortality.Symbiotic gut microbiota is an incredible functioning organ that maintains essential aspects of our homeostasis and immunity. According to the recent body of literature, they also can modify efficacy of many therapeutic drugs including oncotherapy. Considering that unexplainable variable treatment outcomes as well as variable tolerance to treatment have been observed in colorectal  patients, studying gut microbiota modulatory effects on oncotherapy might be a feasible approach to explain this phenomenon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655804>Increase in Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 Levels without Tumor Progression after Polaprezinc Administration that Induced Deep Vein Thrombosis in a  Patient.</a></h1><p>Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a well-known tumor marker of adenocarcinoma (reference range, 37 U/mL). It can also be used, together with computed tomography, to monitor responses and resistance to chemotherapy in  patients. False elevation of CA 19-9 levels is often seen in conditions such as biliary tract obstruction and cholangitis. However, whether medication might induce false elevation of CA 19-9 levels has not yet been reported. A 74-year-old man was treated with third-line CPT-11 (irinotecan) plus panitumumab for stage IV  of the ascending . The patient developed chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia and was treated with polaprezinc. After polaprezinc administration, his CA 19-9 levels gradually increased from 18.9 to 1,699.4 U/mL. He developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although it was not associated with progressive disease or metastasis. Upon discontinuation of polaprezinc, CA 19-9 levels gradually decreased. This case demonstrates that polaprezinc may not only induce false elevation of CA 19-9 levels but also cause development of DVT induced by increased CA 19-9 levels, both of which are very rare events.© 2019 S.

However, the therapeutic outcome of conventional methodologies relying on only one mechanism is rather limited. Herein, the first example of ultrasmall responsively aggregatable nanochelators that can intrinsically fulfill both antivasculature functions as well as high renal clearable efficiency is introduced. The nanochelators with sub-6 nm sizes exhibit not only systemic copper depletion activity for tumor antiangiogenesis but also, more surprisingly, the capability to transform from a "dispersed" state to an "aggregated" state to form large secondary particles in response to tumor microenvironment with elevated copper and phosphate levels for blood vessel obstruction. Compared to a benchmark antiangiogenic agent that can only inhibit the formation of tumor blood vessels, the nanochelators with unprecedented synergistic functions demonstrate significantly enhanced tumor inhibition activity in both breast  and  tumor models. Moreover, these ultrasmall nanochelators are noncytotoxic and renal clearable, ensuring superior biocompatibility. It is envisaged that the design of nanomaterials with ground-breaking properties and the synergistic antivasculature functions would offer a substantial conceptual advance for tumor vasculature targeted therapy and may provide vast opportunities for developing advanced nanomedicines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695808>Integrin αβ-targeted radionuclide therapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy synergistically enhances anti-tumor efficacy.</a></h1><p>Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy has revealed promising outcomes in both preclinical studies and ongoing clinical trials. Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) is a branch of radiotherapy concerned with the use of radioisotopes, radiolabeled molecules or nanoparticles that deliver particulate radiation to  cells. TRT is a promising approach in cases of metastatic disease where conventional treatments are no longer effective. The increasing use of TRT raises the question of how to best integrate TRT with immunotherapy. In this study, we proposed a novel therapeutic regimen that combined programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-based immunotherapy with peptide-based TRT (Lu as the radionuclide) in the murine  model.To explore the most appropriate timing of immunotherapy after radionuclide therapy, the anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1 mAb) was delivered in a concurrent or sequential manner when Lu TRT was given.The results demonstrated that TRT led to an acute increase in PD-L1 expression on T cells, and TRT in combination with αPD-L1 mAb stimulated the infiltration of CD8 T cells, which improved local tumor control, overall survival and protection against tumor rechallenge. Moreover, our data revealed that the time window for this combination therapy may be critical to outcome.This therapeutic combination may be a promising approach to treating metastatic tumors in which TRT can be used. Clinical translation of the result would suggest that concurrent rather than sequential blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis combined with TRT improves overall survival and long-term tumor control.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671556>Functions and Implications of Autophagy in .</a></h1><p>Autophagy is an essential function to breakdown cellular proteins and organelles to recycle for new nutrient building blocks. In colorectal , the importance of autophagy is becoming widely recognized as it demonstrates both pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions. In , cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles for autophagy are essential in growth and progression. However, the mechanisms downstream of autophagy (to reduce or enhance tumor growth) are not well known.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body metabolism and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific metabolic profile on  risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 obesity-related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into  and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and  risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with obesity. However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: 2.46; 95%CI 1.20; 5.03), and distal  (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal  (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; 2.05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women. These results indicate that higher BMR may be an indicator of a metabolic phenotype associated with risk of certain  types, and may be a useful predictor of  risk independent of body fatness.

A current focus of anti- research is harnessing the patient's own immune system for therapy. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), an immune suppressor, is upregulated in various activated immune cells, such as T cells, and in viral infections and tumors.The objective of this study was to investigate the function of PD-1 inhibitor on the metastasisi of mouse  cells.In the present study, we established an in situ  mouse model using the CT26 cell line. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed to detect  cell metastasis. The levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CD44 CD62L memory T cells, CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen were detected by flow cytometry (FCM).We found that anti-PD-1 therapy inhibited  cells metastasis to the small intestine, liver, and lung, and lengthened the survival time of mice. However, the depletion of CD8 suppressed the activity of anti-PD-1 antibodies. In response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, the levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12) in serum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were significantly increased, while IL-6, IL-17, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were decreased. CD8 depletion had the opposite effect. In addition, anti-PD-1 treatment significantly increased CD44 CD62L memory T cells, decreased CD4 FoxP3 regulatory T cells, and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in MLNs and spleen. Furthermore, anti-PD-1 treatment cannot exert these roles when CD8 is depleted.These results suggest that PD-1 inhibitors rely on CD8+ T cells to exert anti-tumor immunity in .© 2019 Gao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667693>Sterile carbon particle suspension vs India ink for endoscopic tattooing of  lesions: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Different markers have been used preoperatively to mark  lesions, especially India ink. In recent years, another kind of marker has been developed: sterile carbon particle suspension (SCPS). No comparison between these two markers has yet been made. The aim of the present study was to compare the pyrogenic, inflammatory and intraperitoneal effect of these two markers.From September 2015 to December 2018, adult patients who were candidates for elective laparoscopic  resection were randomized to the SCPS or conventional India ink injection group using computer-based randomization. The primary endpoint of the study was the presence of intraoperative adhesions related to the endoscopic tattoo. Secondary endpoints were differences in white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels as well as, abdominal pain and body temperature at baseline (before endoscopic tattooing) and 6 and 24 h after colonoscopy. Finally, the visibility of the tattoo during the minimally invasive intervention was assessed.Ninety-four patients were included in the study, 47 for each arm. There were 45/94 females (47.9%) and 49/94 males (52.1%), with a median age of 67.85 ± 9.22 years. No differences were found between groups in WBC, fibrinogen levels, body temperature or VAS scores, but we documented significantly higher CRP values at 6 and 24 h after endoscopic tattooing with India ink injection. There were significantly fewer adhesions in the SCPS Endoscopic Marker group.

We previously established a unique contribution of KLK6 in  metastasis via a specific network of microRNAs and mRNAs. Here we evaluated the cellular functions of KLK6 protease in Caco-2  adenocarcinoma cell line after introduction of the enzymatically active or inactive form of the enzyme. We found that proteolytically active KLK6 increased Caco-2 cells invasiveness  and decreased the animal survival in the orthotopic  model. The active KLK6 induced phosphorylation of SMAD 2/3 proteins leading to the altered expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. KLK6 overexpression also induced the RNA-binding protein LIN28B and high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) transcription factor, two essential regulators of cell invasion and metastasis. In the CRC patients, KLK6 protein levels were elevated in the non-cancerous distant and adjacent tissues, compared to their paired tumor tissues ( < 0.0001 and  = 0.0157, respectively). Patients with mutant K-RAS tumors had significantly higher level of KLK6 protein in the luminal surface of non-cancerous distant tissue, compared to the corresponding tissues of the patients with K-RAS wild type tumors ( ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, KLK6 and HMGA2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) scores in patients' tumors and paired adjacent tissues positively correlated (Spearman correlation  < 0.01 and  = 0.03, respectively).

Mutations in the exon 6 of the PPM1D result in production of a highly stable, C-terminally truncated PPM1D. These gain-of-function PPM1D mutations are present in various human cancers but their role in tumorigenesis remains unresolved. Here we show that truncated PPM1D impairs activation of the cell cycle checkpoints in human non-transformed RPE cells and allows proliferation in the presence of DNA damage. Next, we developed a mouse model by introducing a truncating mutation in the PPM1D locus and tested contribution of the oncogenic PPM1D allele to  tumorigenesis. We found that p53 pathway was suppressed in  stem cells harboring PPM1D resulting in proliferation advantage under genotoxic stress condition. In addition, truncated PPM1D promoted tumor growth in the  in Apc mice and diminished survival. Moreover, tumor organoids derived from  of the ApcPpm1d mice were less sensitive to 5-fluorouracil when compared to ApcPpm1dand the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil was restored by inhibition of PPM1D. Finally, we screened colorectal  patients and identified recurrent somatic PPM1D mutations in a fraction of  adenocarcinomas that are p53 proficient and show defects in mismatch DNA repair. In summary, we provide the first in vivo evidence that truncated PPM1D can promote tumor growth and modulate sensitivity to chemotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646072>Autoinducer-2 of gut microbiota, a potential novel marker for human colorectal , is associated with the activation of TNFSF9 signaling in macrophages.</a></h1><p>: The interaction between the quorum sensing (QS) molecules of gut microbiota and the immunity of colorectal  (CRC) has not been investigated before. : We measured the concentration of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in samples of stool, colorectal tissue, saliva and serum of CRC patients, and compared this to AI-2 levels in colorectal adenoma (AD) and normal  mucosa (NC).

This study aimed to present the clinicopathologic features of GNET, including treatment information. We included 19 patients with GNET with a mean tumor size of 4.2 cm. The most common site of tumor origin was the small intestine (57.9%), followed by the stomach (15.8%),  (10.5%), ileocecal junction (5.3%), lower esophagus (5.3%), and anal canal (5.3%). Microscopically, the tumors were composed of epithelioid cells with eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm arranged in nest, sheet-like, papillary, or pseudoalveolar patterns and/or spindle tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in a fascicular pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells stained positively for S100 (19/19,100%), SOX10 (14/15, 93.3%), vimentin (17/17, 100%), synaptophysin (Syn) (7/17, 41.2%), CD56 (4/13, 30.8%), CD99 (1/5, 20%), and CD117 (1/15, 6.7%), and negatively for HMB45, Melan A, DOG1, CD34, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, chromogranin A, smooth muscle actin, and desmin. In total, 14/15 (93.3%) cases showed split Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene (EWSR1) signals consistent with a chromosomal translocation involving EWSR1. Within a mean follow-up of 29.7 months (range: 3 to 63 mo), 2/15 (13.3%) patients died of disease, 5 (33.3%) were alive with disease, and 8 (53.3%) had no evidence of disease. Two and 1 patients showed partial response to apatinib and anlotinib, respectively.

No targetable genetic driver events have been identified, and the treatment landscape for this disease has remained nearly unchanged for over 30 years. Here, we have taken a CRISPR-based screening approach to identify genetic vulnerabilities in SCLC that may serve as potential therapeutic targets. We used a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting ~5000 genes deemed to encode "druggable" proteins to perform loss-of-function genetic screens in a panel of cell lines derived from autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Cross- analyses allowed us to identify SCLC-selective vulnerabilities. In particular, we observed enhanced sensitivity of SCLC cells toward disruption of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in this pathway, reduced the viability of SCLC cells in vitro and strongly suppressed SCLC tumor growth in human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and in an autochthonous mouse model. These results indicate that DHODH inhibition may be an approach to treat SCLC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including , diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases. Ames dwarf (df/df) mice are characterized by an extended life- and healthspan, and although these mice are protected from many age-related diseases, their microbiome has not been studied. To determine the role of microbiota on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the microbiota by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal , ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut microbiota plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying erinacine A inducing  cell apoptosis in colorectal  (CRC) remain unclear. This study found that treatment with erinacine A not only triggers the activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathways (TNFR, Fas, FasL, and caspases) but also suppresses the expression of antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL  a time-dependent manner in DLD-1 cells. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Jun N-terminus kinase (JNK1/2), NFκB p50, and p300 is involved in erinacine A-induced  cell apoptosis. Inhibition of these signaling pathways by kinase inhibitors blocks erinacine A-induced transcriptional activation implicates histone H3K9K14ac (Acetyl Lys9/Lys14) of the TNFR, Fas, and FasL as promoters. Moreover, histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that erinacine A treatment significantly induced the TNFR, Fas, and FasL levels in the  xenograft mouse model. Together, these results demonstrated an increase in the cellular transcriptional levels of TNFR, Fas, and FasL by erinacine A induction to cell apoptosis  the activation of the JNK, p300, and NFκB p50 signaling modules, thereby providing a new mechanism for erinacine A treatment  and .Copyright © 2019 Lee, Lee, Tung, Huang, Lee, Chen, Chen, Teng, Shen, Hsieh and Kuo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677446>Synthesis and biological evaluation of triterpenoid thiazoles derived from betulonic acid, dihydrobetulonic acid, and ursonic acid.</a></h1><p>In this work, 35 new derivatives of betulonic, dihydrobetulonic and ursonic acid were prepared including 30 aminothiazoles and all of them were tested for their in vitro cytotoxic activity in eight  cell lines and two non- fibroblasts. Compounds with the IC below 5 μM in CCRF-CEM cells and low toxicity in non- fibroblasts (4m, 5c, 5m, 6c, 6m, 7b, and 7c) were further subjected to tests of pharmacological parameters yielding the final set for advanced biological evaluation (4m, 5m, 6m, and 7b). It was proved by several methods, that all of them trigger apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway and derivatives 5m and 7b are the most effective (IC 2.4 μM and 3.6 μM). They are the best candidates to become potentially new anticancer drugs and will be subjected to in vivo tests in mice. In addition, compounds 6b and 6c deserve more attention because their activity is not limited only to chemosensitive CCRF-CEM cell line.

We aimed to evaluate whether MSH3 loss is associated with EMAST in CRC.A consecutive cohort of patients with stage I-III CRC. Digital image analysis using heatmap-derived hot spots investigated MSH3 expression by immunohistochemistry. Fragment analysis of multiplex PCR was used to assess MSI and EMAST, and results cross-examined with MSH3 protein expression.Of 152 patients, EMAST was found in 50 (33%) and exclusively in the . Most EMAST-positive cancers had instability at all 5 markers, and EMAST overlapped with MSI-H in 42/50 cases (84%). The most frequently altered tetranucleotide markers were D8S321 (38.2% of tumors) and D20S82 (34.4%). Subjective evaluation of MSH3 expression by IHC in tumor found ≤10% negative tumor cells in all samples, most being ≤5% negative. Digital analysis improved the detection but showed a similar spread of MSH3 loss (range 0.1-15.7%, mean 2.2%). Hotspot MSH3 negativity ranged between 0.1 to 95.0%, (mean 8.6%) with significant correlation with the whole slide analysis (Spearman's rho=0.677 P<.001). Loss of MSH3 expression did not correlate with EMAST.In a well-defined cohort of patients with CRC, loss of MSH3 was not associated with EMAST.

Histologic diagnosis using biopsy samples of colorectal  is the most important step in determining the treatment methods, but these methods have limitations in accuracy and effectiveness. Herein, we report a dual-recognition two-photon probe and its application in the discrimination between human colorectal . The probe is composed of two monosaccharides, d-glucosamine and β-d-galactopyranoside, in a fluorophore for the monitoring of both glucose uptake and β-gal hydrolysis. In vitro/cell imaging studies revealed the excellent selectivity and sensitivity of the probe for glucose transporter-mediated glucose uptake and β-gal activity. -specific uptake was monitored by increased fluorescence intensity, and additional screening of  cells was achieved by changes in emission ratio owing to the higher activity of β-gal.

We aimed to assess how prolonged frozen storage and freeze-thaw cycles might affect measures of faecal haemoglobin (Hb) and diagnostic performance of FITs. Methods From 2005 through 2010, participants of screening colonoscopy (n = 2042) and clinical colorectal  (CRC) cases (n = 184) provided faecal samples in stool containers (60 mL). The samples were stored at -80 °C for up to 11 years and underwent three freeze-thaw cycles. Between each cycle, a defined amount of faeces was extracted using the manufacturer's sampling device of one or two FITs (RIDASCREEN, OC-Sensor). Faecal Hb concentration and diagnostic performance were calculated and compared across freeze-thaw cycles. Results For RIDASCREEN and the OC-Sensor, repeat measurements were available for 504 and 551 study participants, respectively. Hb concentrations correlated strongly (0.77 and 0.85, respectively) and diagnostic performance indicators were similar at the repeat measurements among the same FITs. For RIDASCREEN we found even slightly higher Hb levels, sensitivities and area under the curves (AUCs) after the third than after the first freeze-thaw cycle. For the OC-Sensor the Hb levels, sensitivities and AUCs were slightly lower after prolonged storage and one additional freeze-thaw cycle. Conclusions Measures of Hb and diagnostic performance were fairly stable, even after long-term frozen storage and multiple freeze-thaw cycles of raw faecal samples. Faecal samples collected in prospective screening studies and kept frozen at -80 °C before analysis seem useful for timely and efficient retrospective evaluation of FIT performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646937>Specifying Future Behavior When Assessing Risk Perceptions: Implications for Measurement and Theory.</a></h1><p>. Many theories assert that high perceived risk motivates health behavior change; the empirical literature shows mixed findings. . To determine whether, for whom, and under what circumstances specifying a future behavior when assessing perceived risk (i.e., "conditioning" risk perception items on behavior) improves data quality and strengthens the perceived risk-intentions/behavior relationship. . Internet panel participants ( = 787, 58.8% no college experience, 44.4% racial/ethnic minority, 43.7% men, 67.3% aged 18-49 years, 59.0% nonadherent to physical activity guidelines) answered 8  perceived risk items in a within-subjects design. Participants answered 4 types of risk perception items: absolute and comparative perceived likelihood and absolute and comparative feelings of risk. Participants answered each type of item twice: once conditioned on not engaging in physical activity and once unconditioned. . Compared to unconditioned items, conditioned items elicited fewer "don't know" (DK) responses (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93), higher risk perceptions ( = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.49-0.61) and stronger positive correlations with intentions ( = 5.46,  < 0.001) and behavior ( = 5.10,  < 0.001). The effect of conditioning was more pronounced for perceived likelihood than feelings of risk items (OR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.63-3.01 and  = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.20 for DK responding and risk perception magnitude, respectively). The effect on risk perception magnitude (except absolute feelings of risk) was higher among people with higher health literacy (χ(3) = 8.11,  = 0.04). . Researchers who examine whether perceived risk motivates precautionary behavior should consider conditioning risk perception items on behavior to increase the validity of the statistical conclusions they draw and to gain insight into the nature of perceived risk and its relation to behavior.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696055>Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3β Plays a Suppressive Role in Colorectal  Progression.</a></h1><p> Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β) is a key transcription factor in the development of the gastrointestinal tract. However, only few studies have examined its' expression, function and potential clinical significance in colorectal  tumorigenesis and progression.  HNF3β expression in colorectal  tissue samples of 174 patients was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The results were analyzed with respect to patients' clinicopathological characteristics and survival. Following the  cell transfection, MTT, wound healing, and Transwell assays were used to test cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, respectively. Western blot was used to examine IL6, JAK1, and STAT3 protein expression. The potential for tumor formation was evaluated using a mouse xenograft model.  HNF3β expression was lower in  tissue compared to normal tissue and correlated with UICC clinical stage ( = 0.001), depth of invasion ( = 0.004), regional lymph node metastasis ( = 0.007), distant metastasis ( = 0.048), and poor survival ( < 0.001) in patients with colorectal . Furthermore, HNF3β overexpression impeded proliferation, migration and invasion of SW480 cells via JAK-STAT3 signaling . Moreso, HNF3β overexpression showed a significant growth inhibition of subcutaneous xenograft tumors .  The results show that HNF3β acts as a suppressor of colorectal  progression and decreased HNF3 β expression is closely related to the poor prognosis. Thus, HNF3β may be a potential molecular target for inhibition of colorectal  cells and development of new anti-tumor therapies.Copyright © 2019 Wang, Lu, Wang, Zheng, Wang, Hu and Ji.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646062>Transmissible inflammation-induced colorectal  in inflammasome-deficient mice.</a></h1><p>The microbiota is pivotal in orchestrating the pathogenesis of IBD-associated colorectal  (CRC).

In the current case-control study, an association between diagnosis of CRC, obesity and diabetes was investigated.Demographic characteristics, colonoscopy reports, history of drug, smoking, and medical history were collected from patients referred to a colonoscopy unit. The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, diabetes, family history of  was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04). The results also demonstrated a significant association between suffering from diabetes and having  adenoma (OR = 1.831, 95%CI = 1.058-3.169, p value = 0.023). The experimental results of 5 classification methods on higher risk factors between  adenoma and normal colonoscopy data were more than 82% and less than 0.42 for the percentage of classification accuracy and root mean squared error, respectively.In the current study, the occurrence of obesity measured based on BMI and diabetes in the adenoma positive patient group was significantly higher than the control group although there was no notable association between obesity, diabetes and adenocarcinoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683128>An Erlotinib gold(I) conjugate for combating triple-negative breast .</a></h1><p>An Erlotinib triphenylphosphane gold(I) conjugate has been prepared from AuCl(PPh) and its crystal structure has been established by X-ray diffraction, showing a metallo-helicate formation. IC values of the new gold conjugate were calculated towards a panel of human tumor cell lines representative of breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) and  (HT-29)  cells. Overall, the gold conjugate exhibited higher cytotoxic activity than that of Erlotinib against the  cells studied. Particularly, the antiproliferative effect of the conjugate demonstrated to be 68-fold higher than Erlotinib in highly metastatic and triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell line. The gold conjugate caused DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase and induced apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the conjugate induces significant arrest in S and G/M phases primarily, whereas Erlotinib, as an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), blocks G/S transition and increases G cell population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this review, we summarized and discussed the current knowledge on pathogenic roles of the altered [Ca] and Ca channels/transporters like SOCE, TRP channels, SERCA and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers in CRC tumorigenesis and progression. Understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of [Ca] on CRC is essential to develop Ca channels/transporters as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Targeting Ca signaling for  therapy has become an emerging research area nowadays, although our knowledge about the roles of Ca channels/transporters in tumorigenesis is still in the early stage, we still believe that they will act as novel preventive/therapeutic targets for CRC with potentially extensive clinical significance.Copyright © 2019.

The accumulated evidence suggests that high expression of HMGA2 is related to tumor progression, poor prognosis, and a poor response to therapy. Thus, HMGA2 is an important molecular target for many types of malignancies. Our recent studies revealed the positive connections between heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and HMGA2 and that the Hsp90 inhibitor has therapeutic potential to inhibit HMGA2-triggered tumorigenesis. However, 43% of patients suffered visual disturbances in a phase I trial of the second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922. To identify a specific inhibitor to target HMGA2, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000platform were both analyzed. We identified the approved small-molecule antifungal agent ciclopirox (CPX) as a novel potential inhibitor of HMGA2. In addition, CPX induces cytotoxicity of colorectal  (CRC) cells by induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo through direct interaction with the AT-hook motif (a small DNA-binding protein motif) of HMGA2. In conclusion, this study is the first to report that CPX is a novel potential inhibitor of HMGA2 using a drug-repurposing approach, which can provide a potential therapeutic intervention in CRC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664942>Muir-Torre syndrome: sebaceous carcinoma concurrent with  in a kidney transplant recipient; a case report.</a></h1><p>Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare but progressive malignant skin , and the incidence is approximately five times higher in post-transplant patients than in people who have not received kidney transplants. Sebaceous carcinoma is sometimes found concurrently with visceral cancers and a genetic abnormality, Muir-Torre syndrome. We report the case of a female kidney transplant recipient with sebaceous carcinoma concurrent with  10 years after transplantation.A 43-year-old woman was admitted due to a rapidly progressive tumor on her head. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as sebaceous carcinoma. We diagnosed her with Muir-Torre syndrome based on the following evidence: 1) high prevalence of microsatellite instability in gene locus assay, 2) absence of mismatch repair proteins in the sebaceous carcinoma on immunohistochemical analysis, and 3) a genetic mutation of 1226_1227delAG in the MSH2 exon 7 in the lesion detected by DNA sequencing analysis. Several reports have shown an association between immunosuppressive agents and latent Muir-Torre syndrome progression. Therefore, the progression of  in this case originated from her genetic mutation for Muir-Torre syndrome and long-term use of immunosuppressive agents.This case report not only highlights the importance of adequate diagnosis and therapy for Muir-Torre syndrome, but also suggests the further prevention of the development of malignant tumors in kidney transplant recipients.

Among these cells are enteric glial cells (EGCs) that are potent regulators of the epithelium functions in a healthy intestine. However, whether EGCs impact CSC-driven tumorigenesis remains unknown.Impact of human EGC primary cultures or a non-transformed EGC line on CSCs isolated from human primary  adenocarcinomas or  cell lines with different p53, MMR system and stemness status was determined using murine xenograft models and 3D co-culture systems. Supernatants of patient-matched human primary  adenocarcinomas and non-adjacent healthy mucosa were used to mimic tumor versus healthy mucosa secretomes and compare their effects on EGCs.Our data show that EGCs stimulate CSC expansion and ability to give rise to tumors via paracrine signaling. Importantly, only EGCs that were pre-activated by tumor epithelial cell-derived soluble factors increased CSC tumorigenicity. Pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis in EGCs or IL-1 knockdown in tumor epithelial cells prevented EGC acquisition of a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of PGE2 receptor EP4 and EGFR in CSCs inhibited the effects of tumor-activated EGCs.Altogether, our results show that EGCs, once activated by the tumor, acquire a pro-tumorigenic phenotype and stimulate CSC-driven tumorigenesis via a PGE2/EP4/EGFR-dependent pathway.This work was supported by grants from the French National  Institute, La Ligue contre le , the 'Région des Pays de la Loire' and the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive  Center.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Triptolide exerts a unique bioactive spectrum of anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to determine whether triptolide has any effect on the activation of TAMs and the production of tumor-promoting mediators. ICR-1 mice with azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced  tumors and BALB/c mice co-inoculated with 4T1 cells and M2-polarized RAW264.7 cells were used to examine whether the inhibitory effect of triptolide on tumor progression was mediated by the targeting of TAMs. Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry assays were performed to determine the expression of cell surface markers and cytokine production. The results showed that triptolide inhibited macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype and abolished M2 macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the expression of M2 markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of M2-polarized macrophages and TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity.

Remnant synchronous lesions require additional colonoscopy procedures or surgery.To investigate factors of preoperative colonoscopy potentially affecting the detection of missed lesions in patients subjected to colorectal  surgery.Of 1147 colorectal  patients subjected to curative open or laparoscopic colectomy and colonoscopy at the Chungnam National University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2016, 518 patients underwent pre- and postoperative colonoscopy. The index colonoscopy was defined as the last preoperative endoscopy performed. We analyzed pre- and postoperative medical charts for colonoscopy and pathological data. The effects of patient, procedure, and tumor factors on the postoperative adenoma detection rate, advanced adenoma detection rate, and adenoma miss rate (AMR) were analyzed.The overall AMR was 25.7% (95% confidence interval, 22.2-29.8%). Comparing optimal and non-optimal bowel preparation groups, the latter had greater postoperative polyp missed rate (PMR), AMR (p < 0.01), and AAMR (p = 0.272). The optimal preparation group allowed identification of more synchronous adenomas than in the fair (OR 5.72) and poor (OR 11.39) preparation groups. On univariate analysis, patient age and left-sided colectomy (p < 0.01) influenced AMR. Multivariate analysis showed that age, preoperative bowel preparation, and left  resection influenced postoperative AMR.A better quality of index colonoscopy had a positive effect on lowering the detection rate of postoperative adenoma. Older age and suboptimal bowel preparation at the index colonoscopy and left-sided colectomy had negative effects on lowering the postoperative AMR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690625>An engineered antibody fragment targeting mutant β-catenin via Major Histocompatibility Complex I neoantigen presentation.</a></h1><p>Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, are common in  and liver cancers, the most frequent mutation affecting Ser-45 in β-catenin. Peptides derived from wild-type β-catenin have previously been shown to be presented on the cell surface as part of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I, suggesting an opportunity for targeting this common driver gene mutation with antibody-based therapies. Here, crystal structures of both the wild-type and S45F mutant peptide bound to HLA-A*03:01 at 2.20 and 2.45 Å resolutions, respectively, confirmed the accessibility of the phenylalanine residue for antibody recognition. Phage display was then used to identify single chain variable fragment clones that selectively bind the S45F mutant peptide presented in HLA-A*03:01 and have minimal wild-type or other off-target binding. Following initial characterization of five clones, we selected a single clone, E10, for further investigation. We developed a computational model of the binding of E10 to the mutant peptide bound HLA-A3, incorporating data from affinity maturation as initial validation. In the future, our model may be used to design clones with maintained specificity and higher affinity.

Here, we investigated the tumor preventive activity of curaxin CBL0137. This compound represents a new class of non-mutagenic DNA-binding small molecules that alter chromatin stability and inhibit the function of the histone chaperone FACT. Among downstream effects of CBL0137 treatment are activation of p53 and type I interferons and inhibition of NF-κB, HSF1 and MYC. In addition, our data show that in both human and mouse CRC cells in vitro CBL0137 inhibits the APC/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a key role in  carcinogenesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR and microarray hybridization, we have demonstrated decreased expression of multiple components and downstream targets of the WNT pathway in  cells treated with CBL0137. At the same time, CBL0137 induced expression of WNT antagonists. Inhibition of WNT-signaling activity by CBL0137 was also confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Tumor preventive activity of CBL0137 in vivo was tested in a murine model of colorectal carcinogenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), which is known to involve WNT pathway dysregulation. After DMH subcutaneous treatment, mice were administered CBL0137 in drinking water. Efficacy of CBL0137 in suppressing CRC development in this model was evidenced by reduced incidence of adenocarcinomas and adenomas in both males and females, decrease in tumor multiplicity.

Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted with log-rank tests to compare overall survival (OS) of patients with different metastatic patterns. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the effects of different metastatic patterns on survival outcomes in terms of OS and disease-specific survival (DSS).A total of 26 170 patients were analyzed. The 3- and 5-year OS were 20.7% and 10.5%, respectively, for patients with stage IV CAC. The most common distant metastatic site was the liver, followed by the lung, bone, and brain, but the frequency differed greatly by histology subtypes. The site of metastasis was a significant prognostic factor for OS and DSS in patients with stage IV CAC, independent of the number of metastatic sites and other clinical and demographic prognostic factors. Using liver-only metastasis as reference, lung-only metastasis was associated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.94) and DSS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.64-0.88). Older age, black race, unmarried status, grade III/IV tumors, advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, proximal , elevated preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), no surgery of the primary site, and no chemotherapy were independent predictors of poor OS.The site of distant metastasis and number of metastasis site were independent prognostic factors for survival of patients with stage IV CAC. This study highlights the need for diverse treatment strategies for patients with different metastatic patterns.© 2019 The Authors.

EpCAM expression at tumoral level was analyzed in relation with clinical and pathological variables of the patients using anti-EpCAM specific antibody.EpCAM expression was predominant in tumoral tissue compared to normal  mucosa and most of the cases (58.7%) showed increased EpCAM expression. Although increased EpCAM expression was observed in advanced stages and in patients with advanced locoregional disease, there was no statistically significant correlation with the clinical and pathological characteristics of the patients.The majority of the analyzed samples showed increased EpCAM expression in tumoral tissue suggesting its involvement in the carcinogenesis process. Numerous studies have identified EpCAM overexpression in  as a negative prognostic factor, being associated with advanced stage of the disease and a poor prognosis of the patient but results are inconsistent. Nevertheless, assessing a possible correlation between EpCAM expression at tumoral level and clinico- pathological characteristics is dependent on the type of antibody used to identify the molecule of interest.EpCAM detection in  using anti-human CD326/EpCAM clone VU-1D9 does not allow the correlation between its expression and the clinico-pathological characteristics of the patients and it should only be used for EpCAM identification in  tissues., , EpCAM, Immunohistochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667643>-associated fibroblast-derived WNT2 increases tumor angiogenesis in .</a></h1><p>WNT2 acts as a pro-angiogenic factor in placental vascularization and increases angiogenesis in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) and other ECs. Increased WNT2 expression is detectable in many carcinomas and participates in tumor progression. In human colorectal  (CRC), WNT2 is selectively elevated in -associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leading to increased invasion and metastasis. However, if there is a role for WNT2 in , angiogenesis was not addressed so far. We demonstrate that WNT2 enhances EC migration/invasion, while it induces canonical WNT signaling in a small subset of cells. Knockdown of WNT2 in CAFs significantly reduced angiogenesis in a physiologically relevant assay, which allows precise assessment of key angiogenic properties. In line with these results, expression of WNT2 in otherwise WNT2-devoid skin fibroblasts led to increased angiogenesis. In CRC xenografts, WNT2 overexpression resulted in enhanced vessel density and tumor volume. Moreover, WNT2 expression correlates with vessel markers in human CRC. Secretome profiling of CAFs by mass spectrometry and cytokine arrays revealed that proteins associated with pro-angiogenic functions are elevated by WNT2. These included extracellular matrix molecules, ANG-2, IL-6, G-CSF, and PGF. The latter three increased angiogenesis. Thus, stromal-derived WNT2 elevates angiogenesis in CRC by shifting the balance towards pro-angiogenic signals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661001>Targeting CXCR4 potentiates anti-PD-1 efficacy modifying the tumor microenvironment and inhibiting neoplastic PD-1.</a></h1><p>Inefficient T-cell access to the tumor microenvironment (TME) is among the causes of tumor immune-resistance. Previous evidence demonstrated that targeting CXCR4 improves anti-PD-1/PD-L1 efficacy reshaping TME. To evaluate the role of newly developed CXCR4 antagonists (PCT/IB2011/000120/ EP2528936B1/US2013/0079292A1) in potentiating anti-PD-1 efficacy two syngeneic murine models, the MC38  and the B16 melanoma-human CXCR4-transduced, were employed.Mice were subcutaneously injected with MC38 (1 × 10) or B16-hCXCR4 (5 × 10). After two weeks, tumors bearing mice were intraperitoneally (ip) treated with murine anti-PD-1 [RMP1-14] (5 mg/kg, twice week for 2 weeks), Pep R (2 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 2 weeks), or both agents. The TME was evaluated through immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry. In addition, the effects of the human-anti-PD-1 nivolumab and/or Peptide-R54 (Pep R54), were evaluated on human melanoma PES43 cells and xenografts treated.The combined treatment, Pep R plus anti-PD-1, reduced the MC38 Relative Tumor Volume (RTV) by 2.67 fold (p = 0.038) while nor anti-PD-1, neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. Significant higher number of Granzyme B (GZMB) positive cells was detected in MC38 tumors from mice treated with the combined treatment (p = 0.016) while anti-PD-1 determined a modest but significant increase of tumor-infiltrating GZMB positive cells (p = 0.035). Also, a lower number of FoxP3 positive cells was detected (p = 0.022). In the B16-hCXCR4 tumors, two weeks of combined treatment reduced tumor volume by 2.27 fold while nor anti-PD-1 neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. A significant higher number of GRZB positive cells was observed in B16-hCXCR4 tumors treated with combined treatment (p = 0,0015) as compared to anti-PD-1 (p = 0.028). The combined treatment reduced CXCR4, CXCL12 and PD-L1 expression in MC38 tumors. In addition, flow cytometry on fresh B16-hCXCR4 tumors showed significantly higher Tregs number following anti-PD-1 partially reversed by the combined treatment Pep R and anti-PD-1. Combined treatment determined an increase of CD8/Tregs and CD8/MDSC ratio. To dissect the effect of anti-PD-1 and CXCR4 targeting on PD-1 expressed by human  cells, PES43 human melanoma xenograft model was employed. In vitro human anti-PD-1 nivolumab or pembrolizumab (10 μM) reduced PES43 cells growth while nivolumab (10 μM) inhibited pERK1/2, P38 MAPK, pAKT and p4EBP. PES43 xenograft mice were treated with Pep R54, a newly developed Pep R derivative (AcHN-Arg-Ala-[DCys-Arg- Nal(2')-His-Pen]- COOH), plus nivolumab. After 3 weeks of combined treatment a significant reduction in tumor growth was shown (p = 0.038). PES43 lung disseminated tumor cells (DTC) were detected in fresh lung tissues as melanoma positive MCSP-APC cells. Although not statistically significant, DTC-PES43 cells were reduced in mice lungs treated with combined treatment while nivolumab or Pep R54 did not affect DTC number.Combined treatment with the new developed CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R, plus anti-PD-1, reduced tumor-growth in two syngeneic murine models, anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant, potentiating Granzyme and reducing Foxp3 cells infiltration. In addition, the human specific CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R54, cooperated with nivolumab in inhibiting the growth of the PD-1 expressing human PES43 melanoma xenograft. This evidence sheds light on PD-1 targeting mechanisms and paves the way for CXCR4/PD-1 targeting combination therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658051>Erythrocyte deformability and aggregability in patients undergoing  surgery and effects of two infusions with omega-3 fatty acids.</a></h1><p>An adequate erythrocyte function is vital for tissue oxygenation and wound healing. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipid composition plays an important role in erythrocyte function and administration of omega-3 fatty acids may provide a means to improve it.To investigate peri-operative erythrocyte function and effects of omega-3 fatty acidsMETHODS:Forty-four patients undergoing elective laparoscopic  resection for non-metastasized  were randomized between intravenous omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) or placebo (saline). Peri-operative blood samples were analyzed with a Lorrca MaxSIS Ektacytometer and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were determined with gas chromatography.Patient and operation characteristics were equal between groups. There was a significant increase in erythrocyte membrane eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the n-PUFA group. There were no significant differences in erythrocyte deformability but the aggregation index (AI) was significantly lower and the aggregation half time (T½) was significantly higher in the n-3 PUFA group.This study confirms rapid changes in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid composition after administration of intravenous n-3 PUFAs. Erythrocyte deformability parameters were not affected but erythrocyte aggregability was decreased in the n-3 PUFA group. Further investigation is necessary to gain more insights in the effects of n-3 PUFA and the postoperative inflammatory response on erythrocyte function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693889>NFE2L3 Controls  Cell Growth through Regulation of DUX4, a CDK1 Inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Constitutive nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation is a hallmark of  tumor growth. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are critical cell-cycle regulators, and inhibition of CDK activity has been used successfully as anticancer therapy. Here, we show that the NFE2L3 transcription factor functions as a key regulator in a pathway that links NF-κB signaling to the control of CDK1 activity, thereby driving  cell proliferation. We found that NFE2L3 expression is regulated by the RELA subunit of NF-κB and that NFE2L3 levels are elevated in patients with  adenocarcinoma when compared with normal adjacent tissue. Silencing of NFE2L3 significantly decreases  cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. NFE2L3 knockdown results in increased levels of double homeobox factor 4 (DUX4), which functions as a direct inhibitor of CDK1. The discovered oncogenic pathway governing cell-cycle progression may open up unique avenues for precision  therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, there is barely a systemic review related to the comparison between the SILS and the conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (CLS) for the right  in the long term follow-up. Herein, we used the most recent articles to compare these two techniques by meta-analysis.We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Wanfang databases to compare SILS with CLS for right  up to May 2019. The operative, postoperative, pathological and mid-term follow-up outcomes of nine studies were extracted and compared.A total of 1356 patients participated in 9 studies, while 653 patients were assigned to the SILS group and 703 patients were assigned to the CLS group. The patients' baselines in the SILS group were consistent with those in the CLS group. Compared to the CLS group, the SILS group had a shorter operation duration (SMD - 23.49, 95%CI - 36.71 to - 10.27, P < 0.001, chi-square = 24.11), shorter hospital stay (SMD - 0.76, 95% `CI - 1.07 to - 0.45, P < 0.001, chi-square = 9.85), less blood loss (SMD - 8.46, 95% CI - 14.59 to - 2.34; P < 0.05; chi-square = 2.26), smaller incision length (SMD - 1.60, 95% CI - 2.66 to - 0.55, P < 0.001; chi-square = 280.44), more lymph node harvested (SMD - 0.98, 95% CI - 1.79 to - 0.16, P < 0.05; chi-square = 4.61), and a longer proximal surgical edge (SMD - 0.51, 95% CI - 0.93 to - 0.09, P < 0.05; chi-square = 2.42). No significant difference was found in other indexes. After we removed a single large study, we performed another meta-analysis again. The operation duration in the SILS group was still better than that in the CLS group.SILS could be a faster and more reliable approach than CLS for the right  and could accelerate patient recovery, especially for patients with a low BMI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665064>BMP3 suppresses  tumorigenesis via ActRIIB/SMAD2-dependent and TAK1/JNK signaling pathways.</a></h1><p>BMP3 gene is often found hypermethylated and hence inactivated in several types of cancers including colorectal  (CRC), indicating that it has a suppressor role in carcinogenesis. Though BMP3 is a reliable biomarker for screening CRC, the molecular mechanism of BMP3 in carcinogenesis remains largely unknown.The expression level of BMP3 was examined by immunohistochemistry staining and western blot. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and real-time quantitative MSP were used to test the hypermethylation status of BMP3 gene. Analyses of BMP3 function in  cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were performed using HCT116 and KM12 cells. BMP3 was further knocked down or overexpressed in CRC cells, and the effects on cell growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice were assessed. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyze the association between BMP3 and BMPR2 or BMP3 and ActRIIB. Microarray analysis was performed to identify most differentially expressed genes and pathways regulated by BMP3. The BMP3-regulated SMAD2-dependent signaling pathway and TAK1/JNK signal axes were further investigated by quantitative PCR and western blot.BMP3 gene was hypermethylated and its expression was downregulated in both CRC tissues and cell lines. Expressing exogenous BMP3 in HCT116 inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion and increased rate of apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. However, shRNA-mediated attenuation of endogenous BMP3 in KM12 reversed such inhibitory and apoptotic effects. Furthermore, BMP3 could bind to ActRIIB, an activin type II receptor at the cellular membrane, thereby activating SMAD2-dependent pathway and TAK1/JNK signal axes to regulate downstream targets including caspase-7, p21, and SMAD4 that play crucial roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis.Our study reveals a previously unknown mechanism of BMP3 tumor suppression in CRC and provides a rationale for future investigation of BMP3 as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic agents to fight CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686843>Overexpression of miR-671-5p indicates a poor prognosis in  and accelerates proliferation, migration, and invasion of  cells.</a></h1><p> is one of the common malignancies worldwide, and many genes, including microRNAs (miRNAs), have been demonstrated that associated with progression of various diseases, including cancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of miR-671-5p in .Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-671-5p in 115 paired  tissues and adjacent normal tissues, as well as in  cells. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the prognostic significance of miR-671-5p in . CCK-8 assay, colony-formation assay, Transwell migration and invasion assays were used to evaluate the effects of miR-671-5p on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in .We found that miR-671-5p expression was increased in  tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-671-5p was found associated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and poor overall survival of patients with . By exploiting miR-671-5p mimics and inhibitors, miR-671-5p overexpression significantly increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while downregulation of miR-671-5p inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of  cells.Taken together, miR-671-5p may act as an oncogene in  and promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of  cells by targeting TRIM67.

This retrospective study was to evaluate the outcomes of emergency surgery for oCRC in a general surgery unit.A retrospective review of data from 1175 patients who underwent colorectal surgery between January 2013 and January 2018 was performed. Among these, a total of 186 patients with oCRC who underwent surgery within 24 h of hospital admission were analyzed. For patients with resectable right-sided oCRC, one-stage surgery was performed. For left-sided oCRC, primary anastomosis was mainly attempted; otherwise, a stoma was formed. The rates of primary resection, PRa, stoma, mortality, and morbidity were evaluated.Among 186 patients, oCRC involving the right , left , and rectum were found in 33.3%, 59.1% and 7.5% respectively. Primary resection and anastomosis were performed in 100%, 44.7%, and 0% of patients with oCRC in the right , left , and rectum respectively. The complication incidence based on Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher was 16.1% and the mortality rate was 7.5%. The median length of hospital stay was 8.5 days, ranging from 2 to 70 days.General surgeons with colorectal surgery experience can still manage oCRC effectively. Primary resection and anastomosis for left-sided oCRC is safe in selective patients. The emergency surgery for oCRC could be benefit with the participation of colorectal surgeons.Copyright © 2019.

The present study is a systematic review to evaluate the role of EPIC after CRS + HIPEC for appendiceal and colorectal cancers with PC.We conducted a systematic search in PubMed according to the PRISMA guidelines and included all studies published before June 27 of 2019 comparing EPIC to HIPEC or the combination of both. Our search found 79 articles. After excluding non-relevant articles, a total of 13 retrospective clinical studies reporting on the efficacy and safety of EPIC compared to HIPEC or as a combination therapy for lower gastrointestinal  were analyzed. Initial EPIC reports led to its declined usage because of concerns with increased postoperative morbidity and uncertain added benefit on survival. Recent retrospective studies have been promising, showing significant improvements in OS and fewer issues with complications when adding EPIC to CRS + HIPEC.Current evidence is entirely retrospective and is conflicting. It is hoped that ongoing clinical trials and additional studies will clarify EPIC's role in the treatment of patients with PC.© 2019 Soucisse et al., published by De Gruyter.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656692>The Cytotoxic Effects of Geranylgeranylacetone Are Attenuated in the High-Glucose Condition.</a></h1><p>Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) has been used as an antiulcer drug and also is known as inducer of heat shock protein 70 that has cytoprotective effects especially in hyperglycemic condition. In contrast, cytotoxicity of GGA has also been reported. Some studies have reported that GGA suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis in cell models of human leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, and  . Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether GGA can have a cytotoxic effect on a human cervical  cell line (HeLa), human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK) in normal-glucose and high-glucose environments (NG and HG, respectively). The results showed that 100 μM GGA inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells only in NG environment despite inhibiting proliferation of Caco-2 and HEK cells regardless of glucose concentration. Cell viability assay revealed that GGA decreased viability of HeLa, Caco-2, and HEK cells only in NG environment. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the type of cell death was a combination of necrosis and apoptosis. Our study revealed that difference in cytotoxicity of GGA is influenced by glucose condition. The cytotoxic effects of GGA are attenuated in the HG condition. Since both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects are reported about GGA, further research is needed about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects.© Yuko Nakano et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671761>Size Matters in the Cytotoxicity of Polydopamine Nanoparticles in Different Types of Tumors.</a></h1><p>Polydopamine has acquired great relevance in the field of nanomedicine due to its physicochemical properties. Previously, it has been reported that nanoparticles synthetized from this polymer are able to decrease the viability of breast and  tumor cells. In addition, it is well known that the size of therapeutic particles plays an essential role in their effect. As a consequence, the influence of this parameter on the cytotoxicity of polydopamine nanoparticles was studied in this work. For this purpose, polydopamine nanoparticles with three different diameters (115, 200 and 420 nm) were synthetized and characterized. Their effect on the viability of distinct sorts of human carcinomas (breast, , liver and lung) and stromal cells was investigated, as well as the possible mechanisms that could be responsible for such cytotoxicity. Moreover, polydopamine nanoparticles were also loaded with doxorubicin and the therapeutic action of the resulting nanosystem was analyzed. As a result, it was demonstrated that a smaller nanoparticle size is related to a more enhanced antiproliferative activity, which may be a consequence of polydopamine's affinity for iron ions. Smaller nanoparticles would be able to adsorb more lysosomal Fe and, when they are loaded with doxorubicin, a synergistic effect can be achieved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648651>Dietary Phenolic Acids and Flavonoids as Potential Anti- Agents: Current State of Art and Future Perspectives.</a></h1><p> is a rapidly growing disease and the second most leading cause of death worldwide.

As the prevalence of thyroid  increases worldwide, thyroid  survivorship is associated with increasing personal and cumulative costs. Few studies have examined the psychological and material economic costs experienced by thyroid  survivors. We seek to estimate the comparative prevalence of financial and psychological hardship among thyroid  and non-thyroid  patients in the United States.The 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Experiences with  databank was queried to identify thyroid and non-thyroid (, breast, lung, prostate)  survivors. This survey includes assessments of financial stress, material hardship, and psychological financial hardship.  incidence-based weighted estimates of responses were compared between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. Independent predictors of material and psychological financial burden were identified through separate multivariate regression models.Thyroid  survivors more frequently reported psychological financial burden compared to non-thyroid  (46.1% vs 24.0%, P = .04). Material financial hardship (28.1% vs 19.9%, P = .37) and concurrent material and psychological hardship (25.1% vs 12.5%, P = .09) were noted at similar frequencies between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. However, on multivariate analysis, only younger age and lack of health insurance coverage were independently associated with psychological financial hardship.Thyroid  survivors report greater psychological financial hardship than non-thyroid  survivors. Because this financial burden may be underrecognized in the medical community, further studies should be conducted to aid physicians in better understanding the impact of a thyroid  diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a  model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of  patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to -related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies have examined the potential prognostic value of the CLU protein in CRC; however, our research follows an alternative approach, focusing on the CLU mRNA expression.Total RNA from 172 cancerous tissue specimens and 39 paired non-cancerous ones was isolated and 2 μg of this were subjected to reverse transcription with an oligo-dT primer. The single stranded DNA, which was synthesized, was amplified with an in-house developed highly sensitive and precise qPCR method, using specific pair of primers for the CLU molecule. Finally, an extensive biostatical analysis took place for the assessment of the results.Patients with tumors expressing high CLU mRNA levels had a higher probability for poor outcome (relapse and death), comparing to those with CLU mRNA-negative tumors. This association between CLU mRNA expression status and both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) is evident in Cox regression analysis and is also depicted in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Consistently, the aforementioned associations and the CLU mRNA expression levels are significantly enhanced as CRC tumors progress from TNM stage I to IV, further supporting the functional implication of CLU in tumorigenesis.High CLU mRNA levels in CRC tumors can act as a new adverse prognostic biomarker of DFS and OS for CRC, independent of clinicopathological and biological features of the patient.Copyright © 2019.

We have identified that mitotic regulator microtubule-associated protein 9 (MAP9) as a critical regulator of CIN in CRC. We thus studied the effect of MAP9 loss on CRC in Map9 knockout mice and in cell lines.We generated  epithelial-specific Map9 knockout mice and evaluated CRC development. Effect of Map9 knockout on CRC progression was determined in chemical or ApcMin/+-induced CRC. Molecular mechanism of MAP9 was determined using spectral karyotyping (SKY), microtubule assays and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Clinical significance of MAP9 was examined in 141 CRC patients.Spontaneous  tumors (9.1%) were developed in  epithelium-specific Map9 knockout mice at 17 months, but none was observed in wildtype littermates. Map9 deletion accelerated CRC formation both in ApcMin/+ mice and azoxymethane-treated mice, and reduced survival in ApcMin/+ mice. Mechanistically, MAP9 stabilized microtubules and mediated mitotic spindle assembly. MAP9 also maintained the spindle pole integrity and protected K-fibre from depolymerization at spindle poles. MAP9 loss induced severe mitosis failure, chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy, leading to transformation of normal  epithelial cells. WGS confirmed enhanced CIN in intestinal tumors from Map9 knockout ApcMin/+ mice. In CRC patients, MAP9 was frequently silenced and its down-regulation was associated with poor survival.MAP9 is a microtubule stabilizer that contributes to spindle stability and inhibits colorectal tumorigenesis, supporting the role of MAP9 as a tumor suppressor for preventing CIN in CRC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693861>Growth differentiation factor 15 and its role in carcinogenesis: an update.</a></h1><p>Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a novel cytokine secreted by a variety of cells like macrophages, adipocytes, normally expressed in high amounts by placenta.

Measures included any use, incident use, regular use (use ≥ 45 days in a 91-day quarter), and average daily dose (converted to morphine milligram equivalent, MME). We also assessed temporal trends of opioid use.Of 2,039  patients, 11-15% received opioids in the four pre-diagnosis quarters, 68% in the first quarter after diagnosis, and 15-17% in each subsequent 19 quarters. Regular opioid use increased from 3 to 5% pre-diagnosis to 5-7% post diagnosis. Average dose increased from 15 to 17 MME/day pre-diagnosis to 14-22 MME/day post diagnosis (excluding the quarter in which  was diagnosed). Among post-diagnosis opioid users, 73-95% were on a low dose (< 20 MME/day). Over years, regular use of opioids increased in survivorship with no change in dosage.Opioid use slightly increased following a  diagnosis, but high-dose use was rare.

Alterations in DNA repair, occurring in many cancers, contribute to the accumulation of mutations in the genome, resulting in genomic instability and  progression. DNA repair also plays a substantial role in response to chemotherapeutics: rapidly dividing  cells, vulnerable to DNA-damaging agents and overcoming DNA repair, undergo cell death. DNA repair capacity represents a complex biomarker, integrating gene variants, gene expressions, the stability of gene products, the effect of inhibitors/stimulators, lifestyle and environmental factors.

Various factors have been studied to identify patients at risk of developing peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), including T4 tumors. The objectives were to assess the incidence of synchronous and metachronous PC, explore potential risk factors for developing PC as the only site of metastasis, and identify which patients might be candidates for prophylactic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).We conducted a retrospective analysis of 125 patients with pT4  who underwent surgery in a single center between January 2010 and December 2014.Of the 947  patients who underwent surgery, 125 (13.2%) were diagnosed with pT4a or b  carcinoma. The median follow-up was 3.7 years. The overall rate of PC was 34.3%, being synchronous in 12% and metachronous in 22.3% of cases. The 8% and 6% of synchronous and metachronous cases of PC respectively were isolated (single site) metastasis. The incidence of PC was 6.1% at 1 year and 14.5% at 3 years after surgery. pT4 was not found to be an independent risk factor for the development of PC (p = 0.231). Nonetheless, the rate of metachronous PC as a single site of metastasis was higher in patients with pT4 tumors and peritoneal nodules around the primary tumor and/or tumor perforation (p = 0.027) and/or who underwent emergency surgery (p = 0.043) than other patients.Considering pT4 tumor stage as the only risk factor for the development of PC in deciding whether to administer prophylactic HIPEC would lead to unjustified overtreatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696302>Co-occurring genetic alterations and primary EGFR T790M mutations detected by NGS in pre-TKI-treated NSCLCs.</a></h1><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assays to understand various mutations and co-occurrence of genomic alterations in non-small cell lung  (NSCLC) have enabled understanding of treatment impact on clinical outcomes.This retrospective study was conducted in 1353 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from surgically resected, pre-TKI-treated NSCLC patients with identified gene alterations. Genomic DNA and RNA extraction was followed by NGS library preparation and sequencing using the Ion Ampliseq  and Lung  Gene Panel V2 and the AmpliSeq RNA Lung  Research Fusion Panel.A total of 2328 alterations in 25 genes were detected from the 1293 patients. DNA mutations and RNA fusions co-occurred in 27 patients with TP53 being the most common co-occurring DNA mutation (43.8%) with concurrent ALK fusions. Analysis of the 975 patients with EGFR mutations revealed that the incidence of dual EGFR L858R/T790M mutations was higher compared to EGFR 19del/T790M, and the mean allele fraction (MAF) of T790M was lower compared to 19del in dual EGFR 19del/T790M patients.NSCLC patients represented genetically heterogeneous subgroup with a high frequency of co-occurring mutations in -associated pathways. This diverse mutational profile may have key clinical and research implications for understanding the variability of treatment outcome in pre-TKI-treated NSCLC population.

Surgical care is essential for the treatment. Many patients do not have access to curative surgery for colorectal  in rural Kenya. To better understand the impact of surgical care on colorectal  in a resource-limited setting, we compared the experience of patients undergoing operations to those who did not.All patients with histologically confirmed CRC at Tenwek Hospital from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from records when available. The exposure was either curative operation, palliative operation, or no operation. The primary outcome was survival at 5 years, assessed with Cox proportional hazard analysis after propensity-score matching for age, sex, tumor site, time period, and stage.One hundred and sixty-five patients were identified on chart review. Survival information was available for 150 patients with a median follow-up of 319 days. Fifty-two percent had  and 48% had rectal . At diagnosis, the mean age was 55.4 years (SD: 16.7) and the male to female ratio was 1.1:1. Thirty-nine percent underwent curative operations, 25% palliative operations, and 36% no operations. One-year survival was estimated to be 98% for curative surgery, 73% for palliative surgery, and 83% for no surgery (p = 0.0005). On crude analysis, 5-year survival improved with curative operation in comparison to no operation with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (CI: 0.14-0.64) (p = 0.002). After propensity matching, the hazard ratio for curative operation versus no operation remained significant, 0.34 (CI: 0.14-0.80) (p = 0.01).Curative surgery improves survival in our resource-limited environment. Although various factors contribute to the use of surgical treatment, the survival advantage persists after adjusted analysis. Barriers exist for access to prompt surgical evaluation and treatment. Surgical care should be a priority to address the increasing burden of CRC in resource-limited settings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661211>Childhood Colorectal  Treatment (PDQ®): Patient Version.</a></h1><p>This PDQ  information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood colorectal .

Previous work demonstrated the therapeutic effect of intratumoral injection of recombinant granulysin using  models of breast  and multiple myeloma. In the present work we have developed a granulysin gene fusion to the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA/CEACAM5) single chain Fv antibody fragment MFE23. Both granulysin and the granulysin-based immunotoxin were expressed in . The immunotoxin specifically recognized CEA, purified or expressed on the cell surface. Moreover, the bioactivity of the immunotoxin against several CEA cell lines was higher than that of granulysin alone. Granulysin and the immunotoxin were tested as a treatment in  xenograft models in athymic mice. When injected intratumorally, both granulysin and the immunotoxin were able to inhibit tumor growth. Furthermore, systemic administration of the immunotoxin demonstrated a decrease in tumor growth in a CEA tumor-bearing mouse model, whereas granulysin did not exhibit a therapeutic effect. This is the first granulysin-based immunotoxin and the present work constitutes the proof of concept of its therapeutic potential.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645984>A new family with a homozygous nonsense variant in  further delineated the clinical phenotype of -associated polyposis.</a></h1><p>A new family with -associated polyposis (NAP) is described, involving a 58-year-old male affected with >100 colorectal polyps and a 55-year-old female sibling with nine colorectal polyps.

This retrospective study identified the risk factors predicting IC and candidemia in  patients under intensive care after gastrointestinal surgery.Enrolled were 229  patients admitted to our oncology surgical ICU after gastrointestinal surgery between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2014.The most common types of solid gastrointestinal cancers were gastric (49.8%),  (20.1%), and esophageal (18.3%). The percentage of patients with corrected Candida colonization index (CCI) ≥0.4 was 31.9%. IC was confirmed in 19 patients (8.3%), and the ICU mortality was 15.8%. Candida albicans accounted for 52.6% of the total number of pathogenic Candida isolates. Among patients with CCI ≥0.4, the cancers with the highest prevalence were cardiac (45%) and gastric (36%), with ICU mortalities of 20% and 4.9%, respectively. For the diagnosis of candidemia, (1-3)-β-D-glucan (BDG) ≥80 pg/mL showed a sensitivity and specificity of 25% and 82.7%, respectively, positive and negative predictive values 6.7% and 95.7%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.512. CCI ≥0.4 was the only significant predictor of IC, and number of organ failures was the only predictor of candidemia (P = .000 and .026).CCI ≥0.4 was the only significant risk factor predicting IC, with greater prediction of intra-abdominal candidiasis but failure to predict candidemia. Blood culture and BDG detection are recommended to supplement diagnosis.

Amongst which the compound (E)-3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1-(4-((4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (5ab) displayed significant IC50 values in the range of 0.36 to 7.08 µm against the cell lines. Moreover, 5ab was found to be the most potent member  with IC50 0.36±0.02 µm. Furthermore, 5ab displayed significant inhibition of tubulin assembly with IC50 5.24±0.06 µm and molecular docking studies also disclosed the binding of 5ab effectively at the colchicine binding site.

Considering features of natural fatty acids, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability and their increased cellular uptake by  cells, it seems that combining them with a drug could improve its bioavailability, and thus cytotoxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was coupling of CP with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and evaluation of their cytotoxicity, apoptosis-inducing effects and inhibition of IL-6 release in human primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620) , metastatic prostate  (PC3) and normal (HaCaT) cell lines. The PC3 cell line was the most sensitive to the presence of the obtained conjugates. The value of IC for oleic acid conjugate (4) was 7.7 μM, and it was 12 times lower than for CP alone (101.4 μM). The studied derivatives induced late apoptosis in all  cell lines, but not in normal cells. The most potent apoptosis inducer was conjugate 4, that resulted in the highest percentage of PC3 cells in late apoptosis (81.5% ± 3.9), followed by elaidic acid amide 5 (75% ± 4.8). The strongest pro-apoptic effects on SW480 cells were demonstrated by conjugates of DHA (8) and sorbic (2) acids, whereas in SW620 cell lines, compounds 2 and 5 appeared to be the most effective. To establish the mechanism of cytotoxic action of derivatives 2, 4, 5, the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured. The compounds with the highest cytotoxic potential significantly decreased the release of IL-6 by  cells. Additionally, all conjugates were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity. Short chain amides - crotonic (1) and sorbic (2) - were the most active against Staphyloccoci. The second-mentioned amide has shown both strong antistaphylococcal and antitumor properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, whether plasma circRNAs might be novel diagnostic biomarkers for CRC remains unclear.We investigated the plasma levels of selected circRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The presence of the candidate circRNAs was confirmed through RNase R assays, qRT-PCR and DNA sequencing, and their diagnostic value was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.The plasma levels of three circRNAs (circ-CCDC66, circ-ABCC1 and circ-STIL) were significantly decreased in CRC patients (n = 45) compared with healthy controls (n = 61). The ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the three-circRNA panel was 0.780, which is higher than that of traditional protein biomarkers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Combining the circRNA panel with CEA and CA19-9 might improve the ability to diagnose CRC (AUC = 0.855). In addition, the plasma circ-ABCC1 level was related to tumor growth and progression, and the plasma circ-CCDC66 and circ-ABCC1 levels were decreased in precursor lesions of CRC, including  adenomas and adenomatous polyps. More importantly, circ-CCDC66 and circ-STIL were found to be useful for diagnosing early-stage CRC, and the three-circRNA panel improved the ability to diagnose CEA-negative and CA19-9-negative CRC.Our study provides the first identification of a panel of three plasma circRNAs that could serve as a novel and independent diagnostic biomarker for CRC.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze the expression of several genes in the Notch (notch, hes1, msi1, and numb) and Wnt/β-catenin (CTNNB1 and CCND1) pathways, following the treatment of HT-29 cells with Lactobacilli cocktail. The treatment by Lactobacilli cocktail induced a significant anti-proliferative effect and late stage apoptosis among the  cells (p < 0.05). Compared to the untreated cells, Lactobacilli cocktail induced the down-regulation of notch, hes1, and msi1 genes and up-regulation of numb gene in the Notch pathway as well as the down-regulation of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lactobacilli cocktail was shown to have beneficial anti-tumor effects on HT-29 cells by modulating the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways; therefore, the use of Lactobacilli probiotics as nutritional supplements may prevent the incidence of .Copyright © 2019.

Cisplatin (CisPt) is a very common chemotherapeutic agent to treat  by reestablishing apoptotic mechanisms of cell death. However, certain patients acquire resistance to CisPt as well as suffer nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting. The synthesis of new Pt(II) compounds represents an alternative to CisPt to avoid resistance and undesirable side effects. Pd(II) could be a Pt(II) surrogate given the similarity of coordination chemistry between them, thus widening the spectra of available anticancer drugs. Herein, we have synthesized and characterized two Pt(II) or Pd(II) complexes with TdTn (2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)imino-N-(2-thiazolin-2-yl)thiazolidine), a thiazoline derivative ligand, with formula [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)]. The potential anticancer ability was evaluated in human  adenocarcinoma HT-29 and human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cell lines. To that aim, U-937 and HT-29 cells were treated with TdTn, [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)] for 24 h. The microscopy monitoring indicated that TdTn, [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)] arrested the cell proliferation of U-937 and HT-29 cells with respect to control, in agreement with MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) analysis. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the ligand by its own showed antiproliferative effects in both cell lines. [PtCl(TdTn)] and [PdCl(TdTn)] caused caspase-3 activation in U-937 cells, simultaneously with caspase-9 activation due to complexes; however, in HT-29 caspase-3 activation occurred simultaneously with caspase-8 activation induced by the ligand TdTn. Only metal complexes were able to induce ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) generation in U-937 cells, but not TdTn. In HT-29 cells neither the metal complexes, nor the ligand induced ROS generation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of insertion-phase LCI in terms of additional benefit of colorectal polyp detection over that obtained with white light imaging (WLI).  We consecutively enrolled eligible patients from November 2017 to June 2018. During colonoscopy, LCI or WLI was alternatively applied on scope insertion and LCI was applied on scope withdrawal. Patients were divided into two groups according to the protocolized difference of imaging modality used in the scope insertion phase (LCI and WLI groups). Group differences in clinical outcomes were evaluated.  A total of 138 patients were enrolled in this study, with equal numbers of patients assigned to the LCI and WLI groups. Most of the lesions located in the proximal  were detected during the withdrawal phase, without a difference in proportions between the two groups. However, in the LCI group, eight of 49 lesions (16 %) located in the sigmoid and rectosigmoid  were only detected during the insertion phase, and no such lesions (0 %) were detected during the insertion phase in the WLI group (   = 0.045).

Here, we investigated the impact of PTC-209, a small-molecule Bmi-1 inhibitor, on human  cell viability alone and in combination with anticancer drugs, namely, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, camptothecin, and Frondoside-A and its impact on cellular migration and colony growth  and on tumor growth .  We demonstrate that PTC-209 causes a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in the cellular viability of lung  cells (LNM35 and A549), breast  cells (MDA-MB-231 and T47D), and  cells (HT-29, HCT8/S11, and HCT-116). Similarly, treatment with PTC-209 significantly decreased the growth of LNM35, A549, MDA-MB-231, and HT-29 clones and colonies  and LNM35 and A549 tumor growth in the  tumor xenograft model. PTC-209 at the non-toxic concentrations significantly reduced the migration of lung (LNM35 and A549) and breast (MDA-MB-231)  cells. Moreover, we show that PTC-209, at a concentration of 1 μM, enhances the anti- effects of Frondoside-A in lung, breast, and  cells, as well as the effect camptothecin in breast  cells and the effect of cisplatin in lung  cells . However, PTC-209 failed to enhance the anti- effects of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil in  cells. Treatment of lung, breast, and  cells with PTC-209 (1 and 2.5 μM) for 48 h showed no caspase-3 activation, but a decrease in the cell number below the seeding level suggests that PTC-209 reduces cellular viability probably through inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death  a caspase-3-independent mechanism. Molecular mechanism analysis revealed that PTC-209 significantly inhibited the STAT3 phosphorylation by decreasing the expression level of gp130 as early as 30 min post-treatment.  Our findings identify PTC-209 as a promising anticancer agent for the treatment of solid tumors either alone and/or in combination with the standard cytotoxic drugs cisplatin and camptothecin and the natural product Frondoside-A.Copyright © 2019 Sulaiman, Arafat, Iratni and Attoub.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686852>The inhibitory effect of oridonin on  was mediated by deactivation of TGF-β1/Smads-PAI-1 signaling pathway in vitro and vivo.</a></h1><p>Oridonin, the main active component of Rabdosia rubescens, has been demonstrated to have anti-tumor effect on all kinds of  cells through various mechanisms and it has shown antitumor activity in some tumors partially via the suppression of TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway.

Cell growth depends on the activation of receptors which bind growth factors and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors are among the most important ones. Usually, only small quantities of isolated receptors are available thus there is a need of suitable assay to study receptors glycosylation. Therefore, we developed a lectin-based reverse-phase protein microarray method for screening the glycosylation pattern of receptors in picomolar (pM) concentrations. The method was applied to glycoprofile IGF1 and IGF2 receptors and the solubilised membrane proteins isolated from tumour and non-tumour  tissue of patients with colorectal . We found that common to both receptors was partial overlapping of the major glycan structures with those present in the entire glycome of membrane proteins. In contrast, receptors possess higher level of α2,3 sialic acid residues and lower level of tri-/tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans and terminal mannose in high-mannose structures. Increased levels of fucosylation and branched mannose structures were observed in both receptors derived from tumour tissue compared to non-tumour tissue. The described method enabling glycan analysis of receptors has a big application potential in e.g. biomarker research, biology and diagnostics.Copyright © 2019.

We believe that setting a "Goal" that will guide the surgeons in returning from the deep layer could be the key to safe en bloc resection of neighboring organs. For descending , the cranial-first approach makes it possible to clearly visualize the pancreas and origin of the transverse mesocolon, leading to safe splenic flexure mobilization and complete mesocolic excision, which is the strongest advantage of this approach.A 75-year-old woman was diagnosed with T4 descending  invading the Gerota's fascia. We performed laparoscopic left colectomy using the cranial-first approach to set a "Goal" at the inferior border of the pancreas for safe resection of the Gerota's fascia. The total operative time was 233 min, and the estimated blood loss was 98 ml. She was discharged after surgery without postoperative complications.

Conversely, it was reported that AhR negatively regulates the β-catenin signal via ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in a ligand dependent manner. However, there have been conflicting data among previous studies regarding the relationship between these two proteins. In this report, we conducted confirmatory studies dissecting the relationship between AhR and β-catenin. We did not observe β-catenin degradation by AhR ligands in several  cell lines. Reporter assays revealed that the AhR ligand did not alter TcF/β-catenin dependent transcription. Yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays failed to reconstruct the interaction of β-catenin and AhR even when other factors, Arnt, CUL4B, and DDB1, were co-expressed additionally. Independently to induction of AhR expression, β-catenin enhanced AhR-dependent transcriptional activation via the xenobiotic response element (XRE). Coimmunoprecipitation detected the formation of a β-catenin and ligand-activated AhR complex, which was thought to reflect the β-catenin mediated enhancement of the AhR signaling. Overall, we could only confirm unidirectional interaction, which is positive regulation of the AhR signal by β-catenin. These results suggested that data from previous reports on the degradation of β-catenin via liganded AhR warrants further investigation to yield clarity in the field.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679229>Antioxidant, Anticancer, Antimicrobial, and Antibiofilm Properties of the Culinary-Medicinal Fairy Ring Mushroom, Marasmius oreades (Agaricomycetes).</a></h1><p>This study is based on the phenolic composition and the antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antibiofilm activities of the edible mushroom Marasmius oreades from Turkey. The phenolic composition of an M. oreades ethanol extract was measured by using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, aluminium chloride colorimetry, and ultraperformance liquid chromatography. The antioxidant activity was evaluated on the basis of DPPH radical scavenging activity. The effect of the M. oreades ethanol extract was also screened in order to determine glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities. The antimicrobial activity of the mushroom extract was evaluated by using well diffusion and was based on the minimum inhibitory concentration. In addition, the antibiofilm potential of M. oreades was analyzed against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Finally, the anticancer effects of the mushroom extract were tested on  (HT-29) and breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231)  cell lines by using the MTT assay. The results revealed that the total amount of phenolics in the ethanol extract of M. oreades was 10.990 ± 0.0007 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g, and the total amount of flavonoids was 1.139 ± 0.0052 mg quercetin equivalent/100 g. The ultraperformance liquid chromatography results indicated that the M. oreades ethanol extract contained various phenolic compounds: catechin, ferulic, gallic acid, and vanillic acid. The M. oreades ethanol extract scavenged about 80% of DPPH free radicals. It did not show any effect on the glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase enzyme activities, but its maximal concentration (10 mg/mL) increased superoxide dismutase activity (8%). The ethanol extract of M. oreades showed a moderate anticancer effect on the HT-29, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Although the ethanolic extract of the mushroom did not show sufficient antibacterial activity, it presented a strong antibiofilm effect against all studied pathogenic strains at the tested concentrations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651566>Supplementation with phytoestrogens and insoluble fibers reduces intestinal carcinogenesis and restores ER-β expression in Apc-driven colorectal carcinogenesis.</a></h1><p>Supplementation with phytoestrogens and insoluble fibers has been reported to reduce duodenal polyps in colectomized familial adenomatous polyposis patients, with a mechanism involving, at least in part, upregulation of estrogen receptor-β subtype, whose expression is lowered during intestinal tumorigenesis.

We first demonstrate that estrogen receptor-β expression in Pirc rat  is significantly down-regulated compared to age-matched wt rats. Then, Pirc rats aged 1 month were treated for 3 months with Adipol (Adi), a patented preparation containing phytoestrogens and insoluble fibers.  tumorigenesis was significantly reduced by Adi treatment ( tumors/rat were 5.3 ± 0.8 and 2.9 ± 0.3, Mucin Depleted Foci/rat 127 ± 6.6 and 97.1 ± 8.6 in Controls and Adi-treated rats, respectively, means ± SE, P < 0.01). The treatment also normalized  proliferation pattern along the crypt and significantly increased apoptosis in  tumors. Estrogen receptor-β expression was increased by Adi treatment, especially in the tumors. These positive effects suggest that Adipol may be exploited as a chemopreventive agent to reduce  risk in familial adenomatous polyposis patients and to postpone prophylactic colectomy. Moreover, given the similarities between familial adenomatous polyposis and sporadic colorectal , it might also be used as chemopreventive agent in colorectal  patients at risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659112>Proteomic Analysis of Primary  and Synchronous Solitary Liver Metastasis.</a></h1><p> is prone to distant metastases to other sites and the risk of recurrence is relatively high.

Identified proteins were validated by western blotting. The in silico analysis was performed using the STRING database and GeneMANIA.We identified 58 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 51 under-expressed and 7 over-expressed proteins among a total of 164 identified proteins. Major hubs of protein-protein networks were ACTC1, PRDX6, TPI1, and ALDH1A1. DEPs were located in the extracellular region and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity.

Here, we performed a prognostic analysis based on the tumor mutational profile and explored the characteristics of the high-risk tumors. We sequenced 338 colorectal carcinomas as the training dataset, constructed a novel 5-gene (SMAD4, MUC16, COL6A3, FLG, and LRP1B) prognostic signature, and validated it in an independent dataset from The  Genome Atlas (TCGA). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses confirmed that the 5-gene signature is an independent predictor of recurrence and prognosis in patients with stage III . The mutant signature translated to an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 2.45, 95% confidence interval = 1.15-5.22, P = 0.016 in our dataset; hazard ratio = 4.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.33-17.16, P = 0.008 in TCGA dataset). RNA and bacterial 16s rRNA sequencing of high-risk tumors indicated that mutations of the 5-gene signature may lead intestinal barrier integrity, translocation of gut bacteria, and deregulation of immune response and extracellular related genes. The high-risk tumors over-expressed IL23A and IL1RN genes and enriched with -related bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Parvimonas, Alloprevotella, and Gemella) compared with the low-risk tumors.

Using a combination of cell-based assays, in vivo tumor xenograft assays, and Mrtfb knockout mice, we demonstrate here that MRTFB is a human and mouse colorectal  (CRC) tumor suppressor that functions in part by inhibiting cell invasion and migration. To identify possible MRTFB transcriptional targets, we performed whole transcriptome RNA sequencing in MRTFB siRNA knockdown primary human  cells and identified 15 differentially expressed genes. Among the top candidate tumor-suppressor targets were melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), a known tumor suppressor, and spindle apparatus coiled-coil protein 1 (SPDL1), which has no confirmed role in . To determine whether these genes play a role in CRC, we knocked down the expression of MCAM and SPDL1 in human CRC cells and showed significantly increased invasion and migration of tumor cells. We also showed that Spdl1 expression is significantly down-regulated in Mrtfb knockout mouse intestine, while lower SPDL1 expression levels are significantly associated with reduced survival in CRC patients. Finally, we show that depletion of MCAM and SPDL1 in human CRC cells significantly increases tumor development in xenograft assays, further confirming their tumor-suppressive roles in CRC. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the tumor-suppressive role of MRTFB in CRC and identify several genes, including 2 tumor suppressors, that act downstream of MRTFB to regulate tumor growth and survival in CRC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664047>Uremic serum residue decreases SN-38 sensitivity through suppression of organic anion transporter polypeptide 2B1 in LS-180  cells.</a></h1><p>Pharmacokinetics of SN-38 in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is partially varied because of fluctuations in transporters expression and/or function by high protein bound-uremic toxins concentration. The fluctuations may induce variations in anticancer drugs sensitivity to  cells. We aimed to clarify the variations in sensitivity of SN-38 to  patients with ESKD and investigate this mechanism, by human  cells exposed to uremic serum residue. LS180 cells were exposed to normal or uremic serum residue (LS/NSR or LS/USR cells) for a month. IC values of SN-38 in LS/NSR or LS/USR cells were calculated from viability of each cells treated SN-38. mRNA expression and intracellular SN-38 accumulation was evaluated by RT-PCR and HPLC-fluorescence methods, respectively. The IC value in LS/USR cells was higher than that in LS/NSR cells. Organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 2B1 mRNA expression was lower in LS/USR cells than in LS/NSR cells, and SN-38 accumulation in LS/USR cells was lower than that in LS/NSR cells. Only co-treatment baicalin, which is OATP2B1 inhibitor, almost negated the difference in SN-38 accumulation between LS/NSR and LS/USR.

Herein, the apoptotic mechanism by co-treatment of MLT and pterostilbene (Ptero) contained mainly in grape and blueberries was elucidated in colorectal cancers (CRCs). MLT and Ptero co-treatment (MLT+Ptero) showed synergistic cytotoxicity compared with MLT or Ptero alone, reduced the number of colonies and Ki67 expression, and also increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL) positive cells and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CRCs. Consistently, MLT+Ptero cleaved caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activated sex-determining region Y-Box10 (SOX10), and also attenuated the expression of Bcl-xL, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 9 (NEDD9), and SOX9 in CRCs. Additionally, MLT+Ptero induced differentially expressed microRNAs (upregulation: miR-25-5p, miR-542-5p, miR-711, miR-4725-3p, and miR-4484; downregulation: miR-4504, miR-668-3p, miR-3121-5p, miR-195-3p, and miR-5194) in HT29 cells. Consistently, MLT +Ptero upregulated miR-25-5p at mRNA level and conversely NEDD9 overexpression or miR-25-5p inhibitor reversed the ability of MLT+Ptero to increase cytotoxicity, suppress colony formation, and cleave PARP in CRCs. Furthermore, immunofluorescence confirmed miR-25-5p inhibitor reversed the reduced fluorescence of NEDD9 and increased SOX10 by MLT+Ptero in HT29 cells.

MTT assay was used to check the proliferation rate of the  cells. Autophagy was detected by electron microscopy. DNA damage was checked by alkaline comet assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Cell migration was monitored by wound healing assay. Protein expression was checked by western blot analysis.The results showed that Dentatin inhibited the growth of HT-29  cells in a concentration-dependent manner and with IC50 of 25 µM. However, the IC50 of Dentatin against the normal CCD-18CO  cells was four times higher (ie.,100 µM). Dentatin inhibited the proliferation of the HT-29  cells by triggering S-phase arrest. This was also accompanied with increase in the expression of cyclin D1 and decrease in the expression of Cyclin A and B1. Moreover, Dentatin also induced autophagy in the HT-29 cells which was associated with upregulation of LC3 II and downregulation of Beclin-1 expression.

In vitro assay platforms such as primary hepatocyte and immortalized liver-derived cell lines have been developed to evaluate drug effects. However, several limitations have been suggested regarding discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo assays. In this study, we aimed to investigate drug metabolism and toxicity based on mouse small intestinal and liver organoids derived from resident stem cells. At first, expressions and activities of CYP subfamilies (CYPs) in intestinal and liver organoids were investigated. Organoids treated with three CYPs-inducers dexamethasone (Dex), β-naphthoflavone (BNF), and 1,4-bis-2-(3, 5-dichloropyridyloxy)-benzene (TCPOBOP) were evaluated for CYPs activities. The CYPs-induced intestinal and liver organoids were confirmed to digest more docetaxel, as  cell-line survived more in CYPs-induced organoid's medium than in non-induced organoid's medium. Then, the activity of docetaxel in a co-culture platform of mouse liver organoids and human pancreatic tumoroids was measured. We obtained significant statistical values on CYPs-induced metabolic activities: cell survival rates of pancreatic tumoroids co-cultured with docetaxel-treated undifferentiated, differentiated, and CYPs-induced differentiated organoids were 66.05 ± 2.14%, 89.20 ± 2.67%, and 101.90 ± 0.94%, respectively. To sum up, gene expression modification and drug metabolism evaluation were able to be done with organoids as done with tissues.

These include directional motility (including galvanotaxis), pH balance, extracellular proteolysis, and invasion. Contrary to the substantial in vitro data, however, evidence for VGSC involvement in the  process in vivo is limited. Here, we critically assess, for the first time, the available in vivo evidence, hierarchically from mRNA level to emerging clinical aspects, including protein-level studies, electrolyte content, animal tests, and clinical imaging. The evidence strongly suggests that different VGSC subtypes (mainly Nav1.5 and Nav1.7) are expressed de novo in human carcinoma tissues and generally parallel the situation in vitro. Consistent with this, tissue electrolyte (sodium) levels, quantified by clinical imaging, are significantly higher in  vs. matched non- tissues. These are early events in the acquisition of metastatic potential by the  cells. Taken together, the multi-faceted evidence suggests that the VGSC expression has clinical (diagnostic and therapeutic) potential as a prognostic marker, as well as an anti-metastatic target. The distinct advantages offered by the VGSC include especially (1) its embryonic nature, demonstrated most clearly for the predominant neonatal Nav1.5 expression in breast and , and (2) the specifically druggable persistent current that VGSCs develop under hypoxic conditions, as in growing tumours, which promotes invasiveness and metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666929>DPA shows comparable chemotherapy sensitizing effects as EPA upon cellular incorporation in tumor cells.</a></h1><p>Dietary supplementation with ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been reported to enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells towards chemotherapy. Most enhancing effects are described for ω-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA; less evidence is available with the intermediate DPA. We studied the chemotherapy enhancing effects of EPA, DPA and DHA in murine  C26 adenocarcinoma cells and showed that DPA displayed similar chemosensitizing effects as EPA. Moreover, EPA supplementation increased cellular DPA content. In a C26 tumor-bearing mouse model, we studied the incorporation of ω-3 PUFA in tumor and skeletal muscle after a diet with different ω-3 PUFA sources. Although little DPA was present in the fatty acid food sources, in those that contained considerable EPA concentrations, DPA levels were higher in tumor and muscle tissue. From these studies, we conclude that EPA and DPA show chemosensitizing effects and that intake of EPA or EPA-containing nutrition leads to increased cellular DPA content by elongation. These findings support the use of ω-3 PUFA containing nutritional supplementations in  patients during chemotherapy treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682852>Uptake of Colorectal  Screening by Physicians is Associated With Greater Uptake by Their Patients.</a></h1><p>Physicians' own screening practices might affect screening in their patients. We conducted a population-based study to evaluate whether family physicians who underwent colorectal  testing were more likely to have patients who underwent colorectal  testing.We collected demographic and healthcare information on residents of Ontario, Canada from administrative databases; the sample was restricted to individuals at average risk of colorectal  who were 52-74 years old as of April 21, 2016. We obtained a list of all registered physicians in the province; physicians (n=11,434) were matched with non-physicians (n=45,736) on age, sex, and residential location. Uptake of colorectal tests was defined by a record of a fecal occult blood test in the past 2 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years, or colonoscopy in the past 10 years. Patients were assigned to family physicians based on billing claim frequency, and then the association between colorectal testing in family physicians and their patients was examined using a modified Poisson regression model.Uptake of colorectal tests by physicians and non-physicians (median age 60; 71% men) was 67.9% (95% CI, 67.0%-68.7%) and 66.6% (95% CI, 66.2%-67.1%), respectively. Physicians were less likely than non-physicians to undergo fecal occult blood testing and were more likely to undergo colonoscopy; prevalence ratios were 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.47) and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.22-1.26), respectively. Uptake of colorectal tests by family physicians was associated with greater uptake by their patients (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12).Approximately one third of physicians and non-physicians are overdue for colorectal  screening. Patients are more likely to be tested if their family physician has been tested. There is an opportunity for physicians to increase their participation in colorectal  screening, which could in turn motivate their patients to undergo screening.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal  (CRC) by regulating the gut microbiota and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate,  length, inflammatory cytokines, gut microbiota, and  epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated  damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and . Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health.

The distribution of Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Summary Stage for 12 malignancies was examined. We estimated net survival by stage up to 5 years after diagnosis, controlling for background mortality with life tables of all-cause mortality in the general population by single year of age, sex, and calendar period. Survival estimates were age-standardised using the International  Survival Standard (ICSS) weights.Only 14.2% of patients were diagnosed at a localised stage and 38.9% at the regional stage. The proportion of patients with known stage was 88.9% during 2000-2004 but fell to 59.4% during 2010-2013. During 2005-2009, 1- and 5-year survival for , rectal, breast, cervical, and prostate  was about 90% or higher for patients diagnosed at the localised stage. During 2004-2009, the proportion of patients diagnosed at a localised stage was lower in Kuwait than in the US for , breast, and lung . Age-standardised 5-year net survival for all stages combined was lower in Kuwait than the US for , lung, and breast , but stage-specific survival was similar.Since stage-specific survival is similar in Kuwait and the US, late stage at diagnosis is likely to be a major contributing factor to the overall lower survival in Kuwait than in the US. Increasing public awareness of  risk factors and symptoms and investment in early detection will be vital to reduce the proportion of patients diagnosed at a late stage and to improve survival.Copyright © 2019 E.

Although some per-butyrylated glucosides of podophyllotoxin and 4β-triazolyl-podophyllotoxin glycosides show good anticancer activity, the per-acetylated/free of podophyllotoxin glucosides and their per-acetylated are not well studied.A few glucoside derivatives of  were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activities against five human  cell lines, HL-60 (leukemia), SMMC-7721 (hepatoma), A-549 (lung ), MCF-7 (breast ), and SW480 (), as well as the normal human pulmonary epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). In addition, we investigated the structure-activity relationship and the physicochemical property-anticancer activity relationship of these compounds.Compound  shows the highest cytotoxic potency against all five  cell lines tested, with IC values ranging from 3.27±0.21 to 11.37±0.52 μM. We have also found that  displays higher selectivity than the etoposide except in the case of HL-60 cell line. The active compounds possess similar physicochemical properties: MSA > 900, %PSA < 20, ClogP > 2, MW > 700 Da, and RB > 10.We synthesized several glucoside derivatives of  and tested their cytotoxicity. Among them, compound  showed the highest cytotoxicity. Further studies including selectivity of active compounds have shown that the selectivity indexes of  are much greater than the etoposide except in the case of HL-60 cell line. The active compounds possessed similar physicochemical properties. This study indicates that active glucoside analogs of podophyllotoxin have potential as lead compounds for developing novel anticancer agents.© 2019 Zi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646964>A qualitative transcriptional signature for predicting microsatellite instability status of right-sided .</a></h1><p>Microsatellite instability (MSI) accounts for about 15% of colorectal  and is associated with prognosis. Today, MSI is usually detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of specific microsatellite markers. However, the instability is identified by comparing the length of microsatellite repeats in tumor and normal samples. In this work, we developed a qualitative transcriptional signature to individually predict MSI status for right-sided  (RCC) based on tumor samples.Using RCC samples, based on the relative expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs, we extracted a signature consisting of 10 gene pairs (10-GPS) to predict MSI status for RCC through a feature selection process. A sample is predicted as MSI when the gene expression orderings of at least 7 gene pairs vote for MSI; otherwise the microsatellite stability (MSS). The classification performance reached the largest F-score in the training dataset. This signature was verified in four independent datasets of RCCs with the F-scores of 1, 0.9630, 0.9412 and 0.8798, respectively. Additionally, the hierarchical clustering analyses and molecular features also supported the correctness of the reclassifications of the MSI status by 10-GPS.The qualitative transcriptional signature can be used to classify MSI status of RCC samples at the individualized level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658780> Infection and Colorectal Surgery: Is There Any Risk?</a></h1><p> infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection, with important consequences both from a medical and financial point of view, but its correlation with anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgeries is scarcely reported in the literature.  We conducted a retrospective study looking for patients who underwent open or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancers between January 2012 and December 2017, excluding emergency surgeries for complicated colorectal tumors. We also examined patient history for risk factors for CDI such as age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical findings at admission or during hospital stay as well as tumor characteristics.  A total of 360 patients were included in the study, out of which 320 underwent surgeries that included anastomoses. There were 19 cases of anastomotic leaks, out of which 13 patients were diagnosed with CDI, with a statistic significance for association between CDI and anastomotic leakage ( < 0.0001). Most patients who developed both CDI and anastomotic leaks had left-sided resections or a type of rectal resection, while none of the patients with right-sided resections had this association, but with no statistical significance possibly due to the limited number of cases.  CDI is a relevant risk factor and should be taken into consideration when trying to prevent anastomotic leaks in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery for  or rectal . Thorough assessment of risk factors at admission should be mandatory in order to adequately prepare the patient and plan an optimal course of treatment. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and a multidisciplinary approach, with a team which should always include the surgeon, is mandatory when it comes to CDI prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696832>The association between dietary fibre deficiency and high-income lifestyle-associated diseases: Burkitt's hypothesis revisited.</a></h1><p>In 1969, Denis Burkitt published an article titled "Related disease-related cause?", which became the foundation for Burkitt's hypothesis. Working in Uganda, he noted that middle-aged people (40-60 years old) had a much lower incidence of diseases that were common in similarly aged people living in England, including , diverticulitis, appendicitis, hernias, varicose veins, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and asthma, all of which are associated with lifestyles commonly led in high-income countries (HICs; also known as western diseases). Following Cleave's common cause hypothesis-which suggests that if a group of diseases occur together in the same population or individual, they are likely to have a common cause-Burkitt attributed these diseases to the small quantities of dietary fibre consumed in HICs due mainly to the over-processing of natural foods. Nowadays, dietary fibre intake in HICs is around 15 g/day (well below the amount of fibre Burkitt advocated of >50 g/day-which is associated with diets from rural, southern and eastern sub-Sahalean Africa). Since Burkitt's death in 1993, his hypothesis has been verified and extended by large-scale epidemiological studies, which have reported that fibre deficiency increases the risk of , liver, and breast  and increases all  mortality and death from cardiovascular, infectious, and respiratory diseases, diabetes, and all non-cardiovascular, non- causes. Furthermore, mechanistic studies have now provided molecular explanations for these associations, typified by the role of short-chain fatty acids, products of fibre fermentation in the , in suppressing  mucosal inflammation and carcinogenesis. Evidence suggests that short-chain fatty acids can affect the epigenome through metabolic regulatory receptors in distant organs, and that this can reduce obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, allergy, and . Diseases associated with high-income lifestyles are the most serious threat to health in developed countries, and public and governmental awareness needs to be improved to urge an increase in intake of fibre-rich foods. This Viewpoint will summarise the evidence that suggests that increasing dietary fibre intake to 50 g/day is likely to increase lifespan, improve the quality of life during the added years, and substantially reduce health-care costs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor immunity, allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via the mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions on CTLs and  tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, cosilencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independent of the adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of single silencing of PD-1 or PD-L1 alone, cosilencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in .

Therefore, these cells can be an appropriate target to improve  treatment.A novel biodegradable brush copolymeric micelle was synthesized by the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The obtained micelle was used for co-delivery of the anticancer drug docetaxel (DTX) and Chrysin (CHS) as an adjuvant on the CSCs originated from Human  adenocarcinoma cell line.  stem cells were enriched by MACS technique and characterized by flow cytometry analysis against CD133 marker.Data demonstrated that the micelles harbouring DTX@CHS had potential to reduce  stem cell viability compared to free DTX@CHS, single-drug formulations and the control group (p < 0.05). The combination effect of DTX and CHS formulated in micelle was synergistic in CSCs (CI < 1). The reactive oxygen species content was shown to increase after cell treatment with DTX@CHS loaded on micelles (p < 0.05). DTX@CHS-micelles inhibited  stem cell migration rate in vitro (p < 0.05), indicating an impaired metastasis activity.In conclusion, the synthesized DOX@CHS-micelles can be applied in the introduction of anticancer agents to resistant  population by further investigations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673316>Dihydropyrimidine-2-thiones as Eg5 inhibitors and L-type calcium channel blockers: potential antitumour dual agents.</a></h1><p>The use of multitarget drugs has evolved as an alternative to "magic bullets" for the treatment of complex diseases such as , in order to affect simultaneously several targets relevant to the disease. We have designed and synthesized a series of dual agents as both Eg5 inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, bearing a 4-aryldihydropyrimidine core. Compound  (aryl: 3-nitrophenyl) was selected as potential dual agent due to displaying both activities: it is a vasorelaxant agent (>90% relaxation at 10 M in KCl-precontracted aorta rings), it decreases the response to calcium and it is cytotoxic to MCF-7 (breast), HCT-116 () and A-549 (lung)  cell lines. The dual mechanism of action was confirmed by blocking (-)-BAY K8644-induced vascular contraction and production of monopolar spindles, typical of Eg5 inhibition.

A gene selection algorithm for  cancers is proposed by using the dynamic modeling properties of chameleon algorithm and its capability to discover any arbitrary shape clusters. This chameleon algorithm based gene selection algorithm comprises three steps. The first step is to select those genes with higher Fisher function values as candidate genes. The second step is to detect gene groups by using chameleon algorithm based on Euclidean distance. The third step is to select the most important gene from each gene cluster to comprise the gene subset by using the information index to classification of each gene. After that the chameleon algorithm is used to detect groups of  patients and normal people only with genes in gene subset. The final clustering accuracy of chameleon algorithm with the selected genes is up to 85.48%. The clustering analysis to  data and the comparisons to the other related studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in detecting the differential genes of  cancers.© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673925>Hereditary or Not?

This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose ethanol (0.5%, 1%, and 2% [v/v] ethanol in drinking water) for 28 wk on  tumor incidence in rats injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Body weight, fluid and food consumption, and the total numbers of  adenomas (mild-, moderate-, and severe-grade dysplasia) per rat were unaffected by ethanol consumption. However, the numbers of severe-grade dysplasia were significantly reduced by 1% ethanol compared with the control (0% ethanol; -93%) but not by 0.5% and 2% ethanol. Although the numbers of total adenocarcinomas were unaffected, those of total of adenomas and adenocarcinomas together were significantly reduced by 0.5% and 1% ethanol (-39% and -41%, respectively). Intriguingly, real-time PCR assay indicated the abundance of cecal Clostridium leptum (a putative immunosuppressor) was the least in rats received 1% ethanol. Furthermore, 1% ethanol markedly increased  mRNA of IL-6, a putative suppressor of regulatory T-cells and cytoprotector. This study provides the first evidence for the potential of 1% ethanol, but not 2% ethanol, to prevent  tumorigenesis in rats, supporting the J-curve hypothesis of the effect of low-dose alcohol on health. Further, the modulation of C. leptum and expression of IL-6, potentially linking to carcinogenesis, by 1% ethanol may provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms of the anti- tumor effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661689>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced T4 : A Nationwide Propensity-Score Matched Cohort Analysis.</a></h1><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) for locally advanced  (LACC) could potentially lead to tumor shrinkage, eradication of micrometastases, and prevention of tumor cell shedding during surgery. This retrospective study investigates the surgical and oncological outcomes of preoperative CT for LACC.Using the Netherlands  Registry, data of patients with stage II or III , diagnosed between 2008 and 2016 was collected. A propensity score matching (PSM; 1:2) was performed and compared patients with clinical tumor (cT) 4  who were treated with neoadjuvant CT to patients with cT4  treated with adjuvant CT (Fig. 1).A total of 192 patients treated with neoadjuvant CT were compared to 1,954 patients that received adjuvant CT. After PSM, 149 patients in the neoadjuvant group were compared to 298 patients in the control group. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics after PSM. After neoadjuvant CT, a significant response was observed in 13 (9%) patients with 5 (4%) patients showing a complete response. Complete resection margins (R0) were achieved in 77% in the neoadjuvant group versus 86% in the adjuvant treated group (p = 0.037). Significantly less tumor positive lymph nodes were found in the neoadjuvant group (median 0 vs. 2, p < 0.001). Major complication rates and 5-year overall survival did not differ between both groups (67-65%, p = 0.87).Neoadjuvant CT seems safe and feasible with similar long-term survival compared to patients who are treated with adjuvant CT.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

CCSCs as a result of accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations and also complex interconnection with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can evolve and convert to full malignant cells. Mounting evidence suggests that in  therapy both CCSCs and non-CCSCs in TME have to be regarded to break through the limitation of current therapies. In this regard, stem cell capabilities of some non-CCSCs may arise inside the TME condition. Therefore, a deep knowledge of regulatory mechanisms, heterogeneity, specific markers, and signaling pathways of CCSCs and their interconnection with TME components is needed to improve the treatment of colorectal  and the patient's life quality. In this review, we address current different targeted therapeutic options that target cell surface markers and signaling pathways of CCSCs and other components of TME. Current challenges and future perspectives of  personalized therapy are also provided here. Taken together, based on the deep understanding of biology of CCSCs and using three-dimensional culture technologies, it can be possible to reach successful  eradication and improvise combination targeted therapies against CCSCs and TME.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650468>Baicalein, an enteric microbial metabolite, suppresses gut inflammation and  progression in Apc mice.</a></h1><p>Chronic inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal  (CRC) development. Baicalin (BI), a major constituent in an anti-inflammatory herb Scutellaria baicalensis, can be biotransformed into baicalein (BE) by the intestinal microbiota. We evaluated the anti-inflammation and anti-CRC effects of the metabolite BE.The in vitro biotransformation by human intestinal microbiota from BI into BE has been determined with HPLC. Using a gut-specific Apc mouse model, the effects of oral BE on the life span, organ index, and tumor multiplicity were evaluated. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA. To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal microbiota. Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125.2 to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index. Compared with the model group, following BE treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and  (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In the gut tissues, BE treatment significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In vitro data supported our in vivo results that the anti-CRC effects of BE were via the inhibition of gut inflammation and induction of  cell death.Our results suggest that the parent compound BI can be quickly converted into its microbial metabolite BE, which has stronger bioactive effects than BI.

Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic acid into the large  through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their  tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671666>Automated Workflow for Somatic and Germline Next Generation Sequencing Analysis in Routine Clinical  Diagnostics.</a></h1><p>Thanks to personalized medicine trends and collaborations between industry, clinical research groups and regulatory agencies, next generation sequencing (NGS) is turning into a common practice faster than one could have originally expected. When considering clinical applications of NGS in oncology, a rapid workflow for DNA extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, as well as producing high quality library preparation, can be real challenges. Here we consider these targets and how applying effective automation technology to NGS workflows may help improve yield, timing and quality-control. We firstly evaluated DNA recovery from archived FFPE blocks from three different manual extraction methods and two automated extraction workstations. The workflow was then implemented to somatic (lung/ panel) and germline () library preparation for NGS analysis exploiting two automated workstations. All commercial kits gave good results in terms of DNA yield and quality. On the other hand, the automated workstation workflow has been proven to be a valid automatic extraction system to obtain high quality DNA suitable for NGS analysis (lung/ Ampli-seq panel). Moreover, it can be efficiently integrated with an open liquid handling platform to provide high-quality libraries from germline DNA with more reproducibility and high coverage for targeted sequences in less time (). The introduction of automation in routine workflow leads to an improvement of NGS standardization and increased scale up of sample preparations, reducing labor and timing, with optimization of reagents and management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674736>Aspirin for  Risk Prevention.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694013>Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 in Colorectal  Development and Progression.</a></h1><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is the leading gastrointestinal malignancy. The development from premalignant intraepithelial lesions leading to invasive  is paradigmatic for the stepwise carcinogenesis of epithelial cancers, but the knowledge of the underlying mechanism of carcinogenesis and progression of CRC is still incomplete. The understanding of epigenetic mechanisms of carcinogenesis has led to new therapeutic approaches during the last years. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is one central epigenetic silencer of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) that is already in clinical use as a novel drug target and is associated with poorer prognosis in several  entities.The protein expression of EZH2 and other members of the PRC2 as well as resulting posttranslational modifications were investigated by immunohistochemistry in 187 patients with CRC and in 94 patients with premalignant colorectal lesions and correlated with their clinical outcome. Furthermore, the corresponding mRNA expression levels were analyzed in 217 patients with rectal  that were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial.We found a weak expression of EZH2 in normal  mucosa that increased in low grade, peaked in high grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and decreased again in invasive CRC. The posttranslational modification caused by EZH2 as a measure of EZH2 activity showed the same behavior. Strong protein and mRNA expression of EZH2 were significantly correlated with favorable prognosis in both investigated cohorts.The expression and activity of EZH2 are associated with colorectal carcinogenesis and most expressed in intraepithelial high-grade lesions. Strong expression of EZH2 is associated with a significantly favorable prognosis in patients suffering from CRC.© 2019 S.

These photosynthesizing microorganisms are amenable for large-scale production, thus overcoming the bottleneck of biomass supply for chemical and activity characterization of bioactive compounds. This characteristic has recently also prompted the screening of microalgae for potential pharmaceutical applications. Here, we show that monoacylglycerides (MAGs) purified from the marine diatom  have selective cytotoxic activity against the haematological  cell line U-937 and  cell line HCT-116 compared to normal MePR-2B cells. LC-MS analysis of the raw extract revealed that in their natural form, MAGs occur as 2-monoacyl derivatives and include mainly C16 and C20 analogues, but they are converted into the corresponding 1-isomers during purification processes. Pure compounds along with the synthetic 1-monoarachidonoylglycerol tested on HCT-116 and U-937 tumor cell lines induced cell death via apoptosis. The mechanism of action was investigated, and we show that it involves the induction of apoptosis through caspase 3/7 activation.

Additionally, these compounds are generally known to have low tendency to interact with DNA which is not common with most of the conventional cytotoxic agents. Thus this class of compounds is of particular interest for the discovery and development of patient friendly anticancer agents.The initial objective of this study was to synthesize and evaluate 2-substituted 4-arylidene-5(4H)-oxazolones for their potential anticancer properties.A simple, mild and non-hazardous synthetic methodology has been developed for the preparation of 2-substituted 4-arylidene-5(4H)-oxazolones. The methodology involved lemon juice mediated condensation of N-acyl glycine derivatives including hippuric acid with arylaldehydes in PEG-400 under ultrasound irradiation.

The relationship between sentinel polyps (rectal polyps with proximal ) and proximal  has received extensive attention in recent years. However, there is still no clear conclusion regarding the relationship.To investigate the clinical characteristics of sentinel polyps and their correlation with proximal .A retrospective analysis of 2587 patients with rectal polyps from January 2006 to December 2017 was performed. According to whether or not proximal  was diagnosed, the patients were divided into either a sentinel polyp group (192 patients) or a pure rectal polyp group (2395 patients). The endoscopic features, clinicopathological features, therapeutic effects, and short-term prognosis were analyzed and compared between the two groups.The mean age of patients in the sentinel polyp group was generally higher than that of the pure rectal polyp group, and the positivity rates of anemia, stool occult blood, and tumor markers of the sentinel polyp group were also significantly higher than those in the rectal polyp group (  = 90.56,  < 0.01;   = 70.30,  < 0.01;   = 92.80,  < 0.01). The majority of the patients in the sentinel polyp group had multiple polyps, large polyps, adenomatous polyps, or sessile polyps (  = 195.96,  < 0.01;   = 460.46,  < 0.01;   = 94.69,  < 0.01;   = 48.01,  < 0.01). Most of the proximal  cancers were Duke's A and B stages in the sentinel polyp group. In the pure rectal polyp group, 2203 patients underwent endoscopic treatment, and all of the patients were cured and discharged. In the sentinel polyp group, 65 patients underwent radical operation, and 61 patients received endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic mucosal resection. Additionally, 21 patients were lost to follow-up after 6-12 mo, and the loss rate was 10.94%. A total of 63.16% of patients experienced remission without tumor recurrence or metastasis, 33.33% of patients experienced tumors regression or improved symptoms, and the other 3.51% of the patients died.If there are multiple, sessile, and adenomatous rectal polyps with a maximum diameter > 1 cm, the possibility of the carcinogenesis of the polyps or of the proximal  should be monitored closely.

This study was undertaken to explore the role and therapeutic potential of PPM1D in .HT-29  cell line was used in this study. Expression analysis of PPMD1 was performed by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. DAPI, acridin orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and propidium iodide (PI)staining assays were used for apoptosis detection. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by western blot analysis.The results showed that the expression of PPMD1 was significantly upregulated in  by 3.2 to 4.8 fold. Silencing of PPMD1 caused significant decline in the proliferation rate of the HT-29  cells that was due to induction of apoptosis as evidenced by DAPI, AO/EB and PI staining. Annexin V/PI showed a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic of HT-29 cells upon silencing of PPMD1. The induction of apoptosis was also accompanied by increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 expression. PPMD1 silencing also resulted in arrest of the HT-29 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle which was also associated with upsurge of p21 and p53 and depletion of cyclin B1 expression levels. PPMD1 silencing also caused decrease in the viability of the HT-29 cells which was concomitant with suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression.These findings suggest that PPMD1 has oncogenic properties in  and exhibit therapeutic implications in  treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685519>STAT3 activation through IL-6/IL-11 in -associated fibroblasts promotes colorectal tumour development and correlates with poor prognosis.</a></h1><p>-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence the tumour microenvironment and tumour growth. However, the role of CAFs in colorectal  (CRC) development is incompletely understood.We quantified phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) expression in CAFs of human  tissue using a tissue microarray (TMA) of 375 patients, immunofluorescence staining and digital pathology. To investigate the functional role of CAFs in CRC, we took advantage of two murine models of colorectal neoplasia and advanced imaging technologies. In loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, using genetically modified mice with collagen type VI (COLVI)-specific signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) targeting, we evaluated STAT3 signalling in fibroblasts during colorectal tumour development. We performed a comparative gene expression profiling by whole genome RNA-sequencing of fibroblast subpopulations (COLVI+ vs COLVI-) on STAT3 activation (IL-6 vs IL-11).The analysis of pSTAT3 expression in CAFs of human TMAs revealed a negative correlation of increased stromal pSTAT3 expression with the survival of  patients. In the loss-of-function and gain-of-function approach, we found a critical role of STAT3 activation in fibroblasts in driving colorectal tumourigenesis in vivo. With different imaging technologies, we detected an expansion of activated fibroblasts in colorectal neoplasias. Comparative gene expression profiling of fibroblast subpopulations on STAT3 activation revealed the regulation of transcriptional patterns associated with angiogenesis. Finally, the blockade of proangiogenic signalling significantly reduced colorectal tumour growth in mice with constitutive STAT3 activation in COLVI+ fibroblasts.Altogether our work demonstrates a critical role of STAT3 activation in CAFs in CRC development.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

To explore its anti-tumorigenic potential, we examined the effects of DMF on human  carcinoma cell lines and the underlying mechanisms of action. Human  cell line HT-29 and human colorectal carcinoma cell line T84 were treated with or without DMF. Effects of DMF on proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were analyzed mainly by Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)- and Lactatdehydrogenase (LDH)assays, caspase activation, flowcytometry, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting. In addition, combinational treatments with radiation and chemotherapy were performed. DMF inhibits cell proliferation in both cell lines. It was shown that DMF induces a cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, which is accompanied by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin D1 and Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)4. Furthermore, upregulation of autophagy associated proteins suggests that autophagy is involved. In addition, the activation of apoptotic markers provides evidence that apoptosis is involved. Our results show that DMF supports the action of oxaliplatin in a synergetic manner and failed synergy with radiation. We demonstrated that DMF has distinct antitumorigenic, cell dependent effects on  cells by arresting cell cycle in G0/G1 phase as well as activating both the autophagic and apoptotic pathways and synergizes with chemotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670584>Performance of CT Colonography in Diagnosis of Synchronous  Lesions in Patients With Occlusive Colorectal .</a></h1><p> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of CT colonography (CTC) in the diagnosis of synchronous  lesions in a cohort of patients with an occlusive colorectal  (CRC) causing incomplete colonoscopy.  Among 109 patients with CRC causing incomplete colonoscopy who underwent CTC with IV contrast enhancement after cathartic purgation, fecal tagging, and  distention, 70 (mean age, 70 years) for whom reference standards (surgical reports, first surveillance colonoscopy) were available were evaluated. Per-patient and per-lesion sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of CTC in the diagnosis of synchronous  lesions measuring 6 mm or larger were assessed.  Twenty-seven of the 70 patients (39%) had at least one 6-mm or larger synchronous lesion, and four patients (6%) had a total of five synchronous CRCs. Per-patient sensitivity in diagnosing synchronous CRC was 1.00 (4/4). There were 59 lesions: 20 with a diameter of 10 mm or greater; 30, 6-9 mm; and nine, 5 mm or less. The overall per-patient CTC sensitivity in detecting synchronous lesions 6 mm or larger was 0.93 (25/27); specificity, 0.98 (42/43); PPV, 0.96; and NPV, 0.95. Per-patient sensitivity for the diagnosis of synchronous advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma and colorectal cancers) was 0.94 (15/16).

This is also the first documented case of the site of perforation not being directly involved with the site of intussusception. The perforation site was in fact distal to the intussusception. At the time of surgery, it was noted that the patient had significantly faecal loading up to her rectum.

The activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling promotes inflammation in colitis of mice, but the role of TLR4 in intestinal tumorigenesis is not yet clear. About 80%-90% of colorectal tumours contain inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) tumour suppressor, and intestinal adenoma carcinogenesis in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is also closely related to the germline mutations in Apc. The Apc (multiple intestinal neoplasia) model mouse is a well-utilized model of FAP, an inherited form of intestinal . In this study, Apc intestinal adenoma mice were generated on TLR4-sufficient and TLR4-deficient backgrounds to investigate the carcinogenic effect of TLR4 in mouse gut by comparing mice survival, peripheral blood cells, bone marrow haematopoietic precursor cells and numbers of polyps in the guts of Apc WT and Apc TLR4 mice. The results revealed that TLR4 had a critical role in promoting spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. Significant differential genes were screened out by the high-throughput RNA-Seq method. After combining these results with KEGG enrichment data, it was determined that TLR4 might promote intestinal tumorigenesis by activating cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in  signalling pathways. After a series of validation experiments for the concerned genes, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF (CSF2), IL11, CCL3, S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly decreased in gut tumours of Apc TLR4 mice compared with Apc WT mice. In the functional study of core down-regulation factors, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF, IL11, CCL3 and S100A8/9 increased the viability of  cell lines and decreased the apoptosis rate of  cells with irradiation and chemical treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

Herein, the anticancer potential of Zingiberene was examined against the CC cells.The proliferation rate of the CC cells was assessed by cell counting assay. Autophagy was detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The transfected cells were then treated with varied concentrations of Zingiberene (0, 10, 20 and 40 µM) for 24 h and monitored by fluorescent microscopy. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting.Zingiberene could considerably inhibit the proliferation of CC cells. The anticancer activity of Zingiberene against the HT-29 CC cells was found to be due to induction of autophagy. The Zingiberene triggered autophagy was also linked with increase in the expression of LC3-II and decrease in p62 expression. However, no apparent effects were observed on the LC3-I expression. Moreover, it was found that zingiberine also caused activation of autophagy-related caspases in the HT-29 cells. Further, it was found that Zingiberene could inhibit the mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in the CC cells. Zingiberene also suppressed the weight and volume of the xenografted tumors concentration-dependently.These results indicate that Zingiberene may inhibit the growth of CC in vitro and in vivo and may be used for the development of systemic therapy against CC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662792>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 expression is closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease.</a></h1><p>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 is reported to participate in intestinal mucosa barrier damage in Crohn's disease (CD).

In the latter, the TIS score was independent from either PD-L1 staining on tumor cells (spearman coefficient 0.2) and TMB (spearman coefficient - 0.2).These results indicate that validated gene expression assay measuring the level of tumor microenvironment inflammation such as TIS, are accurate and independent predictive biomarkers and can be easily implemented in the clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675985>Analysis of the clinical significance of DNA methylation in gastric  based on a genome-wide high-resolution array.</a></h1><p>Aberrant DNA methylation is involved in gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as a useful biomarker in the diagnosis and detection of gastric  (GC) recurrence.A total of 157 patients who received surgery for GC were enrolled in the present study. A genome-wide methylation analysis was performed in tumor and adjacent normal tissues for the discovery set of 16 GC patients; the top three hypermethylated CpG sites of DNA promoters were selected for validation in tissue and plasma samples for the validation set of 141 GC patients. The frequencies of the top three hypermethylated genes in available patient tissues (n = 141) and plasma samples (n = 106) were 41.8% and 38.7%, respectively, for ADAM19; 40.4% and 42.5%, respectively, for FLI1; and 56.7% and 50.9%, respectively, for MSC. In both tissue and plasma samples, FLI1 hypermethylation was associated with more advanced GC and liver and distant lymphatic metastasis, and ADAM19 hypermethylation was associated with more stage IV GC. In plasma samples, MSC hypermethylation was more common in non-superficial type GC than samples without MSC hypermethylation. In both tissue and plasma samples, patients with methylation of all the three genes had significantly more liver metastases, distant lymphatic metastases, and paraaortic lymph node metastases than patients with two or fewer hypermethylated genes. The survival analysis showed that only for stage III GC, patients with hypermethylation of two or three genes had a worse 5-year disease-free survival rate than those with hypermethylation of one or none of the three genes. Subgroup analysis showed that FLI1 hypermethylation in both tissue and plasma samples was associated with liver metastasis in MSI-/EBV- GC, and MSC hypermethylation in tissue samples was correlated with liver metastasis in MSI+ or EBV+ GC. Patients with FLI1 hypermethylation in plasma samples had a significantly worse 5-year disease-free survival rate than those without FLI1 hypermethylation in MSI-/EBV- GC. FLI1 hypermethylation was an independent prognostic factor affecting the overall survival and disease-free survival in both tissue and plasma samples.DNA methylation is a useful biomarker for predicting tumor recurrence patterns and GC patient survival.</p></html>
