<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29589340>Influence of Nutritional Status on the Absorption of Polyphyllin I, an Anticancer Candidate from Paris polyphylla in Rats.</a></h1><p>Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is one of the most suffered complications in cancer patients. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a saponin isolated from rhizome of Paris polyphylla, is a potential candidate in cancer therapy. In this study, the influence of nutritional status on the absorption of PPI in rats was explored after oral administration.PCM rats, namely mal-nourished (MN) rats, were induced from well-nourished (WN) rats by caloric restriction protocol. Intestinal absorption of PPI in WN and MN rats was evaluated by pharmacokinetic and intestinal perfusion methods. The potential mechanisms between two groups were investigated on the basis of intestinal permeability, intestinal efflux and PPI's depletions in vivo. The intestinal permeability was analyzed by determining the concentration of paracellular marker transport in serum and the expression of  proteins in intestine. The intestinal efflux was evaluated through comparing the protein level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in intestine, and the depletions of PPI and/or generation of its metabolites in liver and intestines were analyzed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.Compared to WN rats, the oral systemic exposure of PPI was significantly increased in MN rats, evidenced by significant enhancement of maximum plasma concentration (C) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by more than 2.51- and 3.71-folds as well as terminal elimination half-life (t) prolonged from to 7.3 to 14.1 h. Further studies revealed that the potential mechanism might be associated with combined contribution of improved intestinal absorption and depressed deglycosylation of PPI in MN rats. Furthermore, enhanced intestinal absorption of PPI was benefited from increased intestinal permeability and decreased intestinal efflux in MN rats. Meanwhile, the former manifested as increased transport of paracellular marker and decreased  proteins levels, while the later evidenced by reduced P-gp expression.The oral exposure of PPI was enhanced in MN rats, which suggested that nutritional status alters the absorption of PPI, and thus the dosage of PPI should be modified during the treatment of cancer patient with PCM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28576466>Are additive effects of dietary surfactants on intestinal  integrity an overlooked human health risk? - A mixture study on Caco-2 monolayers.</a></h1><p>Surfactants may cause dysfunction of intestinal  (TJs), which is a common feature of intestinal autoimmune diseases. Effects of dietary surfactants on TJ integrity, measured as trans-epithelial resistance (TEER), were studied in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Cytotoxicity was assessed as apical LDH leakage. Monolayers were apically exposed for 60 min to the dietary surfactants solanine and chaconine (SC, potato glycoalkaloids, 0-0.25 mM), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, industrial contaminant, 0-0.8 mM), and sucrose monolaurate (SML, food emulsifier E 473, 0-2.0 mM) separately and as a mixture. Dose-response modelling of TEER EC showed that SC were 2.7- and 12-fold more potent than PFOS and SML, respectively. The mixture was composed of 1 molar unit SC, 2.7 units PFOS and 12 units SML ("SC TEER equivalent" proportions 1:1:1). Mixture exposure (0-0.05 mM SC equivalents) dose-response modelling suggested additive action on TJ integrity. Increasing SC and SML concentrations caused increased LDH leakage, but PFOS decreased LDH leakage at intermediate exposure concentrations. In the mixture PFOS appeared to protect from extensive SC- and SML-induced LDH leakage. Complex mixtures of surfactants in food may act additively on intestinal TJ integrity, which should be considered in risk assessment of emulsifier authorisation for use in food production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
