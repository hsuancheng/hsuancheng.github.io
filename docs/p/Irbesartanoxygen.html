The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) losartan is known to decrease serum uric acid (UA) level. A recent in vitro study demonstrated a strong interaction between  and UA transporters that exceeded that of losartan. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the hypouricemic effect of  in a clinical setting. A total of 40 high-risk hypertensive outpatients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and/or diabetes complications who were taking ARBs other than  and losartan were enrolled in this study. After a 4-week control period, the patients' prescribed ARBs were exchanged for an equivalent dose of . We assessed blood pressure, heart rate, serum UA level, parameters of lipid and glucose , cardiac and renal function and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in blood samples taken immediately before the initiation of  treatment and again after 12 weeks of treatment. All 40 recruited patients were followed (31 men and 9 women, mean age: 68 years) without any dropouts. During the 12 weeks of  treatment, no significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate, parameters of lipid or glucose  or other biomarkers of cardiac function, renal function, or inflammation were observed. However, UA level (5.9±1.6 to 5.5±1.6 mg ml(-1), P=0.028) and the oxidative stress marker derivative reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) (354±83 to 310±65 U.CARR, P<0.001) were significantly lower at 12 weeks of treatment compared with before treatment. These results suggest that  has beneficial effects on hyperuricemia and oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155324>Angiotensin receptor blocker  reduces stress-induced intestinal inflammation via AT1a signaling and ACE2-dependent mechanism in mice.</a></h1><p>Stress is associated with pathophysiology of both irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II)/Ang II type I receptor axis (AT1). Inhibition of the classical RAS pathway is also involved in upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which activates the Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway to counteract inflammatory signaling and acts as a partner of the amino acid transporter, BAT-1, to absorb tryptophan for regulation of microbiota-gut-brain axis. In this study, we determined the effects of ARB  on stress-induced intestinal inflammation. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress. They were orally treated during the stress with either vehicle, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day . Restraint stress resulted in colon inflammation with higher histological damage scores, increased expression of Nox4, TLR-4 and IL1-β, accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), and activation of the ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis. Stress also downregulated intestinal amino acid transporter, ACE2/BAT-1, and activity of intestinal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), resulting in decrease in α-defensins, changes in intestinal microbial contents, and perturbation of tryptophan metabolism with activation of the kynurenine pathway. Administration of  inhibited activation of stress-induced AT1 pathway to reduce intestinal ROS accumulation and inflammation, restored expression of ACE2/BAT-1, activity of mTOR and p70S6K, dysbiosis and tryptophan metabolism. Our results suggest that AT1 is a potentially suitable therapeutic target in stress-induced intestinal inflammation, and that  could be beneficially suitable for the treatment of stressed patients with IBS.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The extent of HTF migration up to 30 hours, and cell number and morphology at 72 hours was evaluated. To assess the effect on reactive  species (ROS) level, HTF were treated with either  (10 μg/mL) or angiotensin II (2 μg/mL) for 24 hours after scratching, and then stained with dihydroethidium (DHE) before evaluation by confocal microscopy. inhibited HTF migration by 50% to 70% compared to controls ( < 0.05). Levels of ROS were almost completely attenuated by  (DHE fluorescence intensity of 5.68E-09) ( < 0.05).  reduced cell numbers by 50% and induced morphologic changes with loss of pseudopods ( < 0.05). Conversely, angiotensin II increased cell numbers up to 4-fold while retaining cell viability. inhibited HTF migration and ROS production. It also reduced cell numbers and altered HTF morphology. Angiotensin II increased cell number without altering morphology. This initial study warrants future investigations for further potential antifibrotic effects of this drug.This in vitro study focused on investigations of 's effects on HTF migration, ROS production, as well as HTF cell numbers and morphology. It suggests a potential therapeutic strategy worth further exploration with a view towards postoperative wound healing modulation in glaucoma filtration surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702126> attenuates advanced glycation end products-mediated damage in diabetes-associated osteoporosis through the AGEs/RAGE pathway.</a></h1><p>Diabetes-associated osteoporosis is mainly caused by the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) has anabolic bone effects on the physicochemical properties of the bone in diabetes. We hypothesized that ARB could inhibit AGEs-induced deleterious effects.In this study, we chose seven-week-old Leprdb/Lepr+ (db/+) and Leprdb/Leprdb (db/db) mice. After 12 week intervention by , the microarchitecture and mechanical strength of the bone of seven-week-old db/db mice were investigated systematically. Meanwhile, the molecular mechanisms of the osteoblasts were analyzed, after AGEs or  were added to the culture. Also, intracellular formation of reactive  species (ROS) was measured with DCF fluorescence.Results showed that 12-week  treatment could dramatically improve trabecular bone microarchitecture through increasing BV/TV (p = 0.003, +46.7%), Tb.N (p = 0.020, +52.0%), and decreasing that of Tb.Sp (p = 0.005, -21.2%) and SMI (p = 0.007, -26.4%), comparing with the db/db group.  could also substantially raise biomechanical parameters including max load (p = 0.013, +20.7%), fracture load (p = 0.014, +70.5%), energy absorption (p = 0.019, +99.4%). Besides, it could inhibit AGEs-induced damage of cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts, as well as suppressing the activation of apoptosis caused by AGEs. Moreover, co-incubation with  could prevent the AGEs-induced increase of intracellular oxidative stress and RAGE expression in osteoblasts.In conclusion, this study suggested that  might play a protective role in diabetes-related bone damages by blocking the deleterious effects of AGEs/RAGE-mediated oxidative stress. This may provide a revolutionary benefits to therapy with  on diabetic osteoporosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the underlying mechanisms of its action, we established an  model of NAFLD by treating human and mouse hepatocytes with free fatty acids (FFAs) and angiotensin (Ang) II.  significantly reversed AngII/FFA-induced lipid deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring ATP production and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and decreasing the levels of reactive  species (ROS) and inflammatory markers. In addition,  also increased the autophagy flux, in terms of increased numbers of autolysosomes and autophagosomes, and the upregulation and mitochondrial localization of the autophagic proteins Atg5 and LC3BII/I. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibition of the autophagic flux exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in the steatotic hepatocytes. Furthermore, AngII upregulated PKC which inhibited AMPK phosphorylation via direct interaction with the AngII receptor AT1-R.  inhibited PKC and activated AMPK and its downstream effector ULK1, thereby inducing autophagy, decreasing lipid deposition, and restoring mitochondrial function. Taken together,  triggers autophagy via the PKC/AMPK/ULK1 axis to ameliorate the pathological changes in the steatotic hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25752363>Angiotensin Ⅱ Activates MCP-1 and Induces Cardiac Hypertrophy and Dysfunction via Toll-like Receptor 4.</a></h1><p>Angiotensin Ⅱ(Ang Ⅱ) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus contributing to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent heart failure, and stimulates the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In addition, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in the upregulation of MCP-1. In order to clarify whether TLR4 is involved in the onset of cardiac dysfunction caused by Ang Ⅱ stimulation, we investigated the effects of TLR4 on oxidative stress, the MCP-1 expression and cardiac dysfunction in mice with Ang Ⅱ-induced hypertension.TLR4-deficient (Tlr4(lps-d)) and wild-type (WT) mice were randomized into groups treated with Ang Ⅱ, norepinephrine (NE) or a subdepressor dose of the Ang Ⅱreceptor blocker  (IRB) and Ang Ⅱ for two weeks.Ang Ⅱ and NE similarly increased systolic blood pressure in all drug-treated groups compared to that observed in the control group among both WT and Tlr4(lps-d) mice (p＜0.05). In the WT mice, Ang Ⅱ induced cardiac hypertrophy as well as vascular remodeling and perivascular fibrosis of the intramyocardial arteries and monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the heart (p＜0.05). Furthermore, Ang Ⅱ treatment decreased the left ventricular diastolic function and resulted in a greater left ventricular end-systolic dimension (p＜0.05) in addition to producing a five-fold increase in the NADPH oxidase activity, ROS content and MCP-1 expression (p＜0.05). In contrast, the Tlr4(lps-d) mice showed little effects of Ang Ⅱ on these indices. In the WT mice, IRB treatment reversed these changes compared to that seen in the mice treated with Ang Ⅱ alone. NE produced little effect on any of the indices in either the WT or Tlr4(lps-d) mice.TLR4 may be involved in the processes underlying the increased oxidative stress, selectively activated MCP-1 expression and cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction seen in cases of Ang Ⅱ- induced hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27363272>[ reduces inflammatory response of central nervous system in a rat model of fluid percussion brain injury].</a></h1><p>Objective To investigate the neuroprotective effect of the angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) antagonist  on rat models with lateral fluid percussion brain injury (FPBI). Methods FPBI models were prepared using a modified fluid percussion injury method. Before and after modeling,  was given to the rats. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry. Neurologic status was evaluated before and 1, 3, 5, 7 days after FPBI surgery. Brains were removed for immunohistochemical evaluation of active microglias and macrophages. Results Compared to sham group, the rCBF and neurologic score of FPBI rats decreased significantly, while microglia and macrophage activation were confirmed. Treatment with  before FPBI surgery increased rCBF and improved neurological functions. In the peri-infarct cortex,  treatment attenuated the invasion of activated microglias and macrophages on day 7 after FPBI surgery. Conclusion  can play a neuroprotective role through inhibiting microglia and macrophage activation in FPBI rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27198152>Combination Therapy of Nifedipine and Sulphonylureas Exhibits a Mutual Antagonistic Effect on the Endothelial Cell Dysfunction Induced by Hyperglycemia Linked to Vascular Disease.</a></h1><p>By inducing severe endothelial impairment, hypertension and diabetes are two leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Hypertensive patients with concomitant diabetes must take both antihypertensive and hypoglycaemic medications, for which there is a lack of experimental and clinical guidelines. This study aimed to examine the interaction between these two types of medication on the endothelial cell function.The effect of antihypertensive (nifedipine and ) and anti-diabetic (metformin and glibenclamide/glimepiride) drugs on human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) function was examined using a modified Boyden chamber assay. The intracellular NO and O2- levels of HUVECs were detected through flow cytometry.Our findings showed that nifedipine/sulphonylurea monotherapy significantly attenuated high glucose-induced (33 mM) HUVECs migration incapacity, while combination therapy of nifedipine and glibenclamide/glimepiride showed no protective effect. Both nifedipine/metformin monotherapy and combined therapy significantly mitigated the migration incapacity induced by high glucose in HUVECs. Combined with either metformin or sulphonylureas,  therapy was able to attenuate the high glucose-induced migration incapacity of HUVECs. Nifedipine monotherapy decreased the O2- levels and increased the NO levels in in vitro-cultured HUVECs treated with high glucose. However, the combination therapy of nifedipine and glibenclamide increased the O2- levels and decreased the NO levels compared to the nifedipine monotherapeutic group.The nifedipine and glibenclamide/glimepiride combination exerted a mutual antagonistic effect on the protection from high glucose-induced impairment in endothelial cells, which might be partially attributed to the increased O2- level and decreased NO level. These results imply that calcium channel blockers + sulphonylurea combination therapy warrants further attention in patients suffering from both hypertension and diabetes.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Explants were treated either with  (10 µM), vehicle or angiotensin II (2 μM) for four days. Retinal ganglion cell density was estimated by βIII tubulin immunohistochemistry. Live imaging of superoxide formation with dihydroethidium (DHE) was performed. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting, and mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. (10 µM) almost doubled ganglion cell survival after four days. Angiotensin II (2 µM) reduced cell survival by 40%. Sholl analysis suggested that  improved ganglion cell dendritic arborisation compared to control and angiotensin II reduced it. Angiotensin-treated explants showed an intense DHE fluorescence not seen in -treated explants. Analysis of protein and mRNA expression determined that the angiotensin II receptor At1R was implicated in modulation of the NADPH-dependent pathway of superoxide generation.Angiotensin II blockers protect retinal ganglion cells in this model and may be worth further investigation as a neuroprotective treatment in models of eye disease.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25854990>TLR4 is a critical regulator of angiotensin II-induced vascular remodeling: the roles of extracellular SOD and NADPH oxidase.</a></h1><p>Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and angiotensin II (AngII) induce vascular remodeling through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). AngII has also been shown to increase antioxidant enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD). However, the roles of TLR4 in Ang II-induced ROS production, vascular remodeling and hypertension remain unknown. Mice lacking TLR4 function showed significant inhibition of vascular remodeling in response to chronic AngII infusion, with no impact on blood pressure. The increases in ROS level and NADPH oxidase activity in response to AngII infusion were markedly blunted in TLR4-deficient mice. Similar effects were observed in wild-type (WT) mice treated with a sub-depressor dose of the AT1 receptor antagonist , which had no effects on TLR4-deficient mice. Intriguingly, the AngII infusion-induced increases in ecSOD activity and expression were rather enhanced in TLR4-deficient mice compared with WT mice, whereas the expression of the proinflammatory chemokine MCP-1 was decreased. Importantly, AngII-induced vascular remodeling was positively correlated with NADPH oxidase activity, ROS levels and MCP-1 expression levels. Notably, chronic norepinephrine infusion, which elevates blood pressure without increasing ROS production, did not induce significant vascular remodeling in WT mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that ROS elevation is required for accelerating vascular remodeling but not for hypertensive effects in this model. We demonstrated that TLR4 plays a pivotal role in regulating AngII-induced vascular ROS levels by inhibiting the expression and activity of the antioxidant enzyme ecSOD, as well as by activating NADPH oxidase, which enhances inflammation to facilitate the progression of vascular remodeling.</p></html>
