<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670628>Developing evidence-based behavioural strategies to overcome physiological resistance to weight loss in the general population.</a></h2><p>Physiological and behavioural systems are tolerant of excess  intake and responsive to  deficits. Weight loss (WL) changes body structure, physiological function and  balance (EB) behaviours, which resist further WL and promote subsequent weight regain. Measuring and understanding the response of EB systems to  deficits is important for developing evidence-based behaviour change interventions for longer-term weight management. Currently, behaviour change approaches for longer-term WL show modest effect sizes. Self-regulation of EB behaviours (e.g. goal setting, action plans, self-monitoring, relapse prevention plans) and aspects of motivation are important for WL maintenance. Stress management, emotion regulation and food hedonics may also be important for relapse prevention, but the evidence is less concrete. Although much is known about the effects of WL on physiological and psychological function, little is known about the way these dynamic changes affect human EB behaviours. Key areas of future importance include (i) improved methods for detailed tracking of  expenditure, balance and by subtraction intake, using digital technologies, (ii) how WL impacts body structure, function and subsequent EB behaviours, (iii) how behaviour change approaches can overcome physiological resistance to WL and (iv) who is likely to maintain WL or relapse. Modelling physiological and psychological moderators and mediators of EB-related behaviours is central to understanding and improving longer-term weight and health outcomes in the general population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671708>Broadband Near-Infrared Absorber Based on All Metallic Metasurface.</a></h2><p>Perfect broadband absorbers have increasingly been considered as important components for controllable thermal emission,  harvesting, modulators, etc. However, perfect absorbers which can operate over a wide optical regime is still a big challenge to achieve. Here, we propose and numerically investigate a perfect broadband near-infrared absorber based on periodic array of four isosceles trapezoid prism (FITP) unit cell made of titanium (Ti) over a continuous silver film. The structure operates with low quality (Q) factor of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) because of the intrinsic high loss, which is the foundation of the broadband absorption. The high absorption of metal nanostructures mainly comes from the power loss caused by the continuous electron transition excited by the incident light inside the metal, and the resistance loss depends on the enhanced localized electric field caused by the FITP structure. Under normal incidence, the simulated absorption is over 90% in the spectrum ranging from 895 nm to 2269 nm. The absorber is polarization-independent at normal incidence, and has more than 80% high absorption persisting up to the incident angle of ~45° at TM polarization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671907>Research on Data Fusion Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks with Combined Improved LEACH and Compressed Sensing.</a></h2><p>There are a lot of redundant data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). If these redundant data are processed and transmitted, the node  consumption will be too fast and will affect the overall lifetime of the network. Data fusion technology compresses the sampled data to eliminate redundancy, which can effectively reduce the amount of data sent by the node and prolong the lifetime of the network. Due to the dynamic nature of WSNs, traditional data fusion techniques still have many problems. Compressed sensing (CS) theory has introduced new ideas to solve these problems for WSNs. Therefore, in this study we analyze the data fusion scheme and propose an algorithm that combines improved clustered (ICL) algorithm low  adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and CS (ICL-LEACH-CS). First, we consider the factors of residual , distance, and compression ratio and use the improved clustered LEACH algorithm (ICL-LEACH) to elect the cluster head (CH) nodes. Second, the CH uses a Gaussian random observation matrix to perform linear compressed projection (LCP) on the cluster common (CM) node signal and compresses the N-dimensional signal into M-dimensional information. Then, the CH node compresses the data by using a CS algorithm to obtain a measured value and sends the measured value to the sink node. Finally, the sink node reconstructs the signal using a convex optimization method and uses a least squares algorithm to fuse the signal. The signal reconstruction optimization problem is modeled as an equivalent -norm problem. The simulation results show that, compared with other data fusion algorithms, the ICL-LEACH-CS algorithm effectively reduces the node's transmission while balancing the load between the nodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673043>Directed assembly of magnetic and semiconducting nanoparticles with tunable and synergistic functionality.</a></h2><p>The ability to fabricate new materials using nanomaterials as building blocks, and with meta functionalities, is one of the most intriguing possibilities in the area of materials design and synthesis. Semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are co-dispersed in a liquid crystalline (LC) matrix and directed to form self-similar assemblies by leveraging the host's thermotropic phase transition. These co-assemblies, comprising 6 nm CdSe/ZnS QDs and 5-20 nm FeO MNPs, bridge nano- to micron length scales, and can be modulated in situ by applied magnetic fields <250 mT, resulting in an enhancement of QD photoluminescence (PL). This effect is reversible in co-assemblies with 5 and 10 nm MNPs but demonstrates hysteresis in those with 20 nm MNPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and  dispersive spectroscopy reveal that at the nanoscale, while the QDs are densely packed into the center of the co-assemblies, the MNPs are relatively uniformly dispersed through the cluster volume. Using Lorentz TEM, it is observed that MNPs suspended in LC rotate to align with the applied field, which is attributed to be the cause of the observed PL increase at the micro-scale. This study highlights the critical role of correlating multiscale spectroscopy and microscopy characterization in order to clarify how interactions at the nanoscale manifest in microscale functionality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670204>Enhanced methane production from anaerobic digestion of hybrid Pennisetum by selectively removing lignin with sodium chlorite.</a></h2><p>To enhance the biodegradability and methane production of hybrid Pennisetum, a pretreatment method with high selectivity for lignin removal, namely sodium chlorite/acetic acid (SCA) pretreatment, was examined in this work. Results showed that SCA pretreatment can selectively remove lignin with minimal impact on cellulose and hemicellulose. After up to 200 min of SCA treatment, 79.4% of lignin was removed and over 90% of the holocellulose was retained. The physicochemical changes after pretreatment were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, showing that the majority of lignin was removed from secondary cell walls and cell middle lamella while the chlorite-resistant lignin remained in the cell corner. Lignin removal significantly enhanced the biodegradability from 59.6% to 86.4% and increased methane production by 38.3%.  balance showed that SCA pretreatment was efficient to increase the  output of hybrid Pennisetum.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, a new pseudo-partition coefficient between mushrooms and soils was introduced to assess the impacts of different physiochemical properties on the pesticide uptake process. The results indicate that, in general, the pseudo-partition coefficient increases as the relative humidity increases for both the air and soil according to Fick's law of gas diffusion and the spatial competition of molecules, respectively. Meanwhile, the effect of temperature on the pesticide bioaccumulation process is more complex. For most pesticides (e.g., atrazine), the pseudo-partition coefficient that was computed from the transpiration component had a maximum value at a specific temperature due to the temperature dependency of the transpiration and biodegradation processes. For some pesticides (e.g., ethoprophos), the pseudo-partition coefficient of the air-deposition component had a maximum value at a certain temperature that was caused by the ratio of the soil-air internal transfer  and degradation activation  of the pesticide. It was also concluded that for relatively low-volatility pesticides, transpiration dominated the bioaccumulation process; this was mainly determined from the pesticide water solubility. For nonbiodegradable pesticides (e.g., lindane), the computed coefficient values were relatively low due to their insolubility in water, which inhibits bioaccumulation in mushrooms and is one of the main reasons for their long-term persistence in soils.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Gross contamination and devascularisation are aspects supporting talectomy as potential treatment choice. Reconstruction in these cases can be challenging. The Masquelet technique presents one viable option.A carpenter sustained a high  chrush injury with traumatic open lateral talar dislocation qualifying as Gustillo Anderson type IIIc injury, a mangeled extremity index of 7 and gross contamination. The severity of soft tissue damage and contamination prompted the decision for talectomy before plastic coverage with a gracilis flap. Additionally a Masquelet procedure with cement spacer was initiated. After consolidation of the soft tissues a hindfoot arthrodesis with approximate preservation of leg length could be performed. In the course of treatment, the patient suffered no infection and could resume full weight bearing after nine months. The patient resumed his previous occupation with adapted workload and is satisfied with the treatment result.In the present case the principle options were talus preservation or talectomy with reconstruction. Talus preservation in the presence of gross contamination can be associated with the risk of infection, in addition there is a risk to develop secondary arthritis. For this individual patient the a fast and definite solution was important at this point in life. Surgeons therefore opted for talectomy. To optimally reconstruct leg length and optimize for arthrodesis the Masquelet technique was employed.The Masquelet technique is a viable option also in the emergency situation to preserve extremity length and optimize tissue viability.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the high structural heterogeneity of metal-N-C materials that often consist of metal-N x sites and graphene-encapsulated metal nanoparticle simultaneously, as a result of their high-temperature synthesis method, makes it extremely challenging to identify the predominant active structure of metal-N-C catalysts for ORR. Here, we report a low-temperature NH 4 Cl-treatment strategy to efficiently etch out graphene-encapsulated nanoparticles from metal-N-C catalysts without destruction of co-existed atomically dispersed metal-N x sites. We observe a much enhanced catalytic activity upon selective removal of metallic nanoparticles from metal-N-C materials. Accordingly, we definitely elucidate the spectator role of graphene-encapsulated nanoparticles and the pivotal role of metal-N x sites in the metal-N-C materials for ORR in the acidic medium.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Biogenesis, maintenance, and functions of mitochondria require correct assembly of resident proteins and lipids, which require their transport into and within mitochondria. Mitochondrial normal functions also require an exchange of small metabolites between the cytosol and mitochondria, which is primarily mediated by a metabolite channel of the outer membrane (OM) called porin or voltage-dependent anion channel. Here, we describe recently revealed novel roles of porin in the mitochondrial protein and lipid transport. First, porin regulates the formation of the mitochondrial protein import gate in the OM, the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, and its dynamic exchange between the major form of a trimer and the minor form of a dimer. The TOM complex dimer lacks a core subunit Tom22 and mediates the import of a subset of mitochondrial proteins while the TOM complex trimer facilitates the import of most other mitochondrial proteins. Second, porin interacts with both a translocating inner membrane (IM) protein like a carrier protein accumulated at the small TIM chaperones in the intermembrane space and the TIM22 complex, a downstream translocator in the IM for the carrier protein import. Porin thereby facilitates the efficient transfer of carrier proteins to the IM during their import. Third, porin facilitates the transfer of lipids between the OM and IM and promotes a back-up pathway for the cardiolipin synthesis in mitochondria. Thus, porin has roles more than the metabolite transport in the protein and lipid transport into and within mitochondria, which is likely conserved from yeast to human.© 2019 The Author(s).

However, it is still challenging to prepare advanced polymer dielectric composites with a high dielectric constant ('), low dielectric loss (tan ) and simultaneously high breakdown strength ( ). In this work, conductive polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles were  synthesized in a reaction system containing the common barium titanate (BaTiO, BT) or hydroxylated BaTiO (BTOH) particles, and then the PPy@BT and PPy@BTOH composite particles were incorporated into poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to prepare the composites. The morphologies and microstructures of the PPy@BT and PPy@BTOH composite particles and the corresponding PVDF composites were comparatively investigated. The results showed that the PPy@BTOH composite particles had a 'mulberry'-like morphology with a rough surface and the self-assembled structure could be maintained in the PVDF composites, which was apparently different from the PVDF/PPy@BT composites, in which most of the PPy nanoparticles dissociatively dispersed in the PVDF matrix. Electrical conductivity measurements showed that at high particle content (≥20 wt%), the PPy@BTOH composite particles endowed the composites with lower electrical conductivity compared with the PPy@BT composite particles. Dielectric property measurements showed that the 'mulberry'-like PPy@BTOH composite particles endowed the PVDF composites with extremely high ', ultralow tan  and high   compared with the PVDF/PPy@BT composites with dissociatively dispersed PPy nanoparticles and BaTiO particles. The polarization and loss mechanisms of the composites were then proposed based on the morphologies and the microstructures of the composites. This work provides an alternative way to fabricate functional dielectric particles through trace functional groups inducing  polymerization of conductive polymers, and these particles can be used to fabricate advanced dielectric composites.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670603>Naringenin Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Rate: A Case Study.</a></h2><p>Our studies in primary human adipocytes show that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, increases oxygen consumption rate and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), glucose transporter type 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases metabolic rate by PPAR and PPAR activation.

The drugs used to treat these conditions are largely inadequate or dangerous, and a well-researched approach based on nutraceuticals would be highly useful. Pterostilbene (Pt), i.e., 3,5-dimethylresveratrol, has been reported to be effective in animal models of obesity, acting on different metabolic pathways. We investigate here its ability to induce browning of white adipose tissue. Pt (5 µM) was first tested on 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, and then it was administered (352 µmol/kg/day) to mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) for 30 weeks, starting at weaning. In the cultured adipocytes, the treatment elicited a significant increase of the levels of Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) protein-a key component of thermogenic, -dissipating beige/brown adipocytes. In vivo administration antagonized weight increase, more so in males than in females. Analysis of inguinal White Adipose Tissue (WAT) revealed a trend towards browning, with significantly increased transcription of several marker genes (, , , , , and ) and an increase in UCP1 protein levels, which, however, did not achieve significance.

However, the maintenance of duplicated genes and their relevance to adaptive evolution has long been debated. Insect trehalase (Treh) plays key roles in  metabolism, growth, and stress recovery. Here, we show that the duplication of Treh in Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) is linked with their adaptation to various environmental stresses. Generally, two Treh genes are present in insects: Treh1 and Treh2. We report three distinct forms of Treh in lepidopteran insects, where Treh1 was duplicated into two gene clusters (Treh1a and Treh1b). These gene clusters differ in gene expression patterns, enzymatic properties, and subcellular localizations, suggesting that the enzymes probably underwent sub and/or neo-functionalization in the lepidopteran insects. Interestingly, selective pressure analysis provided significant evidence of positive selection on duplicate Treh1b gene in lepidopteran insect lineages. Most positively selected sites were located in the alpha-helical region, and several sites were close to the trehalose binding and catalytic sites. Subcellular adaptation of duplicate Treh1b driven by positive selection appears to have occurred as a result of selected changes in specific sequences, allowing for rapid reprogramming of duplicated Treh during evolution. Our results suggest that gene duplication of Treh and subsequent functional diversification could increase the survival rate of lepidopteran insects through various regulations of intracellular trehalose levels, facilitating their adaptation to diverse habitats. This study provides evidence regarding the mechanism by which gene family expansion can contribute to species adaptation through gene duplication and subsequent functional diversification.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672362>Arsenic enrichment in groundwater and associated health risk in Bari doab region of Indus basin, Punjab, India.</a></h2><p>Contaminated groundwater is considered as one of the most important pathways of human exposure to the geogenic contaminants. Present study has been conducted in a part of Indus basin to investigate the presence and spatial distribution of arsenic (As) and other trace metals in groundwater. The As concentration varies from bdl-255.6 μg/L and 24.6% of the 73 collected groundwater samples have As above world health organization (WHO) guideline of 10 μg/L. High concentration of As is found along the newer alluvium of Ravi River. As is found with high bicarbonate (HCO) and Iron (Fe) and low nitrate (NO) indicating reductive dissolution of Fe bearing minerals. However, silicate weathering along with high sulphate (SO) and positive oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) indicates mixed redox conditions. Weathering of minerals along with other major hydrogeochemical process are responsible for composition of groundwater. With 31.5% of the samples, sodium bicarbonate (Na-HCO) is the major water facies followed by magnesium bicarbonate (Mg-HCO) in 30% of samples. As, Fe and other trace metals including copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn) were used to calculate the health risk for children and adults in the region. Out of 73 samples, 58% has high Fe, 32.8% has high Zn, and 4.1% has high Cd which are above the prescribed limits of WHO guidelines. Health risk of the population has been assessed using chronic dose index (CDI), hazardous quotients (HQ) and hazardous index (HI) for children and adults. The mean CDI values follows the order as Fe > Zn > Cu > As > Cr > Cd, while the HQ values indicates high As hazards for both children and adults. 43.8% of the groundwater samples have high HI for adults, however, 49.3% has high HI for children indicating higher risk for children compared to adults. A large-scale testing should be prioritized to test the wells for As and other trace metals in the study region to reduce health risks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the strain WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and the root dry weight in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 μM KHPO) when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12% NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and  sources. It produces catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl, formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC deaminase. Meanwhile,  WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble phosphates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670950>Second-order exchange-dispersion  based on multireference description of monomers.</a></h2><p>We present a method for calculation of the second-order exchange-dispersion  in the framework of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) for weakly interacting monomers described with multiconfigurational wave functions.

Three primary conclusions are highlighted from this study. First, the redox potential increases as the number of electron-withdrawing nitrogen dopants increases. Second, the redox potentials of pyrenetetrone derivatives continuously decrease with the number of bound Li atoms during the discharging process owing to the decrease in the reductive ability until the compounds become cathodically deactivated exhibiting negative redox potentials. Notably, pyrenetetrone with four nitrogen dopants loses its cathodic activity after the binding of five Li atoms, indicating remarkably high performance (496 mAh/g and 913 mWh/g). Last, the redox potential is strongly correlated not only with electronic properties but also with solvation . This highlights that pyrenetetrone derivatives would follow two-stage transition behaviors during the discharging process, implying a crucial contribution of solvation  to their cathodic deactivation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In this work, a "hierarchically porous carbon (HPC)-supporting" approach was developed to synthesize highly ORR active Fe-phenanthroline (Fe-phen) derived Fe-N  -C catalysts. Compared to commercial carbon black supports, utilizing HPCs as carbon supports can not only prevent the formation of inactive iron nanoparticles during pyrolysis but also optimize the porous morphology of the catalysts, which eventually increases the amount of reactant-accessible and atomically dispersed Fe-N  active sites.

Violation of Gauss's law by the chemiosmotic theory and validation of the two-ion theory.</a></h2><p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the universal biological  fuel, or nature's gasoline. The vast quantities of ATP required for sustenance of living processes in cells are synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis. The chemiosmotic theory of  coupling was proposed by Mitchell more than 50 years ago but has a contentious history. Part of the accumulated body of experimental evidence supports Mitchell's theory, and part of the evidence conflicts with the theory. Although Mitchell's theory was strongly criticized by several prominent scientists, the controversy was never resolved. Certain theoretical arguments and electrostatic calculations were originally made to justify the central tenet of the chemiosmotic theory of electrogenic proton transfer and violation of electrical neutrality in bulk aqueous phases by creation of a delocalized field. However, these calculations have not been scientifically scrutinized previously. Here it is proved from first principles that the original physical arguments and calculations made in support of steady state electrogenic ion transfer and chemiosmosis violate Gauss's law. Nath's two-ion theory of  coupling in which the field is local, and ion translocation is dynamically electrogenic but overall electroneutral is shown to satisfactorily resolve the difficulties. Characterization of length scales in mitochondrial systems is shown to impose strong constraints on possible mechanisms of  transduction. Some biological implications for  coupling, transduction and ATP synthesis arising as a result of the above analysis are discussed. Examples of several other biological processes where the new theory is useful such as apoptosis, muscle contraction, the joint multisite regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and the Krebs cycle, and hindered protein aggregation arising from ATP's hydrotropic properties are outlined.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With noise interferometry, two-point cross-correlation functions of noise serve as the probing signals and replace the Green's function measured in active acoustic remote sensing. The amount of environmental information that can be obtained with passive remote sensing and the robustness of the estimates of the seafloor parameters increase when contributions of individual normal modes are resolved in the noise cross-correlation function. Using the data obtained in the 2012 noise-interferometry experiment in the Straits of Florida, dispersion curves of the first four normal modes are obtained in this paper by application of the time-warping transform to noise cross correlations. The passively measured dispersion curves are inverted for unknown geoacoustic properties of the seabed. Resulting thickness of the sediment layer and sound speed are consistent with the geoacoustic models obtained earlier by other means.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672993>Plasticity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis respiratory chain and its impact on tuberculosis drug development.</a></h2><p>The viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on  generated by its respiratory chain. Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type-2 NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces lesion-associated inflammation, but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty acids. The Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2. These results demonstrate the intrinsic plasticity of Mtb's respiratory chain, and highlight the challenges associated with targeting the pathogen's respiratory enzymes for tuberculosis drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671295>Elimination of micropollutants in four test-scale constructed wetlands treating combined sewer overflow: Influence of filtration layer height and feeding regime.</a></h2><p>Municipal wastewater can contain large amounts of organic micropollutants. Some of these substances are harmful to the environment, even at low concentrations, e.g. when being discharged untreated into surface water bodies in case of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during or after heavy rainfall events. Constructed wetlands can be very effective in treating CSOs. To date, there have only been few investigations about the retention of micropollutants using retention soil filters (RSFs), which basically are vertical flow constructed wetlands with an additional retention area. Thus, focus of this study was set on the interaction between dry periods, loading events, filter operation time, and the resulting removal of micropollutants originating from CSOs. The removal of 1-H-benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, metoprolol, sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol A was examined in four test-scale RSFs. Removal efficiencies of approximately 70% were found for metoprolol. 1-H-benzotriazole, diclofenac and bisphenol A were removed moderately between 30 and 40%. For carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, negative retention rates were found. No significant correlations were found between removal efficiencies and the length of the antecedent dry period and/or filter operation time. However, the study showed that removal efficiencies depend strongly on respective inflow concentrations. Thickness of the filter layer seems to have an influence as well; does not lead to uniform results, though.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The liquid-liquid transition and the dynamical crossover from the fragile (super-Arrhenius) to strong (Arrhenius) glass forming behavior have been studied, by taking into account the system polymorphism in both the liquid and amorphous solid phases. The interest is focused in the low  region of the DOS ( E < 10 meV) and the data are discussed in terms of the  landscape (local minima of the potential ) approach. In this latest research, we consider a unit scale  (EC) linked to the water local order governed by the hydrogen bonding (HB). All the measured spectra, scaled according to such , evidence a universal power law behavior with different exponents ( γ ) in the strong and fragile glass forming regions, respectively. In the first case, the DOS data obey the Debye squared-frequency law, whereas, in the second one, we obtain a value predicted in terms of the mode-coupling theory (MCT) ( γ ≃ 1.6 ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670969>Gap Opening in Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene by Crystal fields.</a></h2><p>Crystal fields occur due to a potential difference between chemically different atomic species. In Van-der-Waals heterostructures such fields are naturally present perpendicular to the planes. It has been realized recently that twisted graphene multilayers provide powerful playgrounds to engineer electronic properties by the number of layers, the twist angle, applied electric biases, electronic interactions and elastic relaxations, but crystal fields have not received the attention they deserve. Here we show that the bandstructure of large-angle twisted double bilayer graphene is strongly modified by crystal fields. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that twisted double bilayer graphene, encapsulated between hBN layers, exhibits an intrinsic bandgap. By the application of an external field, the gaps in the individual bilayers can be closed, allowing to determine the crystal fields. We find that crystal fields point from the inner to the outer layers with strengths in the bottom/top bilayer of 0.13 V/nm and -0.12V/nm, respectively. We show both by means of first principles calculations and low  models that crystal fields open a band gap in the groundstate. Our results put forward a physical scenario in which a crystal field effect in carbon substantially impacts the low  properties of twisted double bilayer graphene, suggesting that such contributions must be taken into account in other regimes to faithfully predict the electronic properties of twisted graphene multilayers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670955>Domino 1,4- and 1,6-Addition Reactions of Ketene Silyl Acetals to Dialkynyl Imines Promoted by Aluminum Chloride: Synthesis of Multifunctionalized β-Lactams.</a></h2><p>Domino 1,4- and 1,6-addition reactions of ketene silyl acetals to dialkynyl imines are disclosed.

Here, we develop a thin and conformal hybrid ionic & electronic conducting metal-oxide nanofiber interface to stabilize Li-anodes without forming dendrites. The thin ionic-conductive Li0.33La0.56TiO3 (LLTO) nanofiber film is first fabricated by electrospinning followed by pyrolysis. After connecting with the electrolytes-wetted Li-metal anodes, due to the self-driven chemical reactions, LLTO is reduced and a hybrid conducting interface is developed. The interface can act as a reservoir to redistribute the nonuniform Li-ion flux above the anode surface, and reduce the driving force of dendrite formation by leveling electric potential distribution, enabling a stable Li plating-stripping with a low overpotential of 80 mV over 800 h at a high current of 5 mA/cm2. More practically, the Li-LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells deliver a high capacity of 147 mA h/g at 1 C with a Coulombic efficiency of 99% over 150 cycles, offering prospects to achieve reliable Li-metal batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671848>Modelling Economic Growth, Carbon Emissions, and Fossil Fuel Consumption in China: Cointegration and Multivariate Causality.</a></h2><p>Most authors apply the Granger causality-VECM (vector error correction model), and Toda-Yamamoto procedures to investigate the relationships among fossil fuel consumption, CO emissions, and economic growth, though they ignore the group joint effects and nonlinear behaviour among the variables. In order to circumvent the limitations and bridge the gap in the literature, this paper combines cointegration and linear and nonlinear Granger causality in multivariate settings to investigate the long-run equilibrium, short-run impact, and dynamic causality relationships among economic growth, CO emissions, and fossil fuel consumption in China from 1965-2016. Using the combination of the newly developed econometric techniques, we obtain many novel empirical findings that are useful for policy makers. For example, cointegration and causality analysis imply that increasing CO emissions not only leads to immediate economic growth, but also future economic growth, both linearly and nonlinearly. In addition, the findings from cointegration and causality analysis in multivariate settings do not support the argument that reducing CO emissions and/or fossil fuel consumption does not lead to a slowdown in economic growth in China. The novel empirical findings are useful for policy makers in relation to fossil fuel consumption, CO emissions, and economic growth. Using the novel findings, governments can make better decisions regarding  conservation and emission reductions policies without undermining the pace of economic growth in the long run.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671874>Theoretical Study of the Effect of Different π Bridges Including an Azomethine Group in Triphenylamine-Based Dye for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells.</a></h2><p>Ten molecules were theoretically calculated and studied through density functional theory with the M06 density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The molecular systems have potential applications as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. Three molecules were taken from the literature, and seven are proposals inspired in the above, including the azomethine group in the π-bridge expecting a better charge transfer. These molecular structures are composed of triphenylamine (donor part); different combinations of azomethine, thiophene, and benzene derivatives (π-bridge); and cyanoacrylic acid (acceptor part). This study focused on the effect that the azomethine group caused on the π-bridge. Ground-state geometry optimization, the highest occupied molecular orbital, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and their  levels were obtained and analyzed. Absorption wavelengths, oscillator strengths, and electron transitions were obtained via time-dependent density functional theory using the M06-2X density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The free  of electron injection (ΔG) was calculated and analyzed. As an important part of this study, chemical reactivity parameters are discussed, such as chemical hardness, electrodonating power, electroaccepting power, and electrophilicity index. In conclusion, the inclusion of azomethine in the π-bridge improved the charge transfer and the electronic properties of triphenylamine-based dyes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673044>Stimulation of indigenous microbes by optimizing the water cut in low permeability reservoirs for green and enhanced oil recovery.</a></h2><p>Low permeability oil reservoirs are a widespread petroleum reservoir type all over the world. Therefore, methods to recover these reservoirs efficiently are of importance to guarantee  supply. Here we report our novel stimulation of indigenous microbes by optimizing the water cut in low permeability reservoirs for green and enhanced oil recovery. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of indigenous bacterial communities with changes in water cut in reservoirs by high-throughput sequencing technology, and reveal the mechanism and characteristics of the crude oil biotreatment under different crude oil-water ratio conditions and the optimum activation time of indigenous functional microbial groups in reservoirs. The indigenous microbial metabolism products were characterized by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results showed that Acinetobacter (47.1%) and Pseudomones (19.8%) were the main functional genus of crude oil degradation at the optimal activation time, and can reduce the viscosity of crude oil from 8.33 to 5.75 mPa·s. The dominant bacteria genus for oil recovery after activation of the production fluids was similar to those in the reservoirs with water cut of 60-80%. Furthermore seven mechanism pathways of enhancing oil recovery by the synergistic of functional microbial groups and their metabolites under different water cut conditions in low permeability reservoirs have been established.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670203>Rheology improvement in an osmotic membrane bioreactor for waste sludge anaerobic digestion and the implication on agitation  consumption.</a></h2><p>Sludge rheology is an essential factor for anaerobic digestion (AD) processes to control the agitation  consumption. In this study, the sludge rheology was characterized for an osmotic membrane bioreactor and a conventional sludge anaerobic digestion reactor as the solid content being increased from 3.5-3.7% to 7.5-7.7%. The flow curves were fitted using different rheological models and the mechanism was discussed. The sludge from the osmotic membrane bioreactor exhibited obviously better rheological properties than that of the conventional reactor at a solid content of 7.5-7.7%. Larger particles induced by less negative zeta potential and higher extracellular polymeric substances, together with the higher conductivity resulted by reverse salt flux in the osmotic membrane bioreactor, improved the sludge rheology due to reduced interactions between particles. As a result, the agitation  consumption of the osmotic membrane bioreactor can save up to 34-39% compared with the conventional one at total solid content of 7.5-7.7%.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we report a sodium rich disordered birnessite (NaMnO) for aqueous sodium-ion electrochemical storage with a much-enhanced capacity and cycling life (83 mAh g after 5000 cycles in full-cell). Neutron total scattering and in situ X-ray diffraction measurements show that both structural water and the Na-rich disordered structure contribute to the improved electrochemical performance of current cathode material. Particularly, the co-deintercalation of the hydrated water and sodium-ion during the high potential charging process results in the shrinkage of interlayer distance and thus stabilizes the layered structure.

Lithium metal is a promising candidate as the anode material due to its high theoretical specific capacity, negative electrochemical potential and favorable density. However, during cycling, low and uneven lithium ion concentration on the surface of anode usually results in uncontrolled dendrite growth, especially at high current densities. Here we tackle this issue by using lithiophilic montmorillonite as an additive in the ether-based electrolyte to regulate the lithium ion concentration on the anode surface and thus facilitate the uniform lithium deposition. The lithiophilic montmorillonite demonstrates a pumping feature that improves the self-concentrating kinetics of the lithium ion and thus accelerates the lithium ion transfer at the deposition/electrolyte interface. The signal intensity of TFSI shows negligible changes via in situ Raman tracking of the ion flux at the electrochemical interface, indicating homogeneous ion distribution, which can lead to a stable and uniform lithium deposition on the anode surface. Our study indicates that the interfacial engineering induced by the lithiophilic montmorillonite could be a promising strategy to optimize the lithium deposition for next-generation lithium metal batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673495>A toxicity profile of the Pheroid® technology in rodents.</a></h2><p>The Pheroid® drug delivery system is now on the threshold of progressing into human clinical trials for various patented pharmaceutical applications and a systematic investigation of its toxicological properties  and  is thus a priority.

The colloidal dispersions investigated during this evaluation has a general size of 200 nm - 2 μm, a zeta-potential of -25 mV and the main ingredient was ethyl esters of essential fatty acids. The Ames mutagenicity assay was performed on selected  strains TA98, TA100 and TA102. The Ames assay included S9 metabolic activation and no mutagenicity was present during the assay. The effect of acute and subchronic administration on a biological system was investigated in two species of rodent (BALB/c mice and Sprague-Dawley rats). Observations focused on the physical condition, blood biochemical analysis and the haematological profiles. Gross necropsy was performed on all the test animals. Organ weights followed by histopathology of selected organ tissues were recorded. During the acute evaluation animals showed tolerance of the maximum prescribed dose of 2000 mg/kg (according to OECD guidelines) in two rodent species after intravenous administration (absolute bioavaibility). The oral formulation was tolerated without incidents in both acute and subchronic studies.

In the present study, we show that tau can accumulate spontaneously in aged transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Tau pathology is abundant around Aβ deposits, and further characterized by accumulation of Gallyas and thioflavin-S-positive inclusions, which were detected in the APP/PS1 brain at 18 months of age. Age-dependent increases in argyrophilia correlated positively with binding levels of the paired helical filament (PHF) tracer [F]Flortaucipir, in all brain areas examined. Sarkosyl-insoluble PHFs were visualized by electron microscopy. Quantitative proteomics identified sequences of hyperphosphorylated and three-repeat tau in transgenic mice, along with signs of RNA missplicing, ribosomal dysregulation and disturbed  metabolism. Tissue from the frontal gyrus of human subjects was used to validate these findings, revealing primarily quantitative differences between the tau pathology observed in AD patient vs. transgenic mouse tissue. As physiological levels of endogenous, 'wild-type' tau aggregate secondarily to Aβ in APP/PS1 mice, this study suggests that amyloidosis is both necessary and sufficient to drive tauopathy in experimental models of familial AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674098>Conjugated Copper-Catecholate Framework Electrodes for Efficient  Storage.</a></h2><p>Herein, a new conjugated copper(II)-catecholate based metal-organic framework (namely Cu-DBC) was prepared using a D2 symmetric redox-active ligand in a copper-bis(dihydroxy) coordination geometry.

The number of conversions is determined from the number of 511 keV photons originating from positron annihilation corrected for the annihilation of positrons in flight. Emission of annihilation photons was determined from the measurements of 511 keV full- peak on two calibrated high-purity germanium detectors. The measurements were performed with two sources of a different construction. The first source was a 1 ml ampoule filled with Sr-90 solution (in equilibrium with Y-90) with an activity of 38.041 MBq inserted into an aluminum absorber. The other source was the evaporation residue of the Sr-90 solution (in equilibrium with Y-90) in a polyethylene absorber. In both cases, the annihilation of positrons occurred in the source materials. The efficiency of 511 keV photon detection was determined by Monte Carlo calculation, where the source was defined as a theoretical continuous positron spectrum with a maximum  of 738 keV. The branching ratio related to the internal pair production during Y-90 decay was determined to be (3.26 ± 0.04) × 10 pairs/decay.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In order to evaluate its feasibility for wetland plants treatment, hydrochars from different wetland plants were produced at different temperatures (200 °C, 220 °C, 240 °C, and 260 °C) and characterized, and the transformation of P was investigated. In comparison with wetland plant derived biochars, the derived hydrochars had a moderate pH (5.0-7.7), more oxygen-containing groups, and higher  density (18.0-27.1 MJ kg). These properties were affected by hydrothermal temperature and feedstock choice. In contrast to high water-soluble P in biomass (71.0-73.2% of total P), more recalcitrant P species formed in hydrochars, implying that HTC treatment could achieve P immobilization and reduce P leaching loss. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results indicated that monoester-P and soluble orthophosphate were transformed to insoluble orthophosphate during the HTC treatment. Therefore, HTC is a promising treatment technique for wetland plants to produce valuable char with P reclamation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The water-soluble nanoparticles (Zn-HPc/DP NPs) assembled from this single molecular material with the help of DSPE-PEG-OCH exhibit characteristic absorption in the NIR-II region at 1064 nm with a large extinction coefficient of 52 L g cm, high photothermal conversion efficiency of 58.3%, and intense photoacoustic signal. Moreover, both  and  studies reveal the good biocompatibility and notable tumor ablation ability of Zn-HPc/DP NPs under 1064 nm laser irradiation. Theoretical density functional theory calculations interpret the two-dimensional compressional wave -dissipation pathway over the broad saddle curved framework of the cruciform conjugated phthalocyanine pentad, rationalizing the efficient photothermal properties of corresponding Zn-HPc/DP NPs in the NIR-II window.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671268>Nanoholes Regulate the Phytotoxicity of Single-layer Molybdenum Disulﬁde.</a></h2><p>Single-layer molybdenum disulfide (SLMoS) are applied as a hot 2D nanosheet in various fields involving water treatments. Both intentional design and environmental or biological processes induce many nanoholes in SLMoS. However, the effects of nanoholes on the environmental stability and ecotoxicity of SLMoS remain largely unknown. The present work discovered that visible-light irradiation induced nanoholes (diameters, approximately 20 nm) in the plane of SLMoS, with irregular edges and increased interplanar crystal spacing. The ratios of Mo to S in pristine and transformed SLMoS were 0.53 and 0.33, respectively. After 96 h exposure at concentrations from 0.1-1 mg/L, the above nanoholes promoted algal division, induced a stress-response hormesis, decreased the generation of •OH and mitigated the cell shrinkage and wall rupture of Chlorella vulgaris induced by SLMoS. In terms of stress response, the nanohole-bearing SLMoS induced fewer vacuoles and polyphosphate bodies of Chlorella vulgaris than the pristine form. Metabolomic analysis revealed that nanoholes perturbed the metabolisms of , carbohydrates and fatty acids. This work proposes that nanoholes cause obvious effects on the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of SLMoS and that the environmental risks of engineered nanomaterials should be reevaluated using nanohole-bearing rather than pristine forms for testing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672007> trapping of circumferential resonant modes at a thin-walled groove in a hollow cylinder.</a></h2><p> trapping of circumferential resonant modes at a thin-walled groove in a hollow cylinder is discussed using theoretical dispersion curves of guided waves, semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) calculations, and experiments. The analysis of the dispersion curves predicts the  trapping at a thin-walled groove using the analogy of  trapping of Lamb waves in a stepped plate. The  trapping frequencies and displacement distributions at these frequencies were independently obtained with SAFE calculations and experiments.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with  metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671541>Fabrication of Spherical Titania Inverse Opal Structures Using Electro-Hydrodynamic Atomization.</a></h2><p>Spherical PS/HEMA opal structure and spherical titania inverse opal structure were fabricated by self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles in uniform aerosol droplets generated with electro-hydrodynamic atomization method.

Well-documented in terrestrial settings, priming effects describe stimulated heterotrophic microbial activity and decomposition of recalcitrant carbon by additions of labile carbon. In aquatic settings, algae produce labile exudates which may elicit priming during organic matter decomposition, yet the directions and mechanisms of aquatic priming effects remain poorly tested. 2. We tested algal-induced priming during decomposition of two leaf species of contrasting recalcitrance,  and , in experimental streams under light or dark conditions. We measured litter-associated algal, bacterial, and fungal biomass and activity, stoichiometry, and litter decomposition rates over 43 days. 3. Light increased algal biomass and production rates and increased bacterial abundance 141-733% and fungal production rates 20-157%. Incubations with a photosynthesis inhibitor established that algal activity directly stimulated fungal production rates in the short-term. 4. Algal-stimulated fungal production rates on both leaf species were not coupled to long-term increases in fungal biomass accrual or litter decomposition rates, which were 154-157% and 164-455% greater in the dark, respectively. The similar patterns on fast- vs. slow-decomposing  and , respectively, indicated that substrate recalcitrance may not mediate priming strength or direction. 5. In this example of negative priming, periphytic algae decoupled fungal activity from decomposition, likely by providing labile carbon invested toward greater fungal growth and reproduction instead of recalcitrant carbon degradation. If common, algal-induced negative priming could stimulate heterotrophy reliant on labile carbon yet suppress decomposition of recalcitrant carbon, modifying  and nutrients available to upper trophic levels and enhancing organic carbon storage or export in well-lit aquatic habitats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673020>3D Porous Graphene Based Aerogel for Electromagnetic Applications.</a></h2><p>Lightweight multifunctional electromagnetic (EM) absorbing materials with outstanding thermal properties, chemical resistance and mechanical stability are crucial for space, aerospace and electronic devices and packaging. Therefore, 3D porous graphene aerogels are attracting ever growing interest. In this paper we present a cost effective lightweight 3D porous graphene-based aerogel for EM wave absorption, constituted by a poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymer matrix filled with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and we show that the thermal, electrical, mechanical properties of the aerogel can be tuned through the proper selection of the processing temperature, controlled either at 65 °C or 85 °C. The produced GNP-filled aerogels are characterized by exceptional EM properties, allowing the production of absorbers with 9.2 GHz and 6.4 GHz qualified bandwidths with reflection coefficients below -10 dB and -20 dB, respectively. Moreover, such aerogels show exceptional thermal conductivities without any appreciable volume change after temperature variations. Finally, depending on the process parameters, it is shown the possibility to obtain water repellent aerogel composites, thus preventing their EM and thermal properties from being affected by environmental humidity and allowing the realization of EM absorber with a stable response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671637>Insights into the Interaction Mechanisms of the Proviral Integration Site of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (Pim) Kinases with Pan-Pim Inhibitors PIM447 and AZD1208: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation and MM/GBSA Calculation Study.</a></h2><p>Based on the up-regulation of the proviral integration site of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim) kinase family (Pim1, 2, and 3) observed in several types of leukemias and lymphomas, the development of pan-Pim inhibitors is an attractive therapeutic strategy. While only PIM447 and AZD1208 have entered the clinical stages. To elucidate the interaction mechanisms of three Pim kinases with PIM447 and AZD1208, six Pim/ligand systems were studied by homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free  calculation. The residues of the top group (Leu44, Val52, Ala65, Lys67, and Leu120 in Pim1) dominated the pan-Pim inhibitors binding to Pim kinases. The residues of the bottom group (Gln127, Asp128, and Leu174 in Pim1) were crucial for Pims/PIM447 systems, while the contributions of these residues were decreased sharply for Pims/AZD1208 systems. It is likely that the more potent pan-Pim inhibitors should be bound strongly to the top and bottom groups. The residues of the left, right and loop groups were located in the loop regions of the binding pocket, however, the flexibility of these regions triggered the protein interacting with diverse pan-Pim inhibitors efficiently.

The objective of this study was to determine the main sources of added sugars in the Argentine diet and to determine the proportional  contribution of each of them. The sample consisted of 1266 individuals, representative of the country's urban population from 15 to 65 years old, stratified by region, age, gender and socio-economic level. Two 24-hour intake records and one socio-economic questionnaire were carried out. Among the total food and beverages consumed, 26.9% of added sugars was contributed by soft drinks and 23.8% by infusions. The third place, with 15.4%, was obtained by baked goods (bread, cookies, etc.) and the fourth, with 12%, from ready-to-prepare juices, ahead of sweets, candies and dairy products. Men, compared to women, consumed significantly more added sugars in soft drinks (32.6 vs. 22.1%) and women more in infusions (25.5% vs. 21.8%), baked goods, sugar and honey. The lower income population consumed significantly more sugar in infusions at the expense of "mate" (21.4 vs. 7 g/day) and no differences were observed in the consumption of soft drinks by socio-economic level (32.9 vs. 34.4 g/day).

The assay is based on the use of g-CN and NiO nanocrystals (NCs) which form a heterojunction. The latter was prepared by two-step hydrothermal pyrolysis by using the ionic liquid 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazole chloride which functions as a morphological template to form NiO NCs. The heterojunction exhibits much better electronic conductivity, wider absorption range, higher electron-hole-separation productivity, and stronger photocurrent compared to plain g-CN. The heterojunction was adopted to construct a self-powered PEC aptamer probe for OTC detection. An OTC-binding aptamer was immobilized on the heterojunction and the probe was constructed. The aptamer on the probe binding with OTC can form steric hindrance for transmitting of electrons and cause the PEC signal change depending on the OTC concentration. The photocurrent decreases with increasing OTC concentration in the 0.01 to 100 nM concentration range and its detection limit is 4 pM (at S/N = 3).

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the  status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The model is developed using a multiscale computational framework by coupling a continuum field model for the cell membrane with a coarse-grained model for the polymeric NPs. The NP is modeled as a self-avoiding bead-spring polymer chain, and the cell membrane is modeled as a triangulated surface using the dynamically triangulated Monte Carlo method. The nanoparticle binding affinity to a cell surface is mainly determined by the delicate balance between the enthalpic gain due to the multivalent ligand-receptor binding and the entropic penalties of various components including receptor translation, membrane undulation, and NP conformation. We have developed new methods to compute the free  of binding, which includes these enthalpy and entropy terms. We show that the multivalent interactions between the flexible NP and the cell surface are subject to entropy-enthalpy compensation. Three different entropy contributions, namely, those due to receptor-ligand translation, NP flexibility, and membrane undulations, are all significant, although the first of these terms is the most dominant. However, both NP flexibility and membrane undulations dictate the receptor-ligand translational entropy making the entropy compensation context-specific, i.e., dependent on whether the NP is rigid or flexible, and on the state of the membrane given by the value of membrane tension or its excess area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670502>A Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Amino Acid for Monitoring Protein Interactions through FRET.</a></h2><p>Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) is a well-established method for studying macromolecular interactions and con-formational changes within proteins. Such a method normally uses fluorescent proteins or chemical labeling methods which are often only accessible to surface exposed residues and risk disturbing target protein structures. Here, we demonstrate that the genetic incorporation of a synthetic fluorescent amino acid, L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Cou), and natural endogenous fluorophore Tryptophan (Trp) residues of a protein, could serve as an efficient FRET pair to monitor protein interactions, using the signaling transducer β-arrestin-1 as a model system. We used this technology to record the dynamic spectra in both binding and competition experiments of β-arrestin-1, the contribution of each specific phosphate in ternary complex formation, in a rapid and efficient manner. The determined Kd value for the association between the active arres-tin and Fab30 is 0.68 μM in the three components interaction system. Moreover, we were able to determine the contributions of the site 3 phospho-site and the site 6 phospho-site binding each contributed to the high affinity ternary complex assem-bling as 2.7 folds and 15.5 folds respectively, which were never determined before. These results thus highlighted the poten-tial usage of this new method in measurement of the allosteric induced enhanced affinity with small amount proteins and in a fast manner and in a complex system.

The static water contact angle (SCA) of the etched Ni surfaces reached higher than 125°, showing excellent hydrophobicity. The examination of surface chemical compositions implied that there were almost no polar moieties on the surface after chemical etching, except part of the surface was oxidized. After chemical etching, the nickel surfaces became much rough with packed terrace-/crater-/thorn-like clusters. According to the analysis of surface composition and morphology, the hydrophobicity was evidently attributed to the rough microstructures on the etched Ni surface. The best hydrophobicity on Ni surface was produced with the SCAs as high as 140.0° by optimizing the etching time and etchants.

The availability of the  optimized full crystal structure of uranophane-β, including the positions of the hydrogen atoms, made possible the computation of its elastic properties and the Raman spectrum by using the theoretical methodology. An extended set of relevant mechanical data is reported. Uranophane-β is shown to be a weak and ductile mineral and, consequenty, is mechanically very different from the α polymorph which is a hard and brittle material. Uranophane-β exhibits the important negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomena. The experimental Raman spectrum of uranophane-β obtained from a natural mineral sample from pegmatite Perus, São Paulo, Brazil, is compared with the spectrum determined theoretically. Since both spectra are in very good agreement, the theoretical methods are employed to assign the Raman spectrum. Three weak bands of the experimental spectrum of this mineral, located at the wavenumbers 2302, 2128 and 2042 cm-1, are identified as combination bands. The Raman spectrum of uranophane-β is also compared with that of the α polymorph. While they are rather similar, a detailed analysis reveals a significant number of differences. Finally, the relative thermodynamic stability of the α and β polymorphs is evaluated. The α polymorph is more stable than the β polymorph at zero pressure and temperature by -12.0 kJ mol-1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671609>BAP31 Inhibits Cell Adaptation to ER Stress Conditions, Negatively Regulating Autophagy Induction by Interaction with STX17.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells modulate their metabolism to proliferate and survive under the metabolic stress condition, which is known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

The results showed that cell growth, intracellular lipogenesis and carotene biosynthesis were improved with an optimal exposure condition at 10 g/L and 20 g/L sodium acetate. Under high light exposure condition (8000 lx), cell growth and lipid production were inhibited while β-carotene accumulation was promoted. The fatty acid compositions moreover revealed that more polyunsaturated fatty acids and linoleic acid were generated under light exposure, which demonstrated its crucial role in the oxidative stress resistance in R. glutinis. The expression levels of some genes in acetate consumption, lipogenesis and β-carotene biosynthesis were found significantly upregulated under light exposure.

Inferring the occluded road area requires a comprehensive understanding of the geometry and the semantics of the visible scene. To this end, we create a small but effective dataset based on the KITTI dataset named KITTI-OFRS (KITTI-occlusion-free road segmentation) dataset and propose a lightweight and efficient, fully convolutional neural network called OFRSNet (occlusion-free road segmentation network) that learns to predict occluded portions of the road in the semantic domain by looking around foreground objects and visible road layout. In particular, the global context module is used to build up the down-sampling and joint context up-sampling block in our network, which promotes the performance of the network. Moreover, a spatially-weighted cross-entropy loss is designed to significantly increases the accuracy of this task.

NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, insulin resistance, obesity and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate metabolism to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical pathways and  metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism during inflammatory conditions. This review summarizes current evidence for the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by iNOS during inflammation, and argues for the role of iNOS as a metabolic enzyme in immune and non-immune cells.Copyright © 2019.

They use the  from ATP hydrolysis to propel large intramolecular movements, which drive vectorial transport of ions. Tight coordination of the motions of the pump is required to couple the two spatially distant processes of ion binding and ATP hydrolysis. Here, we review our current understanding of the structural dynamics of P-type ATPases, focusing primarily on Ca2+ pumps. We integrate different types of information that report on structural dynamics, primarily time-resolved fluorescence experiments including single-molecule Förster resonance  transfer and molecular dynamics simulations, and interpret them in the framework provided by the numerous crystal structures of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. We discuss the challenges in characterizing the dynamics of membrane pumps, and the likely impact of new technologies on the field.© 2019 The Author(s).

We hypothesized that suppression of proinflammatory pathway of IKKβ/NF-κBin the hypothalamuscan improve  balance and cardiac function in type 2 diabetic (T2D)rats.Normal rats and T2D rats received bilateral hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) infusions of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 or vehicle via osmotic minipump.Metabolic phenotyping, immunohistochemical analyses, and biochemical analyses were used to investigate the outcomes of inhibition of the hypothalamic IKKβ. Echocardiography and glucometer were used for measuring cardiac function and blood glucose,respectively. Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (PICs). Heart was harvested for cardiacmorphology evaluations. The ARC was harvested and analyzed for IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NAD(P)H (gp91phox,p47phox) oxidase activitylevels and neuropeptides.Compared with normal rats, T2D rats were characterized by hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, cardiac dysfunction, as well as higher ARC levels of IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, ROS, gp91phox and p47phox. ARC infusion of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 attenuated all these changes in T2D rats, but not in normal rats.Our results indicate that hypothalamic IKKβ/NF-κB pathway plays a key role in modulatingenergy imbalance and cardiac dysfunction, suggesting its potential therapeutic role during type 2diabetes.© 2019 S.

To improve PCE, it is necessary to develop PSCs with good interfacial engineering to reduce the trap states and carrier transport barriers present at the various interfaces of the PSCs architecture. This work reports a facile method to improve the interface between the perovskite absorber layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) by adding a small amount of acetonitrile (ACN) in the Spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution. This small amount of ACN dissolves the surface of the perovskite layer, allowing to form an interdiffusion structure between perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD layers. This modification allows for an improved electrical contact, enhanced collection of holes, reduced recombination losses at the interface between the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD layers and, consequently, enhances the PCE. A maximum PCE of 19.7% with low hysteresis and a steady state power conversion efficiency of 19.0% is obtained for optimized PSCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670076>Dietary 2-deoxy-D-glucose impairs tumour growth and metastasis by inhibiting angiogenesis.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence suggests the antiangiogenic potential of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) among the anticancerous properties of this drug. In the present studies, we investigated the antiangiogenic effects of dietary 2-DG on tumour (Lewis lung carcinoma [LLC]) as well as ionising radiation-induced angiogenesis in mouse models. Dietary 2-DG reduced the serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels (∼40%) in LLC-bearing mice along with a significant inhibition of tumour growth and metastases. In vivo Matrigel plug assays showed significant decrease in vascularisation, Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran fluorescence and factor VIII-positive cells in the plugs from 2-DG-fed mice, supporting the notion that dietary 2-DG significantly suppresses the tumour-associated and radiation-induced angiogenesis. 2-DG inhibited the glucose usage and lactate production as well as ATP levels of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a concentration-dependent manner, accompanied by growth inhibition and loss of viability in vitro. Furthermore, 2-DG inhibited the capillary-like tube formation in Matrigel as well as migration and transwell invasion by HUVECs, which are functional indicators of the process of angiogenesis. These results suggest that dietary 2-DG inhibits processes related to angiogenesis, which can impair the growth and metastasis of tumours.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Trapping for adults was conducted in Italy with novel live (or lethal) traps consisting of aggregation pheromone-baited cylinders with a wind vane, with the upwind end covered by mesh and the downwind end sealed by a removable entry-only mesh cone, admitting the attracted bugs. The novel traps caught up to 15-times more adult  than identically-baited sticky panels in two weeks of daily checking (n = 6 replicates) (the new live traps were, in Run 1, 5-, 9-, 15-, 13-, 4-, 12-, 2-fold; and in Run 2, 7-, 1-, 3-, 7-, 6-, 6-, and 5-fold better than sticky traps, daily). The maximum catch of the new traps was 96 live adults in one trap in 24 h and the average improvement was ~7-fold compared with sticky panels. The rotating live traps, which exploit a mesh funnel facing the plume downwind that proved useful for collecting adults, could also be used to kill bugs. We expect that commercially-available traps could replace the crude prototypes we constructed quickly from local materials, at low cost, as long as the principles of a suitable plume structure were observed, as we discuss. The traps could be useful for the sterile insect technique, supporting rearing colonies, or to kill bugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670102>Fabrication of hierarchical copper sulfide/bismuth tungstate p-n heterojunction with two-dimensional (2D) interfacial coupling for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic degradation of glyphosate.</a></h2><p>Hierarchical copper sulfide/bismuth tungstate (CuS/BiWO) p-n junction with two-dimensional (2D) interfacial coupling were prepared through a two-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. CuS nanoplates anchored on the surface of hierarchical BiWO microspheres consisting of BiWO nanosheets to form a CuS/BiWO p-n junction photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity of glyphosate degradation over CuS/BiWO under 44 W light-emitting diode (LED) light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) was investigated. The results indicate that the CuS/BiWO heterojunctions display higher photocatalytic activity than pure CuS and BiWO. The improved photocatalytic activity of the CuS/BiWO heterostructures can be attributed to strong visible light absorption and enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers by the internal electric field near the interface of the p-n junction. In addition, the CuS/BiWO p-n junction photocatalysts consisting of nanosheets are beneficial for the transport of photoexcited charge carriers, thus resulting in the increase of the photocatalytic activity of glyphosate degradation. This work provides the new avenue for the development and design p-n junction materials for photocatalytic applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile, non-targeting PSs generally yield low efficiency in antibacterial performance due to their short lifetimes small effective working radii. Herein, a water-dispersible membrane anchor (TBD-anchor) PS with aggregation-induced emission is designed and synthesized to provide superefficient 1O2 generation specifically on bacteria membrane. TBD-anchor possesses  donor and acceptor subunits to modulate the bandgap of the PS, and cationic groups were introduced to target bacterial membrane through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. TBD-anchor showed superefficient antibacterial performance towards both Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus). Over 99.8% killing efficiency was obtained for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) when they were exposed to 0.8 μM of TBD-anchor at a low white light dose (25 mW/cm2) for 10 minutes.

Self-reported SB was obtained from the GPAQ. Objectively measured SB was assessed using the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity. Participants wore the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity continuously during 2 consecutive days while following their daily routine. The relative validity was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (ρ), and the agreement was examined using mean bias and 95% limit of agreement with the Intelligent Device for  Expenditure and Activity as reference.The results showed small correlations (ρ = .291, P < .001) between the SB from the GPAQ and the objective measures, and ranged from ρ = .217 to ρ = .491 depending on the potential moderator. Similarly, the GPAQ underestimates the SB for approximately 2 hours per day in older adults (limit of agreement = -7.3 to 3.4 h/d).The GPAQ may not be the most suitable questionnaire for measuring SB in this population and should be used with caution because those studies that use this questionnaire in older adults may have an inaccurate measurement of SB levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673838>Dual- CT for routine imaging of the abdomen and pelvis: radiation dose and image quality.</a></h2><p>To assess the radiation dose and image quality of routine dual  CT (DECT) of the abdomen and pelvis performed in the emergency department setting, compared with single  CT (SECT).Seventy-five consecutive routine contrast-enhanced SECT scans of the abdomen and pelvis meeting inclusion criteria were compared with 75 routine contrast-enhanced DECT scans matched by size and patient weight (within 10 lbs), performed on the same dual-source DECT scanner. Cohorts were compared in terms of radiation dose metrics of CT dose index (CTDI) and dose length product (DLP), objective measurements of image quality (signal, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio of a variety of anatomical landmarks), and subjective measurements of image quality scored by two emergency radiologists.Demographics and patient size were not statistically different between DECT and SECT cohorts.

First, a computational model that predicts the energetically favorable shape of precipitate when a d-dimensional material parameter (x) is given is developed. Second, the discrepancy (y) between the precipitate shape obtained through the experiment and that predicted using the computational model is calculated. Third, the Gaussian process (GP) is used to model the relation between x and y. Finally, for identifying the "low-error region (LER)" in the material parameter space where y is less than a threshold, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy, wherein the estimated GP model suggests the subsequent candidate x to be sampled/calculated. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the estimation of interface  and lattice mismatch between MgZn ([Formula: see text]) and α-Mg phases in an Mg-based alloy. The result shows that the number of computational calculations of the precipitate shape required for the LER estimation is significantly decreased by using the proposed method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673780>The impact of diet, body composition, and physical activity on child bone mineral density at five years of age-findings from the ROLO Kids Study.</a></h2><p>Bone health is extremely important in early childhood because children with low bone mineral density (BMD) are at a greater risk of bone fractures. While physical activity and intake of both calcium and vitamin D benefit BMD in older children, there is limited research on the determinants of good bone health in early childhood. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the impact of diet, physical activity, and body composition on BMD at five years of age. Dietary intakes and physical activity levels were measured through questionnaires. Whole body BMD was measured by dual- X-ray absorptiometry in 102 children. Child weight, height, circumferences, skinfolds and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were assessed. There was no association between BMD and dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, 25OHD, physical activity, or sedentary behaviour. Several measures of body composition were significantly positively associated with BMD; however, neither fat mass nor lean body mass was associated with BMD.Conclusion: Although we found no association between self-reported dietary and lifestyle factors and bone health in early years, increased body size was linked with higher BMD. These findings are important as identifying modifiable factors that can improve bone health at a young age is of utmost importance. What is Known: • Bone health is extremely important in early childhood, as children with low bone mineral density (BMD) are at greater risk of bone fractures. • Physical activity has been found to be beneficial for bone health in adolescents, and body composition has also been associated with BMD in teenage years. • Limited research on the determinants of good bone health in early childhood. What is New: • No association between self-reported lifestyle and dietary factors with bone health in early childhood. • Increased body size was associated with higher BMD at five years of age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672893>Barely porous organic cages for hydrogen isotope separation.</a></h2><p>The separation of hydrogen isotopes for applications such as nuclear fusion is a major challenge. Current technologies are  intensive and inefficient. Nanoporous materials have the potential to separate hydrogen isotopes by kinetic quantum sieving, but high separation selectivity tends to correlate with low adsorption capacity, which can prohibit process scale-up. In this study, we use organic synthesis to modify the internal cavities of cage molecules to produce hybrid materials that are excellent quantum sieves. By combining small-pore and large-pore cages together in a single solid, we produce a material with optimal separation performance that combines an excellent deuterium/hydrogen selectivity (8.0) with a high deuterium uptake (4.7 millimoles per gram).Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The performance of the RAOC in 1,4-dioxane removal was compared to that of a TiO slurry reactor by evaluating the removal efficiencies in pure water (PW) and the BTLL. In the TiO slurry reactor, 1,4-dioxane was hardly degraded in the BTLL during 66 h of treatment because of strong inhibition by coexisting substances in the BTLL. In contrast, the RAOC successfully removed 1,4-dioxane from the BTLL by 89% through adsorption and by 81% through photocatalysis during treatment for 66 h. The ratio of the rate constants for degrading 1,4-dioxane in the BTLL and PW by the RAOC was two orders of magnitude higher than that for a TiO slurry reactor. This shows that the RAOC greatly mitigated the inhibition by coexisting substances in the BTLL. The electrical  required for 1,4-dioxane degradation in the BTLL by the RAOC was much lower than that required for degradation by the TiO slurry reactor. The results show that the RAOC equipped with AC/TiO composite sheets effectively removed 1,4-dioxane from BTLL.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Triplet excited states of these drugs have been shown as reporters of FQ self-association using laser flash photolysis technique. A study using low-temperature phosphorescence technique was performed with quinolone derivatives such as enoxacin (ENX), norfloxacin (NFX), pefloxacin (PFX), ciprofloxacin (CPX, ofloxacin (OFX), nalidixic acid (NLA), pipemidic acid (PPA) and piromidic acid (PRA) to explore emission changes associated with self-associations and to shed some light on the triplet excited state  (E) discrepancies described in the literature for most of these drugs. The emissions obtained at 77 K in buffered aqueous medium revealed that the amphoteric nature of the quinolones CPX, NFX, PFX, ENX, OFX and PPA must generate their self-associations because a redshift of their phosphorescence maxima is produced by FQ concentrations increases. Hence, this effect was not observed for NLA and PRA or when all quinolones were analysed using ethanol or ethylene glycol aqueous mixtures as glassed solvents. Interestingly, the presence of these organic mixtures produced a blue-shift in the phosphorescence emission maximum of each FQ. Additionally, laser flash photolysis experiments with PRA and the amphoteric quinolone PPA, compounds with the same skeleton but different peripheral substituent, confirm the expected correlations between the amphoteric nature of compounds and their self-associations in aqueous media because the excimer generation was only detected for PPA. Now, the discrepancies described in the literature for the E of FQs can be understood considering that changes of medium polarity or proticity as well as the temperature can considerably modify their E values. Thereby, low-temperature phosphorescence technique, is an effective way to detect molecular self-associations and surrounding changes in quinolones that opens the possibility to evaluate these effects in other drug families.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To better mitigate against the impact of airgun pulses on marine mammals, safety criteria are defined to ensure marine mammals are not exposed to high levels of acoustic . Accurate prediction of the sound received levels away from the airguns is required for conducting effective marine mammal monitoring. In this study, measurements by a horizontal hydrophone array towed by the R/V Marcus G. Langseth behind a seismic source array have been used to characterize short-range propagation of airgun pulses and predict the acoustic  radiated from a seismic source. Data from the Cascadia Open-Access Seismic Transects seismic reflection survey are used to train a linear regression (LR) and a random forest (RF) model to estimate sound exposure levels (SELs) in short ranges from the airguns. Results show that the LR model does not account for all the variance in data. However, the RF model is able to estimate the SELs with a high coefficient of determination and a low mean squared error. Results from the LR model show that the rate at which SELs decrease in deep water does not match either of the cylindrical or spherical spreading models.

Therefore, in this work the integrated extraction of phenolic compounds, including the bioactive oleuropein, and proteins from olive mill leaves was addressed following three schemes, including the use of ultrasound. This affected the total phenolic content (4475.5-6166.9 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g), oleuropein content (675.3-1790.0 mg/100 g), and antioxidant activity (18,234.3-25,459.0 µmol trolox equivalents/100 g). No effect was observed on either the protein recovery or the content of sugars and lignin in the extraction residues. Concerning the recovery of proteins, three operational parameters were evaluated by response surface methodology. The optimum (63.1%) was achieved using NaOH 0.7 M at 100 °C for 240 min. Then, the selected scheme was applied to olive leaves from the field, observing differences in the content of some of the studied components.

Polystyrene was used as sacrificial support, SnO was selected as inorganic matrix, surface imprinting using catechol as fragment template and 4-vinylphenylboronic acid as boronate-affinity functional monomer. A thin layer of poly 2-anilinoethanol (2-AE) was formed to coat the boronate-affinity hollow SnO surface through self-polymerization, it has strong hydrophilicity and limited residual boric acid content, avoiding non-specific binding. The hollow structure could bind to target molecules effectively and facilitate the removal of template molecules. The Bh@SnO-FMIPs were used to extract three cis-diol polyphenols containing catechin, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in tea and juice samples. Combination with seven characterizations of the material confirmed the successful preparation. Effecting the imprinting conditions and extraction efficiency parameters were optimized separately. Selective and competitive adsorption experiments indicated that the materials could specific recognition polyphenols. Using solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography method, the detection limits were 0.005-0.046 μg mL and the recoveries were between 82.3-104.3%. The improved adsorption performance may be assigned to the synergistic effects among boronate-affinity, hollow SnO, and 2-AE self-polymerization.

The current study was performed to evaluate a large-animal model employing implanted optical fibers to accurately irradiate targeted spinal segments. The method's feasibility and irradiation parameters that do not cause phototoxic reaction were determined, and the methodology of irradiating the spinal cord with near-infrared light was investigated in detail.A diffusing optical fiber was implanted above the T9 spinal cord of Bama miniature pigs and used to transfer near-infrared light (810 nm) onto the spinal cord surface. After daily irradiation with 200, 300, 500, or 1000 mW for 14 days, both sides of the irradiated area of the spinal cord were assessed for temperature changes. The condition of the spinal cord and the position of optical fiber were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and different parameters indicating temperature increases or phototoxicity were measured on the normal spinal cord surface due to light irradiation (i.e., heat shock responses, inflammatory reactions, and neuronal apoptosis), and the animals' lower-limb neurological function and gait were assessed during the irradiation process.The implanted device was stable inside the freely moving animals, and light  could be directly projected onto the spinal cord surface. The screening of different irradiation parameters preliminary showed that direct irradiation onto the spinal cord surface at 200 and 300 mW did not significantly increase the temperature, stress responses, inflammatory reactions and neural apoptosis, whereas irradiation at 500 mW slightly increased these parameters, and irradiation at 1000 mW induced a significant temperature increase, heat shock, inflammation and apoptosis responses. HE staining of spinal cord tissue sections did not reveal any significant structural changes of the tissues compared to the control group, and the neurological function and gait of all irradiated animals were normal.In this study, we established an in-vivo optical fiber implantation method, which might be safe and stable and could be used to directly project light  onto the spinal cord surface. This study might provide a new perspective for clinical applications of PBM in acute SCI. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.

This mild process can maintain the unique properties of the original carbon nanotubes intact. The morphological character of MWCNTs-CS was examined via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. MWCNTs-CS was used as sensing film to fabricate quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) humidity sensors. The optimized sensor possesses high response sensitivity (46.7 Hz/% RH), negligible humidity hysteresis (around 1.1% RH), quick response and recovery time (75 s/34 s), and remarkable reversibility, repeatability, long-term stability and selectivity. Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was used to study the adsorption process of water molecules on MWCNTs-CS film, and the Gibbs free adsorption  was calculated as -21.85 kJ/mol. By combining the good mechanic properties of MWCNTs and the high hydrophilia of chitosan, the MWCNTs-CS composites are promising for humidity sensing application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The prepared compounds were also tested for their inhibition potential on photosynthetic electron transport (PET) in spinach () chloroplasts. In fact, some of the newly prepared molecules revealed comparable or even better inhibitory activities compared to the marketed drugs (rivastigmine or galanthamine) and commercially applied pesticide Diuron, respectively. Generally, most compounds exhibited better inhibition potency towards AChE; however, a wider activity span was observed for BChE. Notably, benzyl -[()-2-[(-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]-carbamate () and benzyl -[()-2-[(-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]-carbamate () were characterized by fairly high selective indexes. Specifically, compound  was prescribed with the lowest IC value that corresponds quite well with galanthamine inhibition activity, while the inhibitory profiles of molecules  and benzyl--[()-2-[(-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)carbamoyl]ethyl]carbamate () are in line with rivastigmine activity. Moreover, a structure-activity relationship (SAR)-driven similarity evaluation of the physicochemical properties for the carbamates examined appeared to have foreseen the activity cliffs using a similarity-activity landscape index for BChE inhibitory response values. The 'indirect' ligand-based and 'direct' protein-mediated in silico approaches were applied to specify electronic/steric/lipophilic factors that are potentially valid for quantitative (Q)SAR modeling of the carbamate analogues. The stochastic model validation was used to generate an 'average' 3D-QSAR pharmacophore pattern. Finally, the target-oriented molecular docking was employed to (re)arrange the spatial distribution of the ligand property space for BChE and photosystem II (PSII).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671602>A Bootstrapped Comparator-Switched Active Rectifying Circuit for Wirelessly Powered Integrated Miniaturized  Sensing Systems.</a></h2><p>Human life expectancy has gradually increased in part through rapid advances in technology, including the development and use of wearable and implantable biomedical electronic devices and sensing monitors. A new architecture is proposed in this paper to replace the traditional diode circuit implementation in wireless power supply systems applied to the above-mentioned devices and monitors. By achieving near-ideal power transistor switching and leveraging the characteristics of conventional diodes to prevent reverse current, the proposed approach greatly improves the performance of the  harvester in power conversion. The MOS harvester used in the uninterrupted permanent wireless near-field power supply described here for use in biomedical systems was designed and verified using the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) standard 180-nm process, achieving performance results of Voltage conversion efficiency (VCE) = 73.55-95.12% and Power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 80.36-90.08% with the output load (0.1-1 kΩ) under 3.3 V ac input with an overall area of 1.189 mm.

Existing wireless systems often require intracranial wires to connect implanted electrodes to an external head-stage or / and deploy application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), that is battery-powered or externally power-transferred, raising safety concerns such as infection, electronics failure, or heat-induced tissue damage. This work presents a biocompatible, flexible, implantable neural recorder capable of wireless acquisition of neuropotentials without wires, batteries,  harvesting units, or active electronics. The recorder, fabricated on a thin polyimide substrate, features a small footprint of 9 mm x 8 mm x 0.3 mm, and is comprised of passive electronic components. The absence of active electronics on the device leads to near zero power consumption, inherently avoiding the catastrophic failure of active electronics. We performed both in-vitro validation in tissue-simulating phantom and in-vivo validation in an epileptic rat. The fully-passive wireless recorder was implanted under rat scalp to measure neuropotentials from its contact electrodes. The implanted wireless recorder demonstrated its capability to capture low voltage neuropotentials, including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and interictal epileptiform discharges (IED). Wirelessly recorded SSEP and IED signals were directly compared to those from wired electrodes to demonstrate the efficacy of the wireless data. In addition, a CNN (Convoluted Neural Network)-based machine learning algorithm successfully achieved IED signal recognition accuracy as high as 100% and 91% in wired and wireless IED data, respectively. These results strongly support the fully-passive wireless neural recorder's capability to measure neuropotentials as low as tens of microvolts. With further improvement, the recorder system presented in this work may find wide applications in future brain machine interface (BMI) system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673997>Benefits of thymol supplementation on performance, the hepatic antioxidant system, and energetic metabolism in grass carp.</a></h2><p>Thymol is an herbal food additive used to improve animal performance. Thymol acts via its potential to enhance productive and reproductive performance, and by improving bioavailability of nutrients in fish. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with these phenomena remain poorly understood, although recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the phosphotransfer network and antioxidant status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the improvement of the antioxidant/oxidant status and the phosphoryl transfer network may be involved in enhanced growth performance in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with various levels of thymol (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed). Thymol-supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) produced higher body weight and weight gain for 60-day post-feeding compared to the control group. Specific growth rate was higher; while feed conversion ratio was lower in fish that consumed 100 mg of thymol/kg compared to other groups. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity and lipid peroxidation levels were lower in the thymol-supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group, while reactive oxygen species were lower in all supplemented groups than in the control group. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (300 mg/kg feed) and glutathione peroxidase (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed) activities, as well as antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (100 mg/kg feed) were higher in these groups than in the control group. Based on these data, we conclude that 100 mg thymol/kg dietary supplementation increased growth performance of fingerling grass carp. Finally, hepatic adenylate kinase activity was lower in the thymol supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group. Thymol supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) improved hepatic  metabolism, while practically all tested concentrations of thymol enhanced hepatic antioxidant status, all of which may be pathways involved in increased growth performance in fingerling grass carp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670246>Effect of sonication time on the evaporation rate of seawater containing a nanocomposite.</a></h2><p>Sonication time has a significant contribution to the stability and properties of nanofluids (mixtures of nanoparticles and a base fluid). Finding the optimum sonication time can help to save  and ensure optimal design. The present study deals with the sonication time effect on the evaporation rate of seawater containing a nanocomposite (i.e., a mixture of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplates). For indoor experiments, a solar simulator was employed as the radiation source. At first, the nanofluid with a concentration of 0.01% wt. was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for different times of 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 min, and the associated zeta potential values were recorded to evaluate the stability. Next, the best time function was used to appraise the effect of concentration variations (0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04% wt.) and the light intensities (1.6, 2.6, and 3.6 suns) on the rate of solar steam generation. The results indicate that for a concentration of 0.01% wt. and under 3.6 suns, the highest evaporation efficiency of 61.3% would be achieved at 120 min sonication time.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) study on chiral compounds plays a key role in predicting the retention factor and the separation factor even the elution order of the enantiomers. In this study, the structures of chiral arylhydantoin compounds have been built to compute molecular structural parameters using VolSurf program. The satisfying models were established between the parameters and the retention factor as well as the separation factor. Analysis on the variables shows that the large difference values of volume, hydrophilic regions and hydrogen bond acceptor and donor regions at some  levels will result in the large separation factor. The differences of hydrophobic regions and the unbalance between the centre of mass and the barycentre of the hydrophobic region at high  levels are also favorable to the separation. The differences of surface area, hydrophilic regions and hydrogen bond acceptor and donor regions at other  levels as well as hydrophobic regions and the unbalance at low  levels between the enantiomers are disadvantageous to the separation. The analysis on the chiral recognition mechanism demonstrates that the differences of the interaction energies between the enantiomers are mainly affected by the hydrogen bond, π-π interaction and CH-π interaction. The retention factor and the separation factor, especially the elution order of the enantiomers can be easily predicted using the models.

Herein, we fabricate COF-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) using nitrogen rich COF-JLU2 as precursors by a simple carbonization for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and aluminum (Al) batteries for the first time. The computational results suggest that NPC has an enhanced conductivity and optimized electron density distribution. NPC could overcome the low conductivity of COF, and thus further optimize its electrochemical performance in PIBs and Al batteries.

Autophagy also removes misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, a critical mechanism for cellular repair. Earlier work demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans, an abundant class of carbohydrate-modified proteins found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, suppress basal levels of autophagy in several cell types during development in In studies reported here, we examined the capacity of heparan sulfate synthesis to influence events affected by autophagy, including lifespan, resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress, and accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in the brain. Compromising heparan sulfate synthesis increased autophagy-dependent processes, evident by extended lifespan, increased resistance to ROS, and reduced accumulation of ubiquitin-modified proteins in the brains of ROS exposed adults. The capacity of altering heparan sulfate biosynthesis to protect cells from injury was also evaluated in two different models of neurodegeneration, overexpression of Presenilin and mutants. Presenilin overexpression in the retina produces cell loss, and compromising heparan sulfate biosynthesis rescued retinal patterning and size abnormalities in these animals.  is the fly homolog of human, one of the genes responsible for juvenile onset Parkinson's Disease. Parkin is involved in mitochondrial surveillance and compromising function results in degeneration of both flight muscle and dopaminergic neurons in Altering heparan sulfate biosynthesis suppressed flight muscle degeneration and mitochondrial dysmorphology, indicating that activation of autophagy-mediated removal of mitochondria (mitophagy) is potentiated in these animals. These findings provide in vivo evidence that altering the levels of heparan sulfate synthesis activates autophagy and can provide protection from a variety of cellular stressors.Copyright © 2019, G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670045>Determination of thiourea based on the reversion of fluorescence quenching of nitrogen doped carbon dots by Hg.</a></h2><p>Herein, a facile and quick strategy to detect thiourea was conducted based on the reversion of fluorescence quenching of nitrogen doped carbon dots (NCDs) by Hg.

The fluorescence of NCDs was obviously quenched by Hg and can be recovered, due to stronger interaction between thiourea and Hg.

The presence of microplastics have been recorded in the tissues of many wild fish species, and laboratory studies have demonstrated that microplastics can exert adverse health effects. To further investigate the biological mechanisms underlying microplastics toxicity we applied an integrated approach, analyzing the effects of microplastics at transcriptomic, histological and behavioral level. Adult zebrafish have been exposed to two concentrations of high-density polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics for twenty days. Transcriptomic results indicate alterations in the expression of immune system genes and the down-regulation of genes correlated with epithelium integrity and lipid metabolism. The transcriptomic findings are supported by tissue alterations and higher occurrence of neutrophils observed in gills and intestinal epithelium. Even the daily rhythm of activity of zebrafish appears to be affected, although the regular pattern of activity is recovered over time. Considering the transcriptomic and histological findings reported, we hypothesize that the effects on mucosal epithelium integrity and immune response could potentially reduce the organism defense against pathogens, and lead to a different utilization of  stores.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673766>Thermal energetics and behaviour of a small, insectivorous marsupial in response to the interacting risks of starvation and predation.</a></h2><p>Central to understanding animal ecology is how prey cope with the interacting risks of starvation and predation. This trade-off is modulated by the  requirements of prey, yet relatively few studies have incorporated physiological mechanisms for  savings when considering the behavioural response of prey to predation risk. In our study, we aimed to determine individual variation in behaviour, resting metabolism, body temperature and response to 24-h starvation within a captive population of fat-tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata; 15-g insectivorous marsupials), and then, using semi-outdoor enclosures, test whether foraging effort and thermal energetics are adjusted in response to manipulation of ground cover, which for small mammals can simulate predation risk. We found that, under the low cover (high predation risk) treatment, dunnarts consumed less food and employed a greater daily reduction in body temperature between their active and rest phase. This result supports the hypothesis that rest-phase thermoregulatory  savings are employed, even when food is available, if predation risk is perceived to increase the cost of foraging. Individuals exhibited correlated variation along two orthogonal axes incorporating the measured behavioural and metabolic variables, but these differences were not correlated with responses to starvation and predation risk. Our experiment demonstrates that flexibility in daily  requirements provided by heterothermy can have important consequences for how small mammals respond to both starvation and predation risks. Such challenges are amplified in degraded habitat with introduced predators, making the capacity for heterothermy an even more important mechanism for survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671603>Glucagon Regulation of  Expenditure.</a></h2><p>Glucagon's ability to increase  expenditure has been known for more than 60 years, yet the mechanisms underlining glucagon's thermogenic effect still remain largely elusive.

The medium of interest is concrete, but the approach also applies to other types of inhomogeneous media. The theoretical basis of the work is first presented through a one-dimensional point-scatterer model that considers the wavefield set up by multiple distinct scatterers. More complex scattering scenarios are then investigated using numerical simulation. The numerical models consider two types of scatterers: elliptic large-scale particles distributed throughout a medium, and small-sized cracks localized within a damage zone. The theoretical and numerical analyses show that forward propagating waves undergo distinct scattering behavior within the crack damaged zone: non-propagating resonance-like oscillatory fields are set up within the cracked zone, and are distinct from the scatter caused by the large-scale particles. Frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain analyses to extract the  of non-propagating oscillatory fields and thus to detect and locate zones of distributed cracking are employed. The proposed approach is evaluated using numerical simulation and experimental data collected from concrete specimens that contain simulated distributed cracks.

However, most of the photocatalysts suffer from low efficiencies mainly due to the poor charge separation property. Herein, taking a model semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN) as an example, we uncovered that photogenerated electrons and holes can be spatially separated to the nonpolar and polar surfaces of GaN nanorod arrays, which is presumably ascribed to the different surface band bending induced by the surface polarity. The photogenerated charge separation efficiency of GaN can be enhanced significantly from ~8% to more than 80% via co-exposing polar and nonpolar surfaces. Furthermore, spatially assembling of reduction and oxidation cocatalysts selectively on the nonpolar and polar surfaces remarkably boosts photocatalytic overall water splitting, with the quantum efficiency increased from 0.9% for the film photocatalyst to 6.9% for the nanorod arrays photocatalyst.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Results showed that subinhibitory concentration of PT (0.5 mg/ml) induced significant changes in MRSA at both transcriptional and metabolic levels, as 370 genes and 19 metabolites were differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the varying genes and metabolites were mainly involved in pathways of membrane transport, amino acids, carbohydrate, and  metabolism. The highlighted changes were those related to osmotic regulation, intracellular pH regulation, amino acid synthesis and metabolism, glycolysis, TCA cycle and iron metabolism, suggesting the multifaceted effects including cell membrane damage, amino acids limitation,  metabolism disorder and iron deprivation induced by PT.

The adsorption experiments were conducted under various initial Pb(II) concentrations ranging from 60 mg L to 100 mg L. The results suggested that the modified Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model was more applicable to the experimental data than the original Finite Bath Diffusion Control Model. The average value of the diffusion coefficient (λD¯) obtained from the modified finite bath diffusion control model was 1.63 × 10 cm s indicating the effective diffusivity in the adsorption of Pb(II) on MOMC-NP.

At higher doping levels above 5 wt% (~2.5 vol%), electrical tracking performance was improved. The AlN filler increased the tensile strength as well as the hardness of the composites, and decreased their flexibility. The hydrophobic properties of the composites were also studied through the measurements of temperature-dependent contact angle. It was shown that at a doping level of 1 wt%, a maximum contact angle was observed around 108°. Theoretical models were used to explain and understand the measurement results. Our results show that the AlN nanofillers are helpful in improving the overall performances of silicon rubber composite insulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672446>Predictive value of gastrointestinal hormones on weight loss.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery leads to profound and sustainable weight loss. Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in  and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

In this work, we reported a fluorescent probe, namely, BDP-Zn2+ for the discrimination of four kinds of surfactants and the determination of CMC values. BDP-Zn2+ was composed of covalently linked BODIPY, carbazole, N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (BPEA) and zinc ions to fabricate a novel push-pull molecular structure. Upon the addition of surfactants, the probe exhibited a turn-on fluorescence response and the emission was enhanced on increasing the surfactant concentrations. This indicated that the fluorescence intensity and the ratios of the emission at 607 nm to that at 514 nm as fingerprints could be used to identify the CMC values of the surfactants. Our current work provides an alternative method to efficiently discriminate different surfactants for the further studies of their physical and chemical functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673981>Sports Sponsorship as a Cause of Obesity.</a></h2><p>This article investigates the role of food and beverage sponsorship of sports in influencing dietary behaviour, and ultimately obesity, focusing on research published in the past 5 years. A systematic strategy was used to search the health science, social science and marketing databases to identify peer-reviewed literature on food and non-alcoholic beverage company sponsorship of sport published in English from 2015 to 2019.Sixteen discrete studies were identified: six content analyses, two qualitative studies, four cross-sectional surveys and four experimental studies. Findings indicate sports sponsorship is widely used to promote unhealthy foods through professional and community sport, prompting increased awareness and preference for sponsor products. Most studies assessed self-reported responses to sponsorship, with a lack of behavioural data on food purchasing and consumption. Sports sponsorship by unhealthy food brands achieves vast population reach and exposure, promoting increased brand awareness and preference for sponsor products. Research is needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between food and beverage sponsorship and  intake. Research evaluating the efficacy of strategies to reduce spectator's exposure to unhealthy sports sponsorship is also needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673771>Prevalence of inadequate intake of folate after mandatory fortification: results from the first National Dietary Survey in Brazil.</a></h2><p>Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of folate inadequacy (POFI) according to life stage, socio-economic status, and geographical regions after the mandatory fortification of wheat and maize flour in Brazil.This was a population-based study. Data from two non-consecutive food records from the National Dietary Survey/Household Budget Survey 2008-2009 were used to estimate the usual dietary folate intake in µg dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The National Cancer Institute method was used to account for within-person variance and the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-point method was used to calculate the POFI. The survey included 32,749 individuals, 15,700 males and 17,049 females, over 10 years old. Pregnant women, lactating women, and individuals with unreliable  intake data were excluded.Overall POFI was 31.5% and mean dietary folate intake was 411.1 µg DFE. The lowest POFI occurred in the youngest age group of 10-13 years in both sexes, while the highest POFI was observed in the group ≥ 71 years. In women of childbearing age, POFI was around 32%. The lowest income strata had the highest POFI. The most developed regions (South and Southeast) had the lowest POFI compared to less developed regions.Our data show that folate inadequacy is still prevalent in Brazil mainly in low-income groups and less developed regions. Actions need to be taken to ensure that women of childbearing age, who presented a high prevalence of inadequate folate intake, achieve the recommended daily intake of 400 µg DFEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670318>Layered HTiO/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets as a novel cathode for rechargeable magnesium batteries.</a></h2><p>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are promising devices for  storage owing to their high volumetric  density and high safety, but they still suffer from the lack of suitable cathodes.

The computational circuits are implemented on a reconfigurable and programmable signal-processing platform, namely field-programmable analog array (FPAA). The design leverages the core enabling technology of FPAA, namely floating-gate CMOS devices, and an on-chip low-power microcontroller to achieve -efficiency while not compromising accuracy. The custom physical-computation-electronics operating in CMOS subthreshold region, performs low-level (i.e., physiologically-relevant feature extraction) and high-level (i.e., detecting arrhythmia) signal processing in an -efficient manner. The on-chip microcontroller is used (1) in the programming mode for controlling the charge storage at the analog-memory elements to introduce patient-dependency into the system and (2) in the run mode to quantify the vital signs. The system has been validated against digital computation results from MATLAB using datasets collected from three healthy subjects and datasets from the MIT/BIH open source database. Based on all recordings in the MIT/BIH database, ECG R-peak detection sensitivity is 94.2%. The processor detects arrhythmia in three MIT/BIH recordings with an average sensitivity of 96.2%.

In a first step, both previous parameters were estimated under 1.52 bar and various acoustic frequencies ranging from 20 to 1000 kHz in function of normalized time. The results showed that the average number density of bubbles, varying within the interval 2.810-1.4 × 10 bubbles dm, follows a clear monotonous evolving trend as the frequency increases, while the average void fraction, comprised between 9.05 × 10 and 1.95 × 10, demonstrates no dependency of acoustic conditions. In a second step, an  analysis was performed at microscopic and macroscopic scales, which led the authors to figure out that the evolution of the number density of bubbles in function of acoustic frequency is mainly governed by the  required to maintain oscillating the single cavitation bubble.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671638>Evidence for Adaptive Selection in the Mitogenome of a Mesoparasitic Monogenean Flatworm .</a></h2><p>Whereas a majority of monogenean flatworms are ectoparasitic, i.e., parasitize on external surfaces (mainly gills) of their fish hosts,  species (subfamily Ancyrocephalinae) are mesoparasitic, i.e., parasitize in the stomach of the host. As there are numerous drastic differences between these two environments (including lower oxygen availability), we hypothesized that this life-history innovation might have produced adaptive pressures on the  metabolism, which is partially encoded by the mitochondrial genome (OXPHOS). To test this hypothesis, we sequenced mitochondrial genomes of two Ancyrocephalinae species: mesoparasitic  and ectoparasitic . The mitogenomic architecture of  is mostly standard for monogeneans, but that of  exhibits some unique features: missing  gene, very low AT content (60%), a non-canonical start codon of the  gene, and exceptionally long tandem-repeats in the non-coding region (253 bp). Phylogenetic analyses produced paraphyletic Ancyrocephalinae (with embedded Dactylogyrinae), but with low support values. Selective pressure (PAML and HYPHY) and protein structure analyses all found evidence for adaptive evolution in  and  genes of the mesoparasitic . These findings tentatively support our hypothesis of adaptive evolution driven by life-history innovations in the mitogenome of this species. However, as only one stomach-inhabiting mesoparasitic monogenean was available for this analysis, our findings should be corroborated on a larger number of mesoparasitic monogeneans and by physiological studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673007>Effect of shell structure of Ti-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography core-shell magnetic particles for phosphopeptide enrichment.</a></h2><p>Magnetic materials in sample preparation for shotgun phosphoproteomics offer several advantages over conventional systems, as the enrichment can be achieved directly in solution, but they still suffer from some drawbacks, due to limited stability and selectivity, which is supposed to be affected by the hydrophilicity of the polymeric supports used for cation immobilization. The paper describes the development of an improved magnetic material with increased stability, thanks to a two-step covering of the magnetic core, for the enrichment of phosphopeptides in biological samples. Four materials were prepared featuring a polymeric shell with tunable hydrophilicity, obtained by "grafting from" polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate with 0-8.3% of polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGMA), the latter used to modulate the hydrophilicity of the material surface. Finally, the materials were functionalized with iminodiacetic acid for Ti ion immobilization. The materials were analyzed for their composition by a combination of CHN elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, also hyphenated to gas chromatography and mass spectrometric detection. Surface characteristics were evaluated by water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive X-ray spectrometry. These materials were applied to the enrichment of phosphopeptides from yeast protein digests. Peptides were identified by proteomics techniques using nano-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Qualitatively the peptides identified by the four systems were comparable, with 1606-1693 phosphopeptide identifications and a selectivity of 47-54% for all materials. The physico-chemical features of the identified peptides were also the same for the four materials. In particular, the grand average of hydropathy index values indicated that the enriched phosphopeptides were hydrophilic (ca. 90%), and only some co-enriched non-phosphorylated peptides were hydrophobic (21-28%), regardless of the material used for enrichment. Peptides had a pI ≤ 7, which indicated a well-known bias for acidic peptides binding, attributed to the interaction with the metal center itself. The results indicated that the enrichment of phosphopeptides and the co-enrichment of non-phosphorylated peptides is mainly driven by interactions with Ti and does not depend on the amount of PEGMA chains in the polymer shell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670283>Adrenergic receptor beta-3 rs4994 (T>C) and liver X receptor alpha rs12221497 (G>A) polymorphism in Pakistanis with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to determine the association of adrenergic receptor beta-3 (ADRB3) rs4994 T>C and liver X receptor alpha (LXR-α) rs12221497 G>A polymorphism with metabolic syndrome (Met S) and the related traits in Pakistanis. Patients of Met S were recruited from the Endocrinology and Diabetic Clinic of Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, over the time span of 6 months from July to December 2016. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADRB3 was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and of LXR-α by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of TT variant of ADRB3 T>C in Met S was 69 (34.5%) and in controls 89 (44.5%), frequency of TC 103 (51.5%) and 96 (48%), and of CC 28 (14%) and 15 (7.5%), respectively. In the recessive model (CC: TT + TC), CC genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.027; odds ratio [OR] = 2.09; confidence interval [CI] =1.08-4.03) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex. The frequency of GG variant of LXR-α G>A in Met S was 35 (17.5%) and in controls 15 (7.5%), GA 129 (64.5%) and 137 (68.5%), and AA 36 (18%) and 48 (24%), respectively. In the recessive model (GG: GA + AA), GG genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.004; OR = 2.52; CI = 1.33-4.80) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex.

Here, the competition between 2D van der Waals (VDW) silica and 2D Ni silicate phases on NixPd1-x(111) alloy substrates was systematically investigated experimentally as a function of Si surface coverage, annealing time and temperature, O2 partial pressure, and substrate composition and the results were compared with thermodynamic predictions based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermochemical data for O2. Experimentally, 2D Ni silicate was exclusively observed at higher O2 pressures (∼10-6 Torr), higher annealing temperatures (1000 K), and more prolonged annealing (10 min) if the substrate contained any Ni and for initial Si coverages up to 2 monolayers. In contrast, decreasing the O2 pressure to ∼10-8 Torr and restricting the annealing temperature and time enabled 2D VDW silica formation. Amorphous 2D VDW silica was observed even when the substrate composition was tuned to lattice match crystalline 2D VDW silica. The trend of decreased O2 pressure favoring 2D VDW silica was consistent with the theoretical predictions; however, theory also suggested that sufficient Si coverage could avoid Ni silicate formation. The effect of epitaxial strain on 2D Ni silicate was investigated by modifying the solid solution alloy substrate composition. It was found that 2D Ni silicate will stretch to match the substrate lattice constant up to 1.12% tensile strain. When the lattice mismatch was over 1.40%, incommensurate crystalline domains were observed, indicating relaxation of the overlayer to its favored lattice constant. The limited epitaxial strain that could be applied was attributed to a combination of the 2D silicate stiffness, the insensitivity of its bonding to the substrate to its alignment with the substrate, and its lack of accessible structural rearrangements that can reduce the strain . The results demonstrate how the resulting 2D material can be manipulated through the growth conditions and how a solid solution alloy substrate can be used to maximize the epitaxial strain imparted to the 2D system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672899>Reversible epitaxial electrodeposition of metals in battery anodes.</a></h2><p>The propensity of metals to form irregular and nonplanar electrodeposits at liquid-solid interfaces has emerged as a fundamental barrier to high-, rechargeable batteries that use metal anodes. We report an epitaxial mechanism to regulate nucleation, growth, and reversibility of metal anodes. The crystallographic, surface texturing, and electrochemical criteria for reversible epitaxial electrodeposition of metals are defined and their effectiveness demonstrated by using zinc (Zn), a safe, low-cost, and -dense battery anode material. Graphene, with a low lattice mismatch for Zn, is shown to be effective in driving deposition of Zn with a locked crystallographic orientation relation. The resultant epitaxial Zn anodes achieve exceptional reversibility over thousands of cycles at moderate and high rates.

The dynamical properties in the non-interacting regime are studied using an exact numerical approach whereas the steady state properties are obtained following the well-known non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. By means of mutual information and concurrence we explore the connection between the quantum correlations in the system and the current flowing through the dots. It is observed that entanglement between the dots is heavily influenced by the degeneracy or the lack thereof, of the dot levels. In the non-degenerate case, the concurrence falls sharply when the applied bias crosses a certain critical value. In contrast when the dot  levels are degenerate, the concurrence reaches a very high asymptotic value of $1/2$. When interactions are switched on, the degeneracy is lifted, and once again concurrence falls to zero beyond a critical value of the applied bias. Lastly it is observed that the concurrence can be made to reach almost the value of $1.0$ if the chemical potential in both baths are made very large (while keeping the sign the same) provided the dot levels are kept degenerate within the non-interacting limit. A combination of NEGF method, brute-force numerics and asymptotics are employed to corroborate our findings.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671360>Inter-correlated gut microbiota and SCFAs changes upon antibiotics exposure links with rapid body-mass gain in weaned piglet model.</a></h2><p>The risk of overweight or obesity in association with early exposure of antibiotics remains an important public issue for health-care of children. Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and  utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and , enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The ERK-1/2 inhibitors are thus considered as potential agents for cancer therapy. Multitarget quantitative structure-activity relationship (mt-QSAR) models based on the Box-Jenkins approach were developed with a dataset containing 6400 ERK inhibitors assayed under different experimental conditions. The first mt-QSAR linear model was built with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and provided information regarding the structural requirements for better activity. This linear model was also utilised for a fragment analysis to estimate the contributions of ring fragments towards ERK inhibition. Then, the random forest (RF) technique was employed to produce highly predictive non-linear mt-QSAR models, which were used for screening the Asinex kinase library and identify the most potential virtual hits. The fragment analysis results justified the selection of the hits retrieved through such virtual screening. The latter were subsequently subjected to molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to understand their possible interactions with ERK enzymes. The present work, which utilises in-silico techniques such as multitarget chemometric modelling, fragment analysis, virtual screening, molecular docking and dynamics, may provide important guidelines to facilitate the discovery of novel ERK inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670269>Nutrition rehabilitation of children with severe acute malnutrition: Revisiting studies undertaken by the National Institute of Nutrition.</a></h2><p>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children under five years is an important public health problem due to associated high mortality and long-term health consequences. Research on the dietary causes of SAM, especially the role and relative importance of dietary protein, in the aetiology of oedematous malnutrition, has led to considerable debates and controversies. The present article revisits some of the debates in this field, where the researchers at the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India, with their pioneering work, have contributed to the global literature on the various facets of the disease. Highlighting the importance of  as a bigger problem than protein malnutrition is a noteworthy contribution of NIN's research. It is, however, important to examine the protein quality of the diets in light of the new information on the lysine requirements. The article argues that the currently dominating hypothesis of free radical theory requires a critical review of the supporting evidence. Over the past few decades, the research has focused on low-cost diets using locally available foods. The article also argues that solutions based on local foods, being acceptable and sustainable, need to be strengthened for their effective delivery through the existing nutrition programmes. Recent evidence shows that the use of ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) with high micronutrient density may be linked with higher mortality possibly due to the high iron content, which could be counterproductive. There are several unaddressed concerns regarding the potential long-term impact of consumption of RUTF in children with SAM.

Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and  production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019.

Herein, a Co(ii) ion-driven self-assembly strategy is described for the synthesis of cobalt-based nanostructured transition metal compounds (Co-NTMCs) embedded in nitrogen and sulfur codoped hierarchical porous carbon submicrospheres (Co-NTMCs@NSC), where condensation of thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (TEFR) is induced by Co(ii) ions which is simultaneously assembled with polydopamine to form a multifunctional precursor through coordinated interaction. The resulting Co-NTMCs@NSC sample comprises abundant hierarchical porous textures, a high content of active cobalt species including the nanoparticles of Co, Co3O4 and amorphous CoSx, and a considerable amount of defective structures. These characteristics lead to remarkable oxygen electrocatalytic activities, with a half-wave potential of +0.833 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a lower overpotential of 284 mV than RuO2 at 10 mA·cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, its operational stability is also much higher than that of commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. When used as a breathing air electrode for Zn-air batteries, Co-NTMCs@NSC shows a higher open-circuit voltage (1.509 V), higher discharge power density (262 mW cm-2) and better charge-discharge reversibility than commercial Pt/C. The results from the present work suggest that controlled assembly of functional polymers may be exploited for the preparation of doped carbon/metal nanoparticle nanocomposites as viable, high-performance catalysts for electrochemical  technologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670733>The mechanism of monochloramine disproportionation under acidic conditions.</a></h2><p>Monochloramine is a widely employed agent in water treatment technologies. However, its utilization has some drawbacks like the transformation of the active species into the undesired dichloramine. Although it is more pronounced in acidic solutions, the features of this reaction have still remained largely unexplored in the pH < 4 region. In this study the decomposition of monochloramine is examined under such conditions by using kinetic and computational methods. Fast kinetics measurements have convincingly showed that the disproportion into dicloramine is relatively fast and can be studied without any interference from side reactions. By varying the pH, the deprotonation constant of monochloramine has been determined by UV spectroscopy (Ka = 0.023 ± 0.005 M for I = 1.0 M NaClO4, and T = 25.0 °C). Dichloramine formation via monochloramine disproportion was found to follow second-order kinetics. The computations have provided the reaction mechanism and its free  profile in accord with the proposed kinetic model. This involves the reaction between the protonated and unprotonated forms of monochloramine, with a rate constant k = 335.3 ± 11.8 M-1 s-1, corresponding to an activation free  barrier of 14.1 kcal mol-1. The simulations predicted a barrier of 14.9 kcal mol-1 and revealed a key short-lived chlorine-bridged intermediate which yields dichloroamine and ammonium ion through a deprotonation-coupled chlorine shift.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673574>X-ray tomography data of White Etching Cracks (WEC).</a></h2><p>This data article contains lab-based micro-computed tomography (μCT) data of cracks and crack networks in 4 different bearings, mainly from wind turbines, which formed the basis for the crack analysis reported in Danielsen et al.

Fly ash always contains high levels of arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) due to the preconcentration of these two elements during coal combustion process. It would be much concerned to screen their fractions and potential environmental behaviors in fly ash for beneficial use and treatment. Fast and practical methods for this purpose are urgently needed. Two fast and effective microwave-assisted sequential extraction schemes (MASE) were developed for fast screening As and Se fractions in fly ash for the first time. The extraction parameters including microwave irradiation time, temperature and power  were optimized by comparing the results from MASE and the conventional scheme (Wenzel method). The results indicate that the extraction efficiency of As and Se in various fractions can be significantly accelerated by microwave irradiation. The whole procedure operation time can be significantly reduced from 24.5 h to 44 min by microwave assistance compared with the conventional shaking schemes. The recoveries of As and Se in the various extracted fractions were all above 80% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 8%. The developed methods were further confirmed by the validation of the certified reference material GBW08401 and fly ash samples from six power plants. The developed MASE methods are practical and effective for fast screening arsenic and selenium fractions in fly ash samples.Copyright © 2019.

We propose an improved method to straightforwardly derive the surface  of porous membrane from contact angles with the interference effect corrected. A linearized model was established combining the Young-Dupré and Cassie-Baxter equations, from which the surface  (Lifshitz-van der Waals and Lewis acid/base components) and roughness index (surface area difference) can be solved simultaneously at a given porosity using contact angles measured with a set of standard polar/nonpolar test liquids. The model solution was examined using hydrophilic microfiltration membranes with different pore morphologies (including perforated plate-like PCTE, irregular particulate bed-like PVDF and fibrous mesh-like PTFE membranes), with the robustness of the results evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation. In comparison with the verified results of the model solution, it was found that the Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis acid and base  values for the tested membranes would deviate by 50-87%, 30-160% and 52-97% respectively if surface roughness and porosity were neglected in the calculation.

To reveal the buckling (global and local) and post-buckling behavior of different lattice morphologies, both experimental and simulation-based studies were carried out. Additionally, a variable-density lattice structure was designed and analyzed to achieve the optimal value of critical buckling load. Latticed columns were fabricated using polyamide 12 material on multi jet fusion 3D printer. The results exhibited that the buckling in lattice columns depends on the distribution of mass, second moment of inertia I, diameter and position of vertical beams, number of horizontal or inclined beams, and location and angle of the beams that support the vertical beams. The number of horizontal and inclined beams and their thickness has an inverse relation with buckling; however, this trend changes after approaching a critical point. It is revealed that vertical beams are more crucial for buckling case, when compared with horizontal or inclined beams; however, material distribution in inclined or horizontal orientation is also critical because they provide support to vertical beams to behave as a single body to bear the buckling load. The results also revealed that the critical buckling load could be increased by designing variable density cellular columns in which the beams at the outer edges of the column are thicker compared with inner beams. However, post-buckling behavior of variable density structures is brittle and local when compared with uniform density lattice structures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670322>Self-assembly of magnetically-functionalized molecular motors and microtubules into active gels.</a></h2><p>The diversity of functions achieved by living cells result from the collective behavior of biological components that interact through multiple scales in time and space. The cytoskeleton constitutes one canonical system forming dynamic organizations when interacting with molecular motors. These materials constitute a state of active matter that exhibit out-of-equilibrium behavior with oriented order in the presence of . However, such active materials are highly dependent on the intrinsic properties of their constituents (fibers, molecular motors, and ), which makes it difficult to control their behavior. Being able to manipulate directly the constitutive elements of the active gel could provide additional control parameters. Here, we report a strategy to functionalize and manipulate active microtubule-based structures upon magnetic actuation. We engineered protein nanocage ferritins as magnetic labels targeting molecular motors (Eg5 kinesin motors). We first mixed these magnetic motors with individual microtubules, allowing for their manipulation. In order to generate a magnetic-responsive gel, we then mixed the magnetic motors with active microtubule-based structures and characterized their dynamic behavior. We found that the magnetic forces applied on magnetic motors slowed down the dynamics of the microtubule structures as well as constrained their rotation. Our results highlight how genetically encoded magnetic elements, behaving as magnetic actuators, could perturb active gels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672723>Slowing down the metabolic engine: impact of early-life corticosterone exposure on adult metabolism in house sparrows ().</a></h2><p>Whole organism metabolism is an integrative process that determines not only the  cost of living but also the  output that is available for behavioral and physiological processes during the life cycle. Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or immunity), which may altogether affect adult metabolism. All these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult metabolism has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on RMR (resting metabolic rate, measured in thermoneutrality, 25°C) and TMR (thermoregulatory metabolic rate, measured in cold challenging condition, 5°C) in the House sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood when their metabolism was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of metabolism was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an -saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.© 2019.

Functional studies showed that the patient's cells have no detectable AK2 protein, as well as low oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and proton production rate (PPR). An increased production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and mitochondrial mass, and decreased ATP production, were also observed.

Nanostructured materials can act as electron  filters by funneling thermally broadened electrons through discrete  levels. In this study, we develop a theoretical model of the electron filtering properties of nanostructured materials that explicitly includes the effects of thermal broadening and size heterogeneity on the heterogeneity of nanostructure  levels. We find that under certain conditions quantum dot solids can perform as effective electronic  filters. We identify a material specific length scale parameter, $L_\mathrm{crit}$, that specifies the maximum mean quantum dot size that can yield effective  filtering. Moreover, we show that  filtering materials comprised of QDs with size near $L_\mathrm{crit}$ are maximally robust to heterogeneity in quantum dot size, tolerating variations $\sim 10 \%$ of the mean size. The length scale $L_\mathrm{crit}$ can be estimated directly from the widely-tabulated density of states effective mass and show that semiconductors with light conduction band electrons, such as III-V type materials InSb and GaAs are the most forgiving for  filtering applications.

Low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) are classified as slow-adapting (SA) or rapid-adapting (RA) based on whether or not they spike repetitively during sustained tactile stimulation; the former are subclassified as type 1 or 2 based on the regularity of their spiking. Recording  from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mice, we observed irregular- and regular-spiking units consistent with SA1 and SA2 LTMRs, but some units, which we labeled "semi-regular", did not fit cleanly into the existing classification scheme. Analysis of their spiking revealed integer-multiple patterning - spike trains comprised a fundamental interspike interval and multiples thereof. Integer-multiple-patterned spiking was reproduced by randomly removing spikes from an otherwise regular spike train, suggesting that semi-regular units represent SA2 units in which some spikes are "missing". We hypothesized that missing spikes arose from intermittent failure of spikes to initiate or to propagate. Intermittent failure of spike initiation was ruled out by several observations: integer-multiple-patterned spiking was not induced by intradermal lidocaine, was independent of stimulus modality (mechanical vs. optogenetic), and could not be reproduced in a conductance-based model neuron given constant input. On the other hand, integer-multiple-patterned spiking was induced by application of lidocaine to the DRG, thus pinpointing intermittent failure of spike propagation as the basis for integer-multiple-patterned spiking. In fact, half of all SA2 units exhibited some missing spikes, mostly at low rate (<5%), which suggests that axons are efficient in using the lowest safety factor capable of producing near-perfect propagation reliability.The impedance mismatch at axon branch points can impede spike propagation. Reliability of spike propagation across branch points remains an open question, and is especially important for primary afferents whose spikes must cross a T-junction in order to reach the CNS. Past research on propagation reliability has relied almost entirely on simulations and  experiments. Here, recording , we linked a distinctive pattern of spiking to the intermittent failure of spike propagation at the T-junction. The rarity of failures argues that safety factor is high under physiological conditions, yet the occurrence of such failures argues that safety factor is  high enough to ensure -perfect reliability, consistent with a good balance between propagation reliability and  efficiency.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670620>An overview of prospective drugs for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>This study provided an overview of several emerging anti-diabetic molecules.Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder involving dysregulation of glucose homeostasis at various levels.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency,  deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

In northwestern Iberia, D. acuminata has a long growing season, from spring to early autumn, and populations develop as soon as shallow stratification forms when the upwelling season begins. In contrast, D. acuta blooms in late summer, when the depth of the pycnocline is maximal and upwelling pulses are moderate. In situ observations on the hydrodynamic regimes during the two windows of opportunity for Dinophysis species led us to hypothesize that D. acuta should be more sensitive to turbulence than D. acuminata. To test this hypothesis, we studied the response of D. acuminata and D. acuta to three realistic turbulence levels low (LT), ε ≈ 10 m s; medium (MT), ε ≈ 10  m s and high (HT), ε ≈ 10 m sgenerated by Turbogen, a highly reproducible, computer-controlled system. Cells of both species exposed to LT and MT grew at rates similar to the controls. Marked differences were found in the response to HT: D. acuminata grew slowly after an initial lag phase, whereas D. acuta cell numbers declined. Results from this study support the hypothesis that turbulence may play a role in shaping the spatio-temporal distribution of individual species of Dinophysis. We also hypothesize that, in addition to cell disturbance affecting division, sustained high shear generated by microturbulence may cause a decline in Dinophysis numbers due to decreased densities of ciliate prey.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The biorefinery concept applied to seaweed facilitates the extraction of different constituents ensuring full utilization of resources and generating few residues through a succession of steps. Seaweed biorefineries are less advanced than those based on terrestrial biomass and the design of efficient processes requires further study.

Therefore, autophagy represents a pro-survival stress response in the majority of cases. However, the role of autophagy in cell survival and cell death decisions is highly dependent on its extent, duration, and on the respective cellular context. An alternative pro-death function of autophagy has been consistently observed in different settings, in particular, in developmental cell death of lower organisms and in drug-induced cancer cell death. This cell death is referred to as autophagic cell death (ACD) or autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD), a type of cellular demise that may act as a backup cell death program in apoptosis-deficient tumors. This pro-death function of autophagy may be exerted either via non-selective bulk autophagy or excessive (lethal) removal of mitochondria via selective mitophagy, opening new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of autophagy/mitophagy in cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671845>Dietary Supplementation with the Red Seaweed  Protects against DNA Damage and Pre-Malignant Dysplastic Skin Lesions in HPV-Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>Some diet profiles are associated with the risk of developing cancer; however, some nutrients show protective effects.  is widely consumed, having a balanced nutritional profile; however, its potential for cancer chemoprevention still needs comprehensive studies.

We are investigating a hydrocarbon pathway from mixed sugars via 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural intermediates. To achieve this goal, we must first convert glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural in favorable yields. Current processes to produce HMF/furfural generally involve the use of acid catalysts in biphasic systems or solvents such as ionic liquids. However, the yield from transforming glucose to HMF is lower than the yield of furfural from xylose.In this study, we present an efficient chemical pathway simultaneously transforming glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural via ketose intermediates, i.e., fructose and xylulose, which were generated from glucose and xylose via enzymatic isomerization. In the enzymatic isomerization, by adding sodium borate to complex with the ketoses, xylose conversion reached equilibrium after 2 h with a conversion of 91% and glucose conversion reached 84% after 4 h. By enzymatically isomerizing the aldoses to ketoses, the following dehydration reactions to HMF and furfural could be performed at low process temperatures (i.e., 110-120 °C) minimizing the side reactions of the sugars and limiting the degradation of furfurals to humins and carboxylic acids. At 120 °C, pH 0.5, and 15 min reaction time, mixed ketose sugars were converted to HMF and furfural in yields of 77% and 96%, respectively (based on starting aldose concentrations).Taken together, our results demonstrate that this combined biological and chemical process could be an effective pathway to simultaneously convert biomass-derived glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural, for use as intermediates in the production of hydrocarbons.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h2><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670970>Side Chain Optimization Remarkably Enhances the In Vivo Stability of 18F-Labeled Glutamine for Tumor Imaging.</a></h2><p>Similar to glycolysis, glutaminolysis acts as a vital  source in tumor cells, providing building blocks for the metabolic needs of tumor cells. To capture glutaminolysis in tumors, 18F-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine ([18F]FGln) and 18F-fluoroboronoglutamine ([18F]FBQ) have been successfully developed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, but these two molecules are lack of stability, resulting in undesired yet significant bone uptake. In this study, we found that [18F]FBQ-C2 is a stable Gln PET tracer by adding two more methylene groups to the side chain of [18F]FBQ. [18F]FBQ-C2 was synthesized with a good radiochemical yield (RCY) of 35% and over 98% radiochemical purity. [18F]FBQ-C2 showed extreme stability in vitro, and no defluorination was observed after 2 hours in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C. The competitive inhibition assay results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 enters cells via system ASC and N, similar to natural glutamine, and can be transported by tumor-overexpressed ASCT2. PET imaging and biodistribution results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 is stable in vivo with low bone uptake (0.81±0.20%ID/g) and can be cleared rapidly from most tissues. Dynamic scan and pharmacokinetic studies using BGC823-xenograft-bearing mice revealed that [18F]FBQ-C2 accumulates specifically in tumors, with a longer half-life (101.18±6.50 min) in tumor tissues than in other tissues (52.70±12.44 min in muscle). Biodistribution exhibits a high tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (4.8±1.7 for muscle, 2.5±1.0 for the stomach, 2.2±0.9 for the liver and 17.8±8.4 for the brain).

The WO/BiOBr heterojunction exhibits superior photocatalytic activity and photostability compared with pure BiOBr and WO due to an increased oxygen vacancy concentration, an effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and an efficient interfacial charge transfer. Additionally, the WO/BiOBr also shows 2.3 and 41.1 times higher activity than that of TiO P25 and BiVO Alfa Aesar, respectively. Determination of  band line-up indicates that the WO/BiOBr is a type II-heterojunction where electron-hole pairs are efficiently separated. Mechanistic studies based on radical quenching experiment, EPR trapping study and Hammett plot reveal that the main reaction pathway is the electron transfer route mediated by superoxide radical. A possible surface reaction mechanism, the insightful information on the structure-activity relationship and the involvement of reactive oxygen species elucidated in this work lay an important background for the material design and encourage a further development of highly efficient photocatalysts toward organic fine chemical syntheses.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, its practical application is still seriously limited by the modest cycling and rate performances. Herein, we first report a facile design to scalably synthesize the unique one-dimensional (1D) mesoporous ZnMnO 3 nanorods (ZMO-NRs) composed of nanoscale particles (~11 nm).

Yet, under less influencing experimental conditions this molecule might undergo an automerization reaction between its two degenerate geometries via a cumulenic (non-alternating, adjacent double bonds) D18h transition state. Herein we discuss the role of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in this degenerate reaction. Our computations predict that at the experimental temperature (5 K) the reaction in gas phase is completely driven by an extremely rapid heavy atom tunneling (k = 2.1 × 108 s-1). Even when approaching room temperature, the QMT rate is still an order of magnitude faster than the semi-classical one. We propose an experimental test to support our prediction, by measuring a characteristic tunneling  splitting within the radio wave region. Additionally, we examine the role of QMT in other hypothetical C4n+2 carbon clusters.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, butterfly individuals representing the various generations of the same species but differing in body size were not investigated in this respect. Similarly, the question whether different scale size may influence structural color generation based on nanoarchitectures in the scale lumen was never addressed. Populations of lowland (environment of Budapest, Hungary) and upland (Carpathian Mountains, Romania) Polyommatus dorylas were compared in terms of voltinism, wing and scale size, and the structural origin of blue coloration. Data analysis showed that the univoltine upland population exhibits a larger wing and scale size. On the other hand, the nanomorphology of the blue color-generating scales was identical when compared between univoltine and bivoltine populations. Coloration was also identical when measured with a spectrophotometer under ultraviolet and visible light. This high accuracy present in the male structural coloration suggests that it is controlled genetically. Body size alteration for enhanced thermal fitness has no influence on the fine structure of the nanoarchitecture present in the scale lumen.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

While great strides have been made in EM data collection and data processing, sample preparation is still performed using decades-old techniques. Those sample preparation methods rely on extensive macroscale purification and concentration to achieve homogeneity suitable for high-resolution analyses. Noting that relatively few bioparticles are needed to generate high-quality protein structures, this work uses microfluidics that can accurately and precisely manipulate and deliver bioparticles to grids for imaging. The use of microfluidics enables isolation, purification, and concentration of specific target proteins at these small scales and does so in a relatively short period of time (minutes). These capabilities enable imaging of more dilute solutions and obtaining pure protein images from mixtures. In this system, spatially isolated, purified, and concentrated proteins are transferred directly onto electron microscopy grids for imaging. The processing enables imaging of more dilute solutions, as low as 5 × 10 g/ml, with small total amounts of protein (<400 pg, 900 amol).

Use of ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase containing plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) in conferring heat resistance in plants and the role of PGPB, in altering net carbon assimilation, constitutive and stress volatile emissions has not been studied yet. We exposed leaves of Eucalyptus grandis inoculated and non-inoculated with PGPB Brevibacterium linens RS16 to two levels of heat stress (37 °C and 41 °C for 5 min) and quantified temporal changes in foliage photosynthetic characteristics and volatile emission rates at 0.5 h, day 1 and day 5 after the stress application. Heat stress resulted in immediate reductions in dark-adapted photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield (F/F), net assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g), and enhancement of stress volatile emissions, including enhanced emissions of green leaf volatiles (GLV), mono- and sesquiterpenes, light weight oxygenated volatile organic compounds (LOC), geranyl-geranyl diphosphate pathway volatiles (GGDP), saturated aldehydes, and benzenoids, with partial recovery by day 5. Changes in stress-induced volatiles were always less in leaves inoculated with B. linens RS16. However, net assimilation rate was enhanced by bacterial inoculation only in the 37 °C treatment and overall reduction of isoprene emissions was observed in bacterially-treated leaves. Principal component analysis (PCA), correlation analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) indicated that different stress applications influenced specific volatile organic compounds. In addition, changes in the expression analysis of heat shock protein 70 gene (DnaK) gene in B. linens RS16 upon exposure to higher temperatures further indicated that B. linens RS16 has developed its own heat resistance mechanism to survive under higher temperature regimes.

Herein, we found that the reaction of precursors containing both nitrogen and oxygen atoms with Ni(II) under 500°C can generate a N/O mixing coordinated Ni-N3O SAC, in which the oxygen atom can be gradually removed under high temperature due to weaker Ni-O interaction, resulting in a vacancy-defect Ni-N3-V SAC at Ni site under 800°C.

We studied the responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities, the soil's nutritional state and strawberry yield, when the soil was biofumigated each year for five consecutive years using fresh chicken manure (BioFum). BioFum significantly increased the soil's NH-N, NO-N, available P and K and organic matter. Fusarium spp. and Phytophthora spp. which are known to cause plant disease, were significantly decreased after BioFum. In addition, Biofum increased the soil's temperature, enhanced chlorophyll levels in the leaves of strawberry plants, and the soluble sugar and ascorbic acid content in strawberry fruit. We used high-throughput gene sequencing to monitor changes in the soil's bacterial and fungal communities. Although BioFum significantly decreased the diversity of these communities, it increased the relative abundance of some biological control agents in the phylum Actinobacteria and the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Chaetomium. An increase in these biological control agents would reduce the incidence of soil-borne pathogens and plant disease. Although strawberry marketable yield using BioFum was higher in the first three years, the decline in the final two years could be due to the accumulation of P and K which may have delayed flowering and fruiting. Methods to overcome yield losses using BioFum need to be developed in the future. Our research, however, showed that BioFum enhanced soil fertility, reduced the presence of soil pathogens, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and fungi and improved strawberry quality. Unlike chemical soil treatments that can cause pest and disease resistance when used continuously over many years, our multi-year research program on BioFum showed that this treatment provided significant benefits to the soil, plant and strawberry fruit.Copyright © 2019.

In the present work we make use of the framework provided by the density functional theory of chemical reactivity, to discuss in a unified way the approaches to the concept of electronegativity developed by Pauling and by Mulliken. Our analysis starts by making use of the identification of the electronegativity of Mulliken with the chemical potential of density functional theory, and continues to show that the ionic correction proposed by Pauling can be derived, with certain approximations, from the quadratic smooth interpolation of the  as a function of the number of electrons in terms of the chemical potentials and the hardnesses of the interacting species, from which, one can infer the close qualitative relationship between Pauling's electronegativity and the electrophilicity concept.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671869>Preclinical Evaluation of UDCA-Containing Oral Formulation in Mice for the Treatment of Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration.</a></h2><p>As a posterior ocular disease, wet age-related macular degeneration (WAMD) has been known to be related to vision loss, accompanying ocular complications. The intravitreous injection of VEGF antibodies has been reported to be an effective treatment to relieve symptoms of WAMD. However, the limitations of this treatment are high costs and invasiveness. For this reason, oral delivery route can be considered as a cost-effective way and the safest method to deliver drug molecules to the eyes. Accordingly, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was included in the oral formulation as the potential substance for the cure of WAMD in the animal model. Various pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects, have been reported for UDCA and recent reports support the effects of UDCA in ocular treatment. However, due to poor water solubility and low pKa (around 5.0), it has been challenging to formulate aqueous solution of UDCA in the neutral pH range. In the present study, we confirmed the aqueous solubility of the oral UDCA formulation and performed a preclinical study, including pharmacokinetic profiling and WAMD model efficacy study in mice after oral administration of the drug solution. The results demonstrated that the formulation improved bioavailability of UDCA and efficiently delivered UDCA to the eye tissues after oral absorption. UDCA formulation was found to have inhibitory effects of choroidal neovascularization with a functional recovery in mice retinas. Taken together, our results suggest that the oral UDCA formulation could be used as a potent supplement for the cure of WAMD and related retinal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672970>Reversing the charge transfer between platinum and sulfur-doped carbon support for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.</a></h2><p>Metal-support interaction is of great significance for catalysis as it can induce charge transfer between metal and support, tame electronic structure of supported metals, impact adsorption  of reaction intermediates, and eventually change the catalytic performance. Here, we report the metal size-dependent charge transfer reversal, that is, electrons transfer from platinum single atoms to sulfur-doped carbons and the carbon supports conversely donate electrons to Pt when their size is expanded to ~1.5 nm cluster. The electron-enriched Pt nanoclusters are far more active than electron-deficient Pt single atoms for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction, exhibiting only 11 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm and a high mass activity of 26.1 A mg at 20 mV, which is 38 times greater than that of commercial Pt/C. Our work manifests that the manipulation of metal size-dependent charge transfer between metal and support opens new avenues for developing high-active catalysts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673305>Investigation of Hot Spot Region in XIAP Inhibitor Binding Site by Fragment Molecular Orbital Method.</a></h2><p>X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an important regulator of cancer cell survival whose BIR3 domain (XIAP-BIR3) recognizes the Smac N-terminal tetrapeptide sequence (AVPI), making it an attractive protein-protein interaction (PPI) target for cancer therapies. We used the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method to study the binding modes and affinities between XIAP-BIR3 and a series of its inhibitors (- that mimic the AVPI binding motif; the inhibitors had common interactions with key residues in a hot spot region of XIAP-BIR3 (P1-P4 subpockets) with increased binding affinity mainly attributed to specific interactions with the P1 and P4 subpockets. Based on the structural information from FMO results, we proposed a novel XIAP natural product inhibitor, neoeriocitrin , which was derived from our preciously reported XIAP-BIR3 inhibitor , can be used as a highly potent candidate for XIAP-BIR3 inhibition. We also performed pair interaction  decomposition analysis to investigate the binding energies between specific binding residues and individual ligands, showing that the novel natural product neoeriocitrin  had a higher binding affinity than epicatechin gallate . Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were performed to explore the mode of binding between  and XIAP-BIR3, demonstrating that  binds more strongly to the P1 and P4 pockets than . Overall, we present a novel natural product, neoeriocitrin , and demonstrate that the FMO method can be used to identify hot spots in PPIs and design new compounds for XIAP inhibition.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671260>Distinct Nanoscale Interphases and Morphology of Lithium Metal Electrodes Operating at Low Temperatures.</a></h2><p>While Li-ion batteries are known to fail at temperatures below -20 °C, very little is known regarding the low-temperature behavior of next-generation high-capacity electrode materials. The lithium metal anode is of particular interest for high- battery chemistries, but improved understanding of and control over its electrochemical and nanoscale interfacial behavior in diverse conditions is necessary. Here, we investigate lithium deposition/stripping, morphology evolution, and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and properties down to -80 °C using an ether-based electrolyte (DOL/DME). As temperature is reduced, we find that the morphology of deposited lithium is significantly altered. Furthermore, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy coupled with vacuum transfer x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the SEI exhibits different structure, chemistry, thickness, and conductive properties at lower temperatures. These results show that Li is promising for batteries operating under extreme conditions, and the distinct nanoscale evolution of Li electrodes at different temperatures must be considered when designing high- batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674132>Self-Supported, Sulfate Functionalized Nickel Hydroxides Nanoplates with Enhanced Wettability and Conductivity for High-Performance Supercapacitors.</a></h2><p>Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH) 2 ) is promising for supercapacitor application due to its low cost and tunable electrochemical properties, but its performance is usually restricted by insufficient conductivity and surface reactivity. In this work, sulfate functionalized Ni(OH) 2 (SNO) nanoplates were in-situ grown on nickel foam (NF) via a green and facile one-step hydrothermal treatment of NF without need for external Ni source or surfactant addition. The resulting material showed 9.3 times higher areal capacity and 1.8 times higher rate capability than the sulfate-free control, and retained 81.3% capacity after 5000 cycles. When being used as the positive electrode in a hybrid supercapacitor, the SNO/NF//activated carbon system achieved >95% columbic efficiency, maximum  density of 3.59 W h m -2 and maximum power density of 44.63 W m -2 , outperforming most of the existing Ni-based supercapacitor. Detailed material characterization and density functional theory calculation revealed that the sulfate introduction expanded the layer spacing of Ni(OH) 2 and improved electrical conductivity and wettability to favor more efficient electrolyte diffusion, charge transfer and reactant adsorption. The high loading of reactive component and inherited porous structure also contributed to the superior capacitive performances of the SNO/NF electrodes. Therefore, the SNO/NF holds great potential for commercialized supercapacitor application.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Analytes were separated using an Zorbax Extend-Agilent C (1.8 μm, 4.6 × 30 mm) column following a simple methanol precipitation treatment. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and water containing 0.1% formic acid, and the total gradient program time was 1.5 min. Method validation results showed TH was linear in 2-500 ng/mL (r > 0.99), and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 2 μg/mL. The intra-run and inter-run precision (coefficient of variation, CV) was within 2.80%, and the accuracy (relative error, RE) was within ±11.10%. Stability of TH was evaluated in different storage conditions, including short-term I-III, long-term I-III, 2 and 4 h in the artificial gastrointestinal tract, respectively. There was no obvious interference between TH and internal standards (IS). With the established Caco-2 monolayer permeability model, Papp(AB) of TH was calculated as 46.29 ± 8.31 × 10 cm/s, and the efflux ratio (ER) value was calculated as 0.22, indicating a high permeability character of TH. The transmembrane transport of TH followed the concentration-dependent, temperature-independent, and -free manner. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that TH is a highly permeable drug and the transport mechanism is mainly via passive diffusion.Copyright © 2019.

However, there was only one study that catalyzes the producing of hydrogen via the methanolysis of MeAB, and it was carried out by our research group. For this reason, in this work, a new catalyst system entitled by single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) supported bimetallic platinum-ruthenium nanoparticles were developed and called as PtRu@SWCNT. These NPs were characterized by several techniques (XRD, XPS, Raman, and TEM), and they were performed for the methanolysis of MeAB with high catalytic activity. The prepared PtRu@SWCNT NPs were also tested in the methanolysis of MeAB at different parameters including different temperatures, catalyst and substrate concentrations, and reusability performance. Experimental results revealed that the new PtRu@SWCNT NPs had excellent catalytic activity and reusability for removing of hydrogen from the methanolysis of MeAB at ambient conditions. According to the obtained data, the turnover frequency is 136.25 mole H/mole PtRu × min, and the activation  (Ea) is 17.29 kJ/mole. More than 99% of conversion was observed at room temperature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672379>The study of laser cooling of TeH anion in theoretical approach.</a></h2><p>The probabilities of laser cooling of TeH anion via a spin-forbidden transition and a three-electronic-level transition are proposed. The potential  curves of the XΣ, a∏, A∏, and bΣ electronic states of tellurium monohydride anion (TeH) are calculated using multi-reference configuration interaction method. Davidson corrections, core-valence correlations and spin-orbit coupling effects are also considered. The AWCV5Z-PP pseudopotential basis set of Te atom is used. Spectroscopic parameters of the Λ-S and Ω states are obtained by solving radial Schrodinger equation. These results are reported at the first time. Permanent dipole moments of the Ω states and transition dipole moments of the a1↔X0 and A1↔X0 transitions are also calculated. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors of the a1↔X0 and A1↔X0 transitions are obtained, the value of f is 0.9970 and 0.9980, respectively. Spontaneous radiative lifetimes of the a1 and A1 excited states are predicted. i.e. τ(a1) = 200.3 ns and τ(A1) = 84.3 ns. Only the main pump laser is required to driving a1↔X0 and A1↔X0 transitions.

Herein, the kinetics and mechanism of OH-initiated degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP), an antibiotic of fluoroquinolone class, are obtained using density functional and computational kinetics methods. All feasible mechanisms are considered, including H-abstraction, OH-addition, and sequential electron proton transfer. Results showed that the H-abstraction is the dominant reaction pathway, and the product radicals P7H, P9H, and P10H are the dominating intermediates. The aqueous phase rate coefficients for the OH-triggered reaction of ciprofloxacin are calculated from 273 K to 323 K to examine the temperature dependent effect, and the theoretical value of 6.07 × 10 M s at 298 K is close to the corresponding experimental data. Moreover, the intermediates P7H, P9H, and P10H could easily transform to several stable products in the presence of O, HO, and OH. The peroxy radical, which is generated from the incorporation of H-abstraction product radicals (P7H, P9H, and P10H) with O, prefers to produce HO into the surrounding through direct concerted elimination rather than the indirect mechanism. In addition, the peroxy radical could react with HO via triplet and singlet routes, and the former is more favorable due to its smaller barrier compared with the latter. The hydroxyl-substituted CIP has higher activity than its parent compound in their reactions with OH due to its lower barrier and faster rate. In addition, the -NHC(O)-containing compound IM3-P10-H-4 is harmful to aquatic fish and is the primary product in the OH-rich environment according to the ecotoxicity assessment computations. This study can improve our comprehension on CIP transformation in complex water environments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Strategies on how to identify individuals at high fracture risk and target them for treatment have lagged far behind other developments in the osteoporosis field. Most osteoporosis quality improvement strategies have focused on patients with recent or prior fracture (secondary prevention), with limited attention to individuals without prior fracture.

The main feature of this technology is the use of ultrasonic  as the heating source instead of a conventional injection screw. Since 2002, several authors have experimentally and theoretically studied the ability of ultrasonic  to mould polymers. However, different machine configurations and experimental design strategies have been used, which makes it very difficult to compare the results obtained from different articles. In this report, the authors have compiled experimental studies on the ultrasonic moulding process and analysed them along with providing a theoretical framework. An accurate description of the process and the machine configurations used in the literature is also presented. The results obtained from the analysis are summarized and discussed, and possible next steps to further the research in this field are suggested.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In swimming locomotion, a number of questions related to swimming energetics of an organism and how the energetic quantities scale with body size remain open, largely due to the difficulties with modeling and measuring the power production and consumption. Based on a comprehensive theoretical framework that incorporates cyclic muscle behavior, structural dynamics and swimming hydrodynamics, we perform extensive computational simulations and show that many of the outstanding problems in swimming energetics can be explained by considering the coupling between hydrodynamics and muscle contraction characteristics, as well as the trade-offs between the conflicting performance goals of sustained swimming speed U and cost of transport COT. Our results lead to three main conclusions: (1) in contrast to previous hypotheses, achieving optimal values of U and COT is independent of producing maximal power or efficiency; (2) muscle efficiency in swimming, in contrast to that in flying or running, decreases with increasing body size, consistent with muscle contraction characteristics; (3) the long-standing problem of two disparate patterns of longitudinal power output distributions in swimming fish can be reconciled by relating the two patterns to U-optimal or COT-optimal swimmers, respectively. We also provide further evidence that the use of tendons in caudal regions is beneficial from an energetic perspective. Our conclusions explain and unify many existing observations and are supported by computational data covering nine orders of magnitude in body size.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671261>Dynamical Recrossing in the Intercalation Process of the Anticancer Agent Proflavine into DNA.</a></h2><p>Intercalation into DNA is the interaction mode of some anthracycline antibiotics. Recently, this process's molecular mechanism was explored using the static free  landscape. Here we explore the dynamical effects in the intercalation of proflavine into DNA by calculating the transmission coefficient κ -- providing a measure of the departure from Transition State Theory for the reaction rate constant -- by examination of the recrossing events at the transition state. For that purpose, we first found the accurate transition state of this complex system -- as judged by a committor analysis -- using a set of all-atom simulations of total length 6.3 millisecond. In a subsequent calculation of the transmission coefficient κ in another extensive set of simulations, the small value κ=0.1 was found, indicating a significant departure from TST. Comparison of this result with Grote-Hynes and Kramers theories shows that neither theory is able to capture this complex system's recrossing events; the source of this striking failure is discussed, as are related aspects of the mechanism. This study suggests that, for biomolecular processes similar to this, dynamical effects essential for the process are complex in nature and require novel approaches for their elucidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671513>Tuning the Photophysical Features of Self-Assembling Photoactive Polypeptides for Light-Harvesting.</a></h2><p>The LH1 complex is the major light-harvesting antenna of purple photosynthetic bacteria. Its role is to capture photons, and then store them and transfer the excitation  to the photosynthetic reaction center. The structure of LH1 is modular and it cooperatively self-assembles from the subunits composed of short transmembrane polypeptides that reversibly bind the photoactive cofactors: bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid. LH1 assembly, the intra-complex interactions and the light-harvesting features of LH1 can be controlled in micellar media by varying the surfactant concentration and by adding carotenoid and/or a co-solvent. By exploiting this approach, we can manipulate the size of the assembly, the intensity of light absorption, and the  and lifetime of its first excited singlet state. For instance, via the introduction of Ni-substituted bacteriochlorophyll into LH1, the lifetime of this electronic state of the antenna can be shortened by almost three orders of magnitude. On the other hand, via the exchange of carotenoid, light absorption in the visible range can be tuned. These results show how in a relatively simple self-assembling pigment-polypeptide system a sophisticated functional tuning can be achieved and thus they provide guidelines for the construction of bio-inspired photoactive nanodevices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673304>Eliminating Fatigue in Surface-Bound Spiropyrans.</a></h2><p>This paper describes an experimental approach to eliminating the loss of reversibility that surface-bound spiropyrans exhibit when switched with light. Although such fatigue can be controlled in other contexts, on surfaces, the photochromic compounds are held in close proximity to each other and relatively few molecules modulate the properties of a device, leading to a loss of functionality after only a few switching cycles. The switching process was characterized by photoelectron spectroscopy and differences in tunneling currents in the spiropyran and merocyanine forms using eutectic Ga-In. Self-assembled monolayers comprising only the photochromic compounds degraded rapidly, while mixed monolayers with hexanethiol showed different behaviors depending on the relative humidity. Under dry conditions, no chemical degradation was observed and the switching process was reversible over at least 100 cycles. Under humid conditions, no degradation occurred, but the switching process became irreversible. The absence of degradation observed in mixed monolayers is ascribed to the lack of solvation, which increases the barrier to a key bond rotation past the available thermal . These results highlight important differences in the contexts in which photochromic compounds are utilized and demonstrate that they can be leveraged to extract device-relevant functionality from surface-bound switches by suppressing fatigue and irreversibility.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p></html>
