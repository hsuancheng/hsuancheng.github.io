Currently, parents complete  education at the time of diagnosis. However, this format may not be sustainable as rates of T1D climb. The current study aimed to develop an online platform to provide educational material in the form of video micro-lectures using an iterative, user-centered, design process.In the first stage of development, parents of young children with T1D identified information they felt most important to their child's T1D care. In the second stage, healthcare providers contributed qualitative and quantitative feedback regarding the educational material and video mock-ups. The third stage involved parents of young children with T1D providing feedback on the completed video micro-lectures.Providers and parents reported that the videos were highly useful, important to T1D care, and the majority would recommend them to other parents.The iterative design process used by the research team incorporated multiple perspectives and ultimately developed educational resources that were well-received by providers, researchers, and parents.This study used an iterative, user-centered design to develop a series of web-based videos for parents of young children with type 1 . Primary stakeholders, both healthcare providers and parents, described videos as highly important, useful, enjoyable, and would recommend these resources to others. Parents rated videos highly across a variety of presentations that ranged in development time and cost, indicating that researchers can feasibly and cost-effectively create web-based resources for parents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663481>The Increase of HIV-1 Infection, Neurocognitive Impairment, and Type 2  in The Rio Grande Valley.</a></h2><p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection remains a persistent predicament for the State of Texas ranking seventh among the most documented HIV cases in the United States. In this regard, the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) in South Texas is considered as one of the least investigated areas of the state with respect to HIV infection and HIV associated comorbidities. Considering the 115% increase in average HIV incidence rates per 100,000 within the RGV from 2007-2015, it is worth characterizing this population with respect to their HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and the association of treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Moreover, the increased rate of Type-2  (T2D) in the RGV population is intertwined with that of HIV-1 infection facing challenges from lack of knowledge about prevention to inadequate access to healthcare. The role of T2D in the development of HAND among the people living with HIV (PLWH) in the RGV will be reviewed as well to establish a closer link between T2D and HAND in cART-treated patients of the RGV.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663293>Polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescent girls.</a></h2><p>PCOS is already a prevalent endocrinopathy in adolescent girls, and its prevalence is rising further since, in essence, it is the result of a mismatch between an energy-sparing (epi)genetic background and a (relatively) obesogenic environment. This mismatch results in an excess of fat storage in ectopic depots, notably in the liver and viscera (= hepato-visceral, or central fat). There is still no FDA-approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. The prime aim should be a preferential loss of central fat, through lifestyle measures. Failure to sustain these measures is frequent, and the standard approach is to add an estroprogestagen contraceptive, even for girls who do not need contraception. Treatment with SPIOMET, a low-dose combination of spironolactone (to antagonize androgen and mineralocorticoid effects, and to activate BAT thereby raising energy expenditure), pioglitazone (to raise circulating HMW adiponectin concentrations) and metformin, is an alternative approach that holds the potential to revert the PCOS phenotype.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663720>Rational design of a rigid fluorophore-molecular rotor-based probe for high signal-to-background ratio detection of sulfur dioxide in viscous system.</a></h2><p>Many viscous microenvironments exist in living systems. For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in , hypertension, inflammation, tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.5-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in mitochondria and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662365>Effect of  on risk of latent TB infection in a high TB incidence area: a community-based study in Taiwan.</a></h2><p>To investigate the association between  and latent tuberculosis infections (LTBI) in high TB incidence areas.Community-based comparison study.Outpatient  clinics at 4 hospitals and 13 health centres in urban and rural townships.

Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut microbiome) and its interactions with immune cells and metabolic organs including adipose tissues (microbiome-immune-metabolic axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiome, stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the metabolic functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact microbiome-immune-metabolic axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and , and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664476>Construction and validation of the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale among a representative sample of Lebanese women.</a></h2><p>Our study aimed at constructing and validating the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale adapted for use among Lebanese women and to assess factors associated with the poorest knowledge of osteoporosis definition, risk factors, and preventive measures. This scale showed adequate psychometric properties; higher knowledge scores were reached in women who already heard about the disease and had a formal education. As a result, the LOKS-19 can be used to measure knowledge of osteoporosis and help assess osteoporosis-related interventions.The primary objective of this study was to describe the construction of the Lebanese Osteoporosis Knowledge Scale (LOKS) and assess its psychometric properties in a representative sample of Lebanese women aged 40 years and above. Secondary objectives were to explore factors associated with this knowledge score.A cross-sectional study carried out between March and June 2018, enrolled 560 women over the age of 40 years living in the community. This proportionate sample was randomly selected from all Lebanese governorates to cover the entire Lebanese area. A survey was developed and adapted to the Lebanese population based on preexisting scales. Personal interviews were conducted to collect data.The items of the LOKS were distributed across seven factors with an Eigenvalue over 1 solution, outlining an overall value of 55.89% of the variance. A high Cronbach's alpha was found for the full scale (0.725). Individuals having a university level of education (beta = 1.62; compared to illiteracy), having heard of osteoporosis (beta = 2.62), taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D compared to none (beta = 0.77), and having had Crohn's disease (beta = 1.71) had significantly higher knowledge scores of osteoporosis; oppositely, having  (beta = - 1.17), currently taking chemotherapy (beta = - 2.25), and ever having had a fracture (beta = - 0.74) were significantly correlated with lower awareness of osteoporosis.Our findings suggest that the LOKS-19 can be used to measure knowledge of osteoporosis and help assess osteoporosis-related interventions.

In this study, 414 Emirati patients with RA were evaluated over a 3-year period from April 2015 to April 2018. All patients fulfilled the 2010 RA ACR/EULAR criteria and were assessed for demographic and clinical characteristics. The estimated RA prevalence rate in our population cohort was 2.72%. Females showed predominance (80%) with a higher body mass index (31.4 ± 6.61,  = 0.0001) compared to males (28.8 ± 6.03,  = 0.0001). The most frequent comorbidity observed was dyslipidemia (43.5%) followed by hypertension (37.9%),  (34.5%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (33.1%). Xerophthalmia was the most frequent extra-articular manifestation. Rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide were detected in 63.3% and 41.5% patients, respectively, while both were present in 33.3% of patients. Methotrexate, adalimumab, and rituximab were the most frequently prescribed disease modifying agents. In this study, we describe disease features that are unique to United Arab Emirates (UAE) patients and demonstrate that RA has a significant disease burden. Our findings highlight the need for a RA national registry to improve the quality of care of these patients in UAE.Copyright © 2019 Rajaie Namas et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663866>Passive versus Mentally Active Sedentary Behaviors and Depression.</a></h2><p>Detrimental associations of sedentary behaviors with depression have been identified, but findings are inconsistent.

In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on , liver steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 , insulin resistance and type 2  in animal models. Concerning type 1 , the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 , increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When insulin resistance is induced by diets, a greater activation of insulin signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662777>GC-MS Analysis and Inhibitory Evaluation of  Leaf Extracts on Major Enzymes Linked to .</a></h2><p> leaves are used in managing both  and its complications in Southwest Nigeria. However, its inhibitory activity on enzymes implicated in  is not very clear. This study investigated the  inhibitory properties and mode of inhibition of  leaf extracts on enzymes associated with . The study also identified some bioactive compounds as well as their molecular interaction in the binding pocket of these enzymes. Standard enzyme inhibition and kinetics assays were performed to determine the inhibitory effects of aqueous extract (TCA) and ethanol extract (TCE) of  leaves on -glucosidase and -amylase activities. The phytoconstituents of TCA and TCE were determined using GC-MS. Molecular docking of the phytocompounds was performed using Autodock Vina. TCA and TCE were the most potent inhibitors of -glucosidase (IC = 3.28 ± 0.47 mg/mL) and -amylase (IC = 0.24 ± 0.08 mg/mL), respectively. Both extracts displayed a mixed mode of inhibition on -amylase activity, while mixed and noncompetitive modes of inhibition were demonstrated by TCA and TCE, respectively, on -glucosidase activity. The GC-MS analytic chromatogram revealed the presence of 24 and 22 compounds in TCE and TCA, respectively, which were identified mainly as phenolic compounds, terpenes/terpenoids, fatty acids, and other phytochemicals. The selected compounds exhibited favourable interactions with the enzymes compared with acarbose. Overall, the inhibitory effect of  on -amylase and -glucosidase may be ascribed to the synergistic action of its rich phenolic and terpene composition giving credence to the hypoglycaemic nature of  leaves.Copyright © 2019 Franklyn Nonso Iheagwam et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665811>Postnatal β2 Adrenergic Treatment Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Lambs with IUGR but not Persistent Defects in Pancreatic Islets or Skeletal Muscle.</a></h2><p>Previous studies in fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have shown that adrenergic dysregulation was associated with low insulin concentrations and greater insulin sensitivity. Although whole-body glucose clearance is normal, one-month-old lambs with IUGR at birth have higher rates of hindlimb glucose uptake, which may compensate for myocyte deficiencies in glucose oxidation. Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in IUGR lambs is due to lower intra-islet insulin availability and not from glucose sensing. We investigated adrenergic receptor (ADR) β2 desensitization by administering oral ADRβ modifiers for the first month after birth to activate ADRβ2 and antagonize ADRβ1/3. In IUGR lambs ADRβ2 activation increased whole-body glucose utilization rates and insulin sensitivity but had no effect on isolated islet or myocyte deficiencies. IUGR establishes risk for developing . In IUGR lambs we identified disparities in key aspects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, providing new insights into potential mechanisms for this risk.Placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and disturbances in glucose homeostasis with associated β-adrenergic receptor (ADRβ) desensitization. Our objectives were to measure insulin-sensitive glucose metabolism in neonatal lambs with IUGR and to determine whether daily treatment with ADRβ2 agonist and ADRβ1/β3 antagonists for one month normalizes their glucose metabolism. Growth, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and glucose utilization rates (GUR) were measured in control lambs, IUGR lambs, and IUGR lambs treated with β2-agonist clenbuterol, β1-antagonist atenolol, and β3-antagonist SR59230A (IUGR-AR). In IUGR lambs, islet insulin content and GSIS were less than in controls; however, insulin sensitivity and whole-body GUR were not different from controls. Of importance, ADRβ2 stimulation with β1/β3 inhibition increases both insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose utilization in IUGR lambs. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs, hindlimb GUR were greater but fractional glucose oxidation rates and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose oxidation rates were lower than controls. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) was lower in IUGR and IUGR-AR skeletal muscle than in controls but GLUT1 was greater in IUGR-AR. ADRβ2, insulin receptor, glycogen content, and citrate synthase activity were similar among groups. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs heart rates were greater, which was independent of cardiac ADRβ1 activation. We conclude that targeted ADRβ2 stimulation improved whole-body insulin sensitivity but minimally affected defects in GSIS and skeletal muscle glucose oxidation. We show that risk factors for developing  are independent of postnatal catch-up growth in IUGR lambs as early as one-month of age and are inherent to the islets and myocytes.

We hypothesize that notable differences exist between claims-based and prospectively collected clinical registries.We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), a prospective surgical outcomes database, and PearlDiver (PD), a claims-based private insurance database, for patients undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasties from 2007 to 2016. Comorbidities and 30-day complications were compared. Multiple regression analysis was performed for each cohort to identify notable contributors to 30-day revision surgery.Significant differences were observed in demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative complications for the age-matched groups between PD and NSQIP (P < 0.05 for all). Multiple regression analysis in PD identified morbid obesity and dyspnea to lead to an increased risk for revision surgery (P = 0.001) in the <65 cohort and dyspnea and  to lead to an increased risk for revision surgery in the ≥65 cohort (P = 0.015, P < 0.001). Multiple regression did not reveal any risk factors for revision surgery in the <65 age group for the NSQIP; however, congestive heart failure was found to have an increased risk for revision surgery in the ≥65 cohort (P < 0.001).Notable differences in comorbidities and complications for patients undergoing primary total shoulder arthroplasty were present between PD and NSQIP.Retrospective cohort study, level III.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662399>Cross-sectional study of the health of southern African truck drivers.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle and working conditions of truck drivers predisposes them to risk-factors associated with communicable and non-communicable diseases, but little is known about the health status of African truck driver. This study aims to assess a cross-section of truckers in South Africa to describe their health information.The study took place across three truck-stop rest areas in the South African provinces of Free State and Gauteng.Eligibility criteria included being males aged 18 years and older, full-time employment as a long-distance truck driver. A total of 614 male truck drivers participated; 384 (63%) were Zimbabwean and 325 (55%) completed high-school.The trucker survey explored demographics; working conditions; sexual, eating and sleeping behaviours; mental health status, medical history and cardiac risk-factors. Medical assessments included physical measurements, glucose and lipid measurements, ECG, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cardiac ultrasound.In the previous month, 554 (91%) participants were sexually active; 522 (86%) had sex with a regular partner; 174 (27%) with a casual partner; 87 (14%) with a sex worker. Average time driving was 10 hours/day, 20 days/month, 302 (50%) never worked night shifts and 74 (12%) worked nights approximately four times per week. 112 (18%) experienced daytime sleepiness and 59 (10%) were ever hospitalised from an accident. Forty-seven (8%, 95% CI 5.3 to 9.5) were HIV-positive, with half taking antiretrovirals. Forty-eight (8%) truckers had some moderate depression, while 21 (4%) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Reported tuberculosis, myocardial infarction, and  were <3%. Prominent cardiac risk-factors included smoking (n=63, 11%), consuming alcohol (>15 drinks/week) (n=54, 9%), overweight/obesity (n=417, 69%), and hypertension (n=220, 36%,95% CI 32.1 to 39.7). ECG results showed 23 (4.9%) and 29 (5.3%) drivers had left ventricular hypertrophy using the Cornell criterion and product, respectively. CIMT measurements indicated nine (4.2%) drivers had a carotid atherosclerotic plaque.This first holistic assessment of health among southern African male truck drivers demonstrates substantial addressable cardiovascular risk factors, mental health issues and sexual risk behaviours.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Concentrated growth factor (CGF) obtained from the autologous venous blood of patients via fractional centrifugation is employed for producing a CGF gel or membrane that can be applied to expedite self-regeneration of skin wounds. In this case report, we presented the results from 18 patients with chronic skin wounds treated with a CGF gel or membrane produced from autologous venous blood. Noticeable granulation tissue and regenerated epidermal coverage were observed in 16 patients who received CGF treatment over various time courses, thereby demonstrating the significant therapeutic effects of CGF treatment in overall wound healing. The other two patients with stasis ulcers in their calves failed to respond to the treatment because of the comorbidity of iliac vein thrombosis. In addition, by culturing HaCaT keratinocytes using CGF membrane as the foundation, we observed that HaCaT cells attached to the CGF membrane migrated and proliferated to form an epithelium-like structure. Comprehensively, the clinical results infer that CGF gel can expedite the regeneration of the soft tissue at the wound, whereas CGF membrane may facilitate its marginal re-epithelialisation. The combination of the two can promote autologous regeneration of both deep and superficial wounds effectively and safely.© 2019 Medicalhelplines.com Inc and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665233>δ-related Biomarkers Attenuate Multiple AD Conversion Risks and Offer Targets for Intervention.</a></h2><p>We tested certain serum proteins' ability to mediate the effects of demographic variables on prospective 5yr conversion to clinical "Alzheimer's Disease" (AD) from non-demented states [i.e., Normal Control (NC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)]. The proteins were rationally selected from among previously published mediators of those same variables' associations with the latent variable "δ", a novel omnibus dementia severity metric.Each protein's attenuation of its risk factor's independent association with conversion was confirmed by logistic regression, adjusted for education, ethnicity, self-reported  and hypertension, among N = 772 initially non-demented Mexican-American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants in the Texas Alzheimer`s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC).n = 70 non-demented participants at baseline converted to "AD" (9.1%) after a mean follow-up of 5.4 yrs.

Methods and Results The targeted carotid files from the prospective NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) registry (2011-2013) comprised the derivation population. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated predictors of a 30-day adverse event (stroke, myocardial infarction, or death), the effect estimates of which were used to build a weighted predictive scale that was validated using the 2014 to 2015 NSQIP registry release. A total of 10 766 and 8002 patients were included in the derivation and the validation populations, in whom 4.0% and 3.7% developed an adverse event, respectively. The NSQIP registry CEA scale included 14 variables; the highest points were allocated for insulin-dependent , high-risk cardiac physiological characteristics, admission source other than home, an emergent operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification IV to V, modified Rankin Scale score ≥2, and presentation with a stroke. NSQIP registry CEA score was predictive of an adverse event (concordance=0.67), stroke or death (concordance=0.69), mortality (concordance=0.76), an extended hospitalization (concordance=0.73), and a nonroutine discharge (concordance=0.83) in the validation population, as well as among symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups (<0.001). In the validation population, patients with an NSQIP registry CEA scale score >8 and 17 had 30-day stroke or death rates >3% and 6%, the recommended thresholds for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, respectively.

We did baseline (2005-2007) and two follow-up surveys in 2008-2009 and 2013-2015. Risk factors studied were tobacco, alcohol, hypertension, self-reported  and central obesity.Outcome measures were fatal or non-fatal ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular event. We estimated HRs for the risk factors and population attributable fraction (PAF).We followed up 5641 (94.4%) subjects, and follow-up duration was 33 371 person years. The overall incidence of cardiovascular event or death was 4.6 per 1000 person years. Current smoking (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and hypertension (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.4) were the risk factors among men and accounted for 47% of the PAF. Among women, hypertension (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4), self-reported  (HR 4.3, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1) and central obesity (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.0) were associated with CVD and accounted for more than half of the PAF.We described the high burden of fatal CVD and identified the role of CVD risk factors such as hypertension, self-reported , smoking and central obesity. There is an urgent need to implement low-cost interventions such as smoking cessation and treat hypertension and  in primary care settings.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Seventeen randomized placebo controlled PCSK9 inhibitor trials were included, providing data on 79,578 participants. Results were scaled to a one mmol/L lower LDL-C concentration.The PCSK9 GS (comprising 4 SNPs) associations with plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels were consistent in direction with treatment effects. The GS odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.42; 0.68), compared to a PCSK9 inhibitor effect of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86; 0.93). For ischemic stroke ORs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57; 1.22) for the GS, compared to 0.85 (95% CI 0.78; 0.93) in the drug trials. ORs with type 2  (T2DM) were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11; 1.50) for the GS, as compared to 1.00 (95% CI 0.96; 1.04) for incident T2DM in PCSK9 inhibitor trials. No genetic associations were observed for cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Alzheimer's disease - outcomes for which large-scale trial data were unavailable.Genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus recapitulates the effects of therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 on major blood lipid fractions and MI.

We studied the extent to which glycemic variables associate with kidney function, and developed equations including these variables that estimate aGFR in people with T2DM.Diabetic Pima people had aGFR measured from iothalamate clearance divided by body surface area. eGFRs < 60 ml/min/1.73m were excluded. Multivariate linear regression identified variables correlated with kidney function. We constructed equations for approximating aGFR. Correlation analysis and 10-fold cross-validation were used to compare the CKD-EPI equation and the new approximating equations to the measured aGFR. Ability to detect hyperfiltration, defined as aGFR > 120 ml/min/1.73m, was compared by analysis of receiver-operating (ROC) curves.aGFR was measured 2798 times in 269 individuals. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), age, and serum creatinine (SCR) were significantly associated with aGFR. The best equations for approximating aGFR used HbA1c and FPG in addition to age and SCR. They approximate aGFR in this cohort of obese people with T2DM more precisely than the CKD-EPI equation. Analysis of ROC curves show that these equations detect hyperfiltration better than does the CKD-EPI equation.HbA FPG, age, and SCR yielded the best equations for estimating aGFR in these subjects. The new equations identify hyperfiltration better than the CKD-EPI equation in this cohort and may inform clinical decisions regarding hyperfiltration in individuals with T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663914>A Novel Machine Learning Model Developed to Assist in Patient Selection for Outpatient Total Shoulder Arthroplasty.</a></h2><p>Patient selection for outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is important to optimizing patient outcomes. This study aims to develop a machine learning tool that may aid in patient selection for outpatient total should arthroplasty based on medical comorbidities and demographic factors.Patients undergoing elective TSA from 2011 to 2016 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were queried. A random forest machine learning model was used to predict which patients had a length of stay of 1 day or less (short stay). A multivariable logistic regression was then used to identify which variables were significantly correlated with a short or long stay.From 2011 to 2016, 4,500 patients were identified as having undergone elective TSA and having the necessary predictive features and outcomes recorded. The machine learning model was able to successfully identify short stay patients, producing an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.77. The multivariate logistic regression identified numerous variables associated with a short stay including age less than 70 years and male sex as well as variables associated with a longer stay including , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than 2.Machine learning may be used to predict which patients are suitable candidates for short stay or outpatient TSA based on their medical comorbidities and demographic profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662607>Hospital Outcomes of Adult Diabetic Patients by Glycated Hemoglobin Level in Nonsurgical Pathology in a High-Complexity Institution.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence supports the relationship between in-hospital hyperglycemia and inpatient complications. Besides, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) can predict the clinical course of patients with type 2  (DM2) during hospital stays. This study aimed to assess the relationship between HbA1c levels and inpatient outcomes. Type 2  patients with age greater than 18 years, hospital length of stay greater than 24 hours, and one HbA1c report during their in-hospital management were included. All the electronic care records of patients admitted at the Clinical Versalles, a high-volume institution, in Manizales-Colombia were revised. The following variables were considered: hospital length of stay, diagnoses at the arrival, complications, capillary glucose levels, and treatment at discharge. Variables were categorized by HbA1c levels: group 1 = ⩽ 7%, group 2 = 7.01% to 8.5%, group 3 = 8.51% to ⩽10% and group 4 = >10%. There were a total of 232 patients. Average age was 69.7 years, mean HbA1c was 7.19 ± 2.03, average body mass index (BMI) was 28.8 ± 5.6. About HbA1c, 146 (62.9%) had ⩽7.5%. The most frequent admission diagnosis was by cardiovascular diseases. Average hospitalization was 7.5 ± 5.7 days. There was no relationship between the levels of HbA1c with hospital stays, inpatient complications, or readmissions. Infections and respiratory diseases were more common conditions related to higher HbA1c levels, especially when these were 8.5%. In diabetic patients with nonsurgical diseases and high HbA1c levels, there was no association with clinical complications, length of stay, readmissions, or in-hospital mortality, but changes in treatment at discharge were observed.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664464>[Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of depressive comorbidity in somatic illness].</a></h2><p>Comorbid depression is frequent in internal medicine (e.g. in coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure or ) and impairs quality of life as well as the prognosis of the somatic illness.To review evidence based recommendations for the treatment of depressive comorbidity in selected somatic disorders.Selective literature search based on national and international guidelines.In clinical routine, depressive symptoms are often overseen or misinterpreted. Therefore, a specific diagnostic is recommended. Depressive symptoms should obligatory be screened during the clinical interview or by validated questionnaires. When screened positive, further diagnostic steps are mandatory. The treatment of depressive disorders has three main components: basic psychosomatic care, psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. These interventions are safe and effective for reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing quality of life. However, results regarding the effects on morbidity and mortality of the comorbid somatic disorder are still inconclusive. The greatest effects on depression are obtained by a preference-based, stepped-care approach and an optimal cooperation of all professionals ("collaborative care").An effective treatment of depressive comorbidity is relevant for quality of life and possibly also for the prognosis of a somatic disease.

Therefore, focusing a systematic review of DSME research in the AWP region would give a better understanding of which intervention approaches are associated with better clinical outcomes and are culturally acceptable.A systematic review.A review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative studies to evaluate the effectiveness of face-to-face delivery reporting educational and/or psychological interventions for people with T2DM was implemented. We conducted searches using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed and ASSIA databases between January 1990-June 2018. Studies published in English and non-English were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data on participant and intervention characteristics. The quality of evidence was rated on predetermined criteria. Main outcomes included glycaemic control (reduction in HbA1c level).We included 21 DSME programmes (17 RCTs), while 15 were group-based approaches. Twelve studies (60%) were categorized as high quality. Three studies (25%) had a moderate (good) effect.

However, none have grouped participants into non-diabetics (ND), undiagnosed diabetics (UDD), controlled diabetics (CD) and uncontrolled diabetics (UCD) or investigated what glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) are associated with low NMS (dynapenia) by sex.We analyzed the association between UDD, CD and UCD and dynapenia, the extent to which the different groupings of these individuals modifies this association and the association between HbA1c levels and NMS, by sex, in a cross-sectional study involving 5,290 participants ≥ 50 years from the ELSA study. In the first two analyses, logistic regression models were used with dynapenia (grip strength < 26kg in men and < 16kg in women) as outcome and  [ND, UDD, CD and UCD] as exposure. Next, linear regression was performed with grip strength as outcome and the participants classified based on HbA1c level as exposure. The models were adjusted by sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics.Compared to ND only UCD was associated with dynapenia (men OR=2.37 95% CI 1.36-4.14; women OR=1.67 95% CI 1.01-2.79). This association was less clear, particularly in women, when CD and UCD groups were merged. HbA1c ≥ 6.5% in men and ≥ 8.0% in women were associated with lower NMS.UCD increases the chance of dynapenia in both sexes. The different groupings based on  status modify the association between UCD and dynapenia. The threshold of HbA1c associated with reduced NMS is lower in men compared to women.© The Author(s) 2019.

Whereas physiological formation rates confer redox regulation of essential cellular functions and provide the basis for adaptive stress responses, their excessive formation contributes to impaired cellular function or even cell death, organ dysfunction and severe disease phenotypes of the entire organism. Therefore, quantification of RONS formation and knowledge of their tissue/cell/compartment-specific distribution is of great biological and clinical importance.Here, we used a high-performance/pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay to quantify the superoxide-specific oxidation product of the mitochondria-targeted fluorescence dye triphenylphosphonium-linked hydroethidium (mitoSOX) in biochemical systems and three animal models with established oxidative stress. Type 1  (single injection of streptozotocin), hypertension (infusion of angiotensin-II for 7 days) and nitrate tolerance (infusion of nitroglycerin for 4 days) was induced in male Wistar rats.The usefulness of mitoSOX/HPLC for quantification of mitochondrial superoxide was confirmed by xanthine oxidase activity as well as isolated stimulated rat heart mitochondria in the presence or absence of superoxide scavengers. Vascular function was assessed by isometric tension methodology and was impaired in the rat models of oxidative stress. Vascular dysfunction correlated with increased mitoSOX oxidation but also classical RONS detection assays as well as typical markers of oxidative stress.mitoSOX/HPLC represents a valid method for detection of mitochondrial superoxide formation in tissues of different animal disease models and correlates well with functional parameters and other markers of oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664089>A MultiTEP platform-based epitope vaccine targeting the phosphatase activating domain (PAD) of tau: therapeutic efficacy in PS19 mice.</a></h2><p>Pathological tau correlates well with cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and therefore represents a promising target for immunotherapy. Targeting an appropriate B cell epitope in pathological tau could in theory produce an effective reduction of pathology without disrupting the function of normal native tau. Recent data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tau (aa 2-18), termed the "phosphatase activation domain (PAD)", is hidden within native Tau in a 'paperclip'-like conformation. Conversely, PAD is exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and tau polymerization. Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau2-18 antibodies may safely and specifically reduce pathological tau and prevent further aggregation, which in turn would neutralize tau toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of our MultiTEP platform-based vaccine targeting tau2-18 formulated with Advax adjuvant (AV-1980R/A) in PS19 tau transgenic mice. The AV-1980R/A induced extremely high antibody responses and the resulting sera recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections. In addition, under non-denaturing conditions AV-1980R/A sera preferentially recognized AD-associated tau. Importantly, vaccination also prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in PS19 mice and significantly reduced insoluble total and phosphorylated tau species. Taken together, these findings suggest that predominantly targeting misfolded tau with AV-1980R/A could represent an effective strategy for AD immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665383>Elevated cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity early in pregnancy predicts prediabetes 5 years later.</a></h2><p>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) regulates high density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol levels and interaction between glucose and HDL metabolism is central in the development of .We hypothesized that CETP levels would be regulated in diabetic pregnancies.

Thus, we examined whether varicella zoster virus (VZV)-infected cells produce amyloid.Production of intracellular amyloidogenic proteins (amylin, amyloid precursor protein [APP], and amyloid-beta [Aβ]) and amyloid, as well as extracellular amylin, Aβ, and amyloid was compared between mock- and VZV-infected quiescent primary human spinal astrocytes (qHA-sps). The ability of supernatant from infected cells to induce amylin or Aβ42 aggregation was quantitated. Finally, the amyloidogenic activity of viral peptides was examined.VZV-infected qHA-sps, but not mock-infected qHA-sps, contained intracellular amylin, APP and/or Aβ, and amyloid. No differences in extracellular amylin, Aβ40, or Aβ42 were detected, yet only supernatant from VZV-infected cells induced amylin aggregation and, to a lesser extent, Aβ42 aggregation into amyloid fibrils. VZV glycoprotein B (gB) peptides assembled into fibrils and catalyzed amylin and Aβ42 aggregation.VZV-infected qHA-sps produced intracellular amyloid and their extracellular environment promoted aggregation of cellular peptides into amyloid fibrils that may be due, in part, to VZV gB peptides. These findings suggest that together with host and other environmental factors, VZV infection may increase the toxic amyloid burden and contribute to amyloid-associated disease progression.© The Author(s) 2019.

Particular examples include stroke, coronary heart disease, dementia and certain cancers. Research linking clinical and lifestyle risk factors to increased risk of noncommunicable disease is now well established with examples of confirmed risk factors, including smoking, physical inactivity, obesity and hypertension. However, despite a need to target our resources to achieve risk reduction, relatively little work has examined the overlap between the risk factors for these main noncommunicable diseases. Our high-level review draws together the evidence in this area. Using a systematic overview of reviews, we demonstrate the likely commonality of established risk factors having an impact on multiple noncommunicable disease outcomes. For example, systematic reviews of the evidence on physical inactivity and poor diet found each to be associated with increased risk of cancers, coronary heart disease, stroke,  and dementia. We highlight the potential for targeted risk reduction to simultaneously impact multiple noncommunicable disease areas. These relationships now need to be further quantified to allow the most effective development of public health interventions in this area.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663297>Association of MTHFR C677T polymorphism and type 2  (T2DM) susceptibility.</a></h2><p>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is essential in mediating folate metabolism, and thus plays an important role in  and diabetic complications.

Pooled results presented that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM under homozygous (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.39-1.94), heterozygous (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.20-1.59), recessive (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.23-1.61), dominant (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.27-1.70), and allele (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.23-1.52) genetic models. Stratified analysis demonstrated that C677T genotype was associated with T2DM in Asian populations, but not Caucasian and African populations.Our results indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism confers to T2DM, especially in Asian populations. Much more large-scale case-control studies are needed to strengthen such conclusion in the future.© 2019 The Authors.

Consequently,  and cancer share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating  and colon and rectal cancer (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on cancer cell aggressiveness in human colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is deregulated in both  and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of cancer cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating  and CRC.

The majority of  (DM) patients belong to type 2  (T2DM), which is highly associated with obesity. The general principle of current therapeutic strategies for patients with T2DM mainly focuses on restoring cellular insulin response by potentiating the insulin-induced signaling pathway. In late-stage T2DM, impaired insulin production requires the patients to receive insulin replacement therapy for maintaining their glucose homeostasis. T2DM patients also demonstrate a drop of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in their circulation, which suggests that replenishing BDNF or enhancing its downstream signaling pathway may be beneficial. Because of their protein nature, recombinant insulin or BDNF possess several limitations that hinder their clinical application in T2DM treatment. Thus, developing orally active "insulin pill" or "BDNF pill" is essential to provide a more convenient and effective therapy. This article reviews the current development of non-peptidyl chemicals that mimic insulin or BDNF and their potential as anti-diabetic agents.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665590>Vitamin D Supplementation and Prevention of Type 2 .

However, evidence of an association among obesity, bariatric surgery, and skin cancer, including melanoma, is limited.To investigate the association of bariatric surgery with skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma) and melanoma incidence.This nonrandomized controlled trial, the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, is ongoing at 25 surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers in Sweden and was designed to examine outcomes after bariatric surgery. The study included 2007 patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and 2040 contemporaneously matched controls who received conventional obesity treatment. Patients were enrolled between September 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001. Data analysis was performed from June 29, 2018, to November 22, 2018.Patients in the surgery group underwent gastric bypass (n = 266), banding (n = 376), or vertical banded gastroplasty (n = 1365). The control group (n = 2040) received the customary treatment for obesity at their primary health care centers.The SOS study was cross-linked to the Swedish National Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Registry, and the Registry of the Total Population for data on cancer incidence, death, and emigration.The study included 4047 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.9 [6.1] years; 2867 [70.8%] female). Information on cancer events was available for 4042 patients. The study found that bariatric surgery was associated with a markedly reduced risk of melanoma (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.87; P = .02; median follow-up, 18.1 years) and risk of skin cancer in general (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99; P = .047).

Baseline data, medical history and potential risk factors were collected. Lower limb PAOD was classified as stage IIA, stage IIB, stage III and stage IV. The carotid artery stenosis was classified as significant ACAS and non-significant ACAS. Multiple logistic regression estimated odds ratio of the risk factors.Compared to patients with non-significant ACAS, the patients with significant ACAS were significantly older in age and had greater percentage of cigarette-smoking andalcohol beverage consumption, and higher levels of total cholesterol and fibrinogen. There was no significant difference in sex, , hypertension, coronary heart disease and triglyceride between the two groups. The prevalence rate of significant ACAS increased with the stage of lower limb PAOD and with age. Advanced age and hypercholesteremia were risk factors for significant ACAS in this cohort.

However, measurements of total IGF-I concentrations may not reflect the bioactive fraction of IGF-I which reaches the IGF-I receptor at target organs. We examined endogenous IGF-bioactivity using an IGF-I kinase receptor activation (KIRA) assay that measures the ability of IGF-I to activate the IGF-IR in vitro.To compare responses of bioactive IGF and total IGF-I concentrations in short GH treated SGA children in the North European Small for Gestational Age Study (NESGAS).Bioactive IGF increased with age in healthy pre-pubertal children (n=94). SGA children had low-normal bioactive IGF levels at baseline (-0.12 (1.8 SD), increasing significantly after one year of high-dose GH treatment to 1.1 (1.4) SD, p<0.01. Following high-dose GH, 68% (n=65) of SGA children had a total IGF-I concentration >2SD (mean IGF-I 2.8 SDS), whereas only 15% (n=15) had levels of bioactive IGF slightly above normal reference values. At baseline, bioactive IGF (SDS) was significantly correlated to height (SDS) (r=0.29, p=0.005), in contrast to IGF-I (SDS) (r=0.17, p=0.10). IGF-I (SDS) was inversely correlated to delta height (SDS) after one year of high-dose GH treatment (r=-0.22, p=0.02).In contrast to total IGF-I concentrations, bioactive IGF stayed within the normal reference ranges for most SGA children during the first year of GH treatment.© Endocrine Society 2019.

However, the incidence of acute kidney injury after platinum-based transarterial chemoembolization or transarterial infusion chemotherapy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate association between acute kidney injury after platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.We retrospectively analysed 270 sessions in 129 patients who underwent platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the criteria established by the International Club of Ascites. The incidence of acute kidney injury, risk factors for serum creatinine elevation and association between acute kidney injury and prognosis were assessed.Fifteen cases of acute kidney injury (5.6%, 15/270) developed in 14 patients (10.8%, 14/129).

The purpose of this study is to report on the types and frequency of readmissions and identify demographic and clinical factors associated with readmission of Medicare beneficiaries that survived their AMI hospitalization. Methods and Results This retrospective study used the Inpatient Standard Analytical File for 2014. There were 143 286 Medicare beneficiaries with AMI who were discharged alive from 3619 hospitals. All readmissions occurring in any hospital within 90 days of the index AMI discharge date were identified. Of 143 286 Medicare beneficiaries discharged alive from their index AMI hospitalization, 28% (40 145) experienced at least 1 readmission within 90 days and 8% (11 477) had >1 readmission. Readmission rates were higher among Medicare beneficiaries who did not undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention in their index AMI admission (34%) compared with those that underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (20.2%). Using all Medicare beneficiary's index AMI, 27 comorbid conditions were significantly associated with the likelihood of a Medicare beneficiary having a readmission during the follow-up period. The strongest clinical characteristics associated with readmissions were dialysis dependence, type 1 , and heart failure. Conclusions This study provides benchmark information on the types of hospital readmissions Medicare beneficiaries experience during a 90-day AMI bundle. This paper also suggests that interventions are needed to alleviate the need for readmissions in high-risk populations, such as, those managed medically and those at risk of heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661547>Effect of Ropivacaine on Peripheral Neuropathy in Streptozocin -induced Rats through TRPV1-CGRP pathway.</a></h2><p>Objective To determine the effect of ropivacaine on peripheral neuropathy in diabetic rats and its possible mechanism.Methods Forty-eight Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: nondiabetic control group, nondiabetic group A (0.25% ropivacaine), nondiabetic group B (0.75% ropivacaine), diabetic control group (Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) +artificial cerebrospinal fluid), diabetic group A (DPN+0.25% ropivacaine), and diabetic group B (DPN + 0.75% ropivacaine), with eight rats in each group.

Results Compared with the nondiabetic control group, elevated blood glucose, decreased weight and reduced average mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), additionally, the sciatic nerves showed significantly slowed conduction velocity (both p&lt;0.001) and damaged pathological structure, the expression of TRPV1 and CGRP were decreased (both p&lt;0.001) in the diabetic groups. Compared with the diabetic control group, down-regulation of TRPV1 and CGRP in spinal cord was significant for the diabetic group A and B treated with 0.25% and 0.75% ropivacaine, the higher concentration of ropivacaine correlated with a greater change. Conclusion Ropivacaine can significantly block sciatic nerve conduction velocity in DPN rats in a concentration-dependent manner, which may be related to the expression of the TRPV1-CGRP pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661433>Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine, the offspring born from the marriage of nanotechnology and medicine, has already brought momentous advances in the fight against a plethora of unmet diseases from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative to  and cancer. Here, we review a conceptual framework that will provide a basic understanding about the molecular mechanism of action of a therapeutic nanomaterial inside biological milieu. In this review, we highlight how the catalytic nature of a transition metal oxide nanomaterial influences the cellular redox homeostasis, supports the cellular antioxidant defence system and reactivates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated signalling to perform normal cell functions like cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, toxicity, and protein interactions. With numerous examples, we describe the redox modulatory nature of d-block metal oxide nanomaterials and their biomimetic nanozyme activities to protect the mitochondria, the cellular redox mediator which prevents an organism from various diseases. This knowledge will be useful to design new nanomaterials capable of intracellular redox modulation, which in turn can be effective therapeutic agents for treatment of various unmet diseases that are beyond the ability of modern synthetic medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665480>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide is a pancreatic polypeptide secretagogue in humans.</a></h2><p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide(GIP) has been suggested to stimulate the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide(PP), an islet hormone thought to regulate gut motility, appetite and glycemia.To determine whether human GIP1-42 (hGIP) stimulates PP secretion.As glycemia modulates the secretion of PP, we measured plasma PP concentrations from two studies in healthy men(n=10) and in patients with type 2  (T2D)(n=12), where hGIP1-42 had been administered intravenously during fasting glycemia,  hyperglycemia(12mmol/L) and insulin-induced hypoglycemia (targets: 2.5mmol/L(healthy)/3.5mmol/L(T2D)). Porcine GIP1-42 (pGIP) was also infused intra-arterially in isolated porcine pancreata(n=4).Mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations were ~5mmol/L(healthy) and ~8mmol/L(T2D).At fasting glycemia, PP concentrations were higher during intravenous hGIP1-42 infusion compared with saline in healthy men (mean(SEM), net iAUCs0;30min 403(116) vs. -6(57) pmol/L×min,p=0.004) and in patients with T2D (905(177) vs. -96(86)pmol/L×min,p=0.009). During hyperglycemic clamping, PP concentrations were significantly higher during hGIP1-42 infusion compared with saline in patients with T2D (771(160) vs. -183(117)pmol/L×min,p=0.001), but not in healthy individuals (-8(86) vs. -57(53)pmol/L×min,p=0.69). When PG levels were declining in response to exogenous insulin, PP concentrations were higher during hGIP1-42 infusion compared with saline in healthy individuals (294(88) vs. -82(53)pmol/L×min,p=0.0025), but not significantly higher in patients with T2D(586(314) vs. -120(53),p=0.070). At target hypoglycemia , PP levels surged in both groups during both hGIP1-42 and saline infusions.In isolated pancreata, pGIP1-42 increased PP output in the pancreatic venous effluent (baseline vs. infusion, 24(5) vs. 79(16)pmol/min x min,p=0.044).GIP1-42 increases plasma PP secretion in healthy individuals, patients with T2D and isolated porcine pancreata. Hyperglycemia blunts the stimulatory effect of hGIP1-42 in healthy individuals, but not in patients with T2D.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Yet, these relationships are based on studies that relied on estimated GFR (eGFR), estimates of insulin sensitivity, or both. We aimed to verify the relationship between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic function by gold standard methods in adults with T2D.Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M value) (glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min) and renal hemodynamic function by urinary inulin (GFR) and para-aminohippuric acid (effective renal plasma flow [ERPF]) clearances in participants with T2D without overt kidney disease. Filtration fraction (FF) (GFR/ERPF) was calculated. Relationships between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic parameters were examined by multivariable linear regression. Renal hemodynamic parameters were examined across tertiles of M values.We tested 44 adults with T2D, of whom 77% were male, with mean ± SD age 63 ± 7 years, BMI 31.2 ± 4.0 kg/m, and HbA 7.4 ± 0.6%. Average GFR was 110 ± 26 mL/min, with an FF of 22.1 ± 2.8% and median 24-h urinary albumin excretion of 11.3 mg (interquartile range 5.8-17.0). Average M value was 5.6 ± 2.9 mg/kg ⋅ min. Insulin sensitivity inversely correlated with GFR ( = -0.44,  < 0.01) and FF ( = -0.40,  < 0.01), and these associations remained significant after multivariable adjustments for age, sex, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use, and HbA. In addition, GFR, FF, and urinary albumin excretion were highest in the participants in the lowest M value tertile.For the first time, we demonstrate that impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with intrarenal hemodynamic dysfunction by gold standard techniques in adults with T2D treated with metformin monotherapy.© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660880>Arg913Gln variation of SLC12A3 gene is associated with diabetic nephropathy in type 2  and Gitelman syndrome: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy is a global common cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. A lot of research has been conducted in biomedical sciences, which has enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy and has expanded the potential available therapies. An increasing number of evidence suggests that genetic alterations play a major role in development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. This systematic review was focused on searching an association between Arg913Gln variation in SLC12A3 gene with diabetic nephropathy in individuals with Type 2  and Gitelman Syndrome.An extensive systematic review of the literature was completed using PubMed, EBSCO and Cochrane Library, from their inception to January 2018. The PRISMA guidelines were followed and the search strategy ensured that all possible studies were identified to compile the review. Inclusion criteria for this review were: 1) Studies that analyzed the SLC12A3 gene in individuals with Type 2  and Gitelman Syndrome. 2) Use of at least one analysis investigating the association between the Arg913Gln variation of SLC12A3 gene with diabetic nephropathy. 3) Use of a case-control or follow-up design. 4) Investigation of type 2  in individuals with Gitelman's syndrome, with a history of diabetic nephropathy.The included studies comprised 2106 individuals with diabetic nephropathy. This review shows a significant genetic association in most studies in the Arg913Gln variation of SLC12A3 gene with the diabetic nephropathy, pointing out that the mutations of this gene could be a key predictor of end-stage renal disease.The results showed in this systematic review contribute to better understanding of the association between the Arg913Gln variation of SLC12A3 gene with the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in individuals with T2DM and GS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663190>ISPAD 2019 Author Index.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665244>The role of Ames dwarfism and calorie restriction on gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome (GM) represents a large and very complex ecosystem of different microorganisms. There is an extensive interest in the potential role of the GM in different diseases including cancer, , cardiovascular diseases, and aging. The GM changes over the lifespan and is strongly associated with various age-related diseases. Ames dwarf (df/df) mice are characterized by an extended life- and healthspan, and although these mice are protected from many age-related diseases, their microbiome has not been studied. To determine the role of microbiota on longevity animal models, we investigated the changes in the GM of df/df and Normal control (N) mice, by comparing parents before mating and littermate mice at three distinct time points during early life. Furthermore, we studied the effects of a 6-month calorie restriction (CR), the most powerful intervention extending the lifespan. Our data revealed significant changes of the GM composition during early life development, and we detected differences in the abundance of some bacteria between df/df and N mice, already in early life. Overall, the variability of the microbiota by genotype, time-point and breeding pair showed significant differences. In addition, CR caused significant changes in microbiome according to gastrointestinal (GI) location (distal colon, ileum and cecum), genotype and diet. However, the overall impact of the genotype was more prominent than that of the CR. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the gut microbiota plays an important role during post-natal development in long-living df/df mice and CR dietary regimen can significantly modulate the GM.© The Author(s) 2019.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 , insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue. Therefore, C1 was able to decrease the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 better than CLX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665268>Combinations of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Predictors for Prognoses in Patients with Acute Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>In contemporary heart failure (HF) practice, prognostic value for combinations of cardiac and non-cardiac predictors remains poorly understood. We analyzed combinatorial predictors of outcomes in acute HF patients.This longitudinal cohort study included consecutive patients admitted for acute decompensated HF between April 2015 and March 2018 in an urban hospital. The main outcomes are HF readmission within 6 months after discharge or all-cause death. A total of 451 patients with 662 admissions were enrolled and the data including frailty and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed by multivariate and matched cohort analyses.The mean age of patients was 76.8 years. We constructed a Multi-frailty Index (MFI) ranging from 0 to 3 points as a composite of non-cardiac comorbidities and biopsychosocial frailty. In matched cohort of patients with EF ≧50% (HFpEF), MFI ≧1, pulmonary hypertension (peak flow velocity of tricuspid regurgitation ≧2.9 m/s by echocardiography), and pancytopenia at discharge were strong predictors of HF readmission (Odds ratios, 4.33, 2.5, and 2.86; p = 0.02, 0.05, and 0.02, respectively), and MFI ≧2 was the only predictor for all-cause death. For EF < 40%, age, BNP ≧800 pg/ml, increase in estimated GFR during hospitalization, and lymphocytopenia plus anemia predicted HF readmission (Odds ratios, 1.77, 2.72, 0.73, and 2.89; p = 0.001, 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively).

NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2  (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse,  model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted -value;  ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C ω3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660112>Prevalence, Incidence and Ecological Determinants of Diabetic Retinopathy in Iran: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To estimate the pooled prevalence and incidence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Iran and to investigate their correlations with the Human Development Index (HDI), healthcare access (i.e., density of specialists and sub-specialists), and methodological issues.Electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and local databases were searched for cohort and cross-sectional studies published prior to January 2018. Prevalence and incidence rates of DR were extracted from January 2000 to December 2017 and random effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool was applied for quality assessment of eligible studies.A total of 55,445 participants across 33 studies were included. The pooled prevalence (95% CI) of DR in diabetic clinics (22 studies), eye clinics (4 studies), and general population (7 studies) was 31.8% (24.5 to 39.2), 57.8% (50.2 to 65.3), and 29.6% (22.6 to 36.5), respectively. It was 7.4% (3.9 to 10.8) for proliferative DR and 7.1% (4.9 to 9.4) for clinically significant macular edema. The heterogeneity of individual estimates of prevalence was highly significant. HDI (  < 0.001), density of specialists (  = 0.004), subspecialists (  < 0.001), and sampling site (  = 0.041) were associated with heterogeneity after the adjustment for type of DR, duration of , study year, and proportion of diabetics with controlled HbA1C.Human development and healthcare access were correlated with the prevalence of DR. Data were scarce on the prevalence of DR in less developed provinces.

The data collected consisted of the total procedures performed, demographic characteristics of the study population, rates of success, aborted procedure, failure, complications, and catheter survival, and costs.the main causes of end stage renal disease (ESRD) were systemic arterial hypertension and , 37.9% each. Patients had a high number of previous arteriovenous fistula (1.72 ± 0.84) and temporary catheter (2.87 ± 1.9) attempts until a definitive vascular access was achieved, while the preferred vascular site was right internal jugular vein (80%). Success, abortion, and failure rates were 93.3%, 2.7% and 4%, respectively, with only 5.36% of complications (minors). Overall LTCVC survival rates over 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 93.38, 71.81, 54.36, and 30.2%, respectively, with a mean of 298 ± 280 days (median 198 days). The procedure cost was around 496 dollars.

There were 168 females and 154 males with a median age of 71 years (range: 60-89 yrs).PROST (Project in Sado for Total Health), a medical database in Sado island Japan, was analyzed.Data on pure-tone audiometry, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), polymorphism of apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), , hypertension, smoking, and alcohol consumption were extracted. Hearing impairment was defined as an average frequency between 0.25 and 8 kHz that exceeded 30 dB. Multivariate analysis was used to identify which of the above factors could predict the hearing impairment. Hearing threshold of each Hz was compared between the ApoE4 (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) groups.Among various factors, only low MMSE scores (<24) showed significant association with hearing impairment. There were no differences in the hearing threshold of all frequencies between ApoE status groups.Hearing impairment was associated with low MMSE sores, regardless of the ApoE4 status. If ApoE4 status would be a common upstream predictor for both the hearing and cognitive impairment, hearing threshold would be related to ApoE4 status.

Very few patients with pituitary metastasis are symptomatic. It is often associated with presence of co-existing metastases to other organs. Isolated pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary malignancy is uncommon.A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of polyuria, increasing thirst and unexplained weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was scheduled as part of the investigation. She was kept nil per os for 10 h prior to EGD, after which she developed alteration of consciousness. Further investigation revealed hypernatremia with sodium level of 161 mmol/L and low urine osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg. Her urine output was 300 mL per hour.  (DI) was diagnosed based on evidence of polyuria, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality. Her urine output decreased and urine osmolality increased to 570 mOsm/kg in response to subcutaneous desmopressin acetate, confirming central DI. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous gadolinium enhancing lesion at the sellar and suprasellar regions, measuring 2.4 × 2.6 × 3.9 cm compressing both the hypothalamus bilaterally and the inferior aspect of optic chiasm as well as displacing the residual pituitary gland anteriorly. The posterior pituitary bright spot was absent. These MRI findings suggested pituitary macroadenoma. There were also multiple small gadolinium-enhancing lesions up to 0.7 cm in size with adjacent vasogenic brain edema at the subcortical and subpial regions of the left frontal and parietal areas, raising the concern of brain metastases. Pituitary hormonal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the pituitary tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma, originating from the lung. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was subsequently performed, showing a 2.2-cm soft tissue mass at the proximal part of right bronchus. There was no evidence of distant metastases elsewhere. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung with pituitary metastasis manifesting as panhypopituitarism and central DI. Palliative care along with hormonal replacement therapy was offered to the patient. She died 4 months after diagnosis.Diagnosis of pituitary metastasis is challenging, especially in patients with previously undiagnosed primary cancer.

The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, , family history of colon cancer was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04).

Primary outcome was disease remission after drug withdrawal or surgery. Secondary outcomes were biochemical control and side effects during dopamine agonist treatment and postoperative complications. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled proportions. Robustness of results was assessed by sensitivity analyses.A total of 1469 articles were screened: 55 (10 low risk of bias) on medical treatment (n=3564 patients) and 25 (12 low risk of bias) on transsphenoidal surgery (n=1836 patients). Long-term disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal was 34% (95%CI 26-46%) and 67% (95% CI 60-74%) after surgery. Subgroup analysis of microprolactinomas showed 36% (95% CI 21-52%) disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal and 83% (95% CI 76-90%) after surgery. Biochemical control was achieved in 81% (95% CI 75-87%) of patients during dopamine agonists with side effects in 26% (95%CI 13-41%). Transsphenoidal surgery resulted in 0% mortality, 2% (95% CI 0-5%) permanent , and 3% (95% CI 2-5%) cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Multiple sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.In the majority of prolactinoma patients disease remission can be achieved through surgery, with low risks of long-term surgical complications, and disease remission is less often achieved with dopamine agonists.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664995>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of SPRY2 in human hepatocytes leads to increased glucose uptake and lipid droplet accumulation.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities, including type 2  (T2DM), is dramatically increasing throughout the world; however, the underlying aetiology is incompletely understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662880>A mHealth Support Program for Australian Young Adults with Type 1 : A Mixed Methods Study.</a></h2><p>Young adulthood is a life stage comprised of many turning points. For young adults with type 1  (T1DM),  self-management support is crucial during this period. There is a lack of  education programs and services tailored to this population. This paper presents the findings, according to the STROBE guidelines, on the usability and acceptability of a patient-informed mHealth support program ( YES) that was developed for young adults with T1DM.A total of 34 young adults aged 18-35 years with T1DM participated in the  YES program over 12 weeks. Google analytics was used to tracked website use, while a website usability survey measured ease of use. Facebook analytics was used to measure peer support engagement. Evaluation of the program was completed using Likert scales and open-ended questions.Participants rated the website favourably for its ease of navigation and easy to understand information. Web page visits declined sharply while peer support group engagement through Facebook remained consistent throughout the intervention period. Participants utilised weekly discussion topics to generate conversation within the peer support group. Emotional support from peers was the highest regarded benefit reported by participants.

However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of 2.6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180.5 ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/m2, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, , and hyperlipidaemia): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes. Reverse remodelling was associated with improved long-term prognosis.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2019.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of  and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

Finerenone is a novel, nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that has shown to reduce albuminuria in type 2  (T2D) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) while revealing only a low risk of hyperkalemia. However, the effect of finerenone on CV and renal outcomes has not yet been investigated in long-term trials.The Finerenone in Reducing CV Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important CV and renal outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIGARO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 6 years. FIGARO-DKD randomized 7,437 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤5,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of the primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.FIGARO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of CV and renal events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.EudraCT number: 2015-000950-39; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .© 2019 S.

The current study aims to assess the effect of interpregnancy weight change on the risk of developing gestational , pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension, preterm birth, or delivering a large- or small-for-gestational age neonate.Pubmed, Ovid Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and the Cochrane library were systematically searched up until July 24th, 2019. Interpregnancy weight change was defined as the difference between pre-pregnancy weight of an index pregnancy and a consecutive pregnancy. Inclusion criteria included full text original articles reporting quantitative data about interpregnancy weight change in multiparous women with any time interval between consecutive births and the risk of any perinatal complication of interest. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios and a reference group of - 1 to + 1 BMI unit change between pregnancies were harmonised by meta-analysis.Twenty-three cohort studies identified a total of 671,906 women with two or more consecutive pregnancies. Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy weight gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational , pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy weight loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy weight gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m.These findings confirm that interpregnancy weight change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum weight loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy weight before conceiving again.

The amplified response of TSH to slight changes in thyroid hormone levels provides a large and easily measured signal in the routine care setting. Laboratories provide reference ranges with upper and lower cutoffs for TSH to define normal thyroid function. The upper limit of the range, used to diagnose subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism, is itself a matter for debate, with authoritative guidelines recommending treatment to within the lower half of the range. Concomitant diseases, medications, supplements, age, gender, ethnicity, iodine status, time of day, time of year, autoantibodies, heterophilic antibodies, smoking, and other factors influence the level of TSH, or the performance of current TSH assays. The long-term prognostic implications of small deviations of TSH from the reference range are unclear. Correction of TSH to within the reference range does not always bring thyroid and other biomarkers into range and will not always resolve the patient's symptoms. Overt hypothyroidism requires intervention with levothyroxine. It remains important that physicians managing a patient with symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease consider all of the patient's relevant disease, lifestyle, and other factors before intervening on the basis of a marginally raised TSH level alone. Finally, these limitations of TSH testing mitigate against screening the population for the undoubtedly substantial prevalence of undiagnosed thyroid disease, until appropriately designed randomised trials have quantified the benefits and harms from this approach.Copyright © 2019 Salman Razvi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665451>Sperm recovery and ICSI outcomes in men with non-obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Factor affecting sperm retrieval rate (SRR) or pregnancy rates (PR) after testicular sperm extraction (TESE) in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) have not been systematically evaluated. In addition, although micro-TESE (mTESE) has been advocated as the gold standard for sperm retrieval in men with NOA, its superiority over conventional TESE (cTESE) remains conflicting.The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the currently available studies comparing the techniques of sperm retrieval and to identify clinical and biochemical factors predicting SRR in men with NOA. In addition, PRs and live birth rates (LBRs), as derived from subjects with NOA post-ICSI, were also analysed as secondary outcomes.An extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane search was performed. All trials reporting SRR derived from cTESE or mTESE in patients with NOA and their specific determinants were included. Data derived from genetic causes of NOA or testicular sperm aspiration were excluded.Out of 1236 studies, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, enrolling 21 404 patients with a mean age (± SD) of 35.0 ± 2.7 years. cTESE and mTESE were used in 56 and 43 studies, respectively. In addition, 10 studies used a mixed approach and 8 studies compared cTESE with mTESE approach. Overall, a SRR per TESE procedure of 47[45;49]% (mean percentage [95% CI]) was found. No differences were observed when mTESE was compared to cTESE (46[43;49]% for cTESE versus 46[42;49]% for mTESE). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SRR per cycle was independent of age and hormonal parameters at enrolment. However, the SRR increased as a function of testis volume. In particular, by applying ROC curve analysis, a mean testis volume higher than 12.5 ml predicted SRR >60% with an accuracy of 86.2% ± 0.01. In addition, SRR decreased as a function of the number of Klinefelter's syndrome cases included (S = -0.02[-0.04;-0.01]; P < 0.01. I = 0.12[-0.05;0.29]; P = 0.16). Information on fertility outcomes after ICSI was available in 42 studies. Overall, a total of 1096 biochemical pregnancies were reported (cumulative PR = 29[25;32]% per ICSI cycle). A similar rate was observed when LBR was analysed (569 live births with a cumulative LBR = 24[20;28]% per ICSI cycle). No influence of male and female age, mean testis volume or hormonal parameters on both PR and LBR per ICSI cycle was observed. Finally, a higher PR per ICSI cycle was observed when the use of fresh sperm was compared to cryopreserved sperm (PR = 35[30;40]%, versus 20[13;29]% respectively): however, this result was not confirmed when cumulative LBR per ICSI cycle was analysed (LBR = 30[20;41]% for fresh versus 20[12;31]% for cryopreserved sperm).This analysis shows that cTESE/mTESE in subjects with NOA results in SRRs of up to 50%, with no differences when cTESE was compared to mTESE. Retrieved sperms resulted in a LBR of up to 28% ICSI cycle. Although no difference between techniques was found, to conclusively clarify if one technique is superior to the other, there is a need for a sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare mTESE to cTESE in men with NOA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Unfortunately, current MHCII-αβ chain heterodimerization strategies are typically associated with low production yields and require the use of foreign affinity tags for purification, precluding therapeutic applications in humans. Here, we show that fusion of peptide-tethered or empty MHCII-αβ chains to the IgG1-Fc mutated to form knob-into-hole structures results in the assembly of highly stable pMHCII monomers. This design enables the expression and rapid purification of challenging pMHCII types at high yields without the need for leucine zippers and purification affinity tags. Importantly, this design increases the antigen-receptor signaling potency of multimerized derivatives useful for therapeutic applications and facilitates the detection and amplification of low-avidity T cell specificities in biological samples using flow cytometry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665323>Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening II: effect of treating maternal sub-optimal thyroid function on child behaviour.</a></h2><p>The Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening (CATS) study was the first randomised controlled trial to investigate effects of treating suboptimal-gestational-thyroid-function (SGTF) on child cognition. Since observational studies indicated that SGTF may also increase symptoms of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the CATS cohort was used to investigate whether treatment of mothers affected their children's behavior.Mothers (N=475) completed 3 questionnaires, strengths and difficulties (SDQ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social communication (SCQ, used as a screen for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)), about their children (aged 9.5 years). Group comparisons of total scores, numbers of children above clinical thresholds and association between high maternal FT4 (>97.5th percentile of the UK cohort, 'over-treated') and child neurodevelopment were reported.There were no differences in total scores between normal-GTF (n=246), treated (n=125) and untreated (n=104) SGTF groups. More children of treated mothers scored above clinical thresholds, particularly the over-treated. Scores were above thresholds in SDQ conduct 22% vs 7%, SCQ total scores 7% vs 1%, and ADHD hyperactivity 17% vs 5% when comparing over-treated (n=40) and untreated (N=100) respectively. We identified significantly higher mean scores for SDQ conduct (adjusted mean difference (AMD) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.021 to 1.431, P=0.040, effect size 0.018) and ADHD hyperactivity (AMD 1.60, CI 0.361 to 2.633, P=0.003, effect size 0.028) comparing over-treated with normal-GTF children.There was no overall association between SGTF and offspring ADHD, ASD or behavior questionnaire scores. However, children of 'over-treated' mothers displayed significantly more ADHD symptoms and behavioral difficulties than normal-GTF.

Benign call rates (BCR) and surgical outcomes were compared. Histopathologic data were collected on nodules that were surgically resected to calculate measures of test performance.The BCR was 41% (73/178) for GEC and 67.8% (82/121) for GSC (p<0.001). Among specimens with dominant Hürthle cell cytology, the BCR was 22% (6/27) for GEC and 63.2% (12/19) for GSC (p=0.005). The overall surgery rate decreased from 47.8% in the GEC group to 34.7% in the GSC group (p=0.025). One GEC-benign and three GSC-benign nodules proved to be malignant in surgical excision. GSC had a statistically significant higher specificity (94% vs 60%, p<0.001) and positive predictive value (PPV) (85.3% vs 40%, p<0.001) compared to GEC. While sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) dropped with GSC (97.0% vs 90.6% and 98.6% vs 96.3%, respectively), these differences were not significantly different.GSC reclassified more indeterminate nodules as benign and improved the specificity and PPV of the test.

We aimed to investigate the relation between fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level and risk of infection-related morbidity and mortality.The participants were from a community-based health screening program in northern Taiwan during 2005-2008 (n = 118 645) and were followed up until 2014. Incidence of hospitalization for infection and infection-related death was ascertained from the National Health Insurance Database and National Death Registry. Cox proportional hazards regression modelling was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) between FPG and risk of infection.During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, the incidence rate of hospitalization for any infection was 36.33 and 14.26 per 1000 person-years among diabetics and nondiabetics, respectively, in the total study population, but increased to 70.02 and 45.21 per 1000 person-years, respectively, in the elderly. In the Cox regression analysis, the adjusted HR comparing diabetics to nondiabetics was 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-1.67) for any hospitalization for infection and 1.71 (95% CI, 1.36-2.16) for infection-related mortality. The hazard for infection morbidity and mortality was higher at both extremes (<90 and >200 mg/dl) of FPG.

The data were analyzed from June 2018 to May 2019.Resting and exercise gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.Of 295 participants, 121 (41.0%) were men (mean [SD] age, 64 [12] years) and 174 (59.0%) were women (mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with men, women with HFpEF in this tertiary referral cohort had fewer comorbidities, including , insulin resistance, and hypertension, and a more favorable adipokine profile. Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak oxygen [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -2.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction.

The prevalence for mild / moderate and risk use was 9.4% (95% CI: 8.4- 10.6%) and 4.6% (95%CI: 4.0-5.3%), respectively. The two consumption patterns were inversely associated with age and more frequent among men, better schooling, smokers and physical activity practitioners. Mild / moderate consumption was less frequent among non-whites and those with a history of stroke and , whereas risk use was less frequent among the elderly diagnosed for heart disease and more frequent among those suffering from depression. This result identifies profiles of greater vulnerability, with small differences between two patterns of consumption. This information should be considered in the preparation of proposals to promote healthy habits and control of alcohol use among the elderly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663776>Site-specific chemoproteomic profiling of targets of glyoxal.</a></h2><p> Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the biomarkers of aging and  which are formed via reactions between glycating agents and biomacromolecules. However, no proteomic study has been reported to systematically investigate the protein substrates of AGEs.  In this paper, we used an aniline-based probe to capture the glyoxal-imine intermediate which is the transition sate of glyoxal-derived AGEs. Combined with the tandem orthogonal proteolysis activity-based protein profiling strategy, we successfully identified 962 lysines modified by glyoxal.  Enzymes in glycolysis are heavily modified by glyoxal and our biochemical experiments showed that glyoxal can significantly inhibit the activity of GAPDH and glycolysis. These data indicated that AGEs modifications may contribute to pathological processes through impairing the glycolytic process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665449>Urine steroid metabolomics as a novel tool for detection of recurrent adrenocortical carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Urine steroid metabolomics, combining mass spectrometry-based steroid profiling and machine learning, has been described as a novel diagnostic tool for detection of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC).This proof-of-concept study evaluated the performance of urine steroid metabolomics as a tool for post-operative recurrence detection after microscopically complete (R0) resection of ACC.135 patients from 14 clinical centers provided post-operative urine samples, which were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We assessed the utility of these urine steroid profiles in detecting ACC recurrence, either when interpreted by expert clinicians, or when analyzed by Random Forest, a machine learning-based classifier. Radiological recurrence detection served as the reference standard.Imaging detected recurrent disease in 42 of 135 patients; 32 had provided pre- and post-recurrence urine samples. 39 patients remained disease-free for ≥3 years. The urine "steroid fingerprint" at recurrence resembled that observed before R0 resection in the majority of cases. Review of longitudinally collected urine steroid profiles by three blinded experts detected recurrence by the time of radiological diagnosis in 50-72% of cases, improving to 69-92%, if a pre-operative urine steroid result was available. Recurrence detection by steroid profiling preceded detection by imaging by more than 2 months in 22-39% of patients. Specificities varied considerably, ranging from 61 to 97%. The computational classifier detected ACC recurrence with superior accuracy (sensitivity=specificity=81%).Urine steroid metabolomics is a promising tool for post-operative recurrence detection in ACC; availability of a pre-operative urine considerably improves the ability to detect ACC recurrence.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661834>Estimation of Biological Parameters of Cutaneous Ulcers Caused by Leishmaniasis in an Animal Model Using Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease that requires novel tools for its understanding, diagnosis, and treatment follow-up. In the cases of other cutaneous pathologies, such as cancer or cutaneous ulcers due to , optical diffuse reflectance-based tools and methods are widely used for the investigation of those illnesses. These types of tools and methods offer the possibility to develop portable diagnosis and treatment follow-up systems. In this article, we propose the use of a three-layer diffuse reflectance model for the study of the formation of cutaneous ulcers caused by CL. The proposed model together with an inverse-modeling procedure were used in the evaluation of diffuse-reflectance spectral signatures acquired from cutaneous ulcers formed in the dorsal area of 21 golden hamsters inoculated with Leishmanisis braziliensis. As result, the quantification of the model's variables related to the main biological parameters of skin were obtained, such as: diameter and volumetric fraction of keratinocytes, collagen; volumetric fraction of hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation. Those parameters show statistically significant differences among the different stages of the CL ulcer formation. We found that these differences are coherent with histopathological manifestations reported in the literature for the main phases of CL formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663987>Plasma levels of miR-30d-5p are decreased in regularly exercising postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>Plasma/serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are proposed to have a role in the development of osteoporosis, and their levels can be affected by physical activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze differences in plasma miRNAs levels in postmenopausal women and to simultaneously find novel extracellular miRNAs that are associated with variations in physical activities.We measured hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, and hsa-miR-30d-5p in a cohort of 149 postmenopausal women divided into subgroups based on the amount of physical activity by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Further, the correlation of plasma microRNAs with sit-to-stand performance was examined. DIANA web server was used to find which Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (P < 0.05) were regulated by miRNAs associated with physical activity and sit-to-stand performance.Plasma levels of hsa-miR-30d-5p were significantly (P = 0.015) lower in participants with higher physical activity, and a borderline trend for hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.06) was noticed. Higher plasma levels of hsa-miR-21-5p (P = 0.01) and hsa-miR-93-5p (P = 0.04) were observed in the group with reduced sit-to-stand performance. The two miRNAs seem to primarily regulate fatty acid metabolism-related processes.Our results suggest that levels of selected cell-free miRNAs in postmenopausal women are associated with different physical activity regimes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661606>Association between cancer antigen 19-9 and  risk: a prospective and Mendelian randomization study.</a></h2><p>Elevated serum cancer antigen 19-9(CA19-9) levels have been found in  patients in most observational studies; however, whether there is causal association between CA19-9 and  (DM) is unclear.Our study was conducted based on the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort comprising 27,009 individuals. We first investigated the associations between serum CA19-9 levels and incident DM risk in a prospective cohort study (12,700 individuals). Then, we explored the potential causal relationship between CA19-9 and DM risk in a cross-sectional study (3,349 DM cases and 8,341 controls) using Mendelian randomization analysis. A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated by adding the CA19-9 increasing alleles in five SNPs (rs17271883, rs3760776 and rs3760775 in FUT6, rs11880333 in CA11, rs265548 in B3GNT3, and rs1047781 in FUT2) which were identified in previous genome-wide association study on serum CA19-9 levels.In the prospective study, a total of 1,004 incident DM cases were diagnosed during mean 4.54 years of follow-up period. Elevated serum CA19-9 level was associated with a higher incident  risk after adjustment for confounders, with a HR of 1.20 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.30) per SD (12.17U/ml) CA19-9 increased. Using the genetic score to estimate the unconfounded effect, we did not find causal association of CA19-9 with  risk (OR per weighted CA19-9-increasing allele: 0.99; 95 % CI: 0.94-1.04; P=0.61).The present study does not support a causal association of serum CA19-9 with  risk. CA19-9 might be a potential biomarker of incident DM risk.© 2019 The Authors.

Among many proteases, serine protease has been attractive in treating metabolic disorder  (DM). Gliptins have been proven to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), a serine protease, and are an emerging therapeutic drug target to reduce blood glucose levels, but until now there is no natural cyclic peptide proven to inhibit serine protease DPP4. This study demonstrates the potential mechanism of natural cyclic peptide oxytocin (OXT) as a DPP4 inhibitor. To achieve this, initially, activity atlas and field-based models of DPP4 inhibitors were utilized to predict the possible features of positive and negative electrostatic, hydrophobic, and activity shapes of DPP4 inhibition. Oxytocin binding mode, flexibility, and interacting residues were studied using molecular docking simulations studies. 3D-RISM calculations studies revealed that the stability of water molecules at the binding site are favorable. Finally, an experimental study using fluorescence assay revealed OXT inhibits DPP4 in a concentration-dependent manner in a significant way ( < 0.05) and possess IC of 110.7 nM. These new findings significantly expand the pharmaceutical application of cyclic peptides, and in specific OXT, and implicate further optimization of OXT inhibition capacity to understand the effect of DPP4 inhibition. This work highlights the development of natural cyclic peptides as future therapeutic peptides to reduce glucose levels and treat .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661980>Understanding and Influencing Occupational Sedentary Behavior: A Mixed-Methods Approach in a Multiethnic Asian Population.</a></h2><p>We aim to assess sedentary behavior (SB) and its determinants, as well as potential strategies to reduce SB among employees in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, using a mixed-methods approach grounded in the socioecological framework. All employees with email and security guards of a tertiary hospital in Singapore were invited to complete a questionnaire that captured sociodemographics and self-reported domain-specific SB. Environmental influences of occupational SB were assessed using an adapted version of the Checklist for Health Promotion Environments at the Worksite (CHEW). Focus group discussion (FGD) addressed perceptions, barriers, and strategies toward reducing workplace SB. Analyses were performed separately and integrated using an inductive comparative approach. The median occupational sitting time ( = 938) was 300 minutes/day, and highest among administrative staff (administrative, 421 minutes/day; allied health, 300 minutes/day; ancillary, 300 minutes/day; nursing, 120 minutes/day; medical/dental/others, 240 minutes/day;  value: <.001). The CHEW assessment identified poor physical and information environment contributing to occupational SB. FGDs confirmed an unsupportive environment and elicited barriers such as low SB awareness, nature of work, and workplace norms. Besides environmental approaches, participants suggested having face-to-face communication and social modelling to promote more breaks from sitting. This mixed-methods study among diverse professional groups of a tertiary hospital indicated a large amount of occupational SB, particularly among administrative staff. Raising awareness of the health risks of SB and building a supportive organizational culture, information, and physical environment emerged as significant factors. To reduce occupational SB, multicomponent interventions addressing these diverse factors are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665258>Differential Epigenetic Factors in the Prediction of Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetic Patients.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia can strongly alter the epigenetic signatures in many types of human vascular cells providing persistent perturbations of protein-protein interactions both in micro- and macro domains. The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with obesity and . Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need of combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.© The Author(s) 2019.

Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and  is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type 2 .We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type 2 .We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without  at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident  were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type 2  were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 , with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident , with an  2.81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type 2 , independent of traditional  risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute.

Participants included: 263 survey respondents with EM, 18 women interviewed, and 11 women and 6 HPs in pilot-testing. Main outcome measures were: survey-perceptions regarding communication with HPs, likeliness to use a QPL and QPL topics; interviews-QPL user-friendliness and acceptability; pilot study-women's QPL use, perceived helpfulness and future use, and HPs' perceived acceptability. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and thematic analysis.Women's perceived communication difficulties most commonly related to sexual function (50.6%), vaginal/urinary symptoms (43%), and psychological effects (41.1%). Most women (67.3%) indicated they were very likely to use an EM QPL. EM symptoms, effects, and management were considered very important/essential QPL topics (>80%). Interviewed women perceived the QPL as comprehensive, user-friendly, informative, and empowering. Most pilot study women asked 1 to 2 questions (73%), perceived the QPL as helpful (100%), and would use it again (81.8%). HPs reported that the QPL helped patients to ask questions and initiate discussion about important and sensitive issues.Women with EM have unmet information and communication needs, and are supportive of a comprehensive EM QPL.

Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to insulin resistance and type 2 . At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis.

The effect of HIIT was greater compared with MICT ( = 0.017).Treadmill walking HIIT seems a safe and more effective exercise strategy on immediate acute glycemic control compared with MICT in middle-aged and older patients with T2D under therapy with metformin and/or gliptins.ISRCTN09240628.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663189>Oral Sessions.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664427>Association Between Bariatric Surgery and Long-term Health Care Expenditures Among Veterans With Severe Obesity.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery has been associated with improvements in health in patients with severe obesity; however, it is unclear whether these health benefits translate into lower health care expenditures.To examine 10-year health care expenditures in a large, multisite retrospective cohort study of veterans with severe obesity who did and did not undergo bariatric surgery.A total of 9954 veterans with severe obesity between January 1, 2000, and September 30, 2011, were identified from veterans affairs (VA) electronic health records. Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity,  status, and VA regional network and were closest in age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe obesity, 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52.5 (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at 5 years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged 5 to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe obesity, total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660866>Impact on core values of family medicine from a 2-year Master's programme in Gezira, Sudan: observational study.</a></h2><p>Training of family physicians should include not only clinical and procedural skills, but also core values as comprehensive care, continuity of care, leadership and patient-centeredness. The Gezira Family Medicine Project (GFMP) is a 2 years Master's programme in family medicine in Sudan. We assessed the impact of GFMP on the candidates' adherence to some core values of family medicine.This is a prospective study with before-after design based on repeated surveys. We used Patient-Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS) to assess physicians' attitude towards patient-centeredness. Practice based data from individual patients' consultations and self-assessment methods were used to assess physicians' adherence to core values.At the end of the programme the candidates (N = 110) were significantly more active in community health promotion (p <  0.001), more confident as a team leader (p = 0.008), and showed increased adherence to national guidelines for managing  (p = 0.017) and hypertension (p = 0.003). The responding candidates had more knowledge about patients' medical history (p <  0.001), family history (p < 0.001) and family situation (p < 0.001). There were more planned follow up consultations (p < 0.001) and more referrals (p = 0.040). In contrast, results from PPOS showed slightly less orientation towards patient-centeredness (p = 0.007).The GFMP Master's programme induced a positive change in adherence to several core values of family medicine.

We aimed to evaluate the inter- and intraobserver variation of semiautomated segmentation, to assess whether multiple observers may interchangeably perform this task.Anonymised, unenhanced, single mid-abdominal CT images were acquired from 132 subjects from two previous studies. Semiautomated segmentation was performed using a proprietary software package. Abdominal muscle compartment (AMC), inter- and intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were identified according to pre-established attenuation ranges. The segmentation was performed by four observers: an oncology resident with extensive training and three radiographers with a 2-week training programme. To assess interobserver variation, segmentation of each CT image was performed individually by two or more observers. To assess intraobserver variation, three of the observers did repeated segmentations of the images. The distribution of variation between subjects, observers and random noise was estimated by a mixed effects model. Inter- and intraobserver correlation was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).For all four tissue compartments, the observer variations were far lower than random noise by factors ranging from 1.6 to 3.6 and those between subjects by factors ranging from 7.3 to 186.1. All interobserver ICC was ≥ 0.938, and all intraobserver ICC was ≥ 0.996.Body composition segmentation showed a very low level of operator dependability. Multiple observers may interchangeably perform this task with highly reproducible results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665329>Is chemotherapy implicated in the development of hypopituitarism in childhood cancer survivors?</a></h2><p>Endocrine sequelae are a frequent result of therapy aimed at inducing remission in childhood cancer survivors. Hypopituitarism is the consequence of insults directed at the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, in particular surgery and radiotherapy. The question of whether chemotherapy, in the absence of concomitant radiotherapy, can induce hypopituitarism in susceptible individuals has been raised by a number of studies over the last 30 years. Where described the pituitary hormone deficit in question is almost exclusively growth hormone. Studies have been of variable quality, with endocrine testing that fails to hold up to scrutiny. There is thus no robust data to support this hypothesis, in particular no single agent or class of chemotherapeutic agent has been implicated, and the mechanism of action remains elusive.© Endocrine Society 2019.

The simulation was conducted using secondary data from a population-based physician KAB survey on  risk management with antipsychotic use in Missouri Medicaid ( = 973 accrued over 30 weeks). Survey item responses were compared using Pearson's chi-square tests for two faster completion simulations: Fixed Sample ( = 300) and Fixed Time (8 weeks).Survey response rates ranged from 7% to 100% (median = 48%, IQR = 34%-68%). Surveys of targeted populations and surveys using member lists were associated with higher response rates ( = 0.02). In the simulation, 9 of 20 (45%) KAB items, including  screening advocacy, differed significantly using the smaller Fixed Sample strategy (achieved in 12 days) versus full accrual. Fewer response differences were found using the Fixed Time strategy (2 of 20 [10%] items).Published data on physician surveys report low response rates with most associated with the sample source selected.

However, data available concerning the prevalence of new-onset CTO of native vessels in patients with prior CABG is limited. Therefore, the objective of the study is to determine predictors for new native-vessel occlusion in patients with prior coronary bypass surgery.354 patients with prior CABG receiving follow-up angiography are selected and analyzed in the present study, with clinical and angiographic variables being analyzed by logistic regression to determine the predictors of new native-vessel occlusion.The overall new occlusion rate was 35.59%, with multiple CTOs (42.06%) being the most prevalent (LAD 24.60% and RCA 18.25%, respectively). Additionally, current smoking (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 2.60 to 2.74; =0.01), reduced ejection fraction (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.97; =0.04), severe stenosis (OR: 3.65; 95% CI: 2.55 to 5.24; =0.01), and  (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.97; =0.04) serve as the independent predictors for new native-vessel occlusion.As to high incidence of postoperative CTO, appropriate revascularization strategies and postoperative management should be taken into careful consideration.Copyright © 2019 Ze Zheng et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663375>Interleukins and miRNAs intervene in the early stages of diabetic kidney disease in Type 2  patients.</a></h2><p> The involvement of proinflammatory interleukins (ILs) in diabetic kidney disease of Type 2  (DM) patients was studied in relation to a particular miRNA profile.

However, it is not fully understood how spinal dorsal horn neurons are excited during the voiding reflex. In this study, we developed an in vivo technique allowing recording of superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons concurrent with intravesical pressure (IVP) during the micturition cycle in both normal and diabetic rats.Lumbosacral dorsal horn neuronal activity and IVP were recorded from urethane-anesthetized naive and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Saline was continuously perfused into the urinary bladder through a cannula to induce micturition.We classified SDH neurons into bladder- and urethral-responsive neurons, based on their responsiveness during the voiding reflex. Bladder-responsive SDH neurons responded to the rapid increase in IVP at the start of voiding. In contrast, urethral-responsive SDH neuronal firing increased at the peak IVP and their firing lasted during the voiding phase (the high-frequency oscillations). Urethral-responsive SDH neurons were more sensitive to capsaicin, received C afferent fiber inputs, and were rarely detected in STZ- rats. Administration of a cyclohexenoic long-chain fatty alcohol (TAC-302), which is reported to promote neurite outgrowth of peripheral nerves in STZ-diabetic rats, prevented the functional loss of spinal urethral response.Sensory information from the bladder and urethra is conveyed separately to different groups of SDH neurons. Functional loss of spinal urethral sensory information through unmyelinated C afferent fibers may contribute to diabetic bladder dysfunction.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665262>mCSM-AB2: Guiding Rational Antibody Design Using Graph-Based Signatures.</a></h2><p>A lack of accurate computational tools to guide rational mutagenesis has made affinity maturation a recurrent challenge in antibody development.

The primary goal of this study was to determine predictors of revascularization.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on data collected from records of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization at Al-Arabi Heart Center in Palestine in 2017. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess the association of sociodemographic and pre-catheterization clinical predictors with revascularization.A total of 1550 patients were included in the study. The participants mean age was 58 with a SD of 11.7 years, 73.6% were males. 50.2% of patients who underwent an interventional cardiac catheterization tested negative for troponin on presentation. Multivariate logistic regression showed Troponin (RR = 4.5), Age (RR = 1.0), Female gender (RR = 0.4) previous catheterization (RR = 2.0), and existence of  as significant predictors for revascularization. The correlation between ECG on presentation and the subsequent need for an interventional cardiac catheterization was significant only in case of ST-Elevation (RR = 1.5), and T wave inversion (RR = 1.6). CK-MB, Hypertension and ECG with ST-depression were not significant predictors.This study assessed revascularization predictors in addition to characteristics and outcomes of patients who have undergone cardiac catheterization. The results showed the especially high predictive value of troponin in determining the need for revascularization which outweighed the importance of ECG findings on presentation in making clinical decision regarding catheterization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662874>Protocol for the Study of Heart and Renal Protection-Extended Review: Additional 5-Year Follow-up of the Australian, New Zealand, and Malaysian SHARP Cohort.</a></h2><p>There are limited studies on the effects of statins on outcomes in the moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) population and their trajectory to end-stage kidney disease.To examine the long-term effects of lipid-lowering therapy on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, CKD progression, and socioeconomic well-being in Australian, New Zealand, and Malaysian SHARP (Study of Heart and Renal Protection) trial participants-a randomized controlled trial of a combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe, compared with placebo, for the reduction of cardiovascular events in moderate to severe CKD.Protocol for an extended prospective observational follow-up.Australian, New Zealand, and Malaysian participating centers in patients with advanced CKD.All SHARP trial participants alive at the final study visit.Primary outcomes were measured by participant self-report and verified by hospital administrative data.

Here we identify a hypothalamus to telencephalon neural pathway for regulating impulsivity involving communication from melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing lateral hypothalamic neurons to the ventral hippocampus subregion (vHP). Results show that both site-specific upregulation (pharmacological or chemogenetic) and chronic downregulation (RNA interference) of MCH communication to the vHP increases impulsive responding in rats, indicating that perturbing this system in either direction elevates impulsivity. Furthermore, these effects are not secondary to either impaired timing accuracy, altered activity, or increased food motivation, consistent with a specific role for vHP MCH signaling in the regulation of impulse control. Results from additional functional connectivity and neural pathway tracing analyses implicate the nucleus accumbens as a putative downstream target of vHP MCH1 receptor-expressing neurons.

Obesity aggravates symptoms of SLE; however, these symptoms can be improved by weight loss through diet therapy and bariatric surgery. However, there are only a few reports regarding the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients with SLE. Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed  (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in weight. Her body mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her obesity and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her weight decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her weight was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial weight. Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through weight loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial weight loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665115>Macro vitamin B12: an underestimated threat.</a></h2><p>Background The correct identification of the macro-B12 interference (macroforms) is paramount to avoid potential erroneous clinical decisions. Our objectives were to determine whether immunoassays are affected by the presence of macro-B12 and to validate a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation procedure to detect it. Methods Sixty-two serum samples obtained from healthy volunteers were analyzed to determine recovery and reference intervals (RIs) following PEG precipitation. Thereafter, 50 serum samples with very high levels of B12 (>1476 pmol/L) were randomly selected to search for macro-B12 interferences. Serum samples obtained from healthy volunteers and related PEG aliquots were analyzed on a Cobas® immunoassay. Patients' samples were analyzed on both Cobas® and Architect® immunoassays. Finally, samples suspected to contain macro-B12 were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to confirm the presence of macro-B12. Results Recovery and post-PEG RIs determined on a Cobas 8000® in healthy volunteers ranged from 68.3% to 108.4% and from 122.1 to 514.4 pmol/L, respectively. Fifteen samples (30%) were found to show macro-B12 while using the recovery criteria, and nine samples (18%) while using the post-PEG RI. The other immunoassay ran on the Architect i2000® was also affected by the presence of macro-B12. Size-exclusion chromatography studies confirmed the presence of macro-B12 (immunoglobulin-B12 complexes). Conclusions The prevalence of macro-B12 in elevated B12 samples is high. We suggest to systematically screen for the presence of macro-B12 with PEG precipitation procedure in samples with elevated B12 levels to avoid potential misdiagnosis or harmful clinical consequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663410>Associations of physical activity and sedentary behavior with cardiometabolic biomarkers in prediabetes and type 2 : A compositional data analysis.</a></h2><p>ObjectivesTo investigate the associations between objectively measured sedentary behavior (SB), light-intensity physical activity (LIPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cardiometabolic and endocrine biomarkers, and to estimate the associations of reallocating time from one behavior to another with cardiometabolic and endocrine biomarkers.MethodsBaseline data from participants diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 , n=175, 58% men, mean (SD) age=64.4 (7.7), recruited to a physical activity intervention was used. Time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA was measured by accelerometer and transformed into isometric log-ratio coordinates. The associations between time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA and biomarkers were examined by linear regression models. The change in each outcome of reallocating time between the three behaviors was estimated.ResultsThe findings show strong positive associations of time spent in MVPA and negative associations of time spent in SB relative to time spent in the other behaviors with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and negative associations of time spent in SB with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, reallocation of 19 minutes MVPA to SB or to LIPA was associated with a 17% and 17% larger SAD, 39% and 36% larger HOMA-IR values and 3.3% and 2.3% lower levels of HDL, respectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis from a time-use perspective supports the current evidence that sedentary time is devastating for the cardiometabolic health. While LIPA probably requires more time, maintaining or increasing time in MVPA are the most important features of the time use behaviors when promoting a favorable cardiometabolic risk profile in adults with prediabetes and type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662068>Association Between Renal Function and Troponin T Over Time in Stable Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.</a></h2><p>Background People with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often have elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels. It remains unclear how cTnT levels develop over time in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to prospectively study the association between cTnT and GFR over time in older advanced-stage CKD patients not on dialysis. Methods and Results The EQUAL (European Quality Study) study is an observational prospective cohort study in stage 4 to 5 CKD patients aged ≥65 years not on dialysis (incident estimated GFR, <20 mL/min/1.73 m²). The EQUAL cohort used for the purpose of this study includes 171 patients followed in Sweden between April 2012 and December 2018. We used linear mixed models, adjusted for important groups of confounders, to investigate the effect of both measured GFR and estimated GFR on high-sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT) trajectory over 4 years. Almost all patients had at least 1 hs-cTnT measurement elevated above the 99th percentile of the general reference population (≤14 ng/L). On average, hs-cTnT increased by 16%/year (95% CI, 13-19; <0.0001). Each 15 mL/min/1.73 m lower mean estimated GFR was associated with a 23% (95% CI, 14-31; <0.0001) higher baseline hs-cTnT and 9% (95% CI, 5-13%; <0.0001) steeper increase in hs-cTnT. The effect of estimated GFR on hs-cTnT trajectory was somewhat lower than a previous myocardial infarction (15%), but higher than presence of  (4%) and male sex (5%). Conclusions In CKD patients, hs-cTnT increases over time as renal function decreases.

Diagnosis of DM was defined as having at least 2 of the following characteristics: fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl, 2010 WHO ICD-10 codes E11-E14, or prescription of antidiabetic drugs. To identify ART regimens associated with DM, we used competing risks regression models that considered mortality without DM as a competing event and adjusted for sex, age, pancreas disease, and stratified by groups defined by a score summarizing the propensity to receive a specific first-line ART regimen.Data from 35 710 adults (49.1% male; median age, 35.0 years; median follow-up, 2.0 years) were included. In the multivariable analysis with zidovudine+lamivudine+nevirapine as the reference group, a higher risk of DM was observed with TDF+lamivudine/emtricitabine+efavirenz (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.9), zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz (aSHR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.3), and TDF+lamivudine+LPV/r (aSHR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.9).Several of the WHO recommended ART regimens, particularly tenofovir + lamivudine +LPV/r and regimens containing efavirenz, may be associated with an increased risk of DM.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, little is known about the content, daily intake levels, and adequacy of fiber among pregnant women in many low-income settings. We aimed to identify common food items and determine adequacy of dietary fiber intake levels among pregnant women in rural Ethiopia. Dietary data were collected from a subsample ( = 55) of pregnant women enrolled to a larger prospective cohort study ( = 414). Dietary intake level was measured using repeated 24-hr dietary recall method and weighing the total amount of daily food. Fiber content was determined using the Weende method supplemented by other sources.The mean [±] dietary fiber intake level was 25.89 [±5.09 mg/g] per day, which declined across pregnancy trimester from 26.01 [±9.18 mg/g] to 22.67 [±9.01 mg/g] and 24.56 [±9.98 mg/g] during the first, to second and third pregnancy trimesters, respectively. Boiled cereals and coffee contributed to nearly two-thirds (63.2%) of the daily fiber intake, while the major bulk of daily food, enjera, contributed to less than a quarter (24.3%) of the fiber intake. Though dietary patterns favor diversified intake for fiber, the mean intake levels below the recommended levels and proportion of women getting adequate to the physiologic stages of pregnancy were inadequate compared to the standard. Mothers, in such community, could benefit from increasing overall intake of existing food to satisfy their fiber needs during pregnancy.© 2019 The Authors.

Emergency department visit was defined as the stay of the older adult in this service for up to 24 hours. The complexity of drug therapy was determined using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index. Potentially inappropriate drugs for use in older adults were classified according to the American Geriatric Society/Beers criteria of 2015. The outcome investigated was the frequency of visits to the emergency department within 30 days of discharge. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with the emergency department visit.A total of 255 elderly in the study, and 67 (26.3%) visited emergency department within 30 days of discharge. Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications for older adults did not present a statistically significant association.

A questionnaire with 22 questions prepared by the researchers was used. The margin of error was 5% and the confidence level was 95%. For the calculation, the two-proportion equality, Pearson correlation and ANOVA tests were used.Among the interviewees, 43% had chronic hypertension, 33.3% presented with up to 20 weeks of gestation, 23.7% presented after the 20th week of gestation, 62.3% were between 18 and 35 years of age, 78.1% had a family history of hypertension, and among those aged 36 to 45 years, 11.4% were in the first gestation, and 26.3% in the second gestation.

However, current guidelines do not include routine assessment of myocardial function. We investigated whether echocardiography provides incremental prognostic information in individuals with type 1  without known heart disease.A prospective cohort of individuals with type 1  without known heart disease was recruited from the outpatient clinic. Follow-up was performed through Danish national registers. The association of echocardiography with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the incremental prognostic value when added to the clinical Steno T1D Risk Engine were examined.A total of 1093 individuals were included: median (interquartile range) age 50.2 (39.2-60.3) years and HbA 65 (56-74) mmol/mol; 53% men; and mean (SD) BMI 25.5 (3.9) kg/m and  duration 25.8 (14.6) years. During 7.5 years of follow-up, 145 (13.3%) experienced MACE. Echocardiography significantly and independently predicted MACE: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% (n = 18) vs ≥45% (n = 1075), HR (95% CI) 3.93 (1.91, 8.08), p < 0.001; impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS), 1.65 (1.17, 2.34) (n = 263), p = 0.005; diastolic mitral early velocity (E)/early diastolic tissue Doppler velocity (e') <8 (n = 723) vs E/e' 8-12 (n = 285), 1.59 (1.04, 2.42), p = 0.031; and E/e' <8 vs E/e' ≥12 (n = 85), 2.30 (1.33, 3.97), p = 0.003. In individuals with preserved LVEF (n = 1075), estimates for impaired GLS were 1.49 (1.04, 2.15), p = 0.032; E/e' <8 vs E/e' 8-12, 1.61 (1.04, 2.49), p = 0.033; and E/e' <8 vs E/e' ≥12, 2.49 (1.41, 4.37), p = 0.001.

In healthy tissues, the maintenance of MQC depends upon an exquisite balance between mitophagy (removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy) and biogenesis (de-novo synthesis of mitochondria). Here, we show that mitophagy is disrupted in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and decoupled from mitochondrial biogenesis during the progression of the disease. Diabetic retinas from human post-mortem donors and experimental mice exhibit a net loss of mitochondrial contents during the early stages of the disease process. Using novel diabetic mitophagy-reporter mice (mitoQC-Ins2Akita) alongside pMitoTimer (a molecular clock to address mitochondrial-age dynamics), we demonstrate that mitochondrial loss arose due to an inability of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for -exacerbated mitophagy. However, as  duration increases, Pink1-dependent mitophagy deteriorates, leading to the build-up of mitochondria primed for degradation in DR. Impairment of mitophagy during prolonged  is linked with the development of retinal senescence, a phenotype that blunted hyperglycaemia-induced mitophagy in mitoQC primary Müller cells. Our findings suggest that normalizing mitochondrial turnover may preserve MQC and provide novel therapeutic options for the management of DR-associated complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664708>Dapagliflozin: A Review in Type 1 .</a></h2><p>Oral dapagliflozin (Edistride, Forxiga) is approved in the EU at a dosage of 5 mg/day as an adjunct to insulin in adults with type 1  (T1D) and a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 27 kg/m, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. As a highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin decreases plasma glucose levels independently of insulin action and enables glycaemic control improvement without increasing the risks associated with intensive insulin therapy. In the phase III DEPICT-1 and -2 trials, dapagliflozin 5 mg/day as an adjunct to insulin improved glycaemic control and reduced total daily insulin dose and bodyweight relative to placebo in adults with inadequately controlled T1D, including in patients with a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m, over 24 weeks of treatment. In extensions of these trials, these improvements were maintained up to 52 weeks. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety profile and a hypoglycaemia profile generally similar to placebo. The incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis with dapagliflozin in patients with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m was less than half that of the overall population who received dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin is the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved for use in T1D and, while further clinical experience in T1D is required to more definitively establish its efficacy and safety profile, it provides a promising adjunctive treatment option for adults with T1D and a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665370>Changes in Glycemic Load Are Positively Associated with Small Changes in Primary Stress Markers of Allostatic Load in Puerto Rican Women.</a></h2><p>Puerto Ricans experience a high prevalence of type 2 . Dietary glycemic load (GL) and allostatic load (AL) have been linked with . AL, the wear and tear on the body from chronic stress, starts with secretion of primary stress markers from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and immune system. GL can act as a physiological stressor, contributing to the primary AL response.We examined the relation between GL and a composite score of primary stress markers of AL in Puerto Rican adults.Data were from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, a cohort study of Puerto Ricans, aged 45-75 y, including 262 men and 697 women with complete data at baseline and 2-y follow-up. GL was calculated from dietary intake obtained with an FFQ. Sex-specific composite primary AL scores included markers of the HPA axis (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), SNS (epinephrine and norepinephrine), and immune system (C-reactive protein). Linear regression models were stratified by sex and adjusted for covariates.Mean ± SD baseline GL score was 155 ± 28 for men and 135 ± 34 for women. Mean primary stress AL score was 1.25 ± 1.14 for men and 1.25 ± 1.06 for women. GL was not associated with AL score in men. In women, increasing GL from baseline to 2 y was significantly associated with increasing AL, after adjusting for sociodemographics, physical activity, smoking, BMI, menopause, and baseline AL score (β = 0.03; P = 0.049). Results became marginally significant after further adjustment for chronic diseases (P = 0.06) and intake of fats (P values: saturated fats = 0.08; trans fats = 0.06; unsaturated fats = 0.07), but the magnitude of the association remained unchanged.Increasing GL over 2 y was positively associated with increasing composite score of primary markers of AL in Puerto Rican women.

This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of this biological checkup and to determine the most relevant parameters.We conducted a monocentric retrospective study of all standardized and systematically conducted blood tests (CBC and measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine) over a 15-month period among 726 French Army recruits.The population included mainly young males (85.4%, mean age 21.6 years). More than half (54.1%) of the blood tests had at least one abnormal parameter, most often concerning the CBC. Anemia occurred in 5.3% of the population and was mostly normocytic. Microcytosis was mostly not associated with anemia (72.3% of cases). Lymphopenia occurred in 20.1% of the population and was mostly mild. Eosinophilia was present in 5.1% of the population and was never severe. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 0.7% of the population and was never severe. Serum levels of aminotransferases were elevated in 8.1% of the population. Fasting plasma glucose averaged 84 mg/dL (SD: 0.07) ranging from 64 to 123 mg/dL, was abnormal in 0.4% of the population, and one case of  was diagnosed. Serum creatinine concentration was elevated in 0.7% of the population.CBCs gave useful information but iron deficiency was common and insufficiently detected by this single analysis. Assessing aminotransferase levels without screening for viral hepatitis and systematic measurement of fasting plasma glucose levels did not appear to be efficient. In addition, the only interest in systematic measurement of creatinine serum levels was to obtain a reference level for long-term follow-up. In addition to the urinary dipstick, the systematic biological checkup at recruitment could be limited to a CBC with measurement of plasma ferritin levels and Hepatitis B virus serology, providing that any CBC abnormalities, in particular cytopenia, eosinophilia, and microcytosis, are systematically investigated.

The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society.

By combining self-monitoring technologies, the acute physiological consequences of behaviors could be shown, prompting greater consideration to physical activity levels today, which impact the risk of developing  years or decades later. However, until recently, commercially available technologies have not been able to show individuals the health benefits of being physically active.The objective of this study was to examine the usage, feasibility, and acceptability of behavioral and physiological self-monitoring technologies in individuals at risk of developing T2D.A total of 45 adults aged ≥40 years and at moderate to high risk of T2D were recruited to take part in a 3-arm feasibility trial. Each participant was provided with a behavioral (Fitbit Charge 2) and physiological (FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitor) monitor for 6 weeks, masked according to group allocation. Participants were allocated to glucose feedback (4 weeks) followed by glucose and physical activity (biobehavioral) feedback (2 weeks; group 1), physical activity feedback (4 weeks) followed by biobehavioral feedback (2 weeks; group 2), or biobehavioral feedback (6 weeks; group 3). Participant usage (including time spent on the apps and number of glucose scans) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the feasibility (including recruitment and number of sensor displacements) and acceptability (including monitor wear time) of the intervention. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted at the 6-week follow-up appointment.For usage, time spent on the Fitbit and FreeStyle Libre apps declined over the 6 weeks for all groups. Of the FreeStyle Libre sensor scans conducted by participants, 17% (1798/10,582) recorded rising or falling trends in glucose, and 24% (13/45) of participants changed ≥1 of the physical activity goals. For feasibility, 49% (22/45) of participants completed the study using the minimum number of FreeStyle Libre sensors, and a total of 41 sensors were declared faulty or displaced. For acceptability, participants wore the Fitbit for 40.1 (SD 3.2) days, and 20% (9/45) of participants and 53% (24/45) of participants were prompted by email to charge or sync the Fitbit, respectively. Interviews unearthed participant perceptions on the study design by suggesting refinements to the eligibility criteria and highlighting important issues about the usability, wearability, and features of the technologies.Individuals at risk of developing T2D engaged with wearable digital health technologies providing behavioral and physiological feedback. Modifications are required to both the study and to commercially available technologies to maximize the chances of sustained usage and behavior change.

The potential relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and ultrasound-measured renal characteristics has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that exposure to tobacco smoke would be associated with reduced kidney dimensions.This was a cross-sectional study that included all individuals over age 18 at a single site in Mojokerto, Indonesia. A questionnaire was used to assess prior history and environmental exposure, and blinded evaluators performed ultrasound assessments. Six kidney parameters (length, width, and parenchymal thickness of each kidney) were considered as dependent variables, and statistical relationships were assessed using multivariate analysis. Echogenicity was evaluated using a 5-point grading scale described previously.Of the 445 participants assessed, a total of 138 male and 269 female subjects were included in the final analysis. There was a statistically significant association between kidney measures and the following independent variables: pack years smoking (p < 0.001), height (p < 0.001), weight (p < 0.001), and beginning to smoke at the age of 25 or younger (p < 0.001). There was not a statistically significant association between kidney measures and hypertension (p > 0.05) or  (p > 0.05). Echogenicity was similar among all smoking groups.Kidney dimensions were decreased in individuals with increased smoking history. This association is notable, particularly given that statistically significant associations were not observed between renal dimensions and hypertension or .

Therefore, we aim to assess the validity of REE predictive equations based on body composition variables in treatment-seeking Arab adults with overweight and obesity.Body composition and REE were measured by Tanita BC-418 bioimpedance and Vmax Encore 229 IC respectively, and predictive equations based on fat mass, fat-free mass were used in REE estimations among 87 adults of both genders, in the Outpatient Clinic in the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at Beirut Arab University (Lebanon). The mean differences between the measured and estimated REE values were calculated to assess accuracy, and the Bland-Altman method was used to assess the level of agreement.Ten predictive were included. In males, all predictive equations gave significantly different estimates of REE when compared to that measured by IC. On the other hand, in females, the mean difference between the REE value estimated by Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations and that measured using IC was not significant, and agreement was confirmed using Bland-Altman plots.We suggest Huang and Horie-Waitzberg equations for accurate REE estimation in females; however, new validated REE estimation equations for males in this population are still needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662018>Long-term training in -related knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practice among  liaison nurses.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664455>The Thyrotropin Reference Range Should Be Changed in Older Patients.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662781>Determination of Electroacupuncture Effects on circRNAs in Plasma Exosomes in Diabetic Mice: An RNA-Sequencing Approach.</a></h2><p>circRNAs are involved in  pathogenesis.

The aim of this study was to reveal the effect of EA on circRNA expression in plasma exosomes and the underlying signaling pathway in mice with type 2  (T2DM). In total, 10 mice were randomly categorized into a normal group and 20 mice were used for the T2DM model preparation and randomly divided into the model and model + EA groups. Mice in the model + EA group were administered EA treatment. Changes in the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and islet structure were evaluated. Plasma exosomes were subjected to RNA sequencing, and then bioinformatics analysis and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) verification were performed. EA treatment reduced the FBG level, preserved the islet structure, and reduced the islet  cell apoptotic rate in T2DM mice. After EA treatment, 165 differentially expressed circRNAs were found. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that thyroid hormone signaling was actively regulated by EA. circRNA/miRNA interaction analysis revealed mmu-mir-7092-3p to be closely associated with circINPP4B, suggesting that the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway may be affected by EA. qPCR confirmed that 12 circRNAs had significant differences. These findings suggested that EA intervention can significantly protect islet function and improve the FBG level in T2DM, possibly via regulation of thyroid hormone and phosphatidylinositol signaling.Copyright © 2019 Yin Shou et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661471>Relationship Between  and Cirrhosis Risk in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients in Wuhan, China.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND The objective of our research was to assess the possible link between  (DM) and liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals with a diagnosis of both liver cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection (n=257), and CHB-only patients (n=514) were matched 1: 2 by age and sex. Demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical characteristics were reviewed. Univariate and the multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to investigate the association between DM and HBV-related liver cirrhosis. RESULTS The prevalence of DM was higher among CHB patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without liver cirrhosis (22.2% vs. 12.8%, P=0.001), yielding an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 2.317 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.528-3.513. Among them, 87.7% of liver cirrhosis patients were diagnosed with DM before liver cirrhosis diagnosis, yielding an AOR (95% CI) of 2.386 (1.533-3.714). In comparison to patients with a DM duration of 2-5 years, the AOR (95% CI) for those with a DM duration >5 years was 2.073 (0.701-6.132). In DM treatment, the AOR (95% CI) for those treated with insulin was 4.746 (1.329-16.949). CONCLUSIONS DM was associated with cirrhosis risk in CHB patients in Wuhan, China.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660784>Sinus Bradycardia During Targeted Temperature Management: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effect of sinus bradycardia during targeted temperature management (TTM) in cardiac arrest patients remains doubtful. We aimed to investigate the impact of sinus bradycardia on survival and neurological outcome. MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for studies reporting on comatose postcardiac arrest patients presenting sinus bradycardia during TTM. Outcomes were the 180-day survival and final neurologic function assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale. The effect size on study outcomes is presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Two studies with 681 patients were included. Compared to no-sinus bradycardia group, in patients with sinus bradycardia below 50 bpm, a significant effect of sinus bradycardia on reduction of 180-day mortality was reported (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.29-0.59). No heterogeneity was detected. Sinus bradycardia below 50 bpm during TTM may be protective and should be considered in comatose postcardiac arrest patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663919>Neuropathic Arthropathy of the Shoulder: A Systematic Review of Classifications and Treatments.</a></h2><p>Neuropathic arthropathy of the shoulder is a chronic progressive process characterized by joint destruction in the presence of a neurosensory deficit. Causes include syringomyelia, syphilis, , chronic alcoholism, and leprosy, with syringomyelia accounting for the vast majority of upper-extremity Charcot joints. Early presentation of this rare condition includes nonspecific symptoms such as swelling, erythema, sensory symptoms, and decreased functionality, making diagnosis challenging.We systematically reviewed 32 case reports published between 1924 and 2016. A total of 59 shoulders from 56 patients are included in this analysis. Variables include patient demographic characteristics, presentation, etiology, diagnostic techniques, treatment, outcome, and follow-up of Charcot shoulder.We compiled a total of 25 right shoulders (42%), 24 left shoulders (41%), and 10 shoulders (17%) with unspecified laterality. The mean patient age (and standard deviation) was 49 ± 11 years, and the median age was 47 years. There was a higher prevalence in men (37 shoulders [63%]) compared with women (22 shoulders [37%]). Presenting symptoms included reduced range of motion (53 shoulders [90%]), paresthesia or hypoesthesia (45 [76%]), swelling (44 [75%]), weakness (40 [68%]), pain (31 [53%]), and reduction in deep tendon reflexes (22 [37%]). Shoulder radiographs were made in all cases. The presence of a syrinx was detected in 45 shoulders (76%) with magnetic resonance imaging, myelography, or clinical diagnosis. Sixteen shoulders (27%) reported exposure to trauma, with a 69% decrease in time from presentation to diagnosis compared with non-traumatic cases. Treatment was categorized as solely nonoperative management (14 [24%]), operative management (13 [22%]), combined therapy (20 [34%]), and no treatment listed (10 [17%]). Two surgical cases (3%) were excluded from our treatment group analysis as they were treated for unrelated or misdiagnosed conditions.Our study increases awareness and understanding of this complex, progressive disease to reduce delay and misdiagnosis and to contribute to the standard-of-care recommendations.Therapeutic Level IV.

However, studies assessing whether neuroticism is associated with adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes are scarce. This observational study comprises first-time mothers (n = 1969) with singleton pregnancies from several cohorts based in Uppsala, Sweden. To assess neuroticism-related personality, the Swedish universities Scales of Personality was used. Swedish national health registers were used to extract outcomes and confounders. In logistic regression models, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the outcomes by an increase of 63 units of neuroticism (equalling the interquartile range). Analyses were adjusted for maternal age, educational level, height, body mass index, year of delivery, smoking during pregnancy, involuntary childlessness, and psychiatric morbidity. Main outcomes were mode of delivery, gestational , gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, induction of delivery, prolonged delivery, severe lacerations, placental retention, postpartum haemorrhage, premature birth, infant born small or large for gestational age, and Apgar score. Neuroticism was not independently associated with adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes besides gestational . For future studies, models examining sub-components of neuroticism or pregnancy-specific anxiety are encouraged.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662353>Continuity of care and delivery of  and hypertensive care among regular users of primary care services in Chile: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Explore factors related to continuity of care and its association with  and hypertensive care, and disease control.Cross-sectional study.Data from the Chilean Health National Survey 2009-2010.Regular users of primary care services aged 15 or older.Proportion of hypertensive and diabetic patients with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg and HbA1c<7.0% respectively, self-report of diagnosis, treatment and recent foot and ophthalmological exams.

However, whether this association is causal is still unclear. We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with MS and its metabolic traits, using mendelian randomization (MR) methodology.Ten thousand six hundred fifty-five participants were enrolled from the SPECT-China study, which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014 to 2016. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 genes with known effects on 25(OH) D concentrations, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) as instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the effect of genetically lowered 25(OH) D on MS and cardiometabolic risk factors. MS was defined according to the International  Federation criteria.Lower measured 25(OH)D levels were associated with MS (OR 0.921, 95% CI 0.888, 0.954) after multivariable adjustment. However, the MR-derived odds ratio of genetically determined 25(OH) D for risk of MS was 0.977 (95% CI 0.966, 1.030). The MR-derived estimates for raised fasting plasma glucose was 0.578 (95% CI 0.321, 0.980) per 10 nmol/L GRS determined increase of 25(OH) D levels.We found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25(OH)D conferred an increased risk of MS and its metabolic traits. However, we created our GRS only on the basis of common variants, which represent limited amount of variance in 25(OH)D. MR studies using rare variants, and large-scale well-designed RCTs about the effect of vitamin D supplementation on MS are warranted to further validate the findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664483>Relationship between gut microbiota, probiotics, and type 2 .</a></h2><p>The worldwide prevalence of type 2  (T2DM) is constantly increasing, and it has become a major concern, with several implications for public health, economy, and social well-being. It is well-known that several factors such as lifestyle, increased intake of fat and sugar-rich foods, and host genetics can lead to T2DM. Some recent studies have suggested that the composition of the intestinal microbiota can trigger T2DM. Since then, considerable effort has been made to understand the link between the composition of intestinal microbiota and T2DM, as well as the role of probiotics in modulation of intestinal microbiota.

Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone 5 (MPC-5) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic acid (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC-5 cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA. High glucose can provoke MVs generation from glomerular podocytes through ROS/NOX4 pathway, not from mitochondrial pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663475>Gum Acacia Functional Significance in the Management of Obesity.</a></h2><p>Consumption of diets rich in fat and refined sugars are recognized to be the cause of altered intestinal functionality and metabolic disorders like obesity, insulin resistance, type 2  and cardiovascular diseases. Different epidemiologic studies have shown a significant relationship between lower intake of fibre and metabolic disorders. There are many naturally occurring dietary fibres among which gums are utmost important class e.g. guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, gellan gum, and gum acacia. Gum acacia has been considered as a safe dietary fibre by the United States, Food and Drug Administration and it is used widely as a stabilizer, thickening agent, and emulsifier in the food industry. Though gum acacia feeding has been reported to exert many beneficial effects in both rodents and humans, the underpinning for the different proposed molecular mechanisms are still elusive. So it would be of great relevance to conduct studies to understand the molecular mechanism of action of such fibres in the management of metabolic diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663844>Reduction of Resting Energy Expenditure and Sarcopenic Obesity in Adults with Overweight and Obesity: A Brief Report.</a></h2><p>The last decade has seen the emergence of a new condition, describing the coexistence of obesity and sarcopenia, termed sarcopenic obesity (SO). We aimed to assess the potential association between SO and reduced resting energy expenditure (REE).Body composition and REE were measured using a bioimpedance analyser (Tanita BC-418) and Indirect Calorimeter (Vmax Encore 229) respectively in 89 adults with overweight or obesity of both genders, referred to the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at Beirut Arab University (Lebanon). Participants were then categorized as having SO or not.Thirty-nine of the 89 participants met the criteria for SO (43.8%), and these participants displayed a significantly lower REE per unit body weight than those in the group without SO (19.02 ± 2.26 vs 20.87 ± 2.77; p = 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that the presence of SO decreases REE by 1.557 kcal/day for each kg of body weight (β = -1.557; CI = -0.261 ¬- (-0.503); p = 0.004), after adjusting for age and gender.SO appears to be present in a high proportion of treatment-seeking adults with overweight or obesity of both genders, and it seems to be associated with a reduced REE, compared with those without SO.

The extent of this variability is poorly studied amongst older adults, particularly amongst those with multiple health conditions, cognitive impairment or frailty. This study investigates the agreement between self-reported and general practice-recorded data amongst such patients and the impact of participant factors on this agreement.data on health conditions was collected from participants in the Community Ageing Research 75+ (CARE75+) study (n = 964) by self-report during face-to-face assessment and interrogation of the participants' general practice electronic health records. Agreement between self-report and practice records was assessed using Kappa statistics and the effect of participant demographics using logistic regression.agreement ranged from K = 0.25 to 1.00. The presence of ≥2 health conditions modified agreement for cancer (odds ratio, OR:0.62, 95%confidence interval, CI:0.42-0.94),  (OR:0.55, 95%CI:0.38-0.80), dementia (OR:2.82, 95%CI:1.31-6.13) and visual impairment (OR:3.85, 95%CI:1.71-8.62).

Infection of the diabetic foot is a common complication, which may lead to amputation. If infection extends to involve bone, the risk of amputation is increased 4-fold. Presence of osteomyelitis at the histopathologic margin of resection portends a poor prognosis in osteomyelitis outside the setting of the diabetic foot. We aimed to assess the association of a positive histopathologic margin with the outcome of osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot.Medical records were reviewed for all patients who underwent below-ankle amputation for osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot. Patients who had at least 1 year of follow-up, a histopathologic diagnosis of osteomyelitis, and a comment on whether the margin was involved were included.Thirty-nine of 66 (59%) cases had remission of osteomyelitis at 12 months. When comparing cases with remission with those who experienced recurrence in the 12 months of follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences in age, glycosylated hemoglobin, duration of antimicrobial therapy, Infectious Diseases Society of America class, or presence of osteomyelitis at the histopathologic margin. Among cases with a negative histopathologic margin, 29/48 (60.4%) were free of disease at 1 year, compared with 10/18 (55.6%) cases with a positive histopathologic margin ( = .72). Remission was significantly more frequent in cases undergoing amputation at the digit level (66.7%) compared with amputation at the metatarsal level (40.7%) ( = .045).Osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot at the histopathologic margin of resection was not associated with increased risk of treatment failure. Resection at the level of the digit was associated with a lower risk of failure than at the metatarsal level.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665216>Association of Copy Number Variation of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 Region With Cortical and Subcortical Morphology and Cognition.</a></h2><p>Recurrent microdeletions and duplications in the genomic region 15q11.2 between breakpoints 1 (BP1) and 2 (BP2) are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. These structural variants are present in 0.5% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-5). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on 5 of 7 tasks.These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664108>GPR40 activation initiates store-operated Ca entry and potentiates insulin secretion via the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway in pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>The long-chain fatty acid receptor GPR40 plays an important role in potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) from pancreatic β-cells. Previous studies demonstrated that GPR40 activation enhances Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by activating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors. However, it remains unknown how ER Ca release via the IP3 receptor is linked to GIIS potentiation. Recently, stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 was identified as a key regulator of store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), but little is known about its contribution in GPR40 signaling. We show that GPR40-mediated potentiation of GIIS is abolished by knockdown of IP3 receptor 1 (IP3R1), STIM1 or Ca-channel Orai1 in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells. STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown significantly impaired SOCE and the increase of intracellular Ca by the GPR40 agonist, fasiglifam. Furthermore, β-cell-specific STIM1 knockout mice showed impaired fasiglifam-mediated GIIS potentiation not only in isolated islets but also in vivo. These results indicate that the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway plays an important role in GPR40-mediated SOCE initiation and GIIS potentiation in pancreatic β-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662747>miR-29a Negatively Affects Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion and MIN6 Cell Proliferation via Cdc42/-Catenin Signaling.</a></h2><p> is a progressive metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. Functional impairment of islet  cells can occur to varying degrees. This impairment can initially be compensated for by proliferation and metabolic changes of  cells. Cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) and the microRNA (miRNA) miR-29 have important roles in -cell proliferation and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), which we further explored using the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6.Upregulation and downregulation of miR-29a and Cdc42 were accomplished using transient transfection. miR-29a and Cdc42 expression was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. MIN6 proliferation was detected using a cell counting kit assay. GSIS under high-glucose (20.0 mM) or basal-glucose (5.0 mM) stimulation was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The miR-29a binding site in the Cdc42 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) was determined using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays.miR-29a overexpression inhibited proliferation ( < 0.01) and GSIS under high-glucose stimulation ( < 0.01). Cdc42 overexpression promoted proliferation ( < 0.05) and GSIS under high-glucose stimulation ( < 0.05). miR-29a overexpression decreased Cdc42 expression ( < 0.01), whereas miR-29a downregulation increased Cdc42 expression ( < 0.01). The results showed that the Cdc42 mRNA 3'-UTR is a direct target of miR-29a . Additionally, Cdc42 reversed miR-29a-mediated inhibition of proliferation and GSIS ( < 0.01). Furthermore, miR-29a inhibited -catenin expression ( < 0.01), whereas Cdc42 promoted -catenin expression ( < 0.01).By negatively regulating Cdc42 and the downstream molecule -catenin, miR-29a inhibits MIN6 proliferation and insulin secretion.Copyright © 2019 Jing Duan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665438>The External Genitalia Score (EGS): A European multicenter validation study.</a></h2><p>Standardized description of external genitalia is needed in the assessment of children with atypical genitalia.To validate the External Genitalia Score (EGS), to present reference values for preterm and term babies up to 24 months and correlate obtained scores with anogenital distances (AGDs).A European multicentre (n=8) validation study was conducted from 07/2016 until 07/2018.EGS is based on the external masculinization score but uses a gradual scale from female to male (range 0-12) and terminology appropriate for both sexes. The reliability of EGS and AGD's were determined by the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Cross-sectional data were obtained in 686 term (0-24 months), and 181 preterm babies and 111 babies with atypical genitalia.ICC of EGS in typical and atypical genitalia is excellent and good. Median EGS (10th - 90th centile) in males < 28 weeks gestation is 10 (8.6-11.5); in males 28-32 weeks 11.5 (9.2-12); in males 33-36 weeks 11.5 (10.5-12) and in full-term males 12 (10.5-12). In all female babies, EGS is 0 (0-0). The mean (SD) AGDl/u is 0.45 (0.1), with significant difference between AGDl/u in males 0.49 (0.1) and females 0.39 (0.1) and in-between values in DSD 0.43 (0.1). AGDl/u correlates with EGS in males with typical genitalia and in atypical genitalia.EGS is a reliable and valid tool to describe external genitalia in premature and term babies up to 24 months. EGS correlates with AGDl/u in males. It facilitates standardized assessment, clinical decision-making and multicenter research.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

Here we report on the phases of developing and validating the self-report Type 1  and Life (T1DAL) measures for children (age 8-11) and adolescents (age 12-17).Measure development included qualitative interviews with youth and parents (n = 16 dyads) followed by piloting draft measures and conducting cognitive debriefing with youth (n = 9) to refine the measures. To evaluate the psychometric properties, children (n = 194) and adolescents (n = 257) at three T1D Exchange Clinic Network sites completed the age-appropriate T1DAL measure and previously validated questionnaires measuring related constructs. Using psychometric data, the investigators reduced the length of each T1DAL measure to 21 and 23 items, respectively, and conducted a final round of cognitive debriefing with six children and adolescents.The T1DAL measures for children and adolescents demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.84 and 0.89, respectively) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.78 and 0.80, respectively). Significant correlations between the T1DAL scores and measures of general quality of life, generic and -specific HRQOL,  burden, and  strengths demonstrated construct validity. Correlations with measures of self-management (child and adolescent) and glycemic control (adolescent only) demonstrated criterion validity. Factor analyses indicated four developmentally specific subscales per measure. Participants reported satisfaction with the measures.The new T1DAL measures for children and adolescents with T1D are reliable, valid, and suitable for use in care settings and clinical research.© The Author(s) 2019.

The HLA-B*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results provide evidence that β-cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661887>Pyrogallol-Phloroglucinol-6,6-Bieckol Alleviates Obesity and Systemic Inflammation in a Mouse Model by Reducing Expression of RAGE and RAGE Ligands.</a></h2><p> () can alleviate diet-induced obesity in animal models, and phlorotannins contained in  help prevent hypertrophy-induced adipocyte differentiation. Receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is well known to induce hypertrophy of visceral fat and to trigger inflammation substantially. While the relationship between RAGE and obesity and inflammation has been well-characterized, few studies describe the effects of phlorotannin on RAGE. In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity effects of pyrogallol-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PPB)-a single compound from the ethanoic extract of -mediated by a reduction in the inflammation caused by RAGE and RAGE ligands. In visceral fat, PPB (i) significantly inhibited RAGE ligands, (ii) reduced the expression of RAGE, and (iii) reduced the binding ratio between RAGE and RAGE ligands. Under lower expression of RAGE, RAGE ligands and their cognate binding, the differentiation of macrophages found in visceral fat into M1-type-the pro-inflammatory form of this immune cell-was reduced. As the M1-type macrophage decreased, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cause obesity, decreased in visceral fat. The results of this study highlight the anti-obesity effects of PPB, with the effects mediated by reductions in RAGE, RAGE ligands, and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660541>Xeno-Transplantation of macro-encapsulated islets and Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Pancreatic Progenitors without Immunosuppression.</a></h2><p>Islet transplantation effectively treats  but relies on immune suppression and is practically limited by the number of cadaveric islets available. An alternative cellular source is insulin-producing cells derived from pluripotent cell sources. Three animal cohorts were used in the current study to evaluate whether an oxygen-providing macro-encapsulation device, 'βAIR', could function in conjunction with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their derivatives. The first cohort received macro-encapsulated undifferentiated hESCs, a second cohort received hESCs differentiated to a pancreatic progenitor state with limited endocrine differentiation. A reference cohort received human islets. Macro-encapsulation devices were implanted subcutaneously and monitored for up to 4 months. Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells did not form teratoma but underwent cell death following implantation. Human C-peptide (hC- peptide) was detectable in host serum one week after implantation for both other cohorts. hC-peptide levels decreasing over time but remained detectable up to the end of the study. Key factors associated with mature endocrine cells were observed in grafts recovered from cohorts containing islets and hESC-derivatives including C-peptide, insulin, glucagon and urocortin 3.

It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation.  (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between  and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of  along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal inflammation can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ± 5 mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status. Periodontitis could be considered as a potential, modifiable, and independent risk factor for the development of .

The samples consisted of 98 patients with  chosen through available sampling and randomly assigned into study and control groups. For data collection,  quality of life (DQOL) short form clinical questionnaire, Persian version, was used. The intervention involved training self-management conducted through 60 sessions via a designed weblog. The obtained information was introduced into SPSS 21, and analyzed through Mann-Whitney, t-test, and paired t-test.According to the results of this study, the mean age of the examined patients was 32.1 ± 4.9 years, where the major participants were male (n = 52 in the test group, 52.5%). The results showed that after the intervention, the test and control groups were different in terms of anthropometric variables and metabolic indicators; the mean waist circumference in the test and control groups was 98.6 ± 9.8 and 101.5 ± 7.8, respectively; the mean FBS following the intervention in the test and control groups was 131.08 ± 16.04 and 238.2 ± 40, respectively; and the mean BMI postintervention in the test and control groups was obtained as 27.3 ± 3.4 and 30.1 ± 3.8 respectively, where these differences were significant according to independent t-test (p < 0.05). The mean score of quality of life postintervention in the test and control groups was obtained as 56.1 and 49.9 respectively; according to Mann-Whitney test, the difference between the two groups was significant (p < 0.05).The results of the present study revealed the positive effect of weblog based self-management on the quality of life of patients with  following the intervention.

Both DM and hypertension are major risk factors, for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events and mortality. Strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetics has been associated with a cardiovascular and renal risk decrease. Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal tubule is a relatively novel class of agents for treatment of type 2 DM. Inhibition of SGLT-2 co-transporter combines proximal tubule diuretic and osmotic diuretic action leading to glucose reabsorption reduction and mild natriuretic and diuretic effects. On this basis, several studies showed that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors can effectively decrease hyperglycemia but also increase BP control and reduce renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality. Based on such evidence, the recent guidelines for the management of type 2  now suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors should be preferred among oral agents in combination with metformin, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease or heart failure. This review summarizes the existing data from studies evaluating the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on BP, and its potential value for cardio and nephroprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665767>Student-led foot-care sessions for patients with .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663302>Newer therapeutic approaches towards the management of : an update.</a></h2><p> is a chronic metabolic condition characterised by an elevation of blood glucose levels, resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.

Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 , cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity.

Effectiveness analyses of current regimens used 3598 person-visit-pairs (745 men) on cART in 2014-2017. Inverse-probability-of-treatment-and-censoring weighted Poisson regression with robust variances was used to evaluate the association between regimens and switching, adherence and HIV RNA <20 copies/mL.Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen usage has increased since 2008. Almost 90% of cART initiators started with INSTI-cART in 2016-2017; cART adherence was stable around 90% and 83%-85% suppressed virus (<20 cp/mL). Commonly used regimens in 2014-2017 contained disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) backbone with efavirenz (EFV, n = 1161 person-visits), elvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c, n = 551), rilpivirine (RPV, n = 492), darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r, n = 351), or atazanavir (ATV)/r (n = 333). Others were dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC, n = 401) and EVG/c/tenofovir alafenamide/FTC (EVG/c/TAF/FTC, n = 309). Compared to EFV/TDF/FTC users, ATV/r+TDF/FTC users switched more (rate ratio [RR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.76), while those on DTG/ABC/3TC (RR [95% CI] = 0.16 [0.08-0.31]) or EVG/c/TAF/FTC (RR [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.06-0.27]) switched less. The rate of suppressed HIV RNA was 15% (95% CI, 2%-26%) lower among younger EVG/c/TDF/FTC users and 18% (95% CI, 3%-34%) higher in older DRV/r+TDF/FTC users; adherence did not differ by regimen.Consistent with guidelines, recent cART initiators started with INSTI-cART, which was associated with less switching early after initiation.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of this reform experienced by patients with type 2 . The objective was also to explore if socio-economic status affects this experience.The data were collected by conducting a survey among Finnish adults with type 2  (n = 603). The baseline survey was conducted in November-December 2016. A second follow-up survey was conducted at the end of 2017 where the participants' experience of the reimbursement reform was surveyed with an open-ended question. Free-form inductive content analysis was used to categorize the answers. The association between the participants' characteristics and reporting an effect caused by the reimbursement reform was studied with binomial logistic regression.285 (47.3%) participants reported an effect of some kind caused by the reimbursement reform. The most common reported effects were economic effects (32.7%) and annoyance (12.4%). Having financial difficulties in purchasing antidiabetic medicines (odds ratio (OR) 5.20, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 2.99-9.06) or not having annual deductible exceeded (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.19-3.95), and use of certain antidiabetic medication groups at baseline were associated with reporting an effect. Socio-economic status was not associated with the likelihood of reporting an effect.Almost half of the participants with type 2  reported an effect, most commonly economic effects, such as increased expenditure or difficulty in purchasing medicines, after the reimbursement reform.

Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to  and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character.

These characteristics mean that initiating treatment and obtaining a virological cure (Sustained Viral response, SVR) on completion of treatment, in non-specialist environments should be feasible. We investigated the English-language literature evaluating community and primary care-based pathways using DAAs to treat HCV infection.Databases (Cinahl; Embase; Medline; PsycINFO; PubMed) were searched for studies of treatment with DAAs in non-specialist settings to achieve SVR. Relevant studies were identified including those containing a comparison between a community and specialist services where available. A narrative synthesis and linked meta-analysis were performed on suitable studies with a strength of evidence assessment (GRADE).Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: five from Australia; two from Canada; two from UK and eight from USA. Seven studies demonstrated use of DAAs in primary care environments; four studies evaluated integrated systems linking specialists with primary care providers; three studies evaluated services in locations providing care to people who inject drugs; two studies evaluated delivery in pharmacies; and one evaluated delivery through telemedicine. Sixteen studies recorded treatment uptake. Patient numbers varied from around 60 participants with pathway studies to several thousand in two large database studies. Most studies recruited less than 500 patients. Five studies reported reduced SVR rates from an intention-to-treat analysis perspective because of loss to follow-up before the final confirmatory SVR test. GRADE assessments were made for uptake of HCV treatment (medium); completion of HCV treatment (low) and achievement of SVR at 12 weeks (medium).Services sited in community settings are feasible and can deliver increased uptake of treatment. Such clinics are able to demonstrate similar SVR rates to published studies and real-world clinics in secondary care. Stronger study designs are needed to confirm the precision of effect size seen in current studies.

To test whether similar phenomena occur in humans, we compared beta-cell function in adult subjects previously exposed to glucocorticoids during first part of fetal life to non-exposed subjects.The study was conducted in 16 adult participants exposed to glucocorticoids during the first part of fetal life and in 16 non-exposed healthy subjects with normal glucose tolerance matched for age, sex, and BMI. Exposed subjects were descendants from mother at risk of having a child with 21-hydroxylase deficiency that were consequently treated by dexamethasone (1 to 1.5mg/day from the 6th gestational week (GW) to prevent genital virilization. We selected descendant of mother who stopped dexamethasone before the 18th GW following negative genotyping of the fetus. Insulin and glucagon secretion were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), graded intravenous (IV) glucose and arginine test. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic-clamp.Age, BMI and anthropometric characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Insulinogenic index during OGTT and insulin-sensitivity during the clamp were similar in the 2 groups. In exposed subjects, insulin secretion during graded IV-glucose infusion and after arginine administration decreased by 17% (p=0.02) and 22% (p=0.002) respectively while Glucagon secretion after arginine increased.Over exposure to glucocorticoids during first part of fetal life is associated with lower insulin secretion at adult age, which may lead to abnormal glucose tolerance later in life.© Endocrine Society 2019.

However, flap venous congestion remains a tough nut to crack. We hypothesize that raising an adipofascial flap with turnover mode of transposition can improve venous drainage and enhance flap safety.Based on the 2 rows of septocutaneous perforators in the posterior distal third of the lower leg, distally based adipofascial flap was raised from medial sural region nourished by 1 perforator bundle from the posterior tibial artery or from the lateral sural region from the peroneal artery. The superficial dissection was performed in subdermal plane and deep in to the subfascial space. The flap was nourished by perforator-plus-adipofascial pedicle and turned over 180 degrees upside down to reach the distal wounds. One week later, a split-skin graft was used to cover the exposed fascial flap. Postoperatively, flap survival, complications, and patient functional recovery were evaluated.Distally based sural turnover adipofascial flaps were used in 12 cases with complicated wounds of the distal third lower leg, foot, and ankle region. All wounds were caused by trauma and experienced fracture implants fixation and 5 with osteomyelitis. The comorbidities include  in 9 cases and smoking in 7. There were 8 medial ural flaps and 4 lateral sural flaps. The adipofiscial flaps measured from 6.0 cm × 5.0 cm to 17.0 cm × 6.0 cm (mean, 61.3 cm). Postoperatively, all flaps survived uneventfully without any complication such as flap ischemia and/or necrosis. Two minor donor site complications were encountered, one was postoperative hematoma, and another was hyperproliferative scar. After a mean of 14.6 months of follow-up, the adipofascial flap plus skin graft showed a durable esthetic coverage, with normal shoe wearing and walking.Distally based sural adipofascial turnover flap is a simple and reliable wound coverage technique. It avoids venous congestion as usually seen in distally based fasciocutaneous flaps.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664080>dendPoint: a web resource for dendrimer pharmacokinetics investigation and prediction.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine development currently suffers from a lack of efficient tools to predict pharmacokinetic behavior without relying upon testing in large numbers of animals, impacting success rates and development costs. This work presents dendPoint, the first in silico model to predict the intravenous pharmacokinetics of dendrimers, a commonly explored drug vector, based on physicochemical properties. We have manually curated the largest relational database of dendrimer pharmacokinetic parameters and their structural/physicochemical properties. This was used to develop a machine learning-based model capable of accurately predicting pharmacokinetic parameters, including half-life, clearance, volume of distribution and dose recovered in the liver and urine. dendPoint successfully predicts dendrimer pharmacokinetic properties, achieving correlations of up to r = 0.83 and Q up to 0.68. dendPoint is freely available as a user-friendly web-service and database at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/dendpoint . This platform is ultimately expected to be used to guide dendrimer construct design and refinement prior to embarking on more time consuming and expensive in vivo testing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664917>Two cases of fungal cyst infection in ADPKD: is this really a rare complication?</a></h2><p>Cyst infection is a prevalent complication in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients, however therapeutic and diagnostic approaches towards this condition remain unclear. The confirmation of a likely episode of cyst infection by isolating the pathogenic microorganism in a clinical scenario is possible only in the minority of cases. The available antimicrobial treatment guidelines, therefore, might not be appropriate to some patients.We describe two unique cases of kidney cyst infection by Candida albicans, a condition that has not been previously described in literature. Both cases presented clear risk factors for Candida spp. infection. However, since there was no initial indication of cyst aspiration and culture, antifungal therapy was not immediately started and empirical treatment was initiated as recommended by the current guidelines. Antifungal treatment was instituted in both cases along the clinical course, according to their specificities.Our report highlights the possibility of Candida spp. cyst infection. Failure of clinical improvement with antibiotics should raise the suspicion of a fungal infection. Identification of infected cysts should be pursued in such cases, particularly with PET-CT, and when technically possible followed by cyst aspiration and culture to guide treatment. Risk factors for this condition, such as Candida spp. colonization, previous antimicrobial therapy, hemodialysis, necrotizing pancreatitis, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary surgical procedure, central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition,  and immunodeficiency (neutropenia < 500 neutrophils/mL, hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant drugs), should be also considered accepted criteria for empirical antifungal therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663063>Atypical Tibial Fracture in a 63-Year-Old Woman With Intermittent Use of Bisphosphonate Unmasking Hypophosphatasia.</a></h2><p>We report an unusual case of atypical proximal tibial stress fracture (APTF) associated with intermittent use of bisphosphonates (BPs) and persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. We describe the case of a 63-year-old white woman who had experienced an APTF after 4 years of intermittent exposure to alendronate given for recurrent metatarsal stress fractures. BP administration was stopped after the diagnosis of the APTF. A review of her previous serum ALP levels revealed they had been consistently low. Adult hypophosphatasia (HPP) was diagnosed by the low serum ALP activity and elevated urine phosphoethanolamine levels. She was treated conservatively with analgesics. Adult HPP is an underrecognized condition associated with atypical insufficiency fractures, and BP use compounds this risk. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of intermittent BP exposure preceding an APTF in an adult patient with HPP, highlighting the uncommon site of the proximal tibia for BP-associated atypical insufficiency fractures, the need to screen for HPP in those with persistently low ALP levels before they begin BP therapy, and the importance of avoiding BP use in those with HPP.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660813>Dicarbonyls Generation, Toxicities, Detoxifications and Potential roles in  Complications.</a></h2><p>It has been well established that advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) have a strong correlation with  and its secondary complications. Moreover, dicarbonyls especially methylglyoxal (MG) and glyoxal, accelerate AGEs formation and hence have potential roles in the pathogenesis of . They can also induce oxidative stress and concomitantly decrease the efficiency of antioxidant enzymes. Increased proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) are secreted by monocytes due to the dicarbonyl-modified proteins. High levels of blood dicarbonyls have been identified in  and its associated complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). This review aims to provide a better understanding by including in-depth information of past and current knowledge about the formation of MG and glyoxal through multiple pathways with a focus on their biological functions and detoxifications. The potential role of these dicarbonyls in diabetic secondary complications is also discussed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660634>Looking back on 25 years of the PSAD study group.</a></h2><p>The year 2020 marks the 25th anniversary of the Psychosocial Aspects of  (PSAD) study group of the European Association for the Study of . At the time, psychosocial  research in Europe was steadily growing, but not well recognized. By establishing an official European Association for the Study of  study group, PSAD, for which purpose some hurdles had to be overcome,  psychology became more visible and accessible to the scientific  community. Over the years the PSAD study group has been successful in promoting the quality of research in the field through scientific meetings, mentoring, postgraduate education and publications. Looking back we can conclude that starting the PSAD study group signified an important moment in time, where researchers were joining forces to further the quality of the science, raise awareness of the importance of psychosocial aspects and promote the dissemination of psychological interventions in  care.© 2019  UK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663117>Antibodies against neo-epitope of microbial and human transglutaminases' complexes as biomarkers of childhood celiac disease.</a></h2><p>Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and microbial transglutaminase (mTG) cross-link gliadins to form complexes that expose immunogenic neo-epitopes, to produce tTG and mTG-neo-epitope antibodies. To test the diagnostic performance of antibodies against non-complexed and complexed forms of transglutaminases, to correlate their activities to the intestinal damage and to explore their age groups dependency, in celiac disease (CD). 296 children with untreated CD and 215 non-celiac disease controls were checked by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays detecting IgA, IgG, or combined detection of IgA and IgG (check) against tTG, AESKULISA tTG New Generation (tTG-neo) and mTG-neo (RUO), IgA and IgG antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) and human IgA anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) using AESKUSLIDES EMA. Intestinal pathology was graded according the revised Marsh criteria, and age dependencies of the antibodies' activities were analysed. Using cut-offs estimated from Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, the highest area under curve (AUC) of the TG assays was 0.963 for tTG-neo Check, followed by tTG Check, (0.962) when the diagnosis was based on enteric mucosal histology. tTG-neo Check was the best to reflect the intestinal abnormalities in CD (r=0.795, p<0.0001). High levels of anti-mTG-neo IgG and anti-tTG-neo IgG appeared in the earlier age groups followed by the latter anti-tTG IgG surge along the advanced ages, (p<0.001). Considering antibodies' diagnostic performances based on AUC, enteric damage reflection and predictability at an early age, the anti-neo tTG check was the best diagnostic biomarker for pediatric CD. The mTG neo Check might represent a new marker for CD screening, diagnosis and predictability.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p></html>
