<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7504656>Inhibition of metastatic cell  in murine lungs and tumor-induced morbidity by non-peptidic --Asp mimetics.</a></h2><p>The spreading and  of tumor cells require their migration to metastatic sites via blood vessels. To penetrate blood-vessel walls, cells, including malignant ones, must recognize and associate with the sub-endothelium extracellular matrix (ECM) and its glycoproteins. Recognition of ECM-glycoproteins, such as fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN), is mediated by integrin receptors expressed on various cell types, including platelets, leukocytes and tumor cells. The --Asp (RGD)-containing peptide, a major adhesive ligand of ECM, is present in various plasma and matrix glycoproteins, such as FN and VN. Non-peptidic mimetics of RGD, consisting of carboxylate and guanidinium groups of Asp and  divided by a linear atom spacer, express a high affinity for the alpha IIb-beta 3 integrin and inhibit platelet aggregation. Herein, the ability of RGD mimetics to inhibit adhesive interactions between tumor cells and RGD, and tumor progression in vivo, was examined. RGD-containing peptides and the RGD mimetic, compound SF-6,5, but not the --Glu (RGE) peptide or the corresponding mimetic, specifically inhibited B16-F10 melanoma cell adhesion to immobilized VN and FN. Daily administration in vivo of SF-6,5 to mice inhibited the formation of B16-F10 colonies in experimental and spontaneous models of metastases. Moreover, SF-6,5 could prevent mouse death caused by massive  of tumor cells in the lungs. The therapeutic effect of RGD-containing peptides on tumor metastasis formation was marginal, probably due to the small amounts used, and its susceptibility to proteolysis in situ. Thus, non-peptidic mimetics of small adhesive epitopes may provide a novel therapeutic tool to prevent an adverse pathological event involving integrin-dependent cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1399825>Triflavin, an --Asp-containing antiplatelet peptide inhibits cell-substratum adhesion and melanoma cell-induced lung .</a></h2><p>Triflavin, an --Asp (RGD) containing peptide purified from Trimeresurus flavoviridis snake venom, inhibits human platelet aggregation by blocking fibrinogen binding to fibrinogen receptors associated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. In this study, we show that triflavin (1-30 micrograms/mouse) inhibits B16-F10 melanoma cell-induced lung  in C57BL/6 mice in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro, triflavin dose-dependently inhibits adhesion of B16-F10 melanoma cells to extracellular matrices (ECMs; i.e., fibronectin, fibrinogen, vitronectin, and collagen type I). Triflavin is approximately 600-800 times more potent than GRGDS at inhibiting cell adhesion. In addition, triflavin dose-dependently inhibits B16-F10 cell-induced platelet aggregation. These results imply that the inhibitory effect of triflavin on the adhesion of tumor cells to ECMs (e.g., fibronectin, vitronectin and collagen type I) and/or tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation may be partially responsible for its antimetastatic activity in C57BL/6 mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8649213>Liposomal --Asp analogs effectively inhibit metastatic B16 melanoma  in murine lungs.</a></h2><p>Analogs of a synthetic peptide having the L-arginine-L-glycine-L-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence have been found to decrease metastatic . To enhance the metastasis-suppressing efficacy of these analogs, we sought to stabilize these analogs and to prolong their circulation time by incorporating them into a liposomal formulation. Various structures of RGD analogs grafted to hydrophobic groups were synthesized and then incorporated into liposomes. Liposomes composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol and appropriate RGD analogs were injected intravenously along with B16BL6 murine melanoma cells into mice. Liposomal RGD (0.6 mumol of the analog equivalent to ca. 200 micrograms RGD peptides) inhibited lung  up to 76%. This dose is an order of magnitude lower than that for comparable inhibition reported for free RGD. Multi-dose administration of liposomal RGD (0.15 mumol of the analog) also inhibited the spontaneous lung metastasis of cells from a primary tumor site of B16BL6 cells subcutaneously implanted into the footpad of mice. Taken together, our data indicate that liposomal RGD may serve as a useful anti-metastatic agent.</p></html>
