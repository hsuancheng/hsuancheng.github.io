The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of N-Oleoyl glycine (OLGly), a lipoamino , on 3T3-L1 adipogenesis and to explore the likely mechanisms underlying this process. Lipid accumulation were evaluated using Oil Red O staining and triglyceride content assay. The mRNA expressions of cannabinoid receptors and the protein expressions of adipogenic genes and intracellular signaling pathway were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. The results indicated that OLGly itself, but not its degradation products, stimulated lipid accumulation and significantly increased adipogenic genes (PPARγ and aP2), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, OLGly markedly increased the mRNA expression of CB1 receptor (CB1R) and the inhibition of CB1R by its antagonist SR141716 abolished the promotive effects of OLGly on lipid accumulation and the protein expression of PPARγ and aP2. Furthermore, OLGly increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt and p-FoxO1/FoxO1, which could be reversed by SR141716. Moreover, OLGly-induced enhancement of adipogenesis, activation of -mediated Akt signaling pathway and inactivation of FoxO1 were effectively blocked by Wortmannin, a specific PI3K/Akt inhibitor, indicating the essential role of Akt signaling pathway in the process of OLGly-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. In conclusion, OLGly, a lipoamino , was able to promote 3T3-L1 adipogenesis through the activation of CB1 receptor and the enhancement of -mediated Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggested the potential role of OLGly in increasing  sensitivity and suppressing obesity and diabetes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to , lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high  morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and arachidonic  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative -independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446544>Association between plasma trans-fatty  concentrations and diabetes in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</a></h1><p>A diet high in trans-fatty acids (TFA) induces  in rodent models and primates. However, previous epidemiological studies on the association between TFAs, based primarily on self-reported intake from the diet, and diabetes in humans have yielded conflicting results. Herein we examined the associations of objectively measured plasma TFA concentrations with diabetes in a large population-based study among US adults.We included 3801 participants aged ≥20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2009-10. Four major TFAs, namely palmitelaidic  (C16:1 n-7t), elaidic  (C18:1 n-9t), vaccenic  (C18:1 n-7t), and linolelaidic  (C18:2 n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Diabetes was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis, plasma fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5%.After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of diabetes comparing the highest with lowest quintile of plasma TFAs was 2.19 (1.27-3.79) for total TFAs (P  = 0.01), 2.34 (1.48-3.72) for elaidic  (P  = 0.0004), 1.33 (0.82-2.15) for linolelaidic  (P  = 0.18), 1.58 (0.97-2.58) for palmitelaidic  (P  = 0.02), and 1.64 (0.95-2.84) for vaccenic  (P  = 0.08). In addition, total TFAs, elaidic , palmitelaidic , and vaccenic  were significantly associated with fasting glucose, fasting , the  index, and HbA1c.In a nationally representative population, plasma TFAs, in particular elaidic , were positively associated with diabetes and biomarkers of glucose metabolism.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25536389>Effect of NAD on PARP-mediated  sensitivity in  treated hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>High serum free fatty acids levels are associated with the development of  in type 2 diabetes; however, the precise mechanisms underlying this lipid toxicity are unclear. To investigate whether PARP1 activation and NAD depletion are involved in the impairment of  sensitivity associated with lipotoxicity, HepG2 cells were cultured with 500 μM  for 48 h. -treated cells exhibited increased ROS generation, lipid accumulation and PARP1 activation. Treatment with the PARP1 inhibitor PJ34 and transfection with PARP1 small interfering RNA both prevented the -induced impairment of the  signaling pathway. Furthermore, treatment with PJ34 reversed the -induced decrease in intracellular NAD concentration, while exogenous NAD protected cells against -induced  insensitivity. Combined NAD and PJ34 administration did not enhance the effects obtained by treatment with either NAD or PJ34 alone. Interestingly, when cells were treated with the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527, the protective effects of PJ34 and NAD treatment were diminished. Taken together, these data suggest that NAD depletion by PARP1 activation is essential for the modulation of  sensitivity in -induced lipotoxicity.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511930>Effects of two-months balanced diet in metabolically healthy obesity: lipid correlations with gender and BMI-related differences.</a></h1><p>Nowadays no researches has been performed on fatty  profile (FA) and desaturase activity in metabolically healthy obesity (MHO).

These impairments are associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Correcting the defects in lipid metabolism may attenuate obesity and dyslipidaemia, and reduce cardiovascular risk and liver damage. L-Carnitine supplementation was used in this study to enhance fatty  oxidation so as to ameliorate diet-induced disturbances in lipid metabolism. Male Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old) were fed with either corn starch or high-carbohydrate, high-fat diets for 16 weeks. Separate groups were supplemented with L-carnitine (1.2% in food) on either diet for the last 8 weeks of the protocol. High-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-fed rats showed central obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, cardiovascular remodelling and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. L-Carnitine supplementation attenuated these high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet-induced changes, together with modifications in lipid metabolism including the inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, reduced storage of short-chain monounsaturated fatty acids in the tissues with decreased linoleic  content and trans fatty acids stored in retroperitoneal fat. Thus, L-carnitine supplementation attenuated the signs of metabolic syndrome through inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, preferential β-oxidation of some fatty acids and increased storage of saturated fatty acids and relatively inert  in the tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25874297>[The titration of double bonds in fatty acids of blood plasma in patients in testing of glucose tolerance].</a></h1><p>The article deals with per oral glucose tolerance test applied to 20 patients with arterial hypertension.

During the development of obesity and NAFLD, mitochondria adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of fatty  oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing inflammation. Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than weight loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro- (NO-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO-OA and the  sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of  and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity,  and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment, liver weight and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic fatty acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by obesity, without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Although ER stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, it is indispensable for cellular activity. Therefore, when assessing the pathological significance of ER stress, it is important to monitor and quantify ER stress levels. Here, we have established a novel system to monitor ER stress levels quickly and sensitively, and using this method, we have clarified the effect of differences in glucose concentration and various fatty acids on the ER of pancreatic β cells. First, we developed a cell system that secretes Gaussia luciferase in culture medium depending on the activation of the GRP78 promoter. This system could sensitively monitor ER stress levels that could not be detected with real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. This system revealed that hyperglycemia does not induce unfolded protein response (UPR) in a short period of time in MIN6 cells, a mouse pancreatic β cell line. Physiological concentrations of palmitic , a saturated fatty , induced ER stress quickly, while physiological concentrations of , an unsaturated fatty , did not. Docosahexaenoic , an n-3 unsaturated fatty , inhibited palmitic -induced ER stress. In this study, we have established a system that can sensitively detect ER stress levels of living cells in a short period of time. This system can be used to monitor the state of the ER in living cells and lead to the investigation of the significance of physiological or pathological ER stress levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529902>[The  initiates "kinetic perfection" of biologic function of locomotion.

The pathogenesis of the disease includes an increased concentration of FFA in blood, an increase in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, and disorders in the process of -oxidation.The aim of the study was to analyze the fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes among 55 patients with NAFLD who were subjected to a 6-month dietary intervention in order to reduce fatty liver.Basic anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed. The profile of fatty acids was measured in the membranes of erythrocytes and analyzed by gas chromatography.

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for weight loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting , inflammation, and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (, found in olive oil) are less likely to promote , inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly palmitic  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for energy and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased energy expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective.

Conversely, unsaturated fatty acids like docosahexaenoic  were proven to preserve muscle mass. However, it is not known if the most common unsaturated oleate will protect skeletal myotubes against palmitate-mediated atrophy, and its specific mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of oleate on atrophy-related factors in palmitate-conditioned myotubes. Exposure of myotubes to palmitate, but not to oleate, led to an induction of fragmented nuclei, myotube loss, atrophy, and mitochondrial superoxide in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of oleate to myotubes attenuated production of palmitate-induced mitochondrial superoxide in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment of oleate or MitoTEMPO to palmitate-conditioned myotubes led to inhibition of palmitate-induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory (TNF- and IL6), mitochondrial fission (Drp1 and Fis1), and atrophy markers (myostatin and atrogin1). In accordance with the gene expression data, our immunocytochemistry experiment demonstrated that oleate and MitoTEMPO prevented or attenuated palmitate-mediated myotube shrinkage. These results provide a mechanism indicating that oleate prevents palmitate-mediated atrophy via at least partial modulation of mitochondrial superoxide production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993530>Analysis of Fatty  Esters of Hydroxyl Fatty  in Selected Plant Food.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, , hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and -sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in -resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose- homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, , palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and -sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

The decrease in abdominal fat mass was correlated with the reduction in blood pressure after the Canola (systolic blood pressure: r = 0.26, P = 0.062; diastolic blood pressure: r = 0.38, P = 0.0049) and CanolaOleic oil diets (systolic blood pressure: r = 0.39 P = 0.004; diastolic blood pressure: r = 0.45, P = 0.0006). The decrease in abdominal fat mass also was associated with a reduction in triglyceride levels after the CanolaOleic oil diet (r = 0.42, P = 0.002).Diets high in MUFA (compared with PUFA) reduced central obesity with an accompanying improvement in MetS risk factors.

These adverse effects have been attributed to epigenetic changes in utero, but little is known about the role of placental metabolism and its contribution to fetal development.We examined the impact of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity on the expression of genes involved in placental lipid metabolism in lean and obese women.Seventy-three lean and obese women with healthy pregnancy were recruited at term elective cesarean delivery. Metabolic parameters were measured on maternal venous blood samples. Expression of 88 genes involved in lipid metabolism was measured in whole placenta tissue. Proteins of genes differently expressed in response to maternal obesity were quantified, correlated with maternal parameters and immunolocalized in placenta sections. Isolated primary trophoblasts were used for in vitro assays.Triglyceride (TG) content was increased in placental tissue of obese (1.10, CI 1.04-1.24 mg g, P<0.05) vs lean (0.84, CI 0.72-1.02 mg g) women. Among target genes examined, six showed positive correlation (P<0.05) with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, namely ATGL (PNPLA2), FATP1 (SLC27A1), FATP3 (SLC27A3), PLIN2, PPARG and CGI-58 (ABHD5). CGI-58 protein abundance was twofold higher (P<0.001) in placentas of obese vs lean women. CGI-58 protein levels correlated positively with maternal  levels and pre-pregnancy body mass index (R=0.63, P<0.001 and R=0.64, P<0.001, respectively). CGI-58 and PLIN2 were primarily located in the syncytiotrophoblast and, were upregulated (1.38- and 500-fold, respectively) upon  and  treatment of cultured trophoblast cells.Pre-gravid obesity significantly modifies the expression of placental genes related to transport and storage of neutral lipids. We propose that the upregulation of CGI-58, a master regulator of TG hydrolysis, contributes to the turnover of intracellular lipids in placenta of obese women, and is tightly regulated by metabolic factors of the mother.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486510> and linoleic fatty acids downregulate Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression via NFKB and SREBP1 in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h1><p> (OA) and linoleic (LA) fatty acids may be important regulators of Slc2a4 gene (GLUT4 protein) in skeletal muscle, thus participating in . We investigated the effect of OA and LA on the Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression in L6 muscle cells; as well as potential transcriptional regulators. OA and LA (50-400 µM) decreased the Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression in a dose-dependent way (maximum of ~50%, P < 0.001). OA and LA did not alter the Slc2a4-binding activity of oxysterols-receptor-LXR-alpha and peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma; but decreased the Slc2a4-binding activity of the sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-1 (SREBP1) enhancer (50%, P < 0.001), and increased (~30%, P < 0.001) the nuclear proteins binding into the Slc2a4-nuclear-factor-NF-kappa-B-binding site (repressor), and the phosphorylation of the inhibitors of nuclear-factor-kappa-B-kinase alpha/beta (150-300%, P < 0.001).

However, the mechanisms by which different fatty acids regulate IL-1β and the subsequent effects on adipose tissue biology and  sensitivity in vivo remain elusive. We hypothesized that the replacement of SFA for monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) in HFDs would reduce pro-IL-1β priming in adipose tissue and attenuate  via MUFA-driven AMPK activation. MUFA-HFD-fed mice displayed improved  sensitivity coincident with reduced pro-IL-1β priming, attenuated adipose IL-1β secretion, and sustained adipose AMPK activation compared with SFA-HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, MUFA-HFD-fed mice displayed hyperplastic adipose tissue, with enhanced adipogenic potential of the stromal vascular fraction and improved  sensitivity. In vitro, we demonstrated that the MUFA  can impede ATP-induced IL-1β secretion from lipopolysaccharide- and SFA-primed cells in an AMPK-dependent manner. Conversely, in a regression study, switching from SFA- to MUFA-HFD failed to reverse  but improved fasting plasma  levels. In humans, high-SFA consumers, but not high-MUFA consumers, displayed reduced  sensitivity with elevated pycard-1 and caspase-1 expression in adipose tissue. These novel findings suggest that dietary MUFA can attenuate IL-1β-mediated  and adipose dysfunction despite obesity via the preservation of AMPK activity.© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

The present study examined the effects of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)-metabolized precursors and products, notably , on the compensatory capacity of β-cells and their relationship with regulation of the FoxO1 and Wnt pathways. The trioleate-induced compromise of  sensitivity blunted the compensatory response of pancreatic β-cells in primary rat islets. These events were associated with increases in the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of FoxO1. Such effects were also observed in INS-1E cells that were subjected to oleate treatment. The overexpression of human SCD1 that was accompanied by endogenously generated  also led to an increase in the nuclear abundance of FoxO1.

The testicular feminised mouse (non-functional androgen receptor and low testosterone) develops fatty liver and aortic lipid streaks on a high-fat diet, whereas androgen-replete XY littermate controls do not. Testosterone treatment ameliorates these effects, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We compared the influence of testosterone on the expression of regulatory targets of glucose, cholesterol and lipid metabolism in muscle, liver, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Testicular feminised mice displayed significantly reduced GLUT4 in muscle and glycolytic enzymes in muscle, liver and abdominal subcutaneous but not visceral adipose tissue. Lipoprotein lipase required for fatty  uptake was only reduced in subcutaneous adipose tissue; enzymes of fatty  synthesis were increased in liver and subcutaneous tissue.

This study investigates the effects of FA and OZ on alleviating high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced metabolic syndrome parameters.Male SD rats were fed with a regular rodent diet, HFFD, or HFFD supplemented with 0.05% FA or 0.16% OZ (equimolar concentrations) for 13 weeks. Food intake, organ indices, serum lipid profiles, glucose metabolism,  (IR) index and cytokine levels were analyzed. The mechanisms were further investigated in -stimulated HepG2 cells by analyzing triglyceride (TG) content and lipogenesis-related gene expressions.In the in vivo study, FA and OZ exhibited similar effects in alleviating HFFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and IR. However, only OZ treatment significantly decreased liver index and hepatic TG content, lowered serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and increased serum concentration of adiponectin. In the in vitro assay, only OZ administration significantly inhibited intracellular TG accumulation and down-regulated expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1, which might facilitate OZ to enhance its hepatoprotective effect.OZ is more effective than FA in inhibiting hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation.

Although statins should be used with caution in liver diseases, they are increasingly investigated as a possible treatment for NAFLD. The present study recreated an  model of NAFLD using HepG cells exposed to  (OA), which was used to quantify OA-induced lipid accumulation in HepG cells treated with various concentrations of simvastatin. In addition, the effect of simvastatin on HepG cell morphology and microparticle generation as a marker of cell apoptosis was assessed. OA-induced lipid accumulation was quantified by Oil Red O staining and extraction for optical density determination. Stained lipid droplets were visualized using phase contrast microscopy. Furthermore, HepG cell-derived microparticles were counted by flow cytometry subsequent to staining for Annexin V. HepG cells treated with 0-1 mM OA showed dose-dependent lipid accumulation. Treatment of HepG cells with increasing concentrations of simvastatin followed by treatment with 1 mM OA showed that low simvastatin concentrations (4-10 µM) were able to reduce lipid accumulation by ~40%, whereas high simvastatin concentrations (20 and 30 µM) induced apoptotic changes in cell morphology and increased the production of Annexin V microparticles. This suggests that low simvastatin doses may have a role in preventing NAFLD.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and linolenic  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and energy metabolism, promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved lipid profiles and , among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of lipid metabolism activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and  acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899878>Comparative Proteomic Study of Fatty -treated Myoblasts Reveals Role of Cox-2 in Palmitate-induced .</a></h1><p>Accumulated studies demonstrate that saturated fatty acids (FAs) such as palmitic  (PA) inhibit  signaling in skeletal muscle cells and monounsaturated fatty acids such as  (OA) reverse the effect of PA on  signaling. The detailed molecular mechanism of these opposite effects remains elusive. Here we provide a comparative proteomic study of skeletal myoblast cell line C2C12 that were untreated or treated with PA, and PA plus OA. A total of 3437 proteins were quantified using SILAC in this study and 29 proteins fall into the pattern that OA reverses PA effect. Expression of some these proteins were verified using qRT-PCR and Western blot. The most significant change was cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). In addition to whole cell comparative proteomic study, we also compared lipid droplet (LD)-associated proteins and identified that Cox-2 was one of three major altered proteins under the FA treatment. This finding was then confirmed using immunofluorescence. Finally, Cox-2 selective inhibitor, celecoxib protected cells from PA-reduced  signaling Akt phosphorylation. Together, these results not only provide a dataset of protein expression change in FA treatment but also suggest that Cox-2 and lipid droplets (LDs) are potential players in PA- and OA-mediated cellular processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26794005>Pu-erh tea extract ameliorates high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and  by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling in mice.</a></h1><p>Pu-erh tea, made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, possesses activities beneficial for human health, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-obesity properties.We investigated the effects of a pu-erh tea extract (PTE) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects.Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks, during which PTE was simultaneously administered in drinking water. Body weight, hepatic inflammation, steatosis,  sensitivity, expression of lipogenesis- and gluconeogenesis-associated genes, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation were examined. The anti-steatotic effects of PTE and/or interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated in HepG2 cells. The lipid accumulation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes were analyzed.PTE inhibited HFD-induced obesity and significantly attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and liver inflammation, and prevented against liver injury. PTE treatment improved glucose tolerance and  sensitivity in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PTE treatment maintained the intact  signal and significantly decreased expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. PTE treatment strikingly enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in the livers of HFD-fed mice. Consistent with this increase in STAT3 phosphorylation, pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with PTE enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and attenuated -induced steatosis in a STAT3-dependent manner. In contrast, PTE inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in macrophages.PTE ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and  in mice with HFD-induced NASH, presumably by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26438035>Extracts from Aralia elata (Miq) Seem alleviate hepatosteatosis via improving hepatic  sensitivity.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease that is strongly associated with obesity and dysregulation of  in the liver. However, currently no pharmacological agents have been established for the treatment of NAFLD. In this regard, we sought to evaluate the anti-NAFLD effects of Aralia elata (Miq) Seem (AE) extract and its ability to inhibit hepatic lipid accumulation and modulate cellular signaling in a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model.A model of hepatic steatosis in the HepG2 cells was induced by . Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil-Red-O staining, and the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), Fatty  synthase (FAS), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 and 2, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1(CPT-1) was analyzed by real time reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). And glucose consumption was measured with commercial kit. Furthermore, Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with HFD to induce NAFLD. Groups of mice were given plant extracts orally at 100 and 300 mg/kg at daily for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks of AE extract treatment, we performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Liver tissue was procured for histological examination, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity.In the present study, AE extract was shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and significantly downregulate the level of lipogenic genes and upregulate the expression of lipolysis genes in HepG2 cells. And also, AE extract significantly increased the glucose consumption, indicating that AE extract improved . Subsequently, we confirmed the inhibitory activity of AE extract on NAFLD, in vivo. Treatment with AE extract significantly decreased body weight and the fasting glucose level, alleviated hyperinsulinism and hyperlipidemia, and reduced glucose levels, as determined by OGTT. Additionally, AE extract decreased PI3K and Akt activity.Our results suggest that treatment with AE extract ameliorated NAFLD by inhibiting  through activation of the Akt/GLUT4 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959940>Comparison of Fatty  Profiles in a Group of Female Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)⁻Similar Trends of Changes, Different Pathophysiology.</a></h1><p>Fatty  (FA) profiles in the plasma of patients with metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be identical despite their different etiology (dietary mistakes vs. cachexia). The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of arachidonic  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary metabolic pathways of  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of palmitic (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary metabolic pathways are activated for , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA. The higher increase of nervonic  (C24:1) in CKD suggests a higher degree of demyelination and loss of axons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28859934>Acacia nilotica leaf improves  and hyperglycemia associated acute hepatic injury and nephrotoxicity by improving systemic antioxidant status in diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Acacia nilotica (L.) Delile is used as a traditional anti-diabetic remedy in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria and is mentioned in Ayurveda as well.The objective of the study was to evaluate the ethnomedicinal claim of A. nilotica leaf (ANL) extract for its efficiency in ameliorating diabetic complications.ANL was orally administrated (50 and 200mg/kg) to alloxanized mice (blood glucose > 200mg/dL) for 20d. Parameters of glucose metabolism, hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia and nephrotoxicity were measured with emphasis on elevated oxidative stress. ANL was chemically characterized using GC-MS. Further, docking studies were employed to predict molecular interactions.ANL lowered (65%, P< 0.001) systemic glucose load in diabetic mice, which was otherwise 398% higher than control. ANL lowered (35%) , without any significant effect on  sensitivity (P> 0.05). Anti-hyperglycemic properties of ANL was further supported by lowering of HbA1c (34%; P< 0.001) and improved glucose utilization (OGTT). Overall diabetic complications were mitigated as reflected by lowered hepatic (ALT, AST) and renal (creatinine, BUN) injury markers and normalization of dyslipidemia. Elevated systemic oxidative stress was lowered by increased catalase and peroxidase activities in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, resulting in 32% decrease of serum MDA levels. Apart from high phenolic and flavonoid content, tocopherol, catechol and β-sitosterol, identified in ANL, demonstrated substantial binding affinity with Nrf2 protein (5FNQ) reflecting possible crosstalk with intracellular antioxidant defense pathways.The present study revealed the potentials of A. nilotica to alleviate diabetes-related systemic complications by limiting oxidative stress which justified the ethnopharmacological antidiabetic claim.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In HFD-fed mice, GSO improved HFD-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic . Increased hepatic lipid contents were observed in HFD-fed mice and it was lowered in GSO (500 mg/kg)-treated mice by 26.4% which was evident in histological analysis. Pathway analysis of hepatic global gene expression indicated that GSO increased the expression of genes associated with β-oxidation (, , , and ) and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes ( and ), and these were confirmed with reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase-chain reaction.These findings suggest that GSO has a beneficial effect on NAFLD through the suppression of lipogenesis and stimulation of fatty  degradation pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290500>Palmitic and : The Yin and Yang of Fatty Acids in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h1><p>Increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) link obesity with  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The potential impact of TF on skeletal muscle metabolism has yet to be fully investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether TF can promote  and metabolic dysfunction in mammalian skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 murine skeletal myotubes were exposed to 1 ppm TF for 24 h. To examine the potential effect of cellular fatty  levels on TF-dependent regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and  signaling, we treated skeletal myotubes with 0.25 mM or 1.0 mM  (OA) during TF exposure trials. Tolylfluanid (1-10 ppm) reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 20% in 0.25 and 1.0 mM OA treated cells. The addition of 0.25 mM OA completely inhibited the TF-dependent reduction in maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) while 1.0 mM OA exacerbated the TF-dependent reduction in mitochondrial OCR. Exposing skeletal myotubes to 1 ppm TF promoted an 80% reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was completely inhibited by 0.25 mM OA and partially inhibited by1.0 mM OA. The addition of 0.25 mM OA promoted a TF-dependent increase in -dependent P-Akt (Ser473). In contrast, the addition of 1.0 mM OA promoted a significant reduction in -dependent P-Akt (Ser473). Further, the addition of 1 ppm TF significantly reduced -dependent mTORC1 activity regardless of OA concentration. Finally, TF significantly reduced -dependent protein synthesis in the 1 mM OA treated cells only. Our results demonstrate that the effect of 1 ppm TF on mitochondrial function and -dependent protein synthesis in skeletal myotubes was largely dependent upon cellular fatty  levels.Copyright © 2018.

Acne vulgaris is primarily a disease of wealthy countries and exhibits higher prevalence rates in developed compared with developing countries. No acne has been found in non-Westernized populations still living under Paleolithic dietary conditions constraining hyperglycemic carbohydrates, milk, and dairy products. The high prevalence rates of adolescent acne cannot be explained by the predominance of genetic factors but by the influence of a Western diet that overstimulates the key conductor of metabolism, the nutrient- and growth factor-sensitive kinase mTORC1. Increased mTORC1 activity has been detected in lesional skin and sebaceous glands of acne patients compared with acne-free controls. Increased mTORC1 signaling is a characteristic feature of , obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Little knowledge exists concerning the role of STAMP2 in the liver, which is a metabolically central target. We hypothesized that STAMP2 is involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis.We examined our hypothesis using human NAFLD patient pathology samples and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. The molecular mechanism underlying hepatic STAMP2-mediated lipid imbalance was explored using an  (OA)-induced NAFLD in vitro model.Noticeably, the expression level of STAMP2 protein was reduced in the livers obtained from NAFLD patients and HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo knockdown of hepatic STAMP2 by siRNA accelerated hepatic steatosis and  in mice fed a HFD. Conversely, the delivery of adenoviral STAMP2 (Ad-STAMP2) improved hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced NAFLD mice. The expression of lipogenic or adipogenic factors was increased in both in vitro and in vivo NAFLD models but was reversed by Ad-STAMP2. Adenoviral overexpression of STAMP2 improved  in the HFD-induced NAFLD mice. In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that STAMP2 modulates  sensitivity and glucose metabolism and that STAMP2 counteracts OA-induced  by modulating  receptor substrate-1 stability.The present study revealed that hepatic STAMP2 plays a pivotal role in preventing HFD-induced NAFLD and that STAMP2 overexpression improves hepatic steatosis and  in NAFLD.

In vitro, PC12 cells were treated with  to mimic lipotoxicity.Results showed that the cholesterol level in the hypothalamus of the diabetic mice was higher than that of the normal mice. The expression of  receptors and  receptor substrate-1 were downregulated and the number of Fluoro-Jade C positive cells significantly increased in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of the diabetic mice. Furthermore, Upregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and downregulation of LC 3II were obvious in the hypothalamus of the diabetic mice. In vitro, results showed that high-lipid caused PC12 cell damage and upregulated LC3 II expression. Pretreatment of cells with 3-methyladenine evidently downregulated LC3 II expression and aggravated PC12 cell death under high lipid conditions. By contrast, pretreatment of cells with rapamycin upregulated LC3 II expression and ameliorated PC12 cell death caused by lipotoxicity.These results demonstrate that autophagy activation confers protection to neurons under aberrant metabolism and that autophagy dysfunction in the hypothalamus occurs in the chronic metabolic disorder such as T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497874>Delayed intervention with a novel SGLT2 inhibitor NGI001 suppresses diet-induced metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose metabolism and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with . In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated fat deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

Vegetable oils with varying unsaturated fatty  profiles favorably affect multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, their effects on cholesterol efflux remain unclear.The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of diets low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with varying unsaturated fatty  profiles on serum-mediated cholesterol efflux and its association with the plasma lipophilic index and central obesity.The present study is a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Participants [men: n = 50; women: n = 51; mean ± SE age: 49.5 ± 1.2 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 29.4 ± 0.4] at risk for or with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were randomly assigned to 5 isocaloric diets containing the treatment oils: canola oil, high -canola oil, DHA-enriched high -canola oil, corn oil and safflower oil blend, and flax oil and safflower oil blend. These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total energy per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure.The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.25, P = 0.01, r = -0.33, P = 0.02, respectively).Diets low in SFAs with different monounsaturated fatty  and polyunsaturated fatty  profiles improved serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals with or at risk for MetS. This mechanism may account, in part, for the cardiovascular disease benefits of diets low in SFAs and high in unsaturated fatty acids.

Evidences have been shown that PA also decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in cultured macrophages. Although studies have shown that other fatty acids (FAs) modulate several lymphocyte functions, the specific effect of PA on these cells is unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of PA on activation and differentiation of human lymphocytes in comparison to  (OA).Human lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of health men and cultured in the presence of growing concentrations of PA or OA (5 to 200 μM), for 24 h. After that, cells were collected and cytotoxicity evaluated by flow cytometry. Then, we analyzed proliferative capacity in lymphocytes treated with non toxic concentrations of PA and OA (25 and 50 μM, respectively), in the presence or absence of concanavalin A (ConA). The Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production was determined by the Cytometric Bead Array. CD28 and CD95 surface expression and T regulatory cell percentage were determined by flow cytometry.We observed that PA is toxic to lymphocytes above 50 μM. PA promoted a decrease of lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by ConA in both concentrations. PA also decreased CD28 externalization and increased CD95. On the other hand, OA did not alter these parameters. In the same way, PA reduced IL6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL17A production in both concentration and IL2 only at 50 μM (in the presence of ConA). OA promoted IFN-gamma reduction in both concentrations and an increase of IL-2, IL4 and IL10 at 25 μM. Both fatty acids decreased the percentage of T regulatory cells.In conclusion, PA promoted a suppressive effect on lymphocyte proliferation characterized by a decrease of Th1 and Th17 response, and co-stimulatory molecule (CD28). However, OA increased lymphocyte proliferation through IL2 production and Th2 response. These results also show a more suppressive effect of PA on lymphocytes in comparison to OA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032721>Palmitic  triggers inflammatory responses in N42 cultured hypothalamic cells partially via ceramide synthesis but not via TLR4.</a></h1><p>A high-fat diet induces hypothalamic inflammation in rodents which, in turn, contributes to the development of obesity by eliciting both  and leptin . However, the mechanism by which long-chain saturated fatty acids trigger inflammation is still contentious. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of fatty acids on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα was investigated in the mHypoE-N42 hypothalamic cell line (N42). N42 cells were treated with lauric  (LA) and palmitic  (PA). PA challenge was carried out in the presence of either a TLR4 inhibitor, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor (L-cycloserine),  (OA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Intracellular ceramide accumulation was quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. PA but not LA upregulated IL-6 and TNFα. L-cycloserine, OA and EPA all counteracted PA-induced intracellular ceramide accumulation leading to a downregulation of IL-6 and TNFα. However, a TLR4 inhibitor failed to inhibit PA-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, PA induced the expression of IL-6 and TNFα in N42 neuronal cells independently of TLR4 but, partially, via ceramide synthesis with OA and EPA being anti-inflammatory by decreasing PA-induced intracellular ceramide build-up. Thus, ceramide accumulation represents one on the mechanisms by which PA induces inflammation in neurons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[ is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by fatty acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h1><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors.

Therefore, the study was designed to explore the antioxidant and hypolipidemic activity of swertiamarin in ameliorating NAFLD caused due to hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and . Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells by supplementing 1mM  (OA) for 24h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipid droplets. This was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining and triglyceride accumulation. Swertiamarin (25μg/ml) decreased triglyceride content by 2 folds and effectively reduced LDH release (50%) activity by protecting membrane integrity thus, preventing apoptosis evidenced by reduced cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP1. We observed that swertiamarin significantly increased the expressions of major  signaling proteins like  receptor (IR), PI(3)K, pAkt with concomitant reduction in p307 IRS-1. AMPK was activated by swertiamarin action, thus restoring  sensitivity in hepatocytes. In addition, qPCR results confirmed OA up-regulated Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP)-1c and fatty  synthase (FAS), resulting in increased fatty  synthesis. Swertiamarin effectively modulated PPAR-α, a major potential regulator of carbohydrate metabolism which, in turn, decreased the levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK, further restricting hepatic glucose production and fatty  synthesis. Cumulatively, swertiamarin targets potential metabolic regulators AMPK and PPAR-α, through which it regulates hepatic glycemic burden, fat accumulation,  and ROS in hepatic steatosis which emphasizes clinical significance of swertiamarin in regulating metabolism and as a suitable candidate for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Linolenic  (C 26.14%), Linoleic  (C 41.13%) and  (C 17.07%) were the dominant fatty acids in the FSO. β-sitosterol was the major sterol (85.3%) in the FSO. LnLnO (17.1%), LLL (16.6%), OLL and OOLn (8.4%), were the abundant triglycerides. The hexane extract of fenugreek seed (exhibiting the powerful inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase) was purified using a bioassay-guided fractionation affording one fenugreek TG: (11Z)-11- eicosenoic  2, 3- bis[((9Z, 12Z, 15Z)-1-oxo-9, 12, 15-octadecatrien-1-yl)oxy] propyl ester. In diabetic rats, the administration of the fenugreek TG inhibited α-amylase activity in small intestine by 36% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, fenugreek TG increased  sensibility which leads to decrease in blood glucose level by 43%. In addition, this study demonstrated that administration of pure fenugreek TG to diabetic rats ameliorated the glycogen rate in liver and muscle. In addition, the administration of fenugreek TG reverted back the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme respectively in kidney and plasma by 33 and 29%. Interestingly, the fenugreek TG inhibited lipase activity in small intestine by 33% which leads to the regulation of lipid profile. Moreover, the fenugreek TG protected liver-kidney function evidenced by histological study. In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that the administration of fenugreek TG to diabetic rats can make it a potential candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28862046>Glucose metabolism and metabolic flexibility in cultured skeletal muscle cells is related to exercise status in young male subjects.</a></h1><p>We hypothesised that skeletal muscles of healthy young people have a large variation in oxidative capacity and fibre-type composition, and aimed therefore to investigate glucose metabolism in biopsies and myotubes isolated from musculus vastus lateralis from healthy males with varying degrees of maximal oxygen uptake. Trained and intermediary trained subjects showed higher carbohydrate oxidation in vivo. Fibre-type distribution in biopsies and myotubes did not differ between groups. There was no correlation between fibre-type I expression in biopsies and myotubes. Myotubes from trained had higher deoxyglucose accumulation and fractional glucose oxidation (glucose oxidation relative to glucose uptake), and were also more sensitive to the suppressive action of acutely added  to the cells.

Metabolomic profiling studies have identified a number of metabolites whose fasting levels are associated with dysglycemia and type 2 diabetes. These metabolites may serve as the basis of an alternative test for IGT. Using the stable isotope dilution technique, quantitative assays were developed for 23 candidate biomarker metabolites. These metabolites were measured in fasting plasma samples taken just prior to an OGTT from 1623 nondiabetic subjects: 955 from the Relationship between  Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease Study (RISC Study; 11.7% IGT) and 668 subjects from the Diabetes Mellitus and Vascular Health Initiative (DMVhi) cohort from the DEXLIFE project (11.8% IGT). The associations between metabolites, anthropometric, and metabolic parameters and 2hPG values were assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients and Random Forest classification analysis to rank variables for their ability to distinguish IGT from normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Multivariate logistic regression models for estimating risk of IGT were developed and evaluated using AUCs calculated from the corresponding ROC curves. A model based on the fasting plasma levels of glucose, α-hydroxybutyric , β-hydroxybutyric , 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic , linoleoylglycerophosphocholine, , serine and vitamin B5 was optimized in the RISC cohort (AUC = 0.82) and validated in the DMVhi cohort (AUC = 0.83). A novel, all-metabolite-based test is shown to be a discriminate marker of IGT. It requires only a single fasted blood draw and may serve as a more convenient surrogate for the OGTT or as a means of identifying subjects likely to be IGT.© 2014 Diabetes Technology Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25792746>Opposite cross-talk by oleate and palmitate on  signaling in hepatocytes through macrophage activation.</a></h1><p>Chronic low grade inflammation in adipose tissue during obesity is associated with an impairment of the  signaling cascade. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of palmitate or oleate overload of macrophage/Kupffer cells in triggering stress-mediated signaling pathways, in lipoapoptosis, and in the cross-talk with  signaling in hepatocytes. RAW 264.7 macrophages or Kupffer cells were stimulated with oleate or palmitate, and levels of M1/M2 polarization markers and the lipidomic profile of eicosanoids were analyzed. Whereas proinflammatory cytokines and total eicosanoids were elevated in macrophages/Kupffer cells stimulated with palmitate, enhanced arginase 1 and lower leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were detected in macrophages stimulated with oleate. When hepatocytes were pretreated with conditioned medium (CM) from RAW 264.7 or Kupffer cells loaded with palmitate (CM-P), phosphorylation of stress kinases and endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling was increased,  signaling was impaired, and lipoapoptosis was detected. Conversely, enhanced  receptor-mediated signaling and reduced levels of the phosphatases protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were found in hepatocytes treated with CM from macrophages stimulated with oleate (CM-O). Supplementation of CM-O with LTB4 suppressed  sensitization and increased PTP1B and PTEN. Furthermore, LTB4 decreased  receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in hepatocytes, activated the NFκB pathway, and up-regulated PTP1B and PTEN, these effects being mediated by LTB4 receptor BTL1. In conclusion, oleate and palmitate elicit an opposite cross-talk between macrophages/Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Whereas CM-P interferes at the early steps of  signaling, CM-O increases  sensitization, possibly by reducing LTB4.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768879>[The person in philogenesis is not (omnivores), but the herbivores with the carnivores past and the fuzzy future.

Dietary ALA can undergo desaturation and elongation to form long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent to which this occurs in humans is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an energy-restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of palmitic , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk energy-restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion. Additionally, dietary ALA was unable to compensate for a decrease in serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Accompanying these changes, treatment with 6-gingerol attenuates excessive triglyceride accumulation, enhances mitochondrial function, and promotes a transition from a fast- to slow-fiber type and muscle oxidative metabolism in the red gastrocnemius of ageing rats. More importantly, 6-gingerol not only increases the plasma and adipose tissue adiponectin concentrations, but also elevates muscular AdipoR1 expression and activates downstream AMPK phosphorylation as well as upregulates PGC-1α in vivo and in vitro.6-Gingerol may improve ectopic lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and  in skeletal muscle of ageing rats. These effects rely, at least in part, on the elevated plasma adiponectin concentration and muscle AdipoR1 level to dually activate the AMPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the effect of exercise on substrate oxidation is less clear in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects than in lean subjects. We investigated glucose and lipid metabolism and gene expression after 48 h with low-frequency electrical pulse stimulation (EPS), as an in vitro model of exercise, in cultured myotubes established from lean nondiabetic subjects and severely obese subjects (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) with and without type 2 diabetes. EPS induced an increase in  sensitivity but did not improve lipid oxidation in myotubes from severely obese subjects. Thus, EPS-induced increases in  sensitivity and lipid oxidation were positively and negatively correlated to BMI of the subjects, respectively. EPS enhanced oxidative capacity of glucose in myotubes from all subjects. Furthermore, EPS reduced mRNA expression of slow fiber-type marker (MYH7) in myotubes from diabetic subjects; however, the protein expression of this marker was not significantly affected by EPS in either of the donor groups. On the contrary, mRNA levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were unaffected by EPS in myotubes from diabetic subjects, while IL-6 mRNA expression was increased in myotubes from nondiabetic subjects. EPS-stimulated mRNA expression levels of MYH7, IL-6, and IL-8 correlated negatively with subjects' HbA1c and/or fasting plasma glucose, suggesting an effect linked to the diabetic phenotype. Taken together, these data show that myotubes from different donor groups respond differently to EPS, suggesting that this effect may reflect the in vivo characteristics of the donor groups.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820969>Dual Specificity Phosphatase 12 Regulates Hepatic Lipid Metabolism Through Inhibition of the Lipogenesis and Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase 1 Pathways.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after palmitic / treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased  sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, , and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide peptide (GLPP) has therapeutic effect on NAFLD.Ob/ ob mouse model and ApoC3 transgenic mouse model were used for exploring the effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Key metabolic pathways and enzymes were identified by metabolomics combining with KEGG and PIUmet analyses and key enzymes were detected by Western blot. Hepatosteatosis models of HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes were used to further confirm the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD.GLPP administrated for a month alleviated hepatosteatosis, dyslipidemia, liver dysfunction and liver . Pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty  metabolism and primary bile  biosynthesis were involved in the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Detection of key enzymes revealed that GLPP reversed low expression of CYP7A1, CYP8B1, FXR, SHP and high expression of FGFR4 in ob/ob mice and ApoC3 mice. Besides, GLPP inhibited fatty  synthesis by reducing the expression of SREBP1c, FAS and ACC via a FXR-SHP dependent mechanism. Additionally, GLPP reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and the content of TG in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes induced by  and palmitic .GLPP significantly improves NAFLD via regulating bile  synthesis dependent on FXR-SHP/FGF pathway, which finally inhibits fatty  synthesis, indicating that GLPP might be developed as a therapeutic drug for NAFLD.© 2018 The Author(s).

For these reasons, we studied the protective role of oleate in the  and in the atherosclerotic process at cellular level such as in cardiomyocytes (CMs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs).The effect of oleate in the cardiovascular , vascular dysfunction, inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs were analyzed by Western blot, qRT-PCR, BrdU incorporation and cell cycle analysis.Palmitate induced . However, oleate not only did not induce cardiovascular  but also had a protective effect against  induced by palmitate or TNFα. One mechanism involved might be the prevention by oleate of JNK-1/2 or NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α or palmitate. Oleate reduced MCP-1 and ICAM-1 and increased eNOS expression induced by proinflammatory cytokines in ECs. Furthermore, oleate impaired the proliferation induced by TNF-α, angiotensin II or palmitate and the apoptosis induced by TNF-α or thapsigargin in VSMCs.Our data suggest a differential role between oleate and palmitate and support the concept of the cardioprotector role of oleate as the main lipid component of virgin olive oil. Thus, oleate protects against cardiovascular , improves endothelial dysfunction in response to proinflammatory signals and finally, reduces proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs that may contribute to an ameliorated atherosclerotic process and plaque stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261661>Fc Gamma Receptor IIb Expressed in Hepatocytes Promotes Lipid Accumulation and Gluconeogenesis.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver, usually combined with hepatic .

Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental lipid transport and metabolism remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and -sensitizing properties, is synthesized from palmitic  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA,  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls.

The -depended cells absorb palmitic saturated fatty ,  mono-unsaturated fatty  and of the same name triglycerides in very low density lipoproteins.

The palmitic saturated fatty acids in the form of polyether of cholesterol turn into linoleic very low density lipoproteins from high density lipoproteins at impact of protein transferring polyene ethers of cholesterol. They transform very low density lipoproteins into low density lipoproteins of the same name; the cells absorb them by force of апоЕ/В-100 endocytosis.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, , linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001).

Here we found that miR-200b and miR-200c were reduced in the steatotic livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This down-regulation was accompanied by an increase in the expression of lipogenic proteins such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty  synthase (FAS). The suppression of miR-200b and miR-200c in Hep1-6 and NCTC1469 hepatocytes enhanced intracellular triglyceride levels, which were associated with increased SREBP-1 and FAS protein levels. In contrast, the over-expression of miR-200b and miR-200c suppressed lipid accumulation and reduced the expression of SREBP1 and FAS in Hep1-6 and NCTC1469 cells transfected with miR-200b or miR-200c mimics.

The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with palmitic  (PA) and  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation.

The pathology of low density lipoproteins is primary deficiency of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in cells, atherosclerosis and atheromotosis of intima of arteries of elastic type with development of dense plaques from poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the form of polyethers of cholesterol.

As for the prevention of disorders of transfer of fatty acids to very low-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins is common in many ways - minimization of aphysiological effect of surplus amount of food, biological function of diet.

Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in -dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of palmitic , an increase in , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967167>Ablation of PM20D1 reveals -acyl amino  control of metabolism and nociception.</a></h1><p>-acyl amino acids (NAAs) are a structurally diverse class of bioactive signaling lipids whose endogenous functions have largely remained uncharacterized. To clarify the physiologic roles of NAAs, we generated mice deficient in the circulating enzyme peptidase M20 domain-containing 1 (PM20D1). Global PM20D1-KO mice have dramatically reduced NAA hydrolase/synthase activities in tissues and blood with concomitant bidirectional dysregulation of endogenous NAAs. Compared with control animals, PM20D1-KO mice exhibit a variety of metabolic and pain phenotypes, including , altered body temperature in cold, and antinociceptive behaviors. Guided by these phenotypes, we identify -oleoyl-glutamine (C18:1-Gln) as a key PM20D1-regulated NAA. In addition to its mitochondrial uncoupling bioactivity, C18:1-Gln also antagonizes certain members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) calcium channels including TRPV1. Direct administration of C18:1-Gln to mice is sufficient to recapitulate a subset of phenotypes observed in PM20D1-KO animals. These data demonstrate that PM20D1 is a dominant enzymatic regulator of NAA levels in vivo and elucidate physiologic functions for NAA signaling in metabolism and nociception.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

In vivo, exogenous fatty acids transfer α-lipoproteins to all cells and chylomicrons to hepatocytes. The endogenous  fatty , synthesized in hepatocytes is transferred to all cells by β-lipoproteins and to -dependent lipoproteins of very low density. The limitation of cognitive biological function in herbivorous animals underlies the process of transferring of surplus amount of exogenous palmitic  and alcohol cholesterol by β-lipoproteins becoming a non-physiological one. The bio-availability is affected concerning cells of exogenous polyene fatty acids that transfer in blood α-lipoproteins in carnivorous animals and at the first stage in herbivorous animals. The formation of palmitic non-ligand very low density lipoproteins-β-proteins is affected and their collection and partial utilization in intima generates lipoidosis. In summary, all this becomes a cause of formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. The limitations in phylogenesis of cognitive biological function are considered as an etiological factor of metabolic pandemics. The etiological factors are specific for every one of metabolic pandemics and pathogenesis of all pandemics is developed following common algorithm. It is likely that metabolic pandemics (atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, metabolic essential arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome, syndrome of , obesity and non-alcoholic fatty disease of liver)are quite not identical to nosologic forms of diseases if considered according etiological factors, pathogenesis and pathology rate in population. The exclusion of all inherent forms of disorder of metabolism of fatty acids and their transfer in β-lipoproteins demonstrates that problem of atherosclerosis, atheromatosis, coronarosclerosis and ischemic heart disease mainly turns out to be a case of eaten one's fill , a result of environment factors impact, disorder of biological function of trophology, biological reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition) and biological function of homeostasis.

Lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, glucose uptake and cell inflammation were evaluated by cellular biochemical assay, respectively. Signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C) and patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3), glucose uptake including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (pAKT), and oxidative stress including nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) and 2E1 (CYP2E1) were investigated by western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively.DHC decreased the levels of cellular triglycerides (TG) by regulating the mRNA and protein expression levels of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3 and PPARα. At the same time, DHC improved the hepatocellular glucose uptake by increasing the protein expression levels of pAKT and PI3K.

These pathological conditions involve interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in nutriepigenomics are contributing to clarify the role of some nutritional factors, including dietary fatty acids in gene expression regulation. This systematic review assesses currently available information concerning the role of the different fatty acids on epigenetic mechanisms that affect the development of chronic diseases or induce protective effects on metabolic alterations.A targeted search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline databases using the keywords "fatty acids and epigenetic". The data were analyzed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines.Consumption fatty acids like n-3 PUFA: EPA and DHA, and MUFA:  and palmitoleic  was associated with an improvement of metabolic alterations. On the other hand, fatty acids that have been associated with the presence or development of obesity, T2D, pro-inflammatory profile, atherosclerosis and IR were n-6 PUFA, saturated fatty acids (stearic and palmitic), and trans fatty acids (elaidic), have been also linked with epigenetic changes.Fatty acids can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms and consequently result in positive or negative impacts on metabolic outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401392>Alpha-naphthoflavone attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in -treated HepG2 hepatocytes and in high fat diet-fed mice.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease. The literature suggests that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) may be a key player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and it can modulate the synthesis of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Previous studies have shown that CYP1A1 is a key enzyme of oxidative stress, TNF-α is involved in the formation of  (IR), oxidative stress and  are the key factors for the formation of NAFLD. Therefore, it can be said that AHR may participate in contributing to NAFLD by regulating CYP1A1 and TNF-α. Alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) is an effective AHR inhibitor. The present study was designed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of ANF in high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice and  (OA)-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. Mice were fed HFD to induce NAFLD, HepG2 cells were exposed to OA to induce hepatocyte injury, and ANF significantly reduced mouse and cellular liver damage compared to the HFD-induced NAFLD and OA-treated HepG2 hepatocytes. ANF treatment reduces liver damage by reducing ROS and IR, the data show that ANF inhibits the expression of AHR, CYP1A1 and TNF-α in NAFLD. Taken together, these findings show that ANF alleviate NAFLD via regulation of AHR/CYP1A1 and AHR/TNF-α pathways, which may have potential for further development as novel therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Both are associated with changes in the circulating metabolome, but causal directions have been difficult to disentangle. We combined untargeted plasma metabolomics by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in three non-diabetic cohorts with Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to obtain new insights into early metabolic alterations in IR and impaired  secretion. In up to 910 elderly men we found associations of 52 metabolites with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp-measured IR and/or β-cell responsiveness (disposition index) during an oral glucose tolerance test. These implicated bile , glycerophospholipid and caffeine metabolism for IR and fatty  biosynthesis for impaired  secretion. In MR analysis in two separate cohorts (n = 2,613) followed by replication in three independent studies profiled on different metabolomics platforms (n = 7,824 / 8,961 / 8,330), we discovered and replicated causal effects of IR on lower levels of palmitoleic  and . A trend for a causal effect of IR on higher levels of tyrosine reached significance only in meta-analysis. In one of the largest studies combining "gold standard" measures for  responsiveness with non-targeted metabolomics, we found distinct metabolic profiles related to IR or impaired  secretion.

They are currently proposed as therapeutic targets for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We studied the gene expression regulation of UCP1, -2, and -3 in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) from control and MetS rats treated with two doses of a commercial mixture of resveratrol (RSV) and quercetin (QRC). We found that UCP2 was the predominantly expressed isoform, UCP3 was present at very low levels, and UCP1 was undetectable. The treatment with RSV + QRC did not modify UCP3 levels; however, it significantly increased UCP2 mRNA in control and MetS rats in association with an increase in  and linoleic fatty acids. WAT from MetS rats showed a significantly increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ when compared to the control group. Furthermore, PPAR-α protein levels were increased by the highest dose of RSV + QRC in the control and MetS groups. PPAR-γ expression was only increased in the control group. We conclude that the RSV + QRC treatment leads to overexpression of UCP2, which is associated with an increase in MUFA and PUFA, which might increase PPAR-α expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26883301>Differentiation with elaidate tends to impair -dependent glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and  is associated with a quality of dietary fatty acids such as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.

However, little is known about the roles of elaidate in  responsiveness. We show here that elaidate impairs -dependent glucose uptake in adipocytes. Differentiation with 10 μM elaidate, which is close to physiological plasma concentration, reduces -dependent glucose uptake. Furthermore, -dependent GLUT4 translocation is disturbed in adipocytes differentiated with elaidate. In addition, analysis of lipolysis and gene expression shows that deteriorative effects of elaidate on  responsiveness are limited but not general. Thus, our findings reveal that differentiation with elaidate tends to affect -dependent glucose uptake through alternation of GLUT4 translocation from cytosol to the plasma membrane.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27344992>A panel of free fatty  ratios to predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy obese individuals.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidences support that metabolically healthy obese (MHO) is a transient state.

However, the pathogenesis of NASH is still unclear. Accumulation of lipid droplets and  is the hallmark of NASH. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) plays key role in glucose metabolism via regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, we demonstrated a novel of PDK4 in NASH by regulating hepatic steatosis and  signaling pathway in methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH model. Hepatic PDK4 levels were highly induced in human patients with NASH and MCD diet fed mice, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . The glucose and lipid metabolism were impaired in Pdk4 mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis significantly in NASH mice. Pdk4-MCD mice had reduced liver weights and triglyceride (TG) levels. And Pdk4 deficiency dramatically reduced the expression of genes related to fatty  uptake, synthesis and gluconeogenesis. In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-SAPK/JNK and diminished p-ERK, p-P38, p-Akt and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed. In conclusion, our data indicated that PDK4 potentially contributes to the hepatic steatosis in NASH via regulating several signaling pathway and PDK4 may be a new therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, its impact on atherosclerosis has not been examined in detail.LDL receptor knock out (LDLR-KO) mice are fed a Western diet supplemented with 5% (w/w) palmitoleate concentrate, -rich olive oil, or none (control) for 12 weeks. Dietary palmitoleate increases hepatic C16:1 levels, improves plasma and hepatic lipid/lipoprotein profiles (≈40% decrease in triglycerides), and reduces the atherosclerotic plaque area by ≈45% compared with control or olive oil group (p < 0.05). These favorable changes are accompanied by the downregulation of key genes, such as Srebp1c, Scd1, Il-1β, and Tnfα. ApoB-depleted plasma from mice fed palmitoleate has increased cholesterol efflux capacity by 20% from ABCA1-expressing cells (p < 0.05). A beneficial effect of palmitoleate on glucose metabolism (54% decreased in HOMA-IR, p < 0.05) is also observed.Dietary-supplemented palmitoleate reduces atherosclerosis development in LDLR-KO mice, and is associated with improvement of lipid and glucose metabolism and favorable changes in regulatory genes involved in lipogenesis and inflammation.

These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out -induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for adipogenesis and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or  levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

DNA methylation is a potent regulator of gene expression and may be associated with protein levels. In this study we investigate whether the effect of dietary fatty acids on TNFa released from adipocytes might be associated with modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation status. A group of rats was assigned to three diets with a different composition of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Samples of visceral adipose tissues were taken for adipocyte isolation, in which released TNFa levels were measured, and for methylation and expression studies. In addition, 3 T3-L1 cells were treated with palmitic,  and linoleic acids, with and without 5-Azacitydine (5-AZA). After treatments, cells and supernatants were included in the same analyses as rat samples. TNFa promoter methylation levels, gene expression and secretion were different according to the diets and fatty  treatments associated with them. Cells treated with 5-AZA displayed higher TNFa levels than in the absence of 5-AZA, without differences between fatty acids. According to our results, dietary fatty  regulation of adipocyte TNFa levels may be mediated by epigenetic modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, monounsaturated free fatty acids (e.g. oleate) prevent the toxic effect of SFFAs in various types of cells. The mechanism is poorly understood and involvement of the mTOR complex is untested. In the present study, we demonstrate that oleate preconditioning, as well as coincubation, completely prevented palmitate-induced markers of inflammatory signaling,  and cytotoxicity in C2C12 myotubes. We then examined the effect of palmitate and/or oleate on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal path and whether their link is mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Palmitate decreased the phosphorylation of raptor and 4E-BP1 while increasing the phosphorylation of p70S6K. Palmitate also inhibited phosphorylation of AMPK, but did not change the phosphorylated levels of mTOR or rictor. Oleate completely prevented the palmitate-induced dysregulation of mTOR components and restored pAMPK whereas alone it produced no signaling changes. To understand this more, we show activation of AMPK by metformin also prevented palmitate-induced changes in the phosphorylations of raptor and p70S6K, confirming that the mTORC1/p70S6K signaling pathway is responsive to AMPK activity. By contrast, inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation by Compound C worsened palmitate-induced changes and correspondingly blocked the protective effect of oleate. Finally, metformin modestly attenuated palmitate-induced  and cytotoxicity, as did oleate. Our findings indicate that palmitate activates mTORC1/p70S6K signaling by AMPK inhibition and phosphorylation of raptor. Oleate reverses these effects through a metformin-like facilitation of AMPK.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2L mice) have increased circulating free fatty acids (FAs), dramatically increased hepatic CD36 expression and profound fatty liver. To investigate the role of elevated CD36 in the development of fatty liver, we studied two models of hepatic steatosis, a genetic model (JAK2L mice) and a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis model. We deleted Cd36 specifically in hepatocytes of JAK2L mice to generate double knockouts and from wild-type mice to generate CD36L single-knockout mice. Hepatic Cd36 disruption in JAK2L livers significantly improved steatosis by lowering triglyceride, diacylglycerol, and cholesterol ester content. The largest differences in liver triglycerides were in species comprised of  (C18:1). Reduction in liver lipids correlated with an improvement in the inflammatory markers that were elevated in JAK2L mice, namely aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase. Cd36 deletion in mice on HFD (CD36L-HFD) reduced liver lipid content and decreased hepatic 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-FA uptake as compared with CON-HFD. Additionally, CD36L-HFD mice had improved whole-body  sensitivity and reduced liver and serum inflammatory markers. Therefore, CD36 directly contributes to development of fatty liver under conditions of elevated free FAs by modulating the rate of FA uptake by hepatocytes. In HFD-fed animals, disruption of hepatic Cd36 protects against associated systemic inflammation and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282899>A Study on Neonatal Intake of Oleanolic  and Metformin in Rats () with Metabolic Dysfunction: Implications on Lipid Metabolism and Glucose Transport.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome, a cluster of different disorders which include diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases, is a global epidemic that is growing at an alarming rate. The origins of disease can be traced back to early developmental stages of life. This has increased mortalities and continues to reduce life expectancies of individuals across the globe. The aim of this study was to investigate the sub-acute and long term effects of neonatal oral administration of oleanolic  and metformin on lipids (free fatty acids, FFAs) and genes associated with lipid metabolism and glucose transport using a neonatal rat experimental model. In the first study, seven days old pups were randomly grouped into control-distilled water (DW); oleanolic  (60 mg/kg), metformin (500 mg/kg), high fructose diet (20% /, HF), oleanolic  (OA) + high fructose diet (OA + HF), and Metformin + high fructose diet (MET + HF) groups. The pups were treated for 7 days, and then terminated on postnatal day (PD) 14. In the second study, rat pups were initially treated similarly to study 1 and weaned onto normal rat chow and plain drinking water on PD 21 till they reached adulthood (PD112). Tissue and blood samples were collected for further analyses. Measurement of the levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) was done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze the gene expression of , , , ,  and  in the skeletal muscle. The results showed that HF accelerated accumulation of saturated FFAs within skeletal muscles. The HF fed neonatal rats had increased stearic , which was associated with decreased glucose, suppressed expression of , ,  and  genes, and increased expression of  ( < 0.01) and . OA + HF and MET + HF treated groups had increased mono- and polyunsaturated FFAs; , and octadecadienoic acids than the HF group. These unsaturated FFAs were associated with increased ,  and  ( < 0.01) and decreased  and  ( < 0.05) in both OA + HF and MET + HF treated groups.The present study shows that neonatal oral administration of oleanolic  and metformin potentially protects against the development of fructose-induced metabolic dysfunction in the rats in both short and long time periods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670757>Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor antagonist, SKL-14959, suppressed body weight gain on diet-induced obesity mice.</a></h1><p>Gastric inhibitory polypeptide plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism and is associated with obesity and . The objective of this study is to confirm the anti-obesity effects of the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor antagonist, SKL-14959, on diet-induced obesity mice.Diet-induced obesity mice at 20 weeks of age were administered with or without SKL-14959 for 96 d. Body weight and food intake were monitored throughout the experiment. Mice were sacrificed, and physiological and biochemical markers were measured, and then histochemical and gene expression analyses were also performed. In further studies, mice were orally gavaged with [C]- to investigate the excursion of digested lipids.SKL-14959 significantly suppressed weight gain without affecting food intake, decreased triacylglycerol contents in the liver and the muscle and the intensity stained with oil-red in the liver. It also improved plasma glutamic pyruvic transaminase and 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in addition to notably down-regulated relative gene expression of srebf1 and dgat1 in the liver despite not altering in the adipose tissue. Furthermore, SKL-14959 showed remarkable inhibition of lipid uptake in the adipose tissue after the oil challenge.SKL-14959 inhibited lipids uptake and improved lipids metabolism, results in suppression of body-weight gain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30601634>[The  triglycerides of palm oil and palmitic triglycerides of creamy fat.

Although silibinin is used for the treatment of NASH in clinical, its effect on CFLAR-JNK pathway in NASH remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway in NASH models both  and . The  study was performed using male C57BL/6 mice fed with methionine- choline-deficient diet and simultaneously treated with silibinin for 6 weeks. The  study was performed by using mouse NCTC-1469 cells which were respectively pretreated with  plus palmitic , and adenovirus-down  for 24 h, then treated with silibinin for 24 h. After the drug treatment, the key indicators involved in CFLAR-JNK pathway including hepatic injury, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress were determined.

Silibinin prevented NASH by regulating CFLAR-JNK pathway, and thereby on one hand promoting the -oxidation and efflux of fatty acids in liver to relieve lipid accumulation, and on the other hand inducing antioxidase activity (CAT, GSH-Px and HO-1) and inhibiting pro-oxidase activity (CYP2E1 and CYP4A) to relieve oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119530>Decreased lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis are coupled with changes in liver microRNAs in obese subjects with NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Many controversies regarding the association of liver miRNAs with obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) call for additional validations. This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and inflammation was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with palmitic  (PA), a combination of palmitate and , or high glucose, and  (HG) mimicking  in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders. Decreased miR-122-5p in liver was associated with impaired FA usage. Expression of inflammatory and macrophage-related genes was opposite to decreased miR-30b-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-422a, whereas increased miR-146b-5p was associated with FABP4 and decreased glucose metabolism and FA mobilization. In partial agreement, PA (but not HG) led to decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-422a and miR-146a in vitro, in parallel with increased lipogenesis and FA transport, decreased glucose metabolism and diminished FA oxidation.This study confirms decreased liver glucose and lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis coupled with changes in five unique miRNAs in obese patients with NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461456>Elovl6 Deficiency Improves Glycemic Control in Diabetic / Mice by Expanding β-Cell Mass and Increasing  Secretory Capacity.</a></h1><p>Dysfunctional fatty  (FA) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of β-cell dysfunction and loss of β-cell mass in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Elovl6 is a microsomal enzyme that is responsible for converting C16 saturated and monounsaturated FAs into C18 species. We previously showed that Elovl6 played a critical role in the development of obesity-induced  by modifying FA composition. To further define its role in T2D development, we assessed the effects of  deletion in leptin receptor-deficient C57BL/KsJ / mice, a model of T2D. The /; mice had a markedly increased β-cell mass with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis, an adaptive increase in , and improved glycemic control. / islets were characterized by a prominent elevation of oleate (C18:1n-9), cell stress, and inflammation, which was completely suppressed by Elovl6 deletion. As a mechanistic ex vivo experiment, isolated islets from  mice exhibited reduced susceptibility to palmitate-induced inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and β-cell apoptosis. In contrast, oleate-treated islets resulted in impaired glucose-stimulated  secretion with suppressed related genes irrespective of the Elovl6 gene. Taken together, Elovl6 is a fundamental factor linking dysregulated lipid metabolism to β-cell dysfunction, islet inflammation, and β-cell apoptosis in T2D, highlighting oleate as the potential culprit of β-cell lipotoxicity.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28029544>LC-MS/MS method for quantitation of seven biomarkers in human plasma for the assessment of  and impaired glucose tolerance.</a></h1><p>Early detection of  (IR) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is crucial for delaying and preventing the progression toward type 2 diabetes. We recently developed and validated a straightforward metabolite-based test for the assessment of IR and IGT in a single LC-MS/MS method. Plasma samples were diluted with isotopically-labeled internal standards and extracted by simple protein precipitation. The extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for the quantitation of 2-hydroxybutyric  (0.500-40.0μg/mL), 3-hydroxybutyric  (1.00-80.0μg/mL), 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic  (0.500-20.0μg/mL), 1-linoleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (2.50-100μg/mL),  (10.0-400μg/mL), pantothenic  (0.0100-0.800μg/mL), and serine (2.50-100μg/mL). Liquid chromatography was carried out on a reversed phase column with a run time of 3.1min and the mass spectrometer operated in negative MRM mode. Method validation was performed on three identical LC-MS/MS systems with five runs each. Sufficient linearity (R>0.99) was observed for all the analytes over the ranges. The imprecision (CVs) was found to be less than 5.5% for intra-run and less than 5.8% for inter-run for the seven analytes. The analytical recovery was determined to be between 96.3 and 103% for the seven analytes.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic  (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty  amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26302954>Long-term effect of early postnatal overnutrition on  and serum fatty  profiles in male rats.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence suggests that overnutrition during the early postnatal period, a critical window of development, increases the risk of adult-onset obesity and . In this study, we investigated the impact of overnutrition during the suckling period on body weight, serum biochemistry and serum fatty  metabolomics in male rats.Rats raised in small litters (SL, 3 pups/dam) and normal litters (NL, 10 pups/dam) were used to model early postnatal overnutrition and control, respectively. Serum glucose, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, free fatty ,  and leptin concentrations were assayed using standard biochemical techniques. Serum fatty acids were identified and quantified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach. mRNA and protein levels of key components of the  receptor signaling pathway were measured in epididymal fat and gastrocnemius muscle by quantitative PCR and western blotting.SL rats were 37.3 % and 15.1 % heavier than NL rats at weaning and 16-weeks-old, respectively. They had increased visceral fat mass, adult-onset  and glucose intolerance as well as elevated serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All detectable fatty acids were elevated in the serum of SL pups at weaning compared to NL controls, and significant increases in the levels of four fatty acids (palmitic , palmitoleic ,  and arachidonic ) persisted into adulthood. Moreover, a significantly positive correlation was identified between an  index (HOMA-IR) and concentrations of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and  in serum at postnatal 16 weeks. Early postnatal overnutrition also resulted in a significant downregulation of  receptor substrate-1 (Irs-1), protein kinase B (Akt2) and glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) at the protein level in epididymal fat of SL rats at 16 weeks, accompanied by decreased mRNA levels for Irs-1 and Glut4. In gastrocnemius muscle, Akt2 and Glut4 mRNA and Glut4 protein levels were significantly decreased in SL rats.This study demonstrates that early postnatal overnutrition can have long-lasting effects on body weight and serum fatty  profiles and can lead to impaired  signaling pathway in visceral white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, which may play a major role in IR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28335507>Hydroxytyrosol in the Prevention of the Metabolic Syndrome and Related Disorders.</a></h1><p>Virgin olive oil (VOO) constitutes the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet.

Amino  and fatty  changes were assessed, as well as food consumption, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, body composition and liver vacuolation (steatosis).Despite higher food intake, BSO decreased particularly fat mass but also lean mass (both P<0.001), and prevented fatty liver vacuolation. Physical activity increased during the dark phase. BSO decreased plasma free fatty acids and enhanced  sensitivity. BSO did not alter liver rGSH, but decreased plasma total GSH (tGSH) and rGSH (by ~70%), and liver tGSH (by 82%). Glutamate accumulated in plasma and liver. Urine excretion of cysteine and its precursors was increased by BSO. tCys, rCys and cystine decreased in plasma (by 23-45%, P<0.001 for all), but were maintained in liver, at the expense of decreased taurine.

However, the fatty  (FA) profile in red blood cells (RBC) from patients with liver fibrosis remains unexplored. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the fatty  profile in RBC, dietary lipid intake and  indicators in patients with NAFLD, according to the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Using elastography, patients were classified with ( = 52) and without ( = 37) advanced liver fibrosis. The fatty  profile in RBC was analyzed using gas chromatography and the lipid intake was evaluated through a 24-h dietary recall. Subjects with advanced liver fibrosis had higher levels of palmitic, stearic and  and total monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) and  ( < 0.05), and lower levels of elongase very long chain fatty acids protein-6 and the delta-5-desaturase enzymatic activity ( < 0.05). These results suggest a lack of regulation of enzymes related to FA metabolism in patients with advanced fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25879456>Desaturation index versus isotopically measured de novo lipogenesis as an indicator of acute systemic lipogenesis.</a></h1><p>High carbohydrate feeding is known to increase plasma triglycerides as well as hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and may be implicated in the development of hepatic  and fatty liver. Unfortunately, it is technically challenging to determine what proportion of circulating plasma triglycerides have been derived from the newly synthesized fatty acids in the postprandial period. The aims of this study were to 1) characterize the changes in the plasma postprandial total fatty  pool in beagles following the consumption of meals containing 44% (Control) and 74% (High Sucrose) carbohydrate and 2) determine if changes in plasma fatty  concentration and delta-9 desaturation index (DI) would be useful as simple and easy to measure biomarkers of systemic DNL.No differences in plasma total palmitic  (16:0), stearic  (18:0) and  (18:1) concentrations or delta-9 DI for the total 18:0 and 18:1 pools between High Sucrose and Controls were observed. However, newly synthesized 16:0 (2.6 ± 0.2% vs. 8.8 ± 2.0%; p = 0.016), 18:0 (0.93 ± 0.2% vs. 4.1 ± 1.7%; p = 0.007) and 18:1 (0.29 ± 0.09% vs. 3.5 ± 1.2%; p = 0.017) were higher in High Sucrose versus Control animals, respectively. Also, the delta-9 DI for the newly synthesized 18:0 and 18:1 pools was higher at 2 and 6 hours postprandial, with a pattern of change which supports the increased stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) activity following high carbohydrate feeding followed by a down regulation of this enzyme.Our data show that high sucrose meals increase the relative contribution of systemic DNL produced fatty acids to the total postprandial plasma fatty  pool. These data also show that a different pattern of both fatty  synthesis and disposal occurs depending on energy and macronutrient profile of the meal. These changes are in spite of no observable changes in the plasma concentrations or ratios of the total fatty  pool opposed to the observed changes in the newly synthesized fatty  pool.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423681>Effects of Fatty Acids on CYP2A5 and Nrf2 Expression in Mouse Primary Hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Abnormal fatty  metabolism is observed throughout nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis, and fatty  storage is an important inducing factor in , lipid oxidation, hepatic cell damage, and inflammation. During NAFLD pathogenesis, changes in blood and liver contents of different fatty  types also vary. Cytochrome P450 2A5 (CYP2A5), an important enzyme in mouse liver, metabolizes many drugs and activates multiple pro-carcinogens with widely varying structures. According to the changes in liver fatty  profiles observed in NAFLD animal models developed in our laboratory and others, saturated (PA/palmitic, and SA/stearic acids) and unsaturated (OA/, LA/linoleic, ALA/α-linolenic and AA/arachidonic acids) fatty acids were selected to induce mouse primary hepatocytes, at concentrations under 1 mM, as detected by MTT assay. After 24 h treatment with various fatty  concentrations and types, CYP2A5 mRNA and protein amounts, and enzyme activity were determined by real-time PCR, Western blot, and Coumarin 7-hydroxylation, respectively. Meanwhile, Nrf2 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot. The results indicated that saturated fatty acids are more potent in inducing CYP2A5 than unsaturated ones, except arachidonic . In addition, the changes in CYP2A5 expression were consistent with the alterations observed in Nrf2 expression, indicating that Nrf2 might play a regulatory role in CYP2A5 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26324406>Lipidomic evidence that lowering the typical dietary palmitate to oleate ratio in humans decreases the leukocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines and muscle expression of redox-sensitive genes.</a></h1><p>We recently reported that lowering the high, habitual palmitic  (PA) intake in ovulating women improved  sensitivity and both inflammatory and oxidative stress. In vitro studies indicate that PA can activate both cell membrane toll-like receptor-4 and the intracellular nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein (NLRP3). To gain further insight into the relevance to human metabolic disease of dietary PA, we studied healthy, lean and obese adults enrolled in a randomized, crossover trial comparing 3-week, high-PA (HPA) and low-PA/high- (HOA) diets. After each diet, both hepatic and peripheral  sensitivities were measured, and we assessed cytokine concentrations in plasma and in supernatants derived from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as proinflammatory gene expression in skeletal muscle.  sensitivity was unaffected by diet. Plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α was higher during the HPA diet. Lowering the habitually high PA intake by feeding the HOA diet resulted in lower secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α by PBMCs, as well as lower relative mRNA expression of cJun and NLRP3 in muscle. Principal components analysis of 156 total variables coupled to analysis of covariance indicated that the mechanistic pathway for the differential dietary effects on PBMCs involved changes in the PA/OA ratio of tissue lipids. Our results indicate that lowering the dietary and tissue lipid PA/OA ratio resulted in lower leukocyte production of proinflammatory cytokines and muscle expression of redox-sensitive genes, but the relevance to diabetes risk is uncertain.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with pancreatic triglyceride content (PTGC), and to investigate the impact of bariatric surgery on ectopic fat pads, pancreatic fat (PTGC) and hepatic fat (HTGC).In all, 45 subjects (13 lean, 13 obese nondiabetics and 19 T2D, matched for age and gender) underwent 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, computed tomography of the visceral abdominal fat, metabolic and lipidomic analysis, including  homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), -secretion homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-B) and plasma fatty- composition. Twenty obese subjects were reassessed 6 months after the bariatric surgery.PTGC was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic subjects (23.8±3.2%) compared with obese (14.0±3.3; P=0.03) and lean subjects (7.5±0.9%; P=0.0002). PTGC remained significantly associated with T2D after adjusting for age and sex (β=0.47; P=0.004) or even after adjusting for waist circumference, triglycerides and HOMA-IR (β=0.32; P=0.04). T2D, C18:1n-9 (), uric , triglycerides and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were the five more important parameters involved in PTGC prediction (explained 80% of PTGC variance). Bariatric surgery induced a huge reduction of both HTGC (-51.2±7.9%) and PTGC (-43.8±7.0%) reaching lean levels, whereas body mass index remained greatly elevated. An improvement of  HOMA-IR and no change in HOMA-B were observed after bariatric surgery. The PTGC or HTGC losses were not correlated, suggesting tissue-specific mobilization of these ectopic fat stores.Pancreatic fat increased with T2D and drastically decreased after the bariatric surgery. This suggests that decreased PTGC may contribute to improved beta cell function seen after the bariatric surgery. Further, long-term interventional studies are warranted to examine this hypothesis and to determine the degree to which ectopic fat mobilization may mediate the improvement in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403174>Exercise in vivo marks human myotubes in vitro: Training-induced increase in lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Physical activity has preventive as well as therapeutic benefits for overweight subjects. In this study we aimed to examine effects of in vivo exercise on in vitro metabolic adaptations by studying energy metabolism in cultured myotubes isolated from biopsies taken before and after 12 weeks of extensive endurance and strength training, from healthy sedentary normal weight and overweight men.Healthy sedentary men, aged 40-62 years, with normal weight (body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) were included. Fatty  and glucose metabolism were studied in myotubes using [14C] and [14C]glucose, respectively. Gene and protein expressions, as well as DNA methylation were measured for selected genes.The 12-week training intervention improved endurance, strength and  sensitivity in vivo, and reduced the participants' body weight. Biopsy-derived cultured human myotubes after exercise showed increased total cellular  uptake (30%), oxidation (46%) and lipid accumulation (34%), as well as increased fractional glucose oxidation (14%) compared to cultures established prior to exercise. Most of these exercise-induced increases were significant in the overweight group, whereas the normal weight group showed no change in  or glucose metabolism.12 weeks of combined endurance and strength training promoted increased lipid and glucose metabolism in biopsy-derived cultured human myotubes, showing that training in vivo are able to induce changes in human myotubes that are discernible in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26729277>Differential Acute Impacts of Sleeve Gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery and Matched Caloric Restriction Diet on  Secretion,  Effectiveness and Non-Esterified Fatty  Levels Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery is an increasingly common option for control of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Mechanisms underlying rapid improvement of T2D after different types of bariatric surgery are not clear. Caloric deprivation and altered levels of non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) have been proposed. This study examines how sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) or matched hypocaloric diet (DT) achieves improvements in T2D by characterising components of the glucose metabolism and NEFA levels before and 3 days after each intervention.Plasma samples at five time points during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) from subjects with T2D undergoing GBP (N = 11) or SG (N = 12) were analysed for C-peptide,  and glucose before surgery and 3-day post-intervention or after DT (N = 5). Fasting palmitic, linoleic,  and stearic  were measured. C-peptide measurements were used to model  secretion rate (ISR) using deconvolution.Subjects who underwent GBP surgery experienced the greatest improvement in glycaemia (median reduction in blood glucose (BG) from basal by 29 % [IQR -57, -18]) and the greatest reduction in all NEFA measured. SG achieved improvement in glycaemia with lower ISR and reduction in all but palmitoleic .

The presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; hepatosteatosis) in obesity has been linked to the worsening of the metabolic syndrome, including the development of  and cardiovascular disease. Currently, there are few options to treat NAFLD, including life style changes and  sensitizers. Recent evidence suggests that the cannabinoids Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and cannabidiol (CBD) improve  sensitivity; we aimed at studying their effects on lipid levels.The effects of THCV and CBD on lipid levels were examined in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems, with special emphasis on models of hepatosteatosis. Transcriptional, post-translational and metabolomic changes were assayed.THCV and CBD directly reduce accumulated lipid levels in vitro in a hepatosteatosis model and adipocytes. Nuclear magnetic resonance- (NMR) based metabolomics confirmed these results and further identified specific metabolic changes in THCV and CBD-treated hepatocytes. Treatment also induced post-translational changes in a variety of proteins such as CREB, PRAS40, AMPKa2 and several STATs indicating increased lipid metabolism and, possibly, mitochondrial activity. These results are supported by in vivo data from zebrafish and obese mice indicating that these cannabinoids are able to increase yolk lipid mobilization and inhibit the development of hepatosteatosis respectively.Our results suggest that THCV and CBD might be used as new therapeutic agents for the pharmacological treatment of obesity- and metabolic syndrome-related NAFLD/hepatosteatosis.Copyright © 2015.

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following weight loss. We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, , and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ-linolenic  levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following weight loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the weight-loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild weight loss improves abdominal obesity, overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to obesity-related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating palmitic  and stearic  were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and  (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas  showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each).

The aim of this study was to determine the role of high-fat low-cholesterol diets (HFLCDs) rich in SFAs (HFLCD-SFAs), MUFAs (HFLCD-MUFAs) or MUFAs plus omega-3 long-chain PUFAs (HFLCD-PUFAs) on vascular calcification by the modulation of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the aortic roots of LepLDLR mice. Animals fed with HFLCD-SFAs had increased weight and a greater atheroma plaque size, calcification, and RANKL/CATHK expression in the aortic root than mice on MUFA-enriched diets, with an increasing OPG expression in the aortic roots of the latter. Our study demonstrates that compared to dietary SFAs, MUFAs from olive oil protect against atherosclerosis by interfering with vascular calcification via the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in the setting of MetS.

Autophagy, an evolutionarily-conserved house-keeping process, was implicated in cellular lipid handling by either feeding and/or degrading lipid-droplets (LDs). We hypothesized that beyond phagocytosis of dead adipocytes, AT-FC biogenesis is supported by the AT microenvironment by regulating autophagy. Non-polarized ("M0") RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to AT conditioned media (AT-CM) exhibited a markedly enhanced LDs biogenesis rate compared to control cells (8.3 Vs 0.3 LDs/cells/h, p<0.005). Autophagic flux was decreased by AT-CM, and fluorescently following autophagosomes over time revealed ~20% decline in new autophagic vesicles' formation rate, and 60-70% decrease in autophagosomal growth rate, without marked alternations in the acidic lysosomal compartment. Suppressing autophagy by either targeting autophagosome formation (pharmacologically, with 3-methyladenine or genetically, with Atg12±Atg7-siRNA), decreased the rate of LD formation induced by . Conversely, interfering with late autophago-lysosomal function, either pharmacologically with bafilomycin-A1, chloroquine or leupeptin, enhanced LD formation in macrophages without affecting LD degradation rate. Similarly enhanced LD biogenesis rate was induced by siRNA targeting Lamp-1 or the V-ATPase. Collectively, we propose that secreted products from AT interrupt late autophagosome maturation in macrophages, supporting enhanced LDs biogenesis and AT-FC formation, thereby contributing to AT dysfunction in obesity.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

A Mass Spectrometry And Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - based metabolomics study.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a group of abnormalities that enhances the risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. The Mediterranean diet seems to be an important dietary pattern, which reduces the incidence of MetS. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) - a simple phenol found in olive oil - has received increased attention for its antioxidant activity. Recently, the European Foods Safety Authority (EFSA) claimed that dietary consumption of HT exhibits a protective role against cardiovascular disease. In this study, an experimental protocol has been setup, including isolated HT administration in a diet induced model of MetS in young Wistar rats, in order to find out whether HT has a protective effect against MetS. Rats were randomly divided into two groups nurtured by high-carbohydrate high-fat (H) (MetS inducing diet) and high-carbohydrate high-fat + HT (HHT). HT (20mg/kg/d oral gavage, water vehicle) was administered for 8 weeks on the basal diet. Previous pharmacological evaluation of HT showed that hepatic steatosis was reduced and the inflammatory cells into the liver were infiltrated. These indicate that HT shows bioactivity against metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the metabolomics evaluation of liver extracts would indicate the putative biochemical mechanisms of HT activity. Thus, the extracts of liver tissues were analyzed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography - High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS, Orbitrap Discovery) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Avance III 600MHz). Multivariate analysis was performed in order to gain insight on the metabolic effects of HT administration on the liver metabolome. Normalization employing multiple internal standards and Quality Control-based Robust LOESS (LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) Signal Correction algorithm (QC-RLSC) was added in the processing pipeline to enhance the reliability of metabolomic analysis by reducing unwanted information. Experimentally, HHT rats were clearly distinguished from H in PLS-DA, showing differences in the liver metabolome between the groups and specific biomarkers were determined supporting the pharmacological findings. More specifically, HT has shown to be effective towards the mobilization of lipids as various lipid classes being differentially regulated between the H and HHT groups. Interestingly branched fatty  esters of hydroxy  acids (OAHSA) lipids have been shown to be up regulated to the HHT group, denoting the alleviation of the MetS to the animals administered with HT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The hypothesis that n-3 PUFA, which modulate protein homoeostasis via effects on  sensitivity, could contribute to maintain muscle mass during energy restriction was tested in rats fed a high-fat diet (4 weeks) rich in 18 : 1 n-9 (, OLE-R), 18 : 3 n-3 (α-linolenic , ALA-R) or n-3 long-chain (LC-R) fatty  and then energy restricted (8 weeks). A control group (OLE-ad libitum (AL)) was maintained with AL diet throughout the study. Rats were killed 10 min after an i.v.  injection. All energy-restricted rats lost weight and fat mass, but only the OLE-R group showed a significant muscle loss. The Gastrocnemius muscle was enriched with ALA in the ALA-R group and with LC-PUFA in the ALA-R and LC-R groups. The proteolytic ubiquitin-proteasome system was differentially affected by energy restriction, with MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 mRNA levels being decreased in the LC-R group (-30 and -20 %, respectively). RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase and  receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation levels increased in the LC-R group (+70 %), together with  receptor mRNA (+50 %). The ALA-R group showed the same overall activation pattern as the LC-R group, although to a lesser extent.

Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced obesity and . However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty  composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic  [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic ],  [Cis-9-Octadecenoic ], and linoleic  [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic ]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on adipogenesis, inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited adipogenesis of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of obesity. This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty acids inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. SHAMstat3pg has also shown to have a favorable impact on the expression of the obesity-linked proteins and genes in HADMSC that are associated with adipogenesis, inflammation, satiety, energy intake/expenditure (central and peripheral signaling molecules).

The results showed that overexpression of the wild type SHIP2 gene (SHIP2-WT) led to a higher total lipid content (28%) compared to control, whereas overexpression of the dominant negative SHIP2 gene (SHIP2-DN) reduced total lipid content in oleate treated cells by 40%. Overexpression of SHIP2-WT also led to a significant increase in both secretion of apoB100 containing lipoproteins and de-novo lipogenesis, as demonstrated by an enhancement in secreted apoB100 and MTP expression, increased intra and extracellular triglyceride levels and enhanced expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP1c, FAS and ACC. On the other hand, overexpression of the SHIP2-DN gene prevented oleate-induced de-novo lipogenesis and secretion of apoB100 containing lipoproteins in HepG2 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that SHIP2 expression level is a key determinant of hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion, and its inhibition could be considered as a potential target for treatment of dyslipidemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In a double-blind randomized design, half of the group ingested 500 mL/day of semi-skim milk (8 g of fat; placebo milk) whereas the other half ingested 500 mL/day of skim milk enriched with 275 mg of Ω-3PUFA and 7.5 g of oleate (Ω-3 + OLE).Ω-3 + OLE treatment elevated 30% plasma Ω-3PUFA but not significantly (P = 0.286). Improvements in VO2peak (12.8%), mean blood pressure (-7.1%), waist circumference (-1.8%), body fat mass (-2.9%), and trunk fat mass (-3.3%) were similar between groups. However,  sensitivity (measured by intravenous glucose tolerance test), serum concentration of C-reactive protein, and high-density lipoprotein improved only in the Ω-3 + OLE group by 31.5%, 32.1%, and 10.3%, respectively (all P < 0.05). Fasting serum triacylglycerol, glucose, and plasma fibrinogen concentrations did not improve in either group after 24 weeks of intervention.Diet supplementation with Ω-3PUFA and oleate enhanced cardiometabolic benefits of intense aerobic exercise training in patients with MSyn.© 2016 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29141573>Liver Protective Effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Interaction between Its Chemical Composition and the Cell-signaling Pathways Involved in Protection.</a></h1><p>The liver is an organ susceptible to a multitude of injuries that causes liver damage, like steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), presents several protective effects on the liver, reducing hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, fibrogenesis, preventing lipid peroxidation, among other effects. Due to its high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly  and phenolic compounds, such as hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein, EVOO is able to participate in the activation of different signaling pathways in the hepatocytes involved in the prevention of inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and , allowing the prevention or resolution of liver damage. The aim of this work is to offer an update of the molecular effects of EVOO in the liver and its protective properties to prevent the establishment of liver damage through the regulation of different cell-signaling pathways.Searches that considered the effects of EVOO in in vivo and in vitro models, whith emphasis in the molecular mechanism of liver tissue damage and prevention and/or treatment of steatosis, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ischemia-reperfusion injury.The most relevant molecular effects of EVOO involved in the prevention or resolution of liver damage are: (i) Activation of the nuclear transcription factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nfr2), inducing the cellular antioxidant response; (ii) Inactivation of the nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF- κB), preventing the cellular inflammatory response; and (iii) Inhibition of the PERK pathway, preventing endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and lipogenic response.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28887275>FFA4 (GPR120) as a fatty  sensor involved in appetite control,  sensitivity and inflammation regulation.</a></h1><p>Unsaturated long-chain fatty acids have been suggested to be beneficial in the context of cardiovascular disorders based in epidemiologic studies conducted in Greenland and Mediterranean. DHA and EPA are omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids that are plentiful in fish oil, and  is an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty , rich in olive oil. Dietary intake of these unsaturated long-chain fatty acids have been associated with  sensitivity and weight loss, which contrasts with the impairment of  sensitivity and weight gain associated with high intakes of saturated long-chain fatty acids. The recent discovery that free fatty  receptor 4 (FFA4, also known as GPR120) acts as a sensor for unsaturated long-chain fatty acids started to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial functions played by these unsaturated long-chain fatty acids in various physiological processes, which include the secretions of gastrointestinal peptide hormones and glucose homeostasis. In this review, the physiological roles and therapeutic significance of FFA4 in appetite control,  sensitization, and inflammation reduction are discussed in relation to obesity and type 2 diabetes from pharmacological viewpoints.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the pathogenesis of is still unclear. Hepatic steatosis and  are considered to be central to the pathophysiology of NAFLD. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs and has been reported to be involved in pathogenesis of NAFLD and related metabolic diseases. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which miR-150 regulate hepatic steatosis and  in high fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD model. The expression of miR-150 was up-regulated dramatically in both human NAFLD patients and HFD mice model, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . miR-150 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis and  significantly in NAFLD mice. miR-150 deficiency decreased the expression of genes related to fatty  uptake, synthesis and gluconeogenesis, while increased the expression of genes related to fatty  β-oxidation. Further, we identified that CFLAR is a direct downstream target of miR-150. Overexpression of miR-150 reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of CFLAR in vitro. And overexpression of miR-150 significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of CFLAR 3'-UTR, while the effect of miR-150 was blocked when the binding site of miR-150 within the CFLAR 3'-UTR was mutated. We also found that miR-150 deficiency decreased the expression of p-Jnk1 and p-Ask1, while the effect of miR-150 on steatosis and  signaling was blocked by CFLAR overexpression. In conclusion, our data indicated that miR-150 potentially contributes to the hepatic steatosis and  in NAFLD. miR-150/CFLAR pathway may be a new therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, fasting serum from sixty-four adult individuals classified into four sex-matched groups by their BMI [non-obese versus morbid obese] and the increased risk of developing diabetes [prediabetic  resistant state versus non-prediabetic non- resistant] was analyzed by LC- and FIA-ESI-MS/MS-driven metabolomic approaches. Altered levels of [lyso]glycerophospholipids was the most specific metabolic trait associated to morbid obesity, particularly lysophosphatidylcholines acylated with margaric,  and linoleic acids [lysoPC C17:0: R=-0.56, p=0.0003; lysoPC C18:1: R=-0.61, p=0.0001; lysoPC C18:2 R=-0.64, p<0.0001]. Several amino acids were biomarkers of risk of diabetes onset associated to obesity. For instance, glutamate significantly associated with fasting  [R=0.5, p=0.0019] and HOMA-IR [R=0.46, p=0.0072], while glycine showed negative associations [fasting : R=-0.51, p=0.0017; HOMA-IR: R=-0.49, p=0.0033], and the branched chain amino  valine associated to prediabetes and  in a BMI-independent manner [fasting : R=0.37, p=0.0479; HOMA-IR: R=0.37, p=0.0468].

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and  sensitivity and . Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved  signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Fatty acids in plasma triglycerides (TGs) may help to explain part of this heterogeneity. This study compared TG fatty  profile of adults with and without abdominal obesity and examined the associations of these fatty acids with MetS components.Fifty-four abdominally obese subjects were matched by age and sex with 54 adults without abdominal obesity. People were classified with MetS according to the harmonizing criteria for MetS. Fatty acids in plasma TGs were analyzed by gas chromatography.There were no differences in fatty acids of plasma TGs between people with and without abdominal obesity. However, there were differences between abdominally obese people with and without MetS. The abdominally obese group with MetS had higher palmitic (+2.9%; P = 0.012) and  (+4.0%; P = 0.001) acids and lower linoleic (-6.4%; P = 0.018) and arachidonic (-1.2%; P = 0.004) acids. After adjustment for abdominal obesity, age, and sex, a stepwise regression analysis showed that palmitic  positively contributed to the variance in  (β = +1.08 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index (β = +1.09 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and myristic  positively contributed to the variance in systolic blood pressure (β = +1.09 ± 1.03; P = 0.006). In contrast, linoleic  negatively contributed to the variance in glucose (β = -0.321 ± 0.09; P = 0.001) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β = -1.05 ± 1.01; P = 0.000).There were no differences in the plasma TG fatty  profile between people with and without abdominal obesity. Likewise, fatty acids in plasma TGs associated with many of the MetS variables independently of abdominal obesity.

This study was conducted to examine the therapeutic effect of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a naturally occurring curcuminoid and a metabolite of curcumin, on  (OA)-induced steatosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. HepG2 cells were incubated with OA to induce steatosis, and then treated with various concentrations of THC. The results showed that THC treatment significantly decreased lipid accumulation in OA-treated HepG2 cells, possibly, by inhibiting the expression of the lipogenic proteins, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS), and fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4). Moreover, THC attenuated OA-induced hepatic lipogenesis in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, which was reversed by pretreatment with an AMPK inhibitor. THC promoted lipolysis and upregulated the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation. Glucose uptake and  signaling impaired in HepG2 cells incubated with OA were abated by THC treatment, including phosphorylation of the  receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and downstream signaling pathways, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which are involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis, respectively. Altogether, these results demonstrated the novel therapeutic benefit of THC against hepatic steatosis and, consequently, a potential treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018.

Caspase 8 and Fas-associated protein with death domain-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) is an important target gene in regulating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). At present, the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway related to NASH was unknown. Here the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway and its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism, glucose uptake, oxidative stress and inflammatory response were studied in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells.OA-treated HepG2 cells were employed as a in vitro model of steatosis,  and oxidative stress. The model cells were then treated by silibinin (5, 20, 50, and 100 μM) for 24 h and detected for the related indicators as follows: (1) cellular triglycerides (TG), nitric oxide (NO) and glucose uptake; (2) the mRNA levels of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα); (3) the protein levels of PPARα, SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, CFLAR, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (pAKT), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and 4A (CYP4A).Compared to the control, OA-treatment led to a result as follows: (1) increased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) up-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) decreased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) down-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARα, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2. Compared to OA-treated HepG2 cells, silibinin treatment could improve the indicators as follows: (1) decreased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) down-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) increased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) up-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARα, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2.Silibinin can ameliorate some metabolic alterations and induce some molecular changes by activating the CFLAR-JNK pathway and thereby regulating its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism (PPARα, SREBP-1C and PNPLA3), glucose uptake (PI3K-AKT), oxidative stress (NRF2, CYP2E1, CYP4A) and inflammatory response(NO) in OA-treated HepG2 cells demonstrating its possible use in ameliorating various symptoms of NASH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Proliferative and synthetic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) increase intimal thickness and destabilize atheromatous plaques. This study aimed to investigate whether saturated palmitic  (PA) and monounsaturated  (OA) modulate autophagy activity, cell proliferation, and vascular tissue remodeling in an aortic VSMC cell line. Exposure to PA and OA suppressed growth of VSMCs without apoptotic induction, but enhanced autophagy flux with elevation of Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3I/II. Cotreatment with autophagy inhibitors potentiated the FFA-suppressed VSMC growth and showed differential actions of PA and OA in autophagy flux retardation. Both FFAs upregulated lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) but only OA increased LDL uptake by VSMCs. Mechanistically, FFAs induced hyperphosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK. All pathways, except OA-activated PI3K/Akt cascade, were involved in the LOX-1 upregulation, whereas blockade of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK cascades ameliorated the FFA-induced growth suppression on VSMCs. Moreover, both FFAs exhibited tissue remodeling effect through increasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and their gelatinolytic activities, whereas high-dose OA significantly suppressed collagen type I expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated LOX-1 knockdown significantly attenuated the OA-induced tissue remodeling effects in VSMCs. In conclusion, OA and PA enhance autophagy flux, suppress aortic VSMC proliferation, and exhibit vascular remodeling effect, thereby leading to the loss of VSMCs and interstitial ECM in vascular walls and eventually the instability of atheromatous plaques.

The control group consisted of nine healthy subjects. All subjects underwent an oral standard fat load. Triglycerides; cholesterol; FFA; glucose and  were measured every 2 h with the determination of fatty  composition of FFA.higher serum FFA levels in NAFLD subjects are mainly due to levels of , palmitic and linoleic acids at different times.

An individual's level of FAs is affected by diet, lifestyle, and genetic variation. We aimed to improve the understanding of the mechanisms and pathways involved in regulation of FA tissue levels, by identifying genetic loci associated with inter-individual differences in erythrocyte membrane FA levels. We assessed the levels of 22 FAs in the phospholipid fraction of erythrocyte membranes from 2,626 Greenlanders in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped on the MetaboChip or imputed. We identified six independent association signals. Novel loci were identified on chromosomes 5 and 11 showing strongest association with  (rs76430747 in ACSL6, beta (SE): -0.386% (0.034), p = 1.8x10-28) and docosahexaenoic  (rs6035106 in DTD1, 0.137% (0.025), p = 6.4x10-8), respectively.

The results obtained from a number of experimental studies suggest that targeting different components of the inflammatory machinery may result in the improvement of the metabolic phenotype. Unsaturated fatty acids exert antiinflammatory activity through several distinct mechanisms. Here, we tested the capacity of ω3 and ω9 fatty acids, directly from their food matrix, to exert antiinflammatory activity through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)120 and GPR40 pathways. GPR120 was activated in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues, reverting inflammation and  in obese mice. Part of this action was also mediated by GPR40 on muscle, as a novel mechanism described. Pair-feeding and immunoneutralization experiments reinforced the pivotal role of GPR120 as a mediator in the response to the nutrients. The improvement in  sensitivity in the high-fat substituted diets was associated with a marked reduction in tissue inflammation, decreased macrophage infiltration, and increased IL-10 levels. Furthermore, improved glucose homeostasis was accompanied by the reduced expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and reduced body mass. Thus, our data indicate that GPR120 and GPR40 play a critical role as mediators of the beneficial effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids in the context of obesity-induced .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26561012>Circulating Endocannabinoids and the Polymorphism 385C>A in Fatty  Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) Gene May Identify the Obesity Phenotype Related to Cardiometabolic Risk: A Study Conducted in a Brazilian Population of Complex Interethnic Admixture.</a></h1><p>The dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system is associated with cardiometabolic complications of obesity. Allelic variants in coding genes for this system components may contribute to differences in the susceptibility to obesity and related health hazards. These data have mostly been shown in Caucasian populations and in severely obese individuals. We investigated a multiethnic Brazilian population to study the relationships among the polymorphism 385C>A in an endocannabinoid degrading enzyme gene (FAAH), endocannabinoid levels and markers of cardiometabolic risk. Fasting plasma levels of endocannabinoids and congeners (anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, N-oleoylethanolamide and N-palmitoylethanolamide) were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 200 apparently healthy individuals of both genders with body mass indices from 22.5 ± 1.8 to 35.9 ± 5.5 kg/m2 (mean ± 1 SD) and ages between 18 and 60 years. All were evaluated for anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, metabolic variables, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, and genotyping. The endocannabinoid levels increased as a function of obesity and . The homozygous genotype AA was associated with higher levels of anandamide and lower levels of adiponectin versus wild homozygous CC and heterozygotes combined. The levels of anandamide were independent and positively associated with the genotype AA position 385 of FAAH, C-reactive protein levels and body mass index. Our findings provide evidence for an endocannabinoid-related phenotype that may be identified by the combination of circulating anandamide levels with genotyping of the FAAH 385C>A; this phenotype is not exclusive to mono-ethnoracial populations nor to individuals with severe obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26763130>Fructose and glucose combined with free fatty acids induce metabolic disorders in HepG2 cell: A new model to study the impacts of high-fructose/sucrose and high-fat diets in vitro.</a></h1><p>This work investigated the underlying mechanism of high-fructose/sucrose and high-fat diets, which rapidly induce metabolic syndrome in vivo, via a new cell model.Glucose and/or fructose were used to induce the human hepatoma cell (HepG2) in the presence of palmitic , , or combined fatty acids (CFA) for 24 h. The alterations in lipid and uric  production, glucose metabolism, oxidative status, and related genes and proteins were monitored. The cell model that featured metabolic disorders was established by treatment of 10 mM glucose and 15 mM fructose plus 1 mM CFA. Results showed that palmitic  mainly induced , oxidative stress, and triglyceride (TG) secretion, whereas  mainly contributed to intracellular TG. Fructose was mainly responsible for uric  and cholesterol production. In addition, fructose synergistically elevated the intra- and extracellular TG and extracellular malonaldehyde with glucose and CFA. Regulations of genes and proteins associated with carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenesis partially explained the action of fructose in inducing the metabolic disorders in cell.The combination of glucose, fructose, and CFA could successfully induce metabolic disorders in HepG2 cells, including dyslipidemia, , hyperuricemia, and oxidative stress.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, we recently demonstrated that overfeeding with a traditional diet (mainly consisting of cooked maize) does not induce ERS in goose. As cellular studies show that high glucose and palmitate can trigger ERS in mammalian cells, we hypothesized that supplementing sugar to the traditional diet could induce ERS, thus promoting  and fatty liver. To test the hypothesis, we first treated goose primary hepatocytes with high glucose (25 mM and 50 mM) and palmitate (0.5 mM) supplemented with or without 0.25 mM oleate. Data indicated that, as in mammalian cells, high glucose and palmitate indeed induced ERS in goose primary hepatocytes, and palmitate-induced ERS was suppressed by supplemental 0.25 mM oleate. We then tested the hypothesis with an in vivo study, in which Landes geese overfed with traditional or novel diets (i.e., the traditional diet supplemented with sugar) were compared with control geese (normally fed with cooked maize) for ERS, IR and fatty liver. The differences in glucose tolerance,  tolerance and postprandial blood glucose between the geese overfed with traditional and novel diets suggested that supplementing dietary sugar promoted IR. This promotion was accompanied with an increasing trend of liver weight and abdominal fat weight relative to body weight. Surprisingly, compared to overfeeding with the traditional diet, overfeeding with the novel diet did not induce ERS, even further suppressed ERS in goose fatty liver.

Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired  signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic . Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected liver disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency) liver diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with liver steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major liver diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and  (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific fatty -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, , behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced liver steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with  parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in  signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717220>Effect of Sucrose Ingestion at the End of a Critical Window that Increases Hypertension Susceptibility on Peripheral Mechanisms Regulating Blood Pressure in Rats. Role of Sirtuins 1 and 3.</a></h1><p>Susceptibility to develop hypertension may be established during early stages of life that include the intrauterine period, infancy and childhood. We recently showed that blood pressure increased when rats reached adulthood when sucrose was ingested for a short-term critical window from postnatal day 12 to 28 in the rat, which corresponds to days around weaning. Here, we studied several factors that might participate in the increased susceptibility to hypertension when adulthood is reached by analyzing the changes produced at the end of the sucrose ingestion during this critical period. Body weight of the rats at the end of the sucrose period was decreased even if there was an increased ingestion in Kcal. We found an increase in blood pressure accompanied by a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in the aorta. When  was administered to rats receiving sucrose, glucose in plasma diminished later than in controls and this slight  may reduce nitric oxide synthase action.  that modulates eNOS expression was increased, lipoperoxidation was elevated and total non-enzymatic anti-oxidant capacity was decreased. There was also a decrease in SOD2 expression. We also studied the expression of Sirt1, which regulates eNOS expression and Sirt3, which regulates SOD2 expression as possible epigenetic targets of enzyme expression involved in the long- term programming of hypertension. Sirt3 was decreased but we did not find an alteration in Sirt1 expression. We conclude that these changes may underpin the epigenetic programming of increased susceptibility to develop hypertension in the adults when there was exposure to high sucrose levels near weaning in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653011>Fatty  Profile and Antioxidant Status Fingerprint in Sarcopenic Elderly Patients: Role of Diet and Exercise.</a></h1><p>Plasma fatty acids (FAs) and oxidant status contribute to the etiology of sarcopenia in the elderly concurring to age-related muscle loss and elderly frailty through several mechanisms including changes in FA composition within the sarcolemma, promotion of chronic low-grade inflammation, and . The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolenic . Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic , omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and  concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino  supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly. The results indicate the positive beneficial role of supplementation and physical activity on plasma FA status and the antioxidant system as a co-adjuvant approach in sarcopenic, frail, elderly patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819461>Primary defects in lipolysis and  action in skeletal muscle cells from type 2 diabetic individuals.</a></h1><p>A decrease in skeletal muscle lipolysis and hormone sensitive-lipase (HSL) expression has been linked to  in obesity. The purpose of this study was to identify potential intrinsic defects in lipid turnover and lipolysis in myotubes established from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects. Lipid trafficking and lipolysis were measured by pulse-chase assay with radiolabeled substrates in myotubes from non-obese/non-diabetic (lean), obese/non-diabetic (obese) and obese/diabetic (T2D) subjects. Lipolytic protein content and level of Akt phosphorylation were measured by Western blot. HSL was overexpressed by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Myotubes established from obese and T2D subjects had lower lipolysis (-30-40%) when compared to lean, using  as precursor. Similar observations were also seen for labelled glycerol. Incorporation of  into diacylglycerol (DAG) and free fatty  (FFA) level was lower in T2D myotubes, and acetate incorporation into FFA and complex lipids was also lower in obese and/or T2D subjects. Both protein expression of HSL (but not ATGL) and changes in DAG during lipolysis were markedly lower in cells from obese and T2D when compared to lean subjects. -stimulated glycogen synthesis (-60%) and Akt phosphorylation (-90%) were lower in myotubes from T2D, however, overexpression of HSL in T2D myotubes did not rescue the diabetic phenotype. In conclusion, intrinsic defects in lipolysis and HSL expression co-exist with reduced  action in myotubes from obese T2D subjects. Despite reductions in intramyocellular lipolysis and HSL expression, overexpression of HSL did not rescue defects in  action in skeletal myotubes from obese T2D subjects.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesised that skeletal muscle mitochondria of endurance-trained athletes have increased sensitivity for fatty  (FA)-induced uncoupling, which is driven by the mitochondrial protein adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1).Capacity for FA-induced uncoupling was measured in endurance-trained male athletes (T) and sedentary young men (UT) in an observational study and also in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and C2C12 myotubes following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of ANT1. Thus, fuelled by glutamate/succinate (fibres) or pyruvate (mitochondria and myotubes) and in the presence of oligomycin to block ATP synthesis, increasing levels of oleate (fibres) or palmitate (mitochondria and myotubes) were automatically titrated while respiration was monitored.  sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in humans and via -stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes.Skeletal muscle from the T group displayed increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.011) compared with muscle from the UT group, and this was associated with elevated  sensitivity (p = 0.034). ANT1 expression was increased in T (p = 0.013). Mitochondria from ZDF rats displayed decreased sensitivity for FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008). This difference disappeared in the presence of the adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor carboxyatractyloside. Partial knockdown of ANT1 in C2C12 myotubes decreased sensitivity to the FA-induced uncoupling (p = 0.008) and -stimulated glucose uptake (p = 0.025) compared with controls.Increased sensitivity to FA-induced uncoupling is associated with enhanced  sensitivity and is affected by ANT1 activity in skeletal muscle.

Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from tissues and act locally or systemically to promote  sensitivity and glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'. Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic  (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index and  sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that 12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased fatty  (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26210489>Natural Rumen-Derived trans Fatty Acids Are Associated with Metabolic Markers of Cardiac Health.</a></h1><p>Evidence suggests that industrial trans fatty acids (iTFA) impair lipid profiles while ruminant trans fatty acids (rTFA) may lower  and blood pressure. The objective of this article was to determine if the plasma phospholipid percentage of rTFA is associated with a favorable cardiometabolic profile. We collected fasting blood samples from 200 individuals from Quebec city (QC, Canada) aged from 18 to 55 years old, including 100 obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg m(-2)) and 100 non-obese (BMI < 30 kg m(-2)) men and women. Fatty  levels in plasma phospholipids were determined using gas chromatography. After separating the subjects into two groups, according to the median percentage of rTFA in plasma phospholipids, participants in the group with higher percentages of rTFA (0.86 ± 0.24 %) had higher adiponectin levels (p = 0.01) and a lower blood pressure (systolic, p = 0.005; diastolic, p = 0.04). In contrast, concentrations in plasma phospholipids of elaidic , a major iTFA, are positively correlated with glycemia in non-obese subjects (p = 0.01) and with both triacylglycerol (TAG) (p = 0.0007) and total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.009) in obese subjects. These data suggest that rTFA may have beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risk factors conversely to their counterpart iTFA.

The risk of TFA, however, has not been well clarified in Japan. We investigated the association of serum TFA concentration with serum lipid profile, coronary risk factors, and prevalence of CAD.A total of 902 patients, who were hospitalized at Kobe University Hospital from July 2008 to March 2012 and gave written informed consent, were enrolled in this study. Among them, 463 patients had CAD, and 318 patients had metabolic syndrome (MetS). Serum TFA, elaidic  (trans-9-C18:1) and linolelaidic  (trans-9, 12-C18:2), were measured on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Serum TFA level had a positive correlation with body mass index, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B48, and an inverse correlation with age and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Fasting serum TFA, by age quartile in the young generation with CAD and/or MetS, was higher than that in patients without CAD and/or MetS. On multivariate logistic regression, TFA was identified as a CAD risk after adjustment for classical risk factors.Serum TFA concentration was elevated in young patients with CAD and/or MetS.

Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and  are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty  synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE. Moreover, SNE can be used to develop health-food products for preventing NAFL disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971334>Preventive effect of oleate on palmitate-induced  in skeletal muscle and its mechanism of action.</a></h1><p> in skeletal muscle is a feature associated with exposure to an excess of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate.  has been shown to blunt palmitate-induced  in muscle cells. However, there is no literature available regarding the effect of  on palmitate-induced  in intact muscle. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of  on palmitate-induced  in rat soleus muscle and its underlying mechanisms. For these purposes,  (1 mM) was administered for 12 h in the absence or presence of palmitate (2 mM). At the end of the experiment, plasmalemmal GLUT4, the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2, and the total expression of these signaling proteins were examined. We found that treatment with palmitate for 12 h reduced -stimulated GLUT4 translocation and the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2. However, the administration of  fully restored -stimulated GLUT4 translocation (P < 0.05), as well as AS160 and Akt-2 phosphorylation (P < 0.05) despite the continuous presence of palmitate. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K, only slightly prevented the -induced improvements in -stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and AS160 phosphorylation. However, this treatment completely inhibited the -induced improvement in -stimulated Akt-2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the -induced improvement in  signaling was not affected by compound C, an AMPK specific inhibitor. In conclusion, the results clearly indicate that  administration alleviates palmitate-induced  by promoting GLUT4 translocation in muscle, at least in part, by activating the PI3K pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957185>Effects of daphnetin on lipid metabolism,  and oxidative stress in OA‑treated HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease, and has high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Daphnetin (DAP) possesses notable antioxidative, anti‑inflammatory and anticoagulant activities; DAP is an active ingredient extracted from Daphne Koreana Nakai. To investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of DAP on NAFLD, we treated HepG2 cells with  (OA) and DAP simultaneously and non‑simultaneously. In the simultaneous treatment condition, HepG2 cells were co‑treated with 0.5 mM OA and DAP (5, 20, and 50 µM) for 24 h. In the non‑simultaneous treatment conditions, HepG2 cells were pretreated with 0.5 mM OA for 24 h, and then treated with DAP (5, 20 and 50 µM) for 24 h. Following the aforementioned treatments, the biochemical indexes associated with NAFLD were measured as follows: i) The intracellular contents of triglyceride (TG), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fluorescent glucose 2‑[N‑(7‑nitrobenz‑2‑oxa‑1,3‑diazol‑4‑yl) amino]‑2‑deoxyglucose were analyzed with corresponding detection kits; and ii) the cellular expression levels of glycolipid metabolism‑ and oxidative stress‑related genes, including 5'AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1C (SREBP‑1C), patatin‑like phospholipase domain‑containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor α (PPARα), phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor‑like 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and CYP4A were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results revealed the potential mechanism underlying the effects of DAP on NAFLD in vitro: i) By increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK, DAP inhibited the expression of SREBP‑1C and PNPLA3, and induced that of PPARα. Lipid accumulation within hepatocytes was reduced; ii) by upregulating PI3K expression and pAKT/AKT levels, DAP may alleviate  and promote hepatocellular glucose uptake; and iii) by upregulating the expression of Nrf2, DAP downregulated the expression of CYP2E1 and CYP4A, and the levels of reactive oxygen species in hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586235>[The evaluation of unsaturation of blood lipids using methods of physical chemistry and clinical biochemistry.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, , leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, , leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and  (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced vaccenic  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a fat-free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high-fat diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of obesity, fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of  (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or .Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710138>Disruption of Lipid Uptake in Astroglia Exacerbates Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h1><p>Neuronal circuits in the brain help to control feeding behavior and systemic metabolism in response to afferent nutrient and hormonal signals. Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate energy homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by , whereas it is decreased in response to palmitic  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated body weight gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic .

Impacts of FA treatments on radio-labelled FA fluxes, on cellular content in diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), ceramides, acylcarnitines, on PKCθ, MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38) and NF-ΚB activation, and on -dependent Akt phosphorylation were examined. Low dose of oleate (0.05mM) was sufficient to improve palmitate complete oxidation to CO (+29%, P<0.05) and to alter the cellular acylcarnitine profile. -induced Akt phosphorylation was 48% higher in that condition vs. palmitate alone (p<0.01). Although DAG and ceramide contents were significantly decreased with 0.05mM of oleate vs. palmitate alone (-47 and -28%, respectively, p<0.01), 0.25mM of oleate was required to decrease p38 MAPK and PKCθ phosphorylation, thus further improving the  signaling (+32%, p<0.05). By contrast, increasing oleate concentration from 0.25 to 0.5mM, thus increasing total amount of FA from 0.75 to 1mM, deteriorated the  signaling pathway (-30%, p<0.01). This was observed despite low contents in DAG and ceramides, and enhanced palmitate incorporation into TAG (+27%, p<0.05). This was associated with increased incomplete FA β-oxidation and impairment of acylcarnitine profile. In conclusion, these combined data place mitochondrial β-oxidation at the center of the regulation of muscle  sensitivity, besides p38 MAPK and PKCθ.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This crucial function in oxidative tissues is altered in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is a LD protein whose mechanistic and causal link with lipotoxicity and  has raised controversies. We investigated here the physiological role of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle upon various metabolic challenges. We show that PLIN5 protein is elevated in endurance-trained (ET) subjects and correlates with muscle oxidative capacity and whole-body  sensitivity. When overexpressed in human skeletal muscle cells to recapitulate the ET phenotype, PLIN5 diminishes lipolysis and FA oxidation under basal condition, but paradoxically enhances FA oxidation during forskolin- and contraction- mediated lipolysis. Moreover, PLIN5 partly protects muscle cells against lipid-induced lipotoxicity. In addition, we demonstrate that down-regulation of PLIN5 in skeletal muscle inhibits -mediated glucose uptake under normal chow feeding condition, while paradoxically improving  sensitivity upon high-fat feeding. These data highlight a key role of PLIN5 in LD function, first by finely adjusting LD FA supply to mitochondrial oxidation, and second acting as a protective factor against lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28504296>Supplementation with n-3, n-6, n-9 fatty acids in an  animal model: does it improve VLDL quality?</a></h1><p> (IR), of increased cardiovascular risk, is characterized by the production of altered VLDL with greater atherogenicity. Dietary fatty acids influence the type of circulating VLDL. But, it is not clear how dietary fatty acids impact VLDL characteristics in IR.to evaluate the effects of n-3, n-6 and n-9 fatty  supplementation on preventing atherogenic alterations in VLDL, in a diet-induced IR rat model. Male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were fed: standard diet (control, n = 8) and a sucrose rich diet (30% sucrose in water/12 weeks, SRD; n = 24). Simultaneously, SRD was subdivided into SRD-C (standard diet), and three other groups supplemented (15% w/w) with: fish oil (SRD-n3), sunflower oil (SRD-n6) and high  sunflower oil (SRD-n9). Lipid profile, free fatty acids, glucose, and  were measured. Isolated VLDL (d < 1.006 g ml) was characterized by chemical composition and size (size exclusion-HPLC). In comparison with SRD-C: SRD-n3 showed an improved lipoprotein profile (p < 0.01), with lower levels of  and HOMA-IR (p < 0.05). SRD-n6 showed increased levels of HDL-cholesterol and lower  levels. SRD-n9 did not exhibit differences in lipid and IR profile, and even favored weight gain and visceral fat. Only SRD-n3 prevented the alterations in VLDL-TG% (54.2 ± 4.4% vs. 68.6 ± 8.2, p < 0.05) and showed lower large VLDL-% (22.5[19.7-35.6] vs. 49.1[15.5-82.0], p < 0.05), while SRD-n6 and SRD-n9 did not show effects.In IR, while n-3 PUFA showed expected favorable effects, supplementation with n-6 PUFA and n-9 MUFA did not prevent atherogenic alterations of VLDL. Thus, the recommendations of supplementation with these fatty acids in general diet should be revised.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525535>Microbiota-Dependent Hepatic Lipogenesis Mediated by Stearoyl CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) Promotes Metabolic Syndrome in TLR5-Deficient Mice.</a></h1><p>The gut microbiota plays a key role in host metabolism. Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
