Genotypes of MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism were determined in a sample of 654 Caucasian (Czech) subjects. Case group (n = 410) included patients with psoriasis (plaque psoriasis diagnosed in 285 patients, other subtypes of psoriasis were observed in 125 patients). Control group (n = 244) consisted of healthy subjects without individual history of psoriasis, with similar age and gender characteristics. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction and a subsequent restriction analysis with HinfI. The genotypes of C(677)T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism were determined in a sample of 654 Caucasian (Czech) subjects. We proved a significant difference in genotype distribution (P(g) = .03) and allelic frequency (P(a) = .02) between psoriatic and control subjects (Table 3). The CC (the thermostabile) genotype was significantly more frequent in psoriatic patients compared to controls [OR = 1.55, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 1.12-2., P = .004814, P(corr) = .01]. But, a significant increase of T allele in MTHFR gene was observed in patients with positive family history of diabetes (P(a) = .02) and in those with a frequent tonsillitis/tonsillectomy (P(a) = .04). No difference was observed between patients with and without positive family history of psoriasis (P(a) = .251). But, when psoriatic patients were described for FHDM, FH-, and PH-T simultaneously, The highest incidence of CT + TT genotypes was calculated for psoriasis patients with positive history of psoriasis and diabetes mellitus together with personal history of repeated tonsillitis/tonsillectomy compared to patients without all these three phenotypes (odds ratio = 3.17, 95% CI 1.33-7.56, P(corr) = .04). In conclusion, MTHFR C677T polymorphism is marginally associated with psoriasis. The T allele (thermolabile) appears to be more frequent in psoriasis patients with positive history of psoriasis and diabetes mellitus together with personal history of repeated tonsillitis/tonsillectomy. This could reflect an inborn predisposition in complex regulation in one-carbon moieties transport in psoriatic patients and therefore, MTHFR genotype can be a part of genetic background of psoriasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462227>Prevalence of  in Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Claims-Based Analysis.</a></h2><p>While  () is mainly characterized as an adult disease, it can also develop during childhood.

However, it is unclear whether longterm low dose MTX used in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis is associated with bone loss. We compared the effect of low dose MTX on bone density in prospectively recruited patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and /psoriatic arthritis (/PsA).Thirty RA patients and 30 /PsA patients taking MTX were compared to controls not taking MTX (30 with RA, 27 /PsA). Bone mineral density (BMD) of the radius, lumbar spine, trochanter, and femoral neck was measured using Lunar dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Student t tests were used to detect differences in bone density (using Z scores) of the MTX group versus controls for both the RA and /PsA groups. Analysis of covariance was used to examine for confounders including disease duration, disease activity, age, and sex.BMD of the radius/femoral neck/trochanter did not differ significantly between the MTX treated groups and controls when analyzed by Z scores. The mean difference between the MTX group and controls of the femoral neck was .040 (95% CI -.40, .12) and .060 (95% CI -.30, .) for the RA and /PsA groups, respectively. The absolute BMD of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) was higher in the RA MTX group than in controls. Analysis of covariance did not reveal an effect of study group on bone density.This study suggests that low dose MTX does not have a negative effect on bone density, at either cortical or trabecular sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26605347>The Protective Role of HLA-DRB1(∗)13 in Autoimmune Diseases.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are characterized by a multifactorial aetiology and a complex genetic background, with the MHC region playing a major role. We genotyped for HLA-DRB1 locus 1228 patients with AIDs-213 with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 166 with  or Psoriatic Arthritis ( + PsA), 153 with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), 67 with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), 536 with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and 93 with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and 282 unrelated controls. We confirmed previously established associations of HLA-DRB1(∗) (OR = 2.17) and HLA-DRB1(∗)03 (OR = 1.81) alleles with MS, HLA-DRB1(∗)03 with SLE (OR = 2.49), HLA-DRB1(∗)01 (OR = 1.79) and HLA-DRB1(∗)04 (OR = 2.81) with RA, HLA-DRB1(∗)07 with  + PsA (OR = 1.79), HLA-DRB1(∗)01 (OR = 2.28) and HLA-DRB1(∗)08 (OR = 3.01) with SSc, and HLA-DRB1(∗)03 with MG (OR = 2.98). We further observed a consistent negative association of HLA-DRB1(∗)13 allele with SLE,  + PsA, RA, and SSc (18.3%, 19.3%, 16.3%, and 11.9%, resp., versus 29.8% in controls). HLA-DRB1(∗)13 frequency in the AIDs group was 20.% (OR = .58). Although different alleles were associated with particular AIDs, the same allele, HLA-DRB1(∗)13, was underrepresented in all of the six diseases analysed. This observation suggests that this allele may confer protection for AIDs, particularly for systemic and rheumatic disease. The protective effect of HLA-DRB1(∗)13 could be explained by a more proficient antigen presentation by these molecules, favouring efficient clonal deletion during thymic selection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558114>Effect of Methotrexate in the Treatment of Distal Interphalangeal Joint Extensor Tendon Enthesopathy in Patients with Nail .</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of methotrexate on the development of distal interphalangeal joint extensor tendon enthesopathy in , thirty-two people aged 34 to 57 years with nail  and distal interphalangeal joint extensor tendon enthesopathy (19 patients with  () and 13 with PsA (psoriatic arthritis) were started on methotrexate at  to 25 mg/week and the treatment was continued for 6 months). A total of 319 nails were examined. After six months of treatment, the thicknesses of the nail plate, nail bed and nail matrix were found to decrease in both groups of patients. Methotrexate treatment resulted in a decrease in the joint extensor tendon thickness only in patients with  (.94 ± .05 vs. .96 ± .04,  < .001), where the tendon thickness after treatment correlated with the matrix thickness ( = .337,  = .018) and with the bed thickness ( = .299,  = .039). Methotrexate treatment resulted in a decrease in the extensor tendon thickness only in patients with  but not in PsA. The findings of this study may suggest the effectiveness of systemic treatment of nail  in patients without arthritis and the use of US nail examinations in  and PsA patients in morphological change assessment and response to treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18369459>A genome-wide association study of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis identifies new disease loci.</a></h2><p>A genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic factors involved in susceptibility to psoriasis () and psoriatic arthritis (PSA), inflammatory diseases of the skin and joints in humans. 223  cases (including 91 with PSA) were genotyped with 311,398 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and results were compared with those from 519 Northern European controls. Replications were performed with an independent cohort of 577  cases and 737 controls from the U.S., and 576 PSA patients and 480 controls from the U.K.. Strongest associations were with the class I region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The most highly associated SNP was rs10484554, which lies 34.7 kb upstream from HLA-C (P = 7.8x10(-11), GWA scan; P = 1.8x10(-30), replication; P = 1.8x10(-39), combined; U.K. PSA: P = 6.9x10(-11)). However, rs2395029 encoding the G2V polymorphism within the class I gene HCP5 (combined P = 2.13x10(-26) in U.S. cases) yielded the highest ORs with both  and PSA (4.1 and 3.2 respectively). This variant is associated with low viral set point following HIV infection and its effect is independent of rs10484554. We replicated the previously reported association with interleukin 23 receptor and interleukin 12B (IL12B) polymorphisms in  and PSA cohorts (IL23R: rs11209026, U.S. , P = 1.4x10(-4); U.K. PSA: P = 8.0x10(-4); IL12B:rs6887695, U.S. , P = 5x10(-5) and U.K. PSA, P = 1.3x10(-3)) and detected an independent association in the IL23R region with a SNP 4 kb upstream from IL12RB2 (P = .001). Novel associations replicated in the U.S.  cohort included the region harboring lipoma HMGIC fusion partner (LHFP) and conserved oligomeric golgi complex component 6 (COG6) genes on chromosome 13q13 (combined P = 2x10(-6) for rs7993214; OR = .71), the late cornified envelope gene cluster (LCE) from the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (PSORS4) (combined P = 6.2x10(-5) for rs6701216; OR 1.45) and a region of LD at 15q21 (combined P = 2.9x10(-5) for rs3803369; OR = 1.43). This region is of interest because it harbors ubiquitin-specific protease-8 whose processed pseudogene lies upstream from HLA-C. This region of 15q21 also harbors the gene for SPPL2A (signal peptide peptidase like 2a) which activates tumor necrosis factor alpha by cleavage, triggering the expression of IL12 in human dendritic cells. We also identified a novel PSA (and potentially ) locus on chromosome 4q27. This region harbors the interleukin 2 (IL2) and interleukin 21 (IL21) genes and was recently shown to be associated with four autoimmune diseases (Celiac disease, Type 1 diabetes, Grave's disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14523226>Serum MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels are increased in patients with psoriatic arthritis and their siblings.</a></h2><p>To determine matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue-inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) serum levels in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and to compare this with their siblings and local blood donor controls. PsA is an interesting condition in which to study metalloproteinases because there are variations in the level of destructiveness, including a significant proportion of cases without destructive change. This is unlike rheumatoid arthritis (RA) which is more uniformly destructive and where MMP-1/TIMP-1 levels are known to be elevated.MMP-1 and TIMP-1 serum levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in (a) index cases with PsA (subtype: RA n = 43, distal interphalangeal disease n = 2, oligoarticular n = , spondyloarthropathy n = 9, enthesitis n = 1), (b) siblings with PsA, (c) siblings with  (), (d) unaffected siblings and (e) local controls. Patients with  were divided according to the onset of disease: type I disease, onset before age 40 yr and type II, onset after age 40 yr.MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels were significantly increased in both the index cases and the group including all siblings compared with the controls (P < .0001). There was no statistical difference in MMP-1 or TIMP-1 levels between index cases and their siblings. There was no difference in serum MMP-1 level between the different subtypes (Moll and Wright) of PsA, but there was an increased level of serum TIMP-1 in patients with rheumatoid pattern (P = .05). In the index cases there were increased levels of TIMP-1 in type II onset  (P = .03) but no difference in MMP-1 levels.MMP-1 and TIMP-1 serum levels are elevated in PsA. This is greatest in RA pattern PsA. These levels were also elevated in unaffected siblings suggesting that genetic factors may be important.

The aim of this work was to design topical MTX loaded niosomes for management of  to avoid systemic toxicity. To achieve this goal, MTX niosomes were prepared by thin film hydration technique. A Box-Behnken (BB) design, using Design-Expert(®) software, was employed to statistically optimize formulation variables. Three independent variables were evaluated: MTX concentration in hydration medium (X1), total weight of niosomal components (X2) and surfactant: cholesterol ratio (X3). The encapsulation efficiency percent (Y1: EE%) and particle size (Y2: ) were selected as dependent variables. The optimal formulation (F12) displayed spherical morphology under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optimum particle size of 1375.00 nm and high EE% of 78.66%. In-vivo skin deposition study showed that the highest value of percentage drug deposited (22.45%) and AUC0-10 (1. mg.h/cm(2)) of MTX from niosomes were significantly greater than that of drug solution (13.87% and .49 mg.h/cm(2), respectively).

A study group (SG) comprised 52 patients who were treated with EPCT; a control group (CG) included 41 patients. All the patients received pharmacotherapy generally accepted for these diseases. The SG patients were given additionally EPCT (the patient took 8-methoxypsoralen in a dose of .6 mg/kg 1.5-2 hours before the procedure). Mononuclear cells were isolated from the patients' blood in the intermittent-line mode on a Haemonetics MCS+ cell separator. The cell suspension was irradiated with ultraviolet light A (lambda = 320-400 nm) on a JULIA irradiator at 10- mI/mm for 30 mm and reinfused in the patient. The course of therapy consisted of 4 sessions performed on alternate days.A varying positive effect was obtained in 49 (94%) SG patients; the mean PASI scores fell from 19.7 +/- 3.4 to 6.7 +/- 2.1 (p < .05). The DAS reflecting the activity of PsA reduced on average from 3.35 +/- .7 to 2.16 +/- .5 (p < .05), which corresponded to the change of PsA activity from moderate to weak.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate physician preferences and uses of diagnostic tests for toenail onychomycosis (TO) by surveying dermatologists (D), podiatrists (P) and family practitioners (FP) in the United States. Surveys were mailed to approximately 1000 randomly sampled physicians from each of the three specialities. The questionnaire consisted of  items regarding physician and practice characteristics, number of patients with TO seen and treated, tests used to diagnose TO and reasons for using the tests. Results were analysed using several statistical methods. Response rates were low (D33.7%; P16.6%; FP28.4%). Ds and  (75.2%) and FPs (43.4%) reported feeling 'very confident' at diagnosing onychomycosis. KOH was the preferred diagnostic test for all three specialities. More Ds (75.4%) felt 'very confident' interpreting potassium hydroxide (KOH) exams than  (24.9%) and FPs (18.5%). Use of KOH exams was statistically associated with confidence interpreting exams (P P = .04092; D & FP P < .0001). Some FPs (46.6%) and  (21.6%) did not obtain a confirmatory diagnostic test prior to the treatment of onychomycosis while 63.6% of Ds 'almost always/always' did.

We examined the association between IL13 polymorphisms, smoking, and PsA in two  sample sets genotyped for rs1800925, rs20541, and rs848. We found that the minor alleles (rs1800925*T, rs20541*A, and rs848*A) were significantly associated with protection from PsA versus controls, and that no association with  is seen when the PsA cases are excluded. This effect was strongest with rs1800925*T (odds ratio (OR) .40, P(allelic) .000067).
