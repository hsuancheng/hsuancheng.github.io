The burden of liver fat and associated cardio-metabolic risk factors in healthy children is unknown. In a population-based prospective cohort study among 3,170 10-year old children, we assessed whether both liver fat accumulation across the full range and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors already in childhood. Liver fat fraction was measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was defined as liver fat fraction ≥5.0%. We measured body mass index, blood pressure, and , glucose, lipids and C-reactive protein concentrations. Cardio-metabolic clustering was defined as having three or more risk factors out of high visceral fat mass, high blood pressure, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol or high triglycerides, and high  concentrations. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease prevalences were 1.0%, 9.1% and 25.0% among normal weight, overweight and obese children, respectively. Both higher liver fat within the normal range (<5.0% liver fat) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were associated with higher blood pressure, , total-cholesterol, triglycerides and C-reactive protein concentrations (p-values <0.05). As compared to children with <2.0% liver fat, children with ≥5.0% liver fat had the highest odds of cardio-metabolic clustering (Odds Ratio 24.43 (95% Confidence Interval 12.25, 48.60)). The associations remained similar after adjustment for body mass index and tended to be stronger in overweight and obese children. Conclusions: Higher liver fat is, across the full range and independently of body mass index, associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile already in childhood. Future preventive strategies focused on improving cardio-metabolic outcomes in later life may need to target liver fat development in childhood.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657254>[Musculoskeletal relevance of obesity: a new approach to an old topic].</a></h1><p>Authors discuss the musculoskeletal aspects of obesity by applying a novel approach.

There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and , low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692530>Pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current perspectives on diagnosis and management.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common cause of chronic liver disease in childhood. To date, the "multiple-hit" hypothesis is largely recognized as an explanation of NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. Obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome have been closely linked to NAFLD development. Due to the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions over time. Given its unfavorable cardiometabolic burden (such as cardiovascular and metabolic consequences), it represents a worrying phenomenon needing a more comprehensive and successful management. Laboratory tests and classical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in NAFLD diagnosis, but novel noninvasive alternative methods to diagnose and monitor NAFLD have been investigated. Currently, lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay treatment, although its efficacy is poor because of the lack of compliance. Pediatric research is focusing on multiple alternative treatments targeting the main pathogenic factors such as , dyslipidemia, gut-liver axis and microbiota, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory pathways. Results from these studies are promising but larger validation is needed. Innovative therapeutic approaches might add an important piece in the complex knowledge of pediatric NAFLD. We aimed to summarize recent insights into NAFLD diagnosis and treatment in children, with a focus on possible future perspectives in pediatric research.© 2019 Di Sessa et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, , IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia,  and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688024>Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Diet and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Risk in US Men and Women.</a></h1><p>Adherence to a healthy diet has been associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may have overlapping mechanisms with T2D, such as inflammation and . Thus, we examined the association between a previously developed T2D prevention dietary pattern and HCC risk.We followed 87,943 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 49,665 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study for up to 32 years. The dietary diabetes risk reduction score, which includes dietary glycemic index, cereal fiber, ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats, trans fat, sugar-sweetened beverages, nuts, coffee, and red and processed meats, was obtained using validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios and confidence intervals (95% CIs).During over 1.9 million person-years, a total of 160 incident HCC cases were identified. The dietary diabetes risk reduction score was associated with a lower risk of HCC (top vs bottom quartile; hazard ratio: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34-0.95; Ptrend = 0.03). All the individual food and beverage items were associated with the risk of HCC in the expected direction, although the association was weaker than the overall dietary pattern.Greater adherence to the T2D prevention diet was associated with a lower risk of developing HCC among US men and women.

Clinical studies have shown that increased high-fat diet (HFD) consumption is associated with higher incidence of PCa. Brazilian berries, such as  (Vell.) Berg, present high polyphenol concentration in the peel and exhibit positive effects on metabolic disorders and hepatic lesions. Therefore, the aim of the study herein was to investigate the patented jaboticaba peel extract effects (PJE) on different metabolic parameters and liver histopathology in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model, receiving a either normolipid diet or HFD for 8 weeks. The results showed that PJE reduced  and glucose intolerance, decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, and inflammatory markers such as PPARγ and TNFα, respectively. In conclusion, the PJE treatment promoted protective effects in the metabolism of  and glucose and liver imbalance caused by HFD intake in the PCa model, suggesting that it may be a good protector against metabolic disorders present in overweight and associated with PCa.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese -resistant rats.</a></h1><p> increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using  resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during , while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle  in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle  sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by . Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668310>Glucose and  Responses to an Intravenous Glucose Load in Thoroughbred and Paso Fino Horses.</a></h1><p>Certain breeds of horses may be genetically predisposed to developing  dysregulation, which is a risk factor for development of endocrinopathic laminitis in horses. This study was performed to test the hypotheses that Paso Fino horses exhibit evidence of  dysregulation compared with Thoroughbred horses and that obesity exaggerates the  dysregulation. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed in 14 moderate-weight Thoroughbreds, 12 moderate-weight Paso Finos, and 12 overweight Paso Finos. Moderate Paso Finos had greater baseline serum  concentrations, area under the  concentration curve, peak , -to-glucose ratio, area under the  to glucose curve, and modified glucose-to- ratio compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. The reciprocal inverse square of basal  (RISQI) and glucose-to- ratio were significantly lower in moderate Paso Finos compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had greater baseline  concentrations, area under the  concentration curve, time to peak , baseline plasma glucose concentration, -to-glucose ratio, and area under the  to glucose curve compared with moderate Paso Finos. The RISQI and glucose-to- ratio were significantly lower in overweight Paso Finos compared with moderate Paso Finos. In conclusion, moderate-weight Paso Finos had higher baseline serum  concentrations and an excessive hyperinsulinemic response to an intravenous glucose load when compared with moderate-weight Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had even greater baseline  concentrations and hyperinsulinemic responses to glucose compared with moderate Paso Finos, as well as greater baseline plasma glucose concentrations. Paso Finos exhibit  dysregulation compared with Thoroughbreds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, we aimed to verify the usefulness of the glucose response curve in a large Chinese population.A total of 9059 OGTT (3-h tests) were categorized into either a monophasic or a multiphasic group based on the shape of the glucose response. Homeostasis model assessments of fasting , the Matsuda Index, the insulinogenic index, and the disposition index were assessed by plasma glucose and serum  concentration obtained at fasting or during an OGTT.The shape of the OGTT glucose response curve was monophasic in 87.3% and multiphasic in 12.7% of participants.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway plays a central role in metabolism and energy homeostasis. Here, to investigate the role of AMPK in the protective effect of adiponectin against , we established the model of high-glucose (HG)- and high-lipid (HL)-induced  in INS-1 pancreatic β cells. We found that 25mM of glucose and 0.4mM of palmitic acid treatment significantly increased cell apoptosis and impaired  secretion in INS-1 cells. However, recombinant human adiponectin dramatically reduced HG- and/or HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved  secretion. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment also activated AMPK signalling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the AMPK α subunit; 10μM of compound C, a potent AMPK inhibitor, blocked the protective effects of adiponectin against HG/HL-induced . Furthermore, knockout experiments by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, is involved in the protective effects of adiponectin. Taken together, adiponectin reversed the effects of  via AMPK α1, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin and may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Adiponectin can reverse the effects of  and lower blood glucose levels. Here, adiponectin reduced HG/HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved  secretion. These effects were blocked by AMPK inhibitor, compound C.

Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/2 J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type 2 diabetes and obesity traits. Liver and adipose genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and  responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, , and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly  sensitive, which could result from higher rates of -stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) -stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion,  sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0.2 [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059).

In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes, liver steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes,  and type 2 diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 diabetes, increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When  is induced by diets, a greater activation of  signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis.

The co-existence of CAD,  (IR) and coagulation incongruity are believed to exacerbate the existing condition towards more lethal pathological events.The purpose of current study was to find out a possible association between fibrinogen and IR in CAD patients. The study population consist of 135 participants; 82 angiographically confirmed CAD patients who visited the outpatient department at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah and 53 healthy control individuals. Peripheral blood samples were collected from CAD patients and healthy control individuals. Various biochemical parameters such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), , C-peptide, lipid profile, platelet, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured by the use of different analytical methods. Calculation of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and non-HDL were done by using online tools. Among the studied parameters, majority of the conventional risk factors were found to be significantly increased in CAD patients compared with control individuals. Different coagulation components such as fibrinogen (223.8 vs. 394 mg/dL), D-dimer (0.25 vs. 0.63 mg/L), platelet (222.9 vs. 245.9 K/uL) and PTT (27.6 vs. 29.6 seconds) were also found to be significantly enhanced in CAD patients. Based on the severity of IR [HOMA index up to 3 and ≥ 3], comparison with different parameters such as fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-peptide and  in CAD groups were also made.

N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular metabolic phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome, obesity,  and diabetes) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and development of  and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679020>Metabolic syndrome and related risk factors among adults in the northern West Bank, a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors that includes central obesity, , dyslipidaemia and hypertension. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International Diabetes Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.2%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

We present an evidence map of the efficacy and safety of  and  formulas (GGFs) that use  as an essential herb for diabetes, and also its mechanism of actions. We comprehensively searched the ancient medical records to identify empirical evidence; conducted a systematic review (SR) based on moderate- to high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to synthesize the clinical evidence; and reviewed the possible mechanisms of its antidiabetic effects. Empirical application of  in treating diabetic symptoms dated back to more than 2000 years ago. Common herbs used in RCTs that accompany with  included Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae, Radix et Rhizoma Ginseng, Rhizoma Dioscoreae, Poria, and Radix Ophiopogonis. The combinations used today are consistent with their usage in ancient times. Results of the SR showed that GGFs could benefit patients with type 2 diabetes for blood glucose control. When in combination with hypoglycemic agents or , GGFs enhanced the glucose-lowering effect as well as the lipid-lowering effects. Also, the incidence and the risk of adverse events (AE), especially the hypoglycemic episodes, were lower in the combination group. No serious or life-threatening AE was reported. The experimental evidence presented that  and GGFs might exert and enhance the anti-diabetic effects through activation of multiple mechanisms, such as reducing , increasing  release, inhibiting glucose absorption and reabsorption, and improving  sensitivity, glucose uptake, and metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on  in Athletes.</a></h1><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause , and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle . In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic . In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing . However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce . A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving .

Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with obesity, , and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h1><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, , serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and , and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665140>Impact of macronutrient supplements for children born preterm or small for gestational age on developmental and metabolic outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Nutritional supplements may improve development of infants born small (preterm or small for gestational age [SGA]) but may increase the risk of later metabolic disease. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of macronutrient supplements for infants born small on later development and metabolism.We searched OvidMedline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to April 1, 2019, and controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and anzctr.org.au. Randomised or quasirandomised trials were included if the intention was to increase macronutrient intake to improve growth or development of infants born small and assessed post-discharge outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were cognitive impairment and metabolic risk, evaluated in toddlers (<3 years), childhood (3 to 8 years), and adolescence (9 to 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and data were pooled using random-effect models. Twenty-one randomised and one quasirandomised trial of variable methodological quality involving 3,680 infants were included. In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to 2.65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD 5.60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -2.04; 95% CI -7.04 to 2.95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, , and fasting  concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some metabolic outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696157> and Serum Magnesium Concentrations among Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects ∼1 in 10 women worldwide. Hypomagnesemia may worsen  (IR) due to the role magnesium (Mg) plays in glucose metabolism. This review explores the relation between serum Mg and IR among women with PCOS. A review of primary research focusing on both serum Mg and women with PCOS was conducted from 2011 to 2019. Studies reviewed included human subjects, written in the English language, and limited to community-dwelling women aged ≥18 y. A total of 7 articles were reviewed. The findings from 4 epidemiological analytic studies evaluating serum Mg status suggest there may be a relation between serum Mg concentrations and IR among women with PCOS. However, among the 3 experimental trials, Mg supplementation inconsistently impacted IR among women with PCOS. Women with PCOS are more likely to underconsume Mg-rich foods and have a greater likelihood of lower serum Mg concentrations. Although it remains unclear if dietary Mg and/or supplementation should be a nutritional strategy for all women with PCOS, current research indicates an association between adequate Mg status and improved IR. Further research evaluating dietary interventions and supplementation is warranted.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692443>Common Pathological Mechanisms and Risk Factors for Alzheimer's Disease and Type-2 Diabetes: Focus on Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Diabetes is considered as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, but it is yet un-clear whether this pathological link is reciprocal. Although Alzheimer's disease and diabetes appear as entirely different pathological entities affecting the central nervous system and a peripheral organ (pan-creas), respectively, they share a common pathological core. Recent evidence suggests that in the pancreas in the case of diabetes, as in the brain for Alzheimer's disease, the initial pathological event may be the accumulation of toxic proteins yielding amyloidosis. Moreover, in both pathologies, amyloidosis is likely responsible for local inflammation, which acts as a driving force for cell death and tissue degeneration. These pathological events are all inter-connected and establish a vicious cycle resulting in the progressive character of both pathologies.To address the literature supporting the hypothesis of a common pathological core for both diseases.We will focus on the obvious differences between the disease-related inflammatory changes in a peripheral organ, such as the pancreas, versus those observed in the brain. Recent evidence suggesting an impact of peripheral inflammation on neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease will be presented.We propose that it is now necessary to consider whether neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease affects inflammation in the pancreas related to diabetes.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677342>Fatty acid overload to compromised OXPHOS activates inflammation in type 2 diabetes - hidden beasts and how to find them?</a></h1><p>Epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are considered as consequences of lifestyle changes came with industrialization, overconsumption of calorie-dense fatty foods accompanied by less exercise.

SOD3 expression and release were evaluated in adipocytes differentiated from primary human preadipocytes and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The regulatory role for SOD3 was determined by SOD3 lentivirus knockdown in human adipocytes and global SOD3 KO mice. SOD3 was expressed at high levels in white adipose tissue and adipocytes were the main cells expressing SOD3 in adipose tissue. SOD3 expression was significantly elevated in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. Moreover, SOD3 expression and release were markedly increased in differentiated human adipocytes and adipocytes differentiated from mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells compared to undifferentiated cells. In addition, SOD3 silencing in human adipocytes increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways such as PPARγ and SREBP1c and promoted the accumulation of triglyceride. Finally, global SOD3 KO mice were more obese and  resistant with enlarged adipose tissue and increased triglyceride accumulation.Our data showed that SOD3 is secreted from adipocytes and regulates lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. This important discovery may open up new avenues of research for the cytoprotective role of SOD3 in obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.SOD3 is a protective factor secreted by adipocytes in response to HFD-induced obesity and regulates adipose tissue lipid metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673468>Visceral adiposity indicators as predictors of metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of visceral adiposity indicators on metabolic parameters in postmenopausal women.This cross-sectional study included 200 postmenopausal subjects. Postmenopausal women were divided into two groups based on the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as MetS+ and MetS-. Comparisons of clinical and metabolic characteristics were performed between the groups.The current study included 200 postmenopausal women and 63 subjects were diagnosed as having MetS. Postmenopausal women with MetS demonstrated significantly higher values with respect to systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), triglyceride (TG), lipid ratios, Homeostasis Model Assessment  (HOMA) index, TG glucose (TyG), Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP) when compared with women without MetS. Correlation analyses showed that LAP and VAI were positively correlated with waist circumference, WHR, BMI, TG, lipid ratios, TyG and HOMA index, and with each other.

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676315>Protective role of adiponectin against testicular impairment in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder, leading to reproductive impairments and infertility in male. Our recent study showed crucial role of adiponectin in the regulation of testicular functions, and the circulating level of adiponectin declines in diabetes. The current study thus aimed to examine the efficacy of adiponectin in improving testicular dysfunction in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced T2D mice. T2D was induced in pre-pubertal mice fed with high-fat diet for ∼10 weeks followed by single treatment of streptozotocin. T2D mice showed presence of increased body mass, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , increased oxidative stress, and declined serum testosterone compared to vehicle-treated control mice. The spermatogenic, steroidogenic, metabolic, and antioxidative parameters were evaluated in T2D mice treated with adiponectin for both two and four weeks. The exogenous administration of adiponectin to T2D mice showed enhanced serum testosterone and expression of testicular steroidogenic markers proteins,  receptor and GLUT8 proteins, increase in intra-testicular concentrations of glucose and lactate and activity of LDH and antioxidant enzymes compared to the levels in untreated T2D mice. This suggests that treatment of adiponectin effectively improves testicular functions by increasing expression of  receptor-mediated increased transport of energy substrate (glucose and lactate) and a marked reduction in oxidative stress are the possible mechanism by which adiponectin effectively improves testicular function in T2D mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic syndrome, but there is also a link between the occurrence of /impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type-2 diabetes (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers. Among all types of biologically active peptides inclusive of marine-derived ones, this paper's focus would solely be on fish and fishery by-processes' extracted peptides and products. Isolation and fractionation processes of these products alongside their structural, compositional and digestion stability characteristics have likewise been briefly discussed to better address the structure-activity relationship, expanding the reader's knowledge on research and discovery trend of fish antihypertensive biopeptides. Furthermore, drug-likeness of selected biopeptides was predicted by Lipinski's rules to differentiate a drug-like biopeptide from nondrug-like one.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668088>Evaluation of sucrose-enriched diet consumption in the development of risk factors associated to type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a murine model.</a></h1><p>Overconsumption of sucrose, the main contributor of the total added sugar intake in the world, has been associated with negative metabolic effects related to non-communicable diseases. However, this relationship continues to be a controversial topic and further studies are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sucrose-enriched diet consumption in the development of risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a murine model. Sucrose-enriched diet-fed rats showed a decrease in food, lipids and protein intake as well as in serum total cholesterol levels, an increase in carbohydrates intake, glucose, , triglycerides, VLDL-c and HDL-c levels and a greater degree of , steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) and cardiometabolic risk factors and the clustering of these risk factors (metabolic syndrome) in euthyroid children and adolescents. A total of 250 euthyroid children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were included using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2015. In the unadjusted correlation analyses, TSH was positively correlated with glucose (r = 0.172, P = 0.006), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (r = 0.149, P = 0.018),  (r = 0.144, P = 0.023), homeostatic model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.163, P = 0.010), and triglyceride (TG) (r = 0.155, P = 0.014), whereas FT4 was negatively associated with the waist circumference (WC) standard deviation score (SDS) (r = -0.134, P = 0.035), body mass index (BMI) SDS (r = -0.126, P = 0.046),  (r = -0.219, P < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.211, P < 0.001). In the multiple linear regression analysis, TSH was positively associated with glucose (β = 1.179, P = 0.021), HbA1c (β = 0.044, P = 0.039), and TG (β = 8.158, P = 0.041) after adjustment for possible confounders. FT4 was negatively associated with serum fasting  (β = -5.884, P = 0.017) and HOMA-IR (β = -1.364, P = 0.023) in the multiple linear regression analysis. Boys and girls with elevated glucose levels had a higher adjusted mean TSH level compared to those without elevated glucose levels after controlling for confounding factors in the analysis of covariance (2.16 mIU/L vs 3.88 mIU/L, P = 0.004).

Increased consumption of unhealthy, calorie-dense foods, coupled with sedentary lifestyles, is the main factor contributing to a positive energy balance and the development of obesity. Leptin and  are key hormones implicated in pathogenesis of this disorder and are crucial for controlling whole-body energy homeostasis. Their respective function is mediated by the counterbalance of anorexigenic and orexigenic neurons located within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Dysregulation of leptin and  signaling pathways within this brain region may contribute not only to the development of obesity, but also systemically affect the peripheral organs, thereby manifesting as metabolic diseases. Although the exact mechanisms detailing how these hypothalamic nuclei contribute to disease pathology are still unclear, increasing evidence suggests that altered DNA methylation may be involved. This review evaluates animal studies that have demonstrated diet-induced DNA methylation changes in genes that regulate energy homeostasis within the arcuate nucleus, and elucidates possible mechanisms causing hypothalamic leptin and  leading to the development of obesity and metabolic diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

High-fat diet (HFD)-derived fatty acid is associated with the activation of chronic inflammation in T2DM. PF-04620110, which is currently in phase 1 clinical trials as a selective acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) inhibitor, is a potent anti-diabetic agent that may be important for the regulation of chronic inflammation in T2DM. However, the mechanisms by which PF-04620110 regulates fatty acid-induced chronic inflammation remain unclear.PF-04620110 was used in vitro and in vivo. DGAT1-targeting gRNAs were used for deletion of mouse DGAT1 via CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) system. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was measured by immunoblot or cytokine analysis  and .Here we show that PF-04620110 suppressed fatty acid-induced nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptor (NLR), pyrin-domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in macrophages. In contrast, PF-04620110 did not change the activation of the NLR family, CARD-domain-containing 4 (NLRC4), or the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes. Moreover, PF-04620110 inhibited K⁺ efflux and the NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation, which are required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. PF-04620110 reduced the production of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and blood glucose levels in the plasma of mice fed HFD. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of DGAT1 suppressed fatty acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Our results suggest that PF-04620110 suppresses fatty acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Copyright © 2019 Korean Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676170>Pheromones Modulate Learning by Regulating the Balanced Signals of Two -like Peptides.</a></h1><p>Social environment modulates learning through unknown mechanisms. Here, we report that a pheromone mixture that signals overcrowding inhibits C. elegans from learning to avoid pathogenic bacteria. We find that learning depends on the balanced signaling of two -like peptides (ILPs), INS-16 and INS-4, which act respectively in the pheromone-sensing neuron ADL and the bacteria-sensing neuron AWA. Pheromone exposure inhibits learning by disrupting this balance: it activates ADL and increases expression of ins-16, and this cellular effect reduces AWA activity and AWA-expressed ins-4. The activities of the sensory neurons are required for learning and the expression of the ILPs. Interestingly, pheromones also promote the ingestion of pathogenic bacteria while increasing  to the pathogen. Thus, the balance of the ILP signals integrates social information into the learning process as part of a coordinated adaptive response that allows consumption of harmful food during times of high population density.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, mechanisms of the  training-induced improvements in energy metabolism and  sensitivity have not been fully understood. Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), which is a novel adipokine, has beneficial effects on energy metabolism and  sensitivity. We investigated the effect of a single bout of  exercise on the ZAG concentration. Nine healthy men were enrolled. They performed a single bout of  exercise (bench press and leg press) consisting of 10 repetitions of five sets at 70% of maximum strength with 90-s rests in between sets. Blood samples were obtained before and after acute  exercise to measure the ZAG concentration. The serum ZAG concentration significantly increased following acute  exercise.

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific  sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess  signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic  sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived  secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05).

Cd is a toxic heavy metal, and is widely present in environment. It has been reported that chronic Cd exposure is associated with kidney disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Smoking causes exposure to significantly higher Cd levels in humans. Tobacco smoke transports Cd into the lungs. Blood then transport it to the rest of the body where it increases effects by potentiating Cd that is already present from Cd-rich food. Other high exposures of Cd can occur with people, who live near hazardous waste sites, or factories that release Cd into the air and people who work in the metal refinery industry. Breathing of Cd can severely damage the lungs and may even cause death. Multiple studies have shown an association between environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals including toxic metals and obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. At the same time, the existing data on the impact of Cd exposure on obesity and diabetes are contradictory. On the converse, results of epidemiologic studies linking Cd exposure and Osteoporosis, overweight or obesity are far less consistent and even conflicting, also depending on differences in exposure levels. In turn, laboratory studies demonstrated that Cd adversely affects adipose tissue physiopathology through several mechanisms, thus contributing to increased  and enhancing diabetes. However, intimate biological mechanisms linking Cd exposure with human diseases are still to be adequately investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to explore the impact of Cd exposure and status on the risk of Cd in human diseases.© Association of Clinical Biochemists of India 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689600>Huoxue Qianyang decoction ameliorates cardiac remodeling in obese spontaneously hypertensive rats in association with ATF6-CHOP endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway regulation.</a></h1><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in hypertension related cardiac remodeling. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Huoxue Qianyang (HXQY) decoction on cardiac remodeling in obese spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and explore its impacts on the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) ER stress signaling pathway.Twenty-seven obese SHRs were randomly divided into Obese SHR, Obese SHR + HXQY and Obese SHR + Valsartan groups, and treated with the indicated drugs for 8 weeks. Nine age-matched male SHRs were used as controls. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), body weight (BW), and the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were measured weekly or at end point. Then, angiotensin II (Ang II), fasting glucose (FPG) and fasting  (FIN), total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels were evaluated with commercial kits. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. The expression levels of GRP78, ATF6, PERK/pPERK and CHOP were assessed by quantitative PCR and Western blot.Treatment with HXQY decoction resulted in significantly reduced SBP, BW, LVMI, Ang II, TC and LDL-C levels, as well as the homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) score in obese SHRs. Apoptosis in heart tissues of obese SHRs was significantly attenuated after HXQY decoction administration, paralleling reduced expression of GRP78, ATF6, PERK/pPERK and CHOP at both mRNA and protein levels.Cardiac remodeling in obese SHRs is ameliorated by intervention with HXQY decoction in association with inhibited ATF6-CHOP ER stress signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by  and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing  to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5.2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment- (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal  and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Various studies have indicated that a lack of vitamin D must be regarded as a pathogenic factor for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, since a vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) increases  and reduces  secretion from beta cells in the pancreas. A recent study by Pittas et al. did not show a clear preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation with respect to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In terms of this study, it must be remembered that more than 70% of the participants in both the vitamin D supplement group and the placebo group did not have a vitamin D deficiency. In medical and pharmaceutical practice, more attention should be paid to vitamin D deficiency than has previously been accorded. Vitamin D status can be assessed objectively when necessary by laboratory testing of the serum 25(OH)D levels. Type 2 diabetes patients benefit from improving their vitamin D status with respect to their glucose metabolism and decreased mortality risk. Patients with  who are vitamin D deficient should be treated with an appropriate amount of vitamin D to achieve circulating levels of 25(OH)D of 40-60 ng/mL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682379>Tangnaikang improves  and β-cell apoptosis by ameliorating metabolic inflammation in SHR.Cg-Leprcp/NDmcr rats.</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects of Tangnaikang (TNK), a mixture of five herbal plant extracts, on inflammation-mediated  and B-cell apoptosis in SHR.Cg-Leprcp/NDmcr (SHR-cp) rats.Seven-week-old SHR-cp rats were randomly divided into a control (CON) group and a TNK (3.24 g/kg) group. Wistar-Kyoto rats at the same age were used as the normal control group. After 7 weeks of continuous intragastric administration of TNK, the glucose metabolic status and  sensitivity of the rats were evaluated by assessing fasting serum glucose (FBG), the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting serum  (FINS), and the  sensitivity index (ISI). Serum tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Macrophage infiltration and apoptosis in adipose tissues were detected through F4/80 immunohistochemistry and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Islet morphology and B-cell apoptosis were investigated using double immunofluorescence staining and the TUNEL assay. The expression of cytokine genes in adipose tissue, the liver, and the pancreas was detected in real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. The expression and phosphorylation levels of  signaling-, inflammation-, and B-cell survival-related proteins in the liver and pancreas of SHR-cp rats were detected by western blotting.TNK (3.24 g/kg) treatment significantly decreased body weight, FBG and FINS; improved impaired glucose tolerance; increased the ISI; reduced serum levels of TNF-a, CRP and IL-6; and increased serum adiponectin. The mRNA expression of inflammatory markers was markedly reduced in the liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue. F4/80- and TUNEL-positive cells in adipose tissues were decreased, as was the number of TUNEL-positive B-cells. The phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and that of  receptor substrate-1 at serines 307 and 1101 was significantly decreased.

LRYGB resulted in greater loss of body mass index compared to LSG at 1 year [mean difference -1.25 kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.01 to -0.49, P = 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence] which persisted at 3 years, but there was insufficient evidence at 5 years. Resolution of dyslipidemia was higher for LRYGB than LSG at 1 year (risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73, P < 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence) and 5 years (risk ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.04; low certainty of evidence). There was no difference between LRYGB and LSG for remission of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hemoglobin A1c, fasting , homeostatic model assessment of , high-density lipoprotein, and the rate of 30-day major and minor complications.There are insufficient data from RCTs to draw any conclusions regarding the long-term comparative effectiveness beyond 3 years between LRYGB and LSG.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679693>Identification of isotschimgine as a novel farnesoid X receptor agonist with potency for the treatment of obesity in mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity and its associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have become epidemic medical problems worldwide; however, the current available therapeutic options are limited. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has recently emerged as an attractive target for obesity treatment. Here we demonstrate that isotschimgine (ITG), a constituent in genus Ferula, as a novel FXR agonist with anti-obesity and anti-hepatic steatosis effects. The results showed that ITG activated the FXR transactivity and bound with the ligand binding dormain (LBD) of FXR with gene reporter assays and AlphaScreen assays. In high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, ITG lowered body weight and fat mass, improved  and hepatic steatosis. Mechanistic studies showed that ITG altered the expression levels of FXR downstream genes, lipid synthesis and energy metabolism genes in the liver of mice. Our findings suggest that ITG is a novel FXR agonist and may be a potential therapeutic choice for obesity associated with NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although several case reports exist, a comprehensive statistical analysis investigating growth profile and benefit of recombinant growth hormone (rhGH) treatment is still missing.Here, we compared IGF1RM carriers (n = 23) retrospectively regarding birth parameters, growth response to rhGH therapy, near final height and glucose/ homeostasis to treated children born small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 34). Additionally, health profiles of adult IGF1RM carriers were surveyed by a questionnaire.IGF1RM carriers were significantly smaller at rhGH initiation and had a diminished first-year response compared to SGA children (Δ height SDS: 0.29 vs. 0.65), resulting in a lower growth response under therapy. Interestingly, the number of poor therapy responders was three times higher for IGF1RM carriers than for SGA patients (53 % vs. 17 %). However, most IGF1RM good responders showed catch-up growth to the levels of SGA patients. Moreover, we observed no differences in HOMA-IR before treatment, but during treatment  was significantly increased in IGF1RM carriers compared to SGA children. Analyses in adult mutation carriers indicated no increased occurrence of comorbidities later in life compared to SGA controls.In summary, IGF1RM carriers showed a more pronounced growth retardation and lower response to rhGH therapy compared to non-mutation carriers, with high individual variability. Therefore, a critical reevaluation of success should be performed periodically. In adulthood, we could not observe a significant influence of IGF1RM on metabolism and health of carriers.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

The most feasible explanation for this association is the hypothesis of catch up. Some studies postulate a greater influence of catch up growth than the low birth weight itself in developing metabolic and cardiovascular disease.This is a prospective cohort study of newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (defined as weight percentile at birth less than 10th) born during a one-year period. Clinical data of patients were recorded (gender, gestational age, data about breastfeeding and anthropometry during follow-up every 3 months). Some details of pregnancy and characteristics of the mother were also registered. Serum biochemical parameters (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, , glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA) were collected at birth from cord blood, 9 and 12 months. Two main comparative groups were established: those GRF who made a catch-up growth (increase in weight Z score higher than 0,67) during the follow-up and those who did not get it.126 GRF children were born in the study period. 125 accepted the inclusion in the study and 67 of them completed the full monitoring for a year; 47 of them made recovery growth and 20 did not. A significant difference between both groups was found in glucose in umbilical cord and triglycerides at 12 months: GRF children with catch up growth showed lower glucose levels (p = 0.03) and higher levels of triglycerides (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in the rest of laboratory parameters analyzed (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, , glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, HOMA at 9 and 12 months or triglycerides at 9 months).Those GRF with catch up growth during the first year of life have early changes in the triglycerides at the end of that period with higher levels than those GRF children without catch up growth. This finding could be useful to develop a tool for early detection of GRF children with higher metabolic risk in order to prevent future pathology.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Comparative cross-sectional and longitudinal aspects.</a></h1><p> Fasting  indexes are used extensively nowadays. We intended to analyze a new recently presented fasting index, SPISE (sensitivity formula: 600 × HDL-cholesterol/triglycerides/BMI), in comparison with three previously known fasting indexes, regarding correlation with the  clamp index, and for the predictive effects of future long-term risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) or manifest type 2 diabetes. A total of 1049 71-year-old male subjects from the Swedish ULSAM study, median follow-up 8 years, were included. All subjects performed the euglycemic  clamp, and analyses of four fasting  indexes: SPISE-IR (= 10/SPISE), QUICKI-IR, Log HOMA-IR, and Revised QUICKI-IR. Spearman correlation coefficients with the  clamp were 0.60-0.62 for all indexes. Area under curve at ROC analysis was 0.80 for SPISE-IR, and 0.84 for QUICKI-IR, Log HOMA-IR, and Rev QUICKI-IR. Adjusted hazard ratios per 1 SD index increase for long-term risk CHD were similar in all patients: 1.20-1.24 ( = 0.02-0.03). However, comparing the highest quartile (recommended to define ) with the lower quartiles, SPISE-IR was the strongest and the only statistically significant  index: HR 1.53 ( = 0.02). Adjusted odds ratios per 1 SD index increase for long-term risk of type 2 diabetes were fairly similar ( < 0.001) in all patients: 1.62 for SPISE-IR, 1.97 for QUICKI-IR and Log HOMA-IR, and 2.04 for Rev QUICKI-IR, and also when comparing the highest versus the lower quartiles: 2.8-3.1 ( < 0.001).

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on -related metabolism in the central nervous system, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on  sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum  concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the -dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated  receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated  receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing  in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we have identified three novel mutations in the IRS1 gene of type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, which reflected in the amino acid changes as I65S, R66S, and G86R in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of the IRS1 protein. The impact of these mutations on the structure and function of the IRS1 protein was evaluated through molecular modeling studies, and distinct conformational fluctuations were recorded. The variable binding affinities and positional displacement of these mutant models were observed in the ligand-binding cleft of IR. The mutant IRS1 models triggered conformational changes in the L1 domain of IR upon their binding. Such structural variations in IRS1 and IR structures due to mutations resulted in variable molecular interactions that could lead to altered  transduction, followed by  and T2D.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664610>Design, synthesis, molecular docking and in vitro evaluation of benzothiazole derivatives as 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors.</a></h1><p>11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates cortisol levels mainly in adipose, hepatic and brain tissues. There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, , metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue.

The latter favors a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system, which contribute to  and type 2 diabetes. Physical exercise is a powerful preventive tool and treatment for several diseases as it induces metabolic and immune effects that provide health benefits. Exercise is known to reduce inflammation; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible are not fully elucidated. One proposed mechanism is a reduced expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) on innate immune cells after exercise, which could contribute to the protective effect of exercise against  and the prevention of the development of metabolic diseases. The aim of the present study is therefore to review the current evidence about the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise and toll-like receptors regulation on immune cells in humans. Key PointsObesity leads to a low-grade chronic inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system that is directly involved in the develop metabolic syndrome.The anti-inflammatory effect of exercise has been previously suggested through the reduction of the expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) in innate immune cells, which represent one of the main inflammatory responses triggered by obesityThe underlying mechanisms in which toll-like receptors expression modulate the reduction of chronic inflammation are not fully elucidated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672462>iNOS as a metabolic enzyme under stress conditions.</a></h1><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical acting as a cellular signaling molecule in many different biochemical processes.

Crown-like structures (CLS) are histologic hallmarks of the proinflammatory process in adipose tissue. CLS are microscopic foci of dying adipocytes surrounded by macrophages mostly derived from monocytes in blood. Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is expressed in microglia, macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS), where it evokes an anti-inflammatory response. The present study investigates the function of ERβ in macrophages within CLS. We report that even though monocytes in the blood have no detectable levels of ERβ, macrophages in CLS do express ERβ. In ERβ-/- mice, there was a significant increase in the number of CLS in both subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). CLS in these mice were dominated by pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1 macrophages) with higher expression of osteopontin (OPN) and an increase in number of proliferating macrophages. In mice made obese by Western diet, treatment with an ERβ selective agonist (LY3201) reduced the number of CLS in both SAT and VAT with downregulation of OPN, activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), proliferation and upregulation prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), the enzyme which prevents activation of HIF1α, in macrophages. We conclude that ERβ expression is induced in macrophages in CLS within adipose tissue where it plays a pivotal role in suppression of CLS.

Enzyme inhibitory activity of JTP-96193 on TACE and other ADAMs was measured in in vitro. High fat-induced obese mice and type 2 diabetic KK-A mice were used to evaluate the effect of JTP-96193 on . Finally, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were treated with JTP-96193 to evaluate the sciatic motor nerve conduction velocities (MNCV). JTP-96193 selectively inhibited human TACE activity with IC value of 5.4 nM and showed more than 1800-fold selectivity against other matrix metalloproteinases. In mouse models of obesity and diabetes, JTP-96193 reduced the TNF-α release from the fat tissue and prevented development of diabetes and improved , respectively. Furthermore, JTP-96193 prevented delay of sciatic MNCV without any effects on blood glucose or  levels in STZ-induced diabetic mice. TACE inhibitor is effective on  and DPN independent from glucose-lowering effect.

Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a critical lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of two monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), oleate and palmitoleate, from the saturated fatty acids, stearate and palmitate, respectively. SCD1-deficient mouse models are protected against diet-induced adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. However, the mechanism of this protection by SCD1 deficiency is unclear. Using a liver-specific SCD1 knockout (LKO) mouse model fed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (HCD), we show that hepatic SCD1 deficiency increases systemic glucose uptake. Hepatic SCD1 deficiency enhanced glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) expression in the liver and also up-regulated GLUT4 and adiponectin expression in the adipose tissue. The enhanced glucose uptake correlated with increased liver expression and elevated plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hepatokine known to increase systemic  sensitivity and to regulate whole-body lipid metabolism. Feeding LKO mice with triolein-supplemented, but not tristearin-supplemented, HCD reduced FGF21 expression and plasma levels. Consistently, SCD1 inhibition in primary hepatocytes induced FGF21 expression, which was repressed by treatment with oleate but not palmitoleate. Moreover, deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PPARg coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) reduced hepatic and plasma FGF21 and white adipocyte tissue-specific GLUT4 expression and raised plasma glucose levels in the LKO mice. These results suggest that hepatic oleate regulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue either directly or partially by modulating the hepatic PGC-1α-FGF21 axis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687367>The Triglyceride and Glucose Index Is a Predictor of Incident Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Population-Based Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>The triglyceride and glucose index (TyG), defined as the product of triglycerides (TG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), is reported as a surrogate index for . Although a cross-sectional study revealed the association between the TyG-index and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), few studies have investigated the association between the TyG-index and incident NAFLD. Here we investigated whether the TyG-index can be used to predict incident NAFLD.This historical cohort study included 16,093 apparently healthy Japanese individuals. The TyG-index was calculated by the established formula: TyG = Ln [TG (mg/dl) ×  FPG (mg/dl)/2]. Fatty liver was diagnosed based on the subjects' abdominal ultrasonography results. We divided the subjects into tertiles according to the levels of TyG-index. Hazard ratios (HRs) of the TyG-index for incident NAFLD were calculated by a Cox proportional hazards regression model.During the observation period, 27.4% of the men and 11.0% of the women developed NAFLD. The highest TyG-index tertile (men, 8.48 ≤ TyG and women, 7.97 ≤ TyG) (adjusted HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.44-1.94,  < 0.001 in the men and 2.06, 1.59-2.70,  < 0.001 in the women) and the middle TyG-index tertile (men, 8.00 < TyG ≤ 8.48 and women, 7.53 <TyG ≤7.97) (1.33, 1.15-1.54,  < 0.001 in the men and 1.52, 1.16-2.01,  < 0.001 in the women) presented a significantly higher risk of incident NAFLD compared to the lowest TyG-index tertile (men, TyG < 8.00 and women, TyG < 7.53).Our findings demonstrate that the TyG-index is significantly associated with incident NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Aya Kitae et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690633>TFEB drives PGC-1α expression in adipocytes to protect against diet-induced metabolic dysfunction.</a></h1><p>TFEB is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that confers protection against metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis by targeting a network of genes involved in autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis and lipid catabolism. In this study, we sought to characterize the role of TFEB in adipocyte and adipose tissue physiology and evaluate the therapeutic potential of adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression in obesity. We demonstrated that mice with adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression (Adipo-TFEB) were protected from diet-induced obesity, , and metabolic sequelae. Adipo-TFEB mice were lean primarily through increased metabolic rate, suggesting a role for adipose tissue browning and enhanced nonshivering thermogenesis in fat. Transcriptional characterization revealed that TFEB targeted genes involved in adipose tissue browning rather than those involved in autophagy. One such gene encoded PGC-1α, an established target of TFEB that promotes adipocyte browning. To dissect the role of PGC-1α in mediating the downstream effects of TFEB overexpression, we generated mice with adipocyte-specific PGC-1α deficiency and TFEB overexpression. Without PGC-1α, the ability of TFEB overexpression to brown adipose tissue and to elicit beneficial metabolic effects was blunted. Overall, these data implicate TFEB as a PGC-1α-dependent regulator of adipocyte browning and suggest its therapeutic potential in treating metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

It has been previously observed that lactate production is also an important metabolic feature of adipocytes, but its relationship to adipose and whole-body glucose disposal remains unclear. Therefore, using a combination of metabolic labeling techniques, here we closely examined lactate production of cultured and primary mammalian adipocytes.  treatment increased glucose uptake and conversion to lactate, with the latter responding more to  than did other metabolic fates of glucose. However, lactate production did not just serve as a mechanism to dispose of excess glucose, since we also observed that lactate production in adipocytes did not solely depend on glucose availability and even occurred independently of glucose metabolism. This suggests that lactate production is prioritized in adipocytes. Furthermore, knocking down lactate dehydrogenase specifically in the fat body of Drosophila flies lowered circulating lactate and improved whole-body glucose disposal. These results emphasize lactate production is an additional metabolic role of adipose tissue beyond lipid storage and release.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664995>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of SPRY2 in human hepatocytes leads to increased glucose uptake and lipid droplet accumulation.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is dramatically increasing throughout the world; however, the underlying aetiology is incompletely understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to  production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and .CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686535>Association of serum omentin-1, apelin and chemerin concentrations with the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.</a></h1><p>Omentin-1 is a novel adipokine with anti-inflammatory functions.

In this post hoc analysis, we assessed the efficacy of EQW+Dapa vs. each drug alone in reducing biomarkers of fatty liver/steatosis and fibrosis.We evaluated the impact of the study treatments on non-invasive markers of hepatic steatosis (fatty liver index [FLI] and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] liver fat score [NLFS]), fibrosis (fibrosis-4 index [FIB-4]) and severe fibrosis (NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS]), along with liver enzymes and , at weeks 28 and 52. All outcomes in this analysis were exploratory, with nominal p-values reported.At week 28, biomarkers of fatty liver/steatosis and fibrosis were reduced from baseline in all treatment groups. At week 28, EQW+Dapa effects for decrease in FLI were stronger than those of EQW+Plb (-2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.11, -0.73; p=0.0092) or Dapa+Plb (-2.77 [95% CI -4.93, -0.62]; p=0.0119), and stronger than those of EQW+Plb at week 52 (-3.23 [95% CI -5.79, -0.68]; p=0.0134). FIB-4 showed reduction vs. baseline in the EQW+Dapa group only at both week 28 (-0.06 [95% CI -0.11, -0.01]; p=0.0135) and week 52 (-0.05 [95% CI -0.09, -0.004]; p=0.0308).The EQW+Dapa combination showed stronger effects than EQW+Plb or Dapa+Plb in ameliorating markers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug, functions mainly by improving patients' hyperglycemia and . However, its mechanism of action is still not well understood. We show here that pharmacological metformin concentration increases mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and ATP levels in hepatocytes and a clinically relevant metformin dose increases liver mitochondrial density and complex 1 activity along with improved hyperglycemia in high-fat- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Metformin, functioning through 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), promotes mitochondrial fission to improve mitochondrial respiration and restore the mitochondrial life cycle. Furthermore, HFD-fed-mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα1/2 subunits exhibit higher blood glucose levels when treated with metformin. Our results demonstrate that activation of AMPK by metformin improves mitochondrial respiration and hyperglycemia in obesity. We also found that supra-pharmacological metformin concentrations reduce adenine nucleotides, resulting in the halt of mitochondrial respiration. These findings suggest a mechanism for metformin's anti-tumor effects.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Clear definition and diagnosis of these two types of diabetes has been increasing more and more difficult, leading to the inclusion of a new category, namely double or hybrid diabetes (DD) that demonstrates symptoms of both T1D and T2D via the accelerator hypothesis. In this review, we discuss the worldwide prevalence of DD, its main physiological characteristics, including beta-cell autoimmunity, , and cardiovascular disease, the main risk factors of developing DD, mainly genetics, obesity and lifestyle choices, as well as potential treatments, such as  titration, metformin and behavioural modifications.

Acylated ghrelin (AG) and desacylated ghrelin (DAG) are the two main forms of ghrelin, which have opposing roles in energy homeostasis. The AG/DAG ratio has been proposed to be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the general population. This study compared the relationships between MetS and ghrelin parameters in patients with schizophrenia.Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and under olanzapine monotherapy were recruited. Fasting blood samples were collected for the analyses of metabolic and ghrelin parameters. The serum levels of total ghrelin and AG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. DAG level was calculated by subtracting the AG level from the total ghrelin level.We recruited 151 subjects with schizophrenia, and classified them into those with MetS ( = 41) and those without MetS ( = 110). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher AG/DAG ratio, as well as lower total ghrelin and DAG levels. There were no sex differences in ghrelin parameters. The AG/DAG ratio was significantly and positively correlated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference,  level, homeostasis model assessment of  and number of MetS components. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the number of MetS components remained significantly associated with the AG/DAG ratio.Our results revealed that lower AG/DAG ratios were associated with better metabolic profiles in olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. These observations suggest that the balance between AG and DAG plays a crucial role in the metabolic homeostasis among patients with schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676981>Circulating palmitoleic acid is an independent determinant of  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals: a longitudinal analysis.</a></h1><p>Experimental studies suggest that the fatty acid palmitoleate may act as an adipocyte-derived lipid hormone (or 'lipokine') to regulate systemic metabolism. We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between  Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance,  secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body  sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose  sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver  index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body  sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver  (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in  sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and  sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677889>, but not  response, during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to worse histological outcome in obese NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Obese subjects are at high risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes (T2D) due to  (IR). Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43.2 ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x /22.5), OGTT glucose and  profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle  sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x  [AUC]) during OGTT,  response as ( [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased  concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting , HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of  response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

We recommend early surveillance in a growth clinic for children born SGA without catch-up growth. Obesity, , and the risk of metabolic syndrome increase with catch-up growth, but short stature and cognitive dysfunction increase without catch-up growth in children born SGA. A solution to this catch-up dilemma is breast feeding for a minimum of 6 to 12 mo. Because the overall prevalence of metabolic risk factors is very low, routine evaluation of metabolic parameters is not recommended for all children born SGA, but it may be useful to consider metabolic evaluations in overweight or obese children born SGA. Since children born SGA have many risk factors, long-term management from neonate to adulthood is very important.2019©The Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661025>Association between cognitive impairment patient with solid cancer and .</a></h1><p>In an aging population, an increase in the number of elderly cancer patients with cognitive impairment is expected.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing  sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and  signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to  signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world. Sterculic acid has been proposed as a potential tool for the treatment of MS since it inhibits the activity of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a central enzyme in lipid metabolism. We analyzed the effect of sterculic oil (SO) co-administration with 30% fructose in drinking water on the development of MS in male Wistar rats.

The hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp is considered the gold standard for assessing peripheral and hepatic  sensitivity, yet it is a costly and labour-intensive procedure. Therefore, easy-to-measure, cost-effective approaches to determine  sensitivity are needed to enable organ-specific interventions. Recently, evidence emerged that plasma cathepsin D (CTSD) is associated with  sensitivity and hepatic inflammation. Here, we aimed to investigate whether plasma CTSD is associated with hepatic and/or peripheral  sensitivity in humans.As part of two large clinical trials (one designed to investigate the effects of antibiotics, and the other to investigate polyphenol supplementation, on  sensitivity), 94 overweight and obese adults (BMI 25-35 kg/m) previously underwent a two-step hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (using [6,6-H]glucose) to assess hepatic and peripheral  sensitivity (per cent suppression of endogenous glucose output during the low--infusion step, and the rate of glucose disappearance during high- infusion [40 mU/(m × min)], respectively). In this secondary analysis, plasma CTSD levels, CTSD activity and plasma inflammatory cytokines were measured.Plasma CTSD levels were positively associated with the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-α (IL-8: standardised β = 0.495, p < 0.001; TNF-α: standardised β = 0.264, p = 0.012). Plasma CTSD activity was negatively associated with hepatic  sensitivity (standardised β = -0.206, p = 0.043), independent of age, sex, BMI and waist circumference, but it was not associated with peripheral  sensitivity. However, plasma IL-8 and TNF-α were not significantly correlated with hepatic  sensitivity.We demonstrate that plasma CTSD activity, but not systemic inflammation, is inversely related to hepatic  sensitivity, suggesting that plasma CTSD activity may be used as a non-invasive marker for hepatic  sensitivity in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672515>The potential efficacy of dietary fatty acids and fructose induced inflammation and oxidative stress on the  signaling and fat accumulation in mice.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to clarify whether oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are related to impaired  signaling and fat accumulation induced by the dietary fatty acids and fructose. C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or saturated fatty acid (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment- (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1),  receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty acid- and fructose-induced impaired  signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

However, in the last few years a new entity has emerged, the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individual. This category encompasses obese individuals without the presence of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. Several studies have thus been undertaken to determine the risk of these MHO individuals for diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases compared with the 'unhealthy' obese.

We examined the miRNA signature in  receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR-NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro. InsR+/- HSCs displayed 36 differentially expressed miRNAs ( < 0.05 vs. wt), whose expression was then analyzed in the liver of InsR+/- mice fed an MCD diet. We found that miR-101-3p negatively associated with both InsR+/- genotype and MCD ( < 0.05) and the histological spectrum of liver damage ( < 0.01). miR-101-3p was reduced in InsR+/- hepatocytes and HSCs and even more in InsR+/- cells exposed to  (0.33 µM) and fatty acids (0.25 mM), resembling the IR-NASH model. Conversely,  induced miR-101-3p expression in wt cells but not in InsR+/- ones ( < 0.05). In conclusion, IR combined with diet-induced liver injury favors miR-101-3p downregulation, which may promote progressive NAFLD through HSC and hepatocyte transdifferentiation and proliferation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683329>Several Circulating Biomarkers for PCOS Diagnosis.</a></h1><p>Irisin, Betatrophin and Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG) have been shown to be associated with  (IR) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), respectively.

Circulating Irisin, Betatrophin and ZAG concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between these serum biomarkers and PCOS was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of these biomarkers for PCOS women.In women with PCOS, serum Irisin and Betatrophin levels were markedly elevated compared to those in healthy controls (p<0.01), while ZAG levels were lower (p<0.01). PCOS women with IR (M-value<6.28) had lower circulating ZAG concentrations, and higher circulating Irisin and Betatrophin levels relative to PCOS women without IR (M-value ≥ 6.28). ROC curve analyses showed that the AUC for Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin for predicting PCOS were 0.77, 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. In a joint ROC curves analysis of these serum markers and other parameters, the results showed that the AUC was 0.93, and the sensitivity and specificity were 82.1 % and 92.3 %, respectively.When compared to using single cytokine, the analysis of Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin elevates the accuracy in diagnosing PCOS.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689374>PRADC1: a novel metabolic-responsive secretory protein that modulates physical activity and adiposity.</a></h1><p>Interorgan communication mediated by secreted proteins plays a pivotal role in metabolic homeostasis, yet the function of many circulating secretory proteins remains unknown. Here, we describe the function of protease-associated domain-containing 1 (PRADC1), an enigmatic secretory protein widely expressed in humans and mice. In metabolically active tissues (liver, muscle, fat, heart, and kidney), we showed that  expression is significantly suppressed by refeeding and reduced in kidney and brown fat in the context of obesity. PRADC1 is dispensable for whole-body metabolism when mice are fed a low-fat diet. However, in obesity induced by high-fat feeding, PRADC1-deficient female mice have reduced weight gain and adiposity despite similar caloric intake. Decreased fat mass is attributed, in part, to increased metabolic rate, physical activity, and energy expenditure in these animals. Reduced adiposity in PRADC1-deficient mice, however, does not improve systemic glucose and lipid metabolism,  sensitivity, liver steatosis, or adipose inflammation. Thus, in PRADC1-deficient animals, decreased fat mass and enhanced physical activity are insufficient to confer a healthy metabolic phenotype in the context of an obesogenic diet.

Experimental studies showed that leptin might affect serum uric acid, by modulation of the uric acid excretion. However, there are few observational data on the relationship between leptin and uric acid in the general population. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between leptin and uric acid and its excretion in a large middle-aged male general population.A sample of 930 adult male individuals (mean age: 52 years) without therapy for high uric acid was included in the analysis (the Olivetti Heart Study).Uric acid was significantly and positively associated with blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference, , C-reactive protein and leptin (p < 0.01), while inversely with renal function (p = 0.01). The multivariate analysis confirmed the association between leptin and uric acid after adjustment for potential confounders (p < 0.01). After division for adiposity, this trend was confirmed separately for normal weight and excess body weight participants. Moreover, leptin was inversely associated with excretion of uric acid (p < 0.01), also in multivariate analysis (p = 0.03).The results of this study indicate a positive association between circulating leptin levels and uric acid, independently of potential confounders, both in normal and excess body weight men.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism. Metabolic parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally  injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the  Syndrome) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced  compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Acromegaly is a rare disorder caused by overproduction of growth hormone (GH) and is associated with functional and structural differentiation of adipose and muscle tissues. Acromegalic subjects are also at risk of vascular diseases and metabolic dysfunctions. We aimed to determine the altered levels of irisin in subjects with active acromegaly and controlled acromegaly and in controls, and to ascertain whether there is an association between irisin and hormonal and cardiometabolic parameters.We enrolled 40 subjects with active acromegaly, 30 subjects with controlled acromegaly, and 40 control subjects of matched age, gender, BMI, and occurrence of hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome distribution in the present cross-sectional study. Hormonal and metabolic parameters, carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), and epicardial fat thickness (EFT) of the subjects were evaluated. Irisin levels were measured using ELISA.Circulating levels of irisin were significantly higher in acromegalic subjects compared to both controlled acromegalic subjects and controls. Moreover, irisin levels were elevated in controlled acromegalic subjects compared to controls. Irisin displayed a positive correlation with , cIMT, EFT, BMI, GH, and -like growth factor (IGF-1) in acromegalic subjects. Irisin levels were independently associated with cIMT and EFT according to multiple regression analyses. There was an independent relationship between irisin and IGF-1.Elevated irisin levels in acromegalic subjects were associated with cIMT and EFT, suggesting that irisin is a surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk in acromegalic subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678575>Serum alkaline phosphatase level is positively associated with metabolic syndrome: A nationwide population-based study.</a></h1><p>Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a useful marker of hepatobiliary or bone disorder, has recently emerged as a biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation and cardiometabolic disease. This study aimed to examine the association of serum ALP level with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in apparently healthy adults.A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationship between serum ALP level and MetS in 7,101 men and 8,873 women aged 19 to 75 years using data from the 2008 to 2011 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MetS were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses across serum ALP quartiles (Q1: ≤190 U/L; Q2: 191-224 U/L; Q3: 225-263 U/L; and Q4: ≥264 U/L for men and Q1: ≤163 U/L; Q2: 164-201 U/L; Q3: 202-251 U/L; and Q4: ≥252 U/L for women).The mean values of most cardiometabolic variables, HOMA-IR, and leukocyte count gradually increased with serum ALP quartile. The prevalence of MetS significantly increased in accordance with serum ALP quartile. In comparison with those of individuals in the lowest quartile, the OR (95% CI) for MetS in the highest quartile was 1.32 (1.05-1.64) in men and 1.99 (1.42-3.81) in women after adjusting for age, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, regular exercise, household income, education level, occupation, AST, ALT, and GGT levels.Serum ALP level was positively and independently associated with MetS in men and women.Copyright © 2019.

Glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2) and sodium-coupled glucose cotransporters 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubules play a critical role in the reabsorption of glucose and have been linked to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our study was designed to investigate the role of GLUT2 and SGLT2 in the pathogenesis of GDM, which is considered a forerunner of T2DM, and investigate the related molecular mechanism.High-fat diet (HFD) was utilized to build a GDM mouse model that closely induces metabolic abnormalities similar to human GDM. Body weight, blood glucose and serum  were recorded in the experimental process. Glucose tolerance was determined by the use of an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). In addition, levels of GLUT2 and SGLT2 were evaluated to further explore the underlying mechanism of GDM.HFD feeding induced abnormal glucose metabolism as manifested by increased levels of blood glucose and  and prominent glucose intolerance. Additionally, fetal mice from mother feed on HFD showed higher mean body weight. Furthermore, HFD feeding led to an increase in the number of positive cells of GLUT2 and SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule and the expressions of renal GLUT2 and SGLT2 mRNA and proteins in mice. However, no obvious change was observed in renal morphology.Our study demonstrates a potential involvement of renal GLUT2 and SGLT2 in GDM pathology in an HFD-induced GDM mouse model, which further supports the role of renal GLUT2 and SGLT2 not only in T1DM and T2DM but also in GDM.© 2019 Jiang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664435>Sex Differences in Cardiometabolic Traits and Determinants of Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.</a></h1><p>Sex differences in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have been established, but insights into the mechanistic drivers of these differences are limited.To examine sex differences in cardiometabolic profiles and exercise hemodynamic profiles among individuals with HFpEF.This cross-sectional study was conducted at a single-center tertiary care referral hospital from December 2006 to June 2017 and included 295 participants who met hemodynamic criteria for HFpEF based on invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing results. We examined sex differences in distinct components of oxygen transport and utilization during exercise using linear and logistic regression models. The data were analyzed from June 2018 to May 2019.Resting and exercise gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.Of 295 participants, 121 (41.0%) were men (mean [SD] age, 64 [12] years) and 174 (59.0%) were women (mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with men, women with HFpEF in this tertiary referral cohort had fewer comorbidities, including diabetes, , and hypertension, and a more favorable adipokine profile. Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak oxygen [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -2.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction. These sex differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to exercise may illuminate the pathophysiology underlying the development of HFpEF and should be investigated further.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691133>Impact of a Formulation Containing Unusual Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, Trace Elements, Polyphenols and Plant Sterols on  and Associated Disturbances.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the effect of a lipid-based formulation containing unusual polyunsaturated fatty acids, trace elements, polyphenols and plant sterols on  and its associated disturbances among adults at risk of diabetes.This was an 8-week, three-arm, open-label randomized clinical trial. We studied individuals aged ≥ 18 years old with diabetes risk given by a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m or a FinnRisc score ≥ 13/20. Participants were randomly assigned to receive: 7 ml sunflower oil (control group), 3.5 ml of the study formulation + 3.5 ml of sunflower oil (low-dose group) or 7 ml of study formulation (high-dose group).We randomized 25 individuals. After one withdrawal in the high-dose group, the study sample comprised nine patients in the control, nine in the low-dose and six in the high-dose groups. The  sensitivity increased significantly and in a dose-dependent fashion, up to 10% in the high-dose group. At week 8 the low-dose group exhibited lower glycemic excursions during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), especially 1 h after the glucose challenge (32 mg/dl or 23% lower vs. control group). The incremental area under the glucose curve in the OGTT was 17.1% lower in the low-dose group vs. the control group. Waist circumference increased in the control group, remained constant in the low-dose group and decreased in the high-dose group. C-reactive protein decreased in both formulation groups, up to 50% in the high-dose group. Participants in the formulation groups exhibited increased secretion of GLP-1 and plasma irisin at week 8 vs. the control group.The formulation induced favorable changes in  sensitivity, glucose tolerance, abdominal obesity and inflammation.

It has been noted that nearly 50% of all patients undergo the systemic treatment module; however, most of them exhibit drug . In addition, targeted gene therapy has also been used in treatment but has been found to be effective only in patients with a specified molecular profile (or else this might lead to an increased risk of developing resistant mutations). This has led to increasing interest among researchers in finding innovative treatment options. Metformin, a biguanide, has been widely used in treating diabetes. The drug has been reportedly used in cases of hypothesis-generating retrospective population studies of diabetic patients showing reduced incidence of cancer. Metformin helps in reduction of excess  levels that possess various effects on cell signaling and metabolism. Nonetheless, there is need for an in-depth study on its molecular mechanism to fill any existing research gaps.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678183>A 28.6-kD small heat shock protein (MnHSP28.6) protects Macrobrachium nipponense against heavy metal toxicity and oxidative stress by virtue of its anti-aggregation activity.</a></h1><p>Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are ATP-independent chaperones and involved into various physiological and stress processes. In the present study, a 28.6-kD sHSP coding gene, MnHSP28.6, was cloned and characterized from the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense. Tissue distribution analysis via qPCR and western blot revealed that MnHSP28.6 predominantly expressed in muscle. The temporal transcription of MnHSP28.6 in muscle after bacterial challenge, heavy metal exposure and doxorubicin (DOX) injection was investigated by qPCR. The results showed that the expression of MnHSP28.6 were strongly enhanced by both Cd and Cu exposure, as well as DOX injection, but not by bacterial infection. Aggregation assays showed that recombinant MnHSP28.6 could effectively prevent temperature-induced aggregation of citrate synthase, and reduction-induced aggregation of  in vitro. MnHSP28.6 also could protect muscle extracts from heat-induced protein denaturation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) inactivation. Expressing MnHSP28.6 in E. coli conferred host cell impressive protection against HO compared to control. These results suggest a protective role of MnHSP28.6 in maintaining protein homeostasis, preventing aggregation, promoting  to heavy metal and keeping redox balance.Copyright © 2019.

It is important to combat the negative effects on age-associated hormonal decline, BP, and body composition by incorporating appropriate lifestyle interventions, such as exercise. We sought to examine the effects of a 12-week  band exercise training program on aging-related hormones including estradiol, growth hormone (GH), -like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), BP, and body composition in postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension.Postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension (n = 20) were recruited and randomly assigned to a 12-week  band exercise training group (EX, n = 10) or control group (CON, n = 10). The EX group performed a total-body  band exercise training program. Levels of estradiol, GH, IGF-1, DHEA-S, as well as BP and body composition were assessed before and after 12 weeks.There were significant group by time interactions (P < 0.05) for estradiol, GH, IGF-1, DHEA-S, and lean body mass, which significantly increased (P < 0.05), and systolic BP, total body mass, body mass index, and body fat percentage, which significantly decreased (P < 0.05) after EX compared to no changes in CON. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in diastolic BP after 12 weeks.These results indicate that 12 weeks of  band exercise may be an effective, easily accessible, and cost-efficient intervention for improving age-associated hormonal decline, high BP, and poor body composition in postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A494.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696503>Resveratrol ameliorates high-fat diet-induced  and fatty acid oxidation via ATM-AMPK axis in skeletal muscle.</a></h1><p>Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin that exhibits diverse pharmacological actions, including its effect on the . However, the mechanism through which RSV improves  is not fully understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism through which RSV ameliorates  in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model, as well as palmitic acid (PA) treated L6 cells, with a specific focus on the response of RSV on fatty acid oxidation.Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet-fed mice (ND), the high-fat diet-fed mice (HFD), HFD supplemented with RSV (100 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day orally; n = 10). Fasting plasma glucose, , total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid levels were determined. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was used to measure blood glucose and area under the curve. The quantitative  sensitivity index was calculated to assess . Skeletal muscles were collected for histology study and protein expression measurement. L6 cells were cultured with PA and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, and the intracellular TG levels were tested. RSV, chloroquine, palmitoyltransferase and Ku-55933 were administered to differentiate L6 cells.The HFD fed mice showed increased BW, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The expressions of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV protein were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscles of HFD fed mice and PA-treated L6 cells. All these effects induced by HFD and PA were reversed by RSV treatment.ATM is a key factor to improve HFD-induced lipid metabolism and  in skeletal muscles. The effects of RSV on ameliorating HFD-induced abnormal lipid metabolism and  mediated through ATM-AMPK pathway may due to its improvement in fatty acid oxidation efficiency and sequential reduction in ROS production in skeletal muscle. These results provide important theoretical evidence for the application of RSV in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus and related metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677716>Dietary habits contribute to define the risk of type 2 diabetes in humans.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a frequent disorder largely preventable. The aim of this review was to summarize information on the association between dietary habits and the risk of developing T2D.We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database from its inception to June, 2019. Articles were restricted to those written in English and concerning human subjects. Relevant manuscripts found in the list of references of the retrieved articles were also used in preparation for the review.Animal protein consumption increases the risk of T2D independently of body mass index. Intake of both unprocessed meat and processed meat is strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing T2D. In contrast, consumption of high-quality vegetable foods prevents the disease. High-quality plant foods include whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Among less healthy plant-based foods are fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, sweets, and desserts. Carbohydrate-restricted diets that encourage consumption of animal products promote T2D. Low intake of animal products is linked to high educational level so that well-informed individuals tend to consume diets with elevated content of vegetable food. According to the American Dietetic Association, "appropriately planned vegetarian diets including vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases".restricting animal products while increasing healthy plant-based foods intake facilitates T2D prevention. To neutralize worldwide the burden of T2D and its devastating complications, animal products consumption should be limited or discontinued.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of MSDC-0602K in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis (F1-F3) were randomized to daily oral placebo, or 1 of 3 MSDC-0602K doses in a 52-week double-blind study. The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatic histological improvement of ≥2 points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) with a ≥1-point reduction in either ballooning or lobular inflammation and no increase in fibrosis stage at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included NAS improvement without worsening fibrosis, NASH resolution, and fibrosis reduction. Exploratory endpoints included changes in  sensitivity, liver injury and liver fibrosis markers.Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94), or 62.5 mg (n = 99), 125 mg (n = 98), or 250 mg (n = 101) of MSDC-0602K.

Since there are sex differences in the development of obesity and susceptibility to obesity-related disorders, we sought to determine the role of estrogens in regulating the circadian mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity. When fed high-fat diet, C57BL/6J male mice gain weight while females are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Here we demonstrate that estradiol regulates circadian rhythms in females to confer  to diet-induced obesity. We found that ovariectomized females with undetectable circulating estrogens became obese and had disrupted daily rhythms of eating behavior and locomotor activity when fed high-fat diet. The phase of the liver molecular circadian rhythm was also altered by high-fat diet feeding in ovariectomized mice. Estradiol replacement in ovariectomized females fed high-fat diet rescued these behavioral and tissue rhythms. Additionally, restoring the daily rhythm of eating behavior in ovariectomized females with time-restricted feeding inhibited diet-induced obesity and . Together, these data suggest that the circadian system is a target for treating obesity and its comorbidities in women after menopause, when circulating levels of estrogens are too low to protect their circadian rhythms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663775>Exposure to Bisphenol A and Bisphenol S and Incident Type 2 Diabetes: A Case-Cohort Study in the French Cohort D.E.S.I.R.</a></h1><p>The question of whether exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes is still unresolved. Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and diabetes is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type 2 diabetes.We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes.We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without diabetes at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the  Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident diabetes were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively.

However, there is great variability in the literature regarding the time of exposure, composition of the H diets offered to the genitors and/or offspring and parameters evaluated. Here, we investigated the effect of H diet subjected to the genitors on different cardio-metabolic parameters on first (F1) and second (F2) generation offspring. Female Fischer (F) rats, during mating, gestation and breastfeeding, were subjected to the H diet (G0HF) or control (G0CF) diets. Part of F1 offspring, becoming G1 genitors for generating of the F2 offspring. After weaning, F1 and F2 rats only consumed C diet. Nutritional, biometric, biochemical and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated. G0HF genitors had a reduction in food intake, but energy intake was similar to the control group. F1H and F2H offspring presented increased plasma leptin,  and fasting glucose levels, dietary intake, energy intake, adiposity index, mean arterial pressure (MAP), sympathetic drive evidenced by the hexamethonium and  (IR) compared to control. Our data showed that maternal H diet only during mating, gestation and breastfeeding induced cardio-metabolic disorders characteristic of human metabolic syndrome (MetS) that were transferred to F1 and F2 offspring, both females and males, even they fed control diet after weaning. This process probably occurs due to disturbance in mechanisms related to leptin that increases energy intake in F1H and F2H offspring. The present data reinforce the importance of balanced diet during the pregnancy and breastfeeding in health of the F1 and F2 offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690602>Study to Weigh the Effect of Exercise Training on BONE quality and strength (SWEET BONE) in type 2 diabetes: study protocol for a randomised clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased fracture risk despite normal-to-increased bone mineral density, suggesting reduced bone quality. Exercise may be effective in reducing fracture risk by ameliorating muscle dysfunction and reducing risk of fall, though it is unclear whether it can improve bone quality.The 'Study to Weigh the Effect of Exercise Training on BONE quality and strength (SWEET BONE) in T2D' is an open-label, assessor-blinded, randomised clinical trial comparing an exercise training programme of 2-year duration, specifically designed for improving bone quality and strength, with standard care in T2D individuals. Two hundred T2D patients aged 65-75 years will be randomised 1:1 to supervised exercise training or standard care, stratified by gender, age ≤ or >70 years and non- or  treatment. The intervention consists of two weekly supervised sessions, each starting with 5 min of warm-up, followed by 20 min of aerobic training, 30 min of  training and 20 min of core stability, balance and flexibility training. Participants will wear weighted vests during aerobic and  training. The primary endpoint is baseline to end-of-study change in trabecular bone score, a parameter of bone quality consistently shown to be reduced in T2D. Secondary endpoints include changes in other potential measures of bone quality, as assessed by quantitative ultrasound and peripheral quantitative CT; bone mass; markers of bone turnover; muscle strength, mass and power; balance and gait. Falls and asymptomatic and symptomatic fractures will be evaluated over 7 years, including a 5-year post-trial follow-up. The superiority of the intervention will be assessed by comparing between-groups baseline to end-of-study changes.This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study results will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication.; Pre-results.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate liver diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatic  model in vitro. in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in -resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic  via preserving  signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and -mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of  (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and  signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and , which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in , dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a metabolic clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a metabolic clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the metabolic team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the metabolic clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Recently, several researchers have reported that combined aerobic and  exercise prevents hypoglycemia during and after exercise. Furthermore, exercise has been shown to have beneficial effects on the psychological status of patients with various diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined aerobic and  exercise in adolescents with T1DM. Methods Thirty-five type 1 diabetic patients were enrolled, and subjects were divided into either an exercise group or a control group. Thirty patients (20 patients in the exercise group, 10 patients in the control group) completed the study. The exercise program was performed for 1 h at a time, once a week, for 12 weeks. Study parameters were evaluated at baseline and 3 months after baseline evaluation. Results Combined aerobic and  exercise better controlled the body mass index (BMI), and also improved maximum muscular strength and maximum exercise intensity. On psychological tests, subjects' attention and quality of life showed improving tendency, while their stress and behavioral problems diminished. The number of exercise events increased in the training group, while the daily total  dose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level showed no significant changes. Conclusions A 12-week structured exercise program consisting of aerobic and  exercises improves cardiovascular, neurocognitive and psychobehavioral functions, and positively helps lifestyle modification in patients with T1DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice via activating  signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate  secretion and  sensitivity. As  is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body  sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced  sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body  sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic  sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661991>Pyrroloquinoline quinone protected autophagy-dependent apoptosis induced by mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in INS-1 cells.</a></h1><p>Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is the main metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in organisms and is commonly used as a plasticizer. Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to  and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671770>Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Dysregulation of Glucose Metabolism: Beyond Weight Gain.</a></h1><p>Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia because of their high clinical efficacy. However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in -sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on  signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and  secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668590>Sex difference in the association between surrogate markers of  and arterial stiffness.</a></h1><p>To investigate the predictive capability of  surrogate markers for  and arterial stiffness based on sex.We assessed the association of triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP) with homeostasis model assessment- (HOMA-IR) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in both sexes.A total of 1720 men and 1098 women were evaluated.

Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces , and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.Copyright © 2019 Per G.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced  is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving  sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum  (FINS) and  index, in parallel with improved glucose and  tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced  through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

Sucrose laurate (SL) (D1216), a food grade surfactant, was assessed in Caco-2 monolayers, isolated rat intestinal tissue mucosae, and rat intestinal instillations. Accordingly, 1 mM SL increased the apparent permeability coefficient () of [C]-mannitol and reduced transepithelial electrical  (TEER) across monolayers. It altered expression of the tight junction protein, ZO-1, increased plasma membrane potential, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in Caco-2 cells. The concentrations that increased flux were of the same order as those that induced cytotoxicity. In rat colonic tissue mucosae, the same patterns emerged in respect to the concentration-dependent increases in paracellular marker fluxes and TEER reductions with 5 mM being the key concentration. While the histology revealed some perturbation, ion transport capacity was retained. In rat jejunal and colonic instillations, 50 and 100 mM SL co-administered with  induced blood glucose reductions and achieved relative bioavailability values of 2.4% and 8.9%, respectively, on a par with the gold standard PE, sodium caprate (C). The histology of the intestinal loops revealed little damage. In conclusion, SL is a candidate PE with high potential for emulsion-based systems. The primary action is plasma membrane perturbation, leading to tight junction openings and a predominant paracellular flux.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668383>Metformin prevents the pathological browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Browning, the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to a beige phenotype, has gained interest as a strategy to induce weight loss and improve  in metabolic disorders. However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Recent studies have shown several unexpected pleiotropic effects of mannose including increased regulatory T cells (Tregs), prevention of auto-immune disease and ability to reduce growth of human cancer cells. We have previously shown in large cohorts that elevated serum mannose levels are associated with future development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. However, potential direct effects of mannose on  sensitivity in vivo or in vitro are unknown. We here show that administration of mannose (0.1 g/kg BW twice daily) for one week in man did not elicit negative effects on meal-modified glucose tolerance, markers of inflammation or  levels. Tregs number and  signaling in human liver cells were unchanged. These data suggest that mannose is a marker, and not a mediator, of . To verify this, we examined serum mannose levels during long-term euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps in non-diabetic and T2D individuals.

According to reactivity hypothesis, sympathetic response to stressors may be more sensitive at predicting IR than baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), a baseline measure of baroreflex functioning. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of negative affect coupled with minute-to-minute HR and heart-rate variability (HRV) monitoring, we examined whether negative affect (NA)-related autonomic arousal mediates the association of BRS with IR. At baseline, BRS was measured, and fasting serum glucose and  levels were collected from 178 young adults (18-39 years old), from which homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell functioning (HOMA %B) were derived. Participants subsequently underwent one day of Holter HR and HRV monitoring while reporting negative affect levels  EMA. Multilevel modeling was used to assess the associations of momentary negative affect with HR and low- (LF) and high-frequency (HF) HRV during the 5-minute intervals following each EMA reading. Structural equation modeling was then used to determine whether individual differences in these associations mediated the association of BRS with IR, measured by HOMA-IR, HOMA %B, and  levels. As predicted, BRS was negatively associated with the IR ( = -.17,  = .024). However, NA-related autonomic arousal mediated their association, accounting for 56% of the covariance between BRS and IR.

These factors, at the cellular level, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased glucose uptake. Such events are poorly explored in the context of the salivary glands. In this study, we present a series of eight cases of a distinct salivary gland lesion characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts, and we provide new pathologic insights regarding its pathogenesis.Seven patients (87.5%) had a confirmed T2D, and obesity was identified in five (62.5%) patients. Clinically, the patients demonstrated bilateral parotid gland swelling with recurrent episodes of pain and enlargements. Imaging exams revealed multiple cystic lesions in both parotid glands. Microscopically, the parotid glands showed multiple cysts of different sizes, lined by oncocytic epithelial cells. Intraluminally, high-eosinophilic glass-like crystalloid materials were observed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed and the most notable finding was GLUT1 overexpression in the oncocytic cysts (not observed in any other oncocytic lesion of patients without T2D). In addition, higher expressions of mitochondrial antigen, fission 1 protein, and mitofusin-2 were observed in the oncocytic epithelium of the cysts. Furthermore, most of the oncocytic cysts demonstrated a pattern of cytokeratin expression consistent with striated ducts.Thus, these results strongly suggest that T2D is associated with alterations in GLUT1 expression in the cells of striated ducts with mitochondrial dysfunction, causing a hyperplastic process characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts. For this lesion, the designation of "diabetes associated-bilateral multiple oncocytic cysts of the parotid gland" is proposed.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670492>Correlations of glycolipid metabolism abnormality and  with the onset of prostate cancer and its postoperative recurrence.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685792>Effect of dapagliflozin on obstructive sleep apnea in patients with type 2 diabetes: a preliminary study.</a></h1><p>The aim of this case-control study was to assess the efficacy of dapagliflozin combined with metformin for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).A total of 36 patients with newly-diagnosed T2DM and OSAHS were randomized divided into two groups.

Moreover, blood glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and BMI significantly decreased in these two groups, and the decrease was more significant in the dapagliflozin group.These present results indicate that dapagliflozin can significantly reduce glucose, BMI, blood pressure and AHI, and improve hypoxemia during sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness, which thereby has potential as an effective treatment approach for OSAHS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685037>Whole Grain Consumption and Its Effects on Hepatic Steatosis and Liver Enzymes in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a considerable challenge to public health across the globe. Whole grain is highly recommended as an inseparable part of a healthy diet and has been proposed as an effective way to manage NAFLD. The objective in this study was to evaluate the effects of whole grain consumption on hepatic steatosis and liver enzymes as primary outcomes in patients with NAFLD. Over the 12 weeks of this open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial, 112 patients [mean age: 43± 8.7 y; body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 32.2 ± 4.3] were randomly assigned to two groups to receive dietary advice; either to obtain at least half of their cereal servings each day from whole-grain foods or from usual cereals. By the end of the study, the grades of NAFLD showed a significant decrease in the intervention group (P < 0.001). In addition, a significant reduction in serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (P < 0.001), γ-glutamyltransferase (P = 0.009), systolic blood pressure (P = 0.004) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.008) were observed in the intervention group compared to the control group. After adjusting, however, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of lipid profile, glycemic status, and anthropometric measurements. Overall, our study demonstrated that consumption of whole grains for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis and liver enzymes concentrations in patients with NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684843>Effect of nutrition on neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic review.</a></h1><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive functional loss of neurons in the brain, causing cognitive impairment and motoneuron disability. Although multifactorial interactions are evident, nutrition plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and evolution of these diseases. A systematic literature search was performed, and the prevalence of studies evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet), nutritional support, EPA and DHA, and vitamins on memory and cognition impairment. The data showed that malnutrition and low body mass index (BMI) is correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality. MeDiet, nutritional support, and calorie-controlled diets play a protective effect against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) while malnutrition and  represent significant risk factors. Malnutrition activates also the gut-microbiota-brain axis dysfunction that exacerbate neurogenerative process.

Here we suggest an unexpected role of  Grx in oxidative tolerance and intracellular infection. The recombinant Grx was able to efficiently catalyze the thiol-disulfide oxidoreduction of  in the presence of DTT as an election donor. Unexpectedly, the deletion of  resulted in a remarkably increased tolerance and survival ability of this bacteria when exposed to various oxidizing agents, including diamide, and copper and cadmium ions. Furthermore, loss of  significantly promoted bacterial invasion and proliferation in human epithelial Caco-2 cells and murine macrophages, as well as a notably increasing invasion but not cell-to-cell spread in the murine fibroblasts L929 cells. More importantly,  lacking the glutaredoxin exhibited more efficient proliferation and recovery in the spleens and livers of the infected mice, and hence became more virulent by upregulating the virulence factors, InlA and InlB. In summary, we here for the first time demonstrated that  glutaredoxin plays a counterintuitive role in bacterial oxidative  and intracellular infection, which is the first report to provide valuable evidence for the role of glutaredoxins in bacterial infection, and more importantly suggests a favorable model to illustrate the functional diversity of bacterial Grx systems during environmental adaption and host infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670281>Effects of cannabinoid modulation on hypothalamic nesfatin-1 and .</a></h1><p>Both nesfatin-1 and cannabinoid systems involved in the regulation of sleep, metabolism, and food intake.

Testosterone supplementation has been shown to have a positive co-relation with improved glycemic control in T2DM males. Clinical studies have reported that Androgen Replacement Therapy (ART) to hypogonadic males with T2DM resulted in improved glycemic control and metabolic parameters, but, these studies did not address in detail how testosterone acted on the key glucose homeostatic organs.In this study, we delineate the effect of testosterone supplementation to high-fat diet (HFD) induced T2DM in male C57BL6J mice and the effect of testosterone supplementation on the skeletal muscle  responsiveness. We also studied the effect of testosterone on the  signaling pathway proteins in C2C12 myocyte cells to validate the in vivo findings.We found that testosterone had a potentiating effect on the skeletal muscle  signaling pathway to improve glycaemic control. We demonstrate that, in males, testosterone improves skeletal muscle  responsiveness by potentiating the PI3K-AKT pathway. The testosterone treated animals showed significant increase in the skeletal muscle  Receptor (IR), p85 subunit of PI3K, P-GSK3α (Ser-21), and P-AKT (Ser-473) levels as compared to the control animals; but there was no significant change in total AKT and GSK3α. Testosterone supplementation inhibited GSK3α in the myocytes in a PI3K/AKT pathway dependent manner; on the other hand GSK3β gene expression was reduced in the skeletal muscle upon testosterone supplementation.Testosterone increases  responsiveness by potentiating  signaling in the skeletal muscle cells, which is in contrast to the increased  in the liver of testosterone treated T2DM male animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685793>Energy restriction in obese women suggest linear reduction of hepatic fat content and time-dependent metabolic improvements.</a></h1><p>Energy restriction reduces liver fat, improves hepatic  and lipid metabolism. However, temporal data in which these metabolic improvements occur and their interplay is incomplete. By performing repeated MRI scans and blood analysis at day 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 the temporal changes in liver fat and related metabolic factors were assessed at five times during a low-calorie diet (LCD, 800-1100 kcal/day) in ten obese non-diabetic women (BMI 41.7 ± 2.6 kg/m) whereof 6 had NAFLD. Mean weight loss was 7.4 ± 1.2 kg (0.7 kg/day) and liver fat decreased by 51 ± 16%, resulting in only three subjects having NAFLD at day 28. Marked alteration of , NEFA, ALT and 3-hydroxybuturate was evident 3 days after commencing LCD, whereas liver fat showed a moderate but a linear reduction across the 28 days. Other circulating-liver fat markers (e.g. triglycerides, adiponectin, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 index, fibroblast growth factor 21) demonstrated modest and variable changes. Marked elevations of NEFA, 3-hydroxybuturate and ALT concentrations occurred until day 14, likely reflecting increased tissue lipolysis, fat oxidation and upregulated hepatic fatty acid oxidation. In summary, these results suggest linear reduction in liver fat, time-specific changes in metabolic markers and  in response to energy restriction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646121>Pioglitazone and cardiovascular risk reduction: time for a second look?</a></h1><p>, a fundamental pathophysiological abnormality in patients with type 2 diabetes, is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) disease risk. In diabetes management, the macrovascular impact of antihyperglycemic agents that do not improve  sensitivity has generally been disappointing. In contrast, glucose-lowering drugs that work as  sensitizing agents have been postulated to reduce CV complications. The data to support this hypothesis have, however, been inconsistent.

Time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA was measured by accelerometer and transformed into isometric log-ratio coordinates. The associations between time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA and biomarkers were examined by linear regression models. The change in each outcome of reallocating time between the three behaviors was estimated.ResultsThe findings show strong positive associations of time spent in MVPA and negative associations of time spent in SB relative to time spent in the other behaviors with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and homeostasis model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) and negative associations of time spent in SB with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, reallocation of 19 minutes MVPA to SB or to LIPA was associated with a 17% and 17% larger SAD, 39% and 36% larger HOMA-IR values and 3.3% and 2.3% lower levels of HDL, respectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis from a time-use perspective supports the current evidence that sedentary time is devastating for the cardiometabolic health. While LIPA probably requires more time, maintaining or increasing time in MVPA are the most important features of the time use behaviors when promoting a favorable cardiometabolic risk profile in adults with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662726>Cigarette Smoking: An Accessory to the Development of .</a></h1><p> is a condition characterized by decreased sensitivity of a skeletal or adipose cell to , resulting in decreased glucose uptake by the cell.

However, the evidence on which forms of exercise are beneficial for pregnant women with GDM is unclear.PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Web of Science were systematically searched for eligible studies until Feb.24, 2019. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was used as the study method. The literature quality was evaluated and the data extracted by two researchers, and statistical analysis was carried out using Review Manage 5.2 software.A total of 9 RCTs were included. The research results show that compared with the conventional treatment group, aerobic exercise reduced the fasting blood glucose [WMD=-0.35, 95% CI: -0.62~-0.08, I2=87%], postprandial blood glucose [WMD=-0.62, 95% CI:-0.95~-0.29, I2=84%] and glycosylated hemoglobin levels [WMD=-0.35, 95% CI:-0.49~-0.20, I2=71%] in patients with GDM.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Since endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is a mechanism of IR, this study sought to examine whether DEX can effectively alleviate IR by reducing ERS.HepG2 and LO2 cells were treated with different concentrations of . The glucose content assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) were then employed to determine the optimal  concentration capable of inducing IR without affecting cell viability. -resistant hepatocytes were cultured with different concentrations of DEX for 24 h, and the glucose concentration in the supernatant was measured. ERS was assessed by qPCR and western blotting.

Due to the epidemic obesity, NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of liver damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to  (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of gut microbiota and gut-derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the gut and the liver. Obesity, nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients. The premise of this review is to discuss the role of gut-liver axis in NAFLD and emphasize the beneficial effects of probiotics on gut microbiota composition as a novel attractive therapeutic strategy to introduce in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669589>VDR regulates energy metabolism by modulating remodeling in adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism. Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits.  in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and  tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of , which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Muscle mass loss is associated with weakness, fatigue, and . In fact, it is predicted that controlling muscle atrophy can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with diseases such as cancer cachexia and sarcopenia.We analyzed gene expression data from muscle of mice or human patients with diverse muscle pathologies and identified LMCD1 as a gene strongly associated with skeletal muscle function. We transiently expressed or silenced LMCD1 in mouse gastrocnemius muscle or in mouse primary muscle cells and determined muscle/cell size, targeted gene expression, kinase activity with kinase arrays, protein immunoblotting, and protein synthesis levels. To evaluate force, calcium handling, and fatigue, we transduced the flexor digitorum brevis muscle with a LMCD1-expressing adenovirus and measured specific force and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release in individual fibers. Finally, to explore the relationship between LMCD1 and calcineurin, we ectopically expressed Lmcd1 in the gastrocnemius muscle and treated those mice with cyclosporine A (calcineurin inhibitor). In addition, we used a luciferase reporter construct containing the myoregulin gene promoter to confirm the role of a LMCD1-calcineurin-myoregulin axis in skeletal muscle mass control and calcium handling.Here, we identify LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1 (LMCD1) as a positive regulator of muscle mass, that increases muscle protein synthesis and fiber size. LMCD1 expression in vivo was sufficient to increase specific force with lower requirement for calcium handling and to reduce muscle fatigue. Conversely, silencing LMCD1 expression impairs calcium handling and force, and induces muscle fatigue without overt atrophy. The actions of LMCD1 were dependent on calcineurin, as its inhibition using cyclosporine A reverted the observed hypertrophic phenotype. Finally, we determined that LMCD1 represses the expression of myoregulin, a known negative regulator of muscle performance. Interestingly, we observed that skeletal muscle LMCD1 expression is reduced in patients with skeletal muscle disease.Our gain- and loss-of-function studies show that LMCD1 controls protein synthesis, muscle fiber size, specific force, Ca handling, and fatigue . This work uncovers a novel role for LMCD1 in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function with potential therapeutic implications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661671>Leptin and  in young adulthood are associated with weight in infancy.</a></h1><p>Low weight in early infancy is a known risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome in adult life. However, little is known either about developmental programming in subjects of normal birthweight, or about events between the ages which separate early programming and the occurrence of disease at late adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and  in young, healthy adults, born with a birth size within the normal range, are influenced by early life growth patterns. In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of metabolic function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their body composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome, was associated with low weight at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult weight = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial  and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) .

This work assesses the efficacy of metformin in pregnancy to avert one outcome-incident GDM in women at high risk. We included RCTs comparing metformin with usual care or placebo controls in terms of incident GDM and recruiting women at high risk during early pregnancy. Eleven eligible trials enrolled 2370 adult women whose intervention arm consisted of metformin started at conception or before 20 weeks of gestation. Risk of GDM was similar in intervention compared with controls (risk ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.24). The data were of sufficient quality meeting the criteria for consistency and directness. We conclude that metformin does not contribute to averting the GDM outcome in women at high risk when initiated in pregnancy. The evidence provided by this synthesis affirms that further broad clinical trials investigating this question are no longer needed.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667162>Use of Homeostatic Model Assessment Indexes for the Identification of Metabolic Syndrome and  among Cuban-Americans: A Cross Sectional Study.</a></h1><p>to determine cut off points for The Homeostatic Model Assessment Index 1 and 2 (HOMA-1 and HOMA-2) for identifying  and metabolic syndrome among a Cuban-American population.Cross sectional.Florida International University, Robert Stempel School of Public Health and Social Work, Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Miami, FL from July 2010 to December 2011.Subjects without diabetes residing in South Florida were enrolled (N=146, aged 37 to 83 years).

Increased intestinal permeability is related with obesity, , type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. The existence of such a relationship between PCOS and intestinal permeability has come to an end. Zonulin can change intestinal permeability, and this effect is reversible. We studied the relation between zonulin and the hormonal and metabolic parameters of PCOS.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women were included in the study. Histories were taken from all the participants, body mass indexes were calculated, and biochemical tests and suprapubic over ultrasonography were made. Zonulin was studied with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum zonulin levels were similar between PCOS and control groups (p = 0.893). In all participants, there were negative correlations between zonulin and the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.00, 0.018, 0.004, 0.002), there were boundary correlations with age and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.052 and 0.058). No statistically significant was detected in the PCOS group except negative correlation between zonulin and age (p = 0.046), boundary correlation between zonulin and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.064).PCOS patients did not have metabolic syndrome. Zonulin was not higher in PCOS then controls, and it had only negative relation with age. The negative relation between zonulin and some metabolic parameters in all participants was not detected in PCOS group.

Sweet proteins are a relatively unstudied class of sweet compounds that could serve as innovative sweeteners, but their introduction on the food market has been delayed by some factors, among which is the lack of thorough metabolic and toxicological studies. We have tried to shed light on the potential of a sweet protein, MNEI, as a fructose substitute in beverages in a typical western diet, by studying the metabolic consequences of its consumption on a Wistar rat model of high fat diet-induced obesity. In particular, we investigated the lipid profile,  sensitivity and other indicators of metabolic syndrome. We also evaluated systemic inflammation and potential colon damage. MNEI consumption rescued the metabolic derangement elicited by the intake of fructose, namely , altered plasma lipid profile, colon inflammation and translocation of lipopolysaccharides from the gut lumen into the circulatory system.

GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty acid-binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition.

However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1.2, 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and 2.45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin B for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and obesity-related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin B, and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin B, and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or B. CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin B, and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin B treatment.

The HGP test showed that the treatment of AHG (10 μg mL-1) for 3 h decreased HGP by 25% in  resistant hepatocytes. Quantitative PCR and western blot analysis revealed that AHG also ameliorated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase).

The homeostasis model assessment was the gold standard for identifying IR. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value, and the nomogram was utilized to analyze the predictive value. The size of the area under the curve (AUC) reflected the accuracy of screening and prediction.Differences in races were observed in terms of IR and BLIs, and the Kazakhs had the highest IR level at 5.27 mmol/L. The correlation between IR and BLIs differed among the three races. For the Kazakhs and Hans, all BLIs, except total cholesterol (TC), were correlated to IR. However, for the Uygurs, only the triglyceride (TG) level, TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, and TC/HDL-C ratio were associated with IR. After further adjustment of confounding factors, these indicators were still correlated to IR. BLIs that independently correlated to IR in the three nationalities had a certain diagnostic value for IR. In terms of the AUC size, the TG level was the highest in Uygurs, the TG/HDL-C ratio was the highest for Kazakhs and Hans, and the corresponding best cut-off points for IR were 1.515, 1.230, and 1.495 mmol/L, respectively. In addition, for each race, when the indicators with a certain diagnostic value were combined, the diagnostic value for IR was higher.BLIs had a certain diagnostic value for IR and could be used as a screening tool for IR among Uygurs, Kazakhs, and Hans in Xinjiang.

Furthermore, most people with type 2 diabetes are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of  and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28mM glucose, 200µM palmitic acid, and 200µM oleic acid as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on  secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and  secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, 2-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased  secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of  secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of  secretion. As such they may be potential targets for treatment of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is currently unclear how complement integrates into our current model of molecular pathogenesis in HS and whether is represents a central component of pathogenesis, or a neutrophil-associated bystander. Levels of C5a in serum and tissue correlate with disease activity and degree of neutrophilic infiltrates in HS. C5a has been associated with Th17 immune axis activation in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease with strong similarities to TH17 activation in HS. Porphyromonas species (which are identified in the HS microbiome) are able to cleave inactive C5 into C5a implicating the cutaneous microbiome as an activator of complement. C3a and C5a are associated with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, implicated in the inflammatory drive in HS. Complement receptors are present upon dendritic cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and adipocytes which may broaden the potential contribution of complement to multiple aspects of HS pathogenesis. Dysregulation of complement receptor pathways have been documented in obesity,  and polycystic ovarian syndrome leading to the possibility that complement may explain the epidemiological associations between these conditions and HS. The therapeutic potential of complement inhibitors in HS may be related to the therapeutic target (complement receptor or complement subunit), and the presence of alternate receptors (such as C5aR2) or ligands (including C3a, PAMPs and DAMPs). Integrating complement into the known pathogenesis of HS may aid in explaining the contradictory results between Phase 2 studies of C5a antagonists. It also allows for the identification of existing knowledge gaps to target further clinical investigation and research.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We have recently shown that myeloid cell-specific reduction of 3- hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (  ), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, protects against atherosclerosis by inhibiting macrophage migration in mice. We hypothesized that ATMs are harder to accumulate in   mice than control   mice in the setting of obesity.

Myeloid cell-specific reduction of  improved glucose tolerance and  sensitivity without altering body weight in the HFD-induced obese mice. The improvement was due to a decrease in the numbers of ATMs. The ATMs were reduced by decreased recruitment of macrophages due to their impaired chemotactic activity. These changes were associated with decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissues. Myeloid cell-specific reduction of  also attenuated hepatic steatosis.

IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more weight, had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with /AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic inflammation, which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662623>High IL-1α Production Was Induced in the WBN/Kob- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Rat Model and Inhibited by  Infection.</a></h1><p>The novel WBN/Kob- () congenic rat strain is considered a useful rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Bone marrow derived macrophages from  rats expressed high levels of IL-1α upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore,  infection, which delays the onset of T2DM, reduced both plasma and cecal IL-1α levels in  rats. These results suggest that macrophage infiltration and IL-1α secretion comprise an important part of T2DM development and that  infection inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in  rats.© 2018 M.

This intervention was modeled on standard brief motivational interventions for alcohol used in the workplace that promote health knowledge and goal setting.Outcomes included changes in SSB intake, Homeostatic Model Assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and measures of abdominal adiposity. The primary associations tested were the correlation between changes in SSB intake and changes in HOMA-IR.Among the 214 study participants, 124 (57.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41.2 (11.0) years and a baseline mean (SD) body mass index of 29.4 (6.5). They reported a mean daily intake of 1050 mL (35 fl oz) of SSBs at baseline and 540 mL (18 fl oz) at follow-up-a 510-mL (17-fl oz) (48.6%) decrease (P < .001). Reductions in SSB intake correlated with improvements in HOMA-IR (r = 0.16; P = .03). Those not randomized to receive the brief intervention reduced their SSB intake by a mean (SD) of 246.0 (84.0) mL (8.2 [2.8] fl oz), while those also receiving the brief intervention reduced SSB intake by 762.0 (84.0) mL (25.4 [2.8] fl oz). From baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in mean (SE) waist circumference (2.1 [2.8] cm; P < .001).This study's findings suggest that the workplace sales ban was associated with a reduction in SSB intake and a significant reduction in waist circumference among employees within 10 months. The randomized clinical trial portion of this study found that targeting those at high risk with a brief motivational intervention led to additional improvements. Workplace sales bans may offer a promising new private-sector strategy for reducing the health harms of SSB intake.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676093>PM aggravates diabetes via the systemically activated IL-6-mediated STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in rats' liver.</a></h1><p>PM exposure aggravates type 2 diabetes, in which inflammatory factors play an important role. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for aggravating diabetes after PM exposure, and study the roles of inflammatory factors in -resistant type 2 diabetes. Our study indicated that short-time PM exposure enhances  in type 2 diabetic rats and significantly raises inflammatory factors, including IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1, in lungs. However, we found that of these inflammatory factors only IL-6 levels are elevated in blood, liver, adipose tissue, and macrophages, but not in skeletal muscle. IL-6 induced activation of the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver, but not other downstream pathways including STAT1, ERK1/2, and PI3K. Both STAT3 inhibition and IL-6 neutralization effectively alleviated the disorders of glucose metabolism after PM exposure. Taken together, this suggests that the systemic increase in IL-6 may play an important role in the deterioration of the type 2 diabetes via IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver after short-time exposure to PM. Besides, we unexpectedly found a stronger  to the PM exposure-induced increase in IL-6 in skeleton muscle than those of many other tissues.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Military Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

The objective of present study was to evaluate the androgens levels in young females with emphasis on the association of 17OHP with IR. Serum concentrations of glucose, , and androgens in 80 young females were measured by standard routine procedures. Total testosterone (TT), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (ASD), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) levels were higher in patients with IR compared to healthy controls ( < .05). 17OHP was associated with IR and other androgens tested in young females. According to the results, androgen excess was associated with IR in young females and TT appeared to be independent predictor of IR in these patients. These data may suggest that simultaneous quantification of an androgen profile including at least TT, DHT, and 17OHP can present useful clinical information for assessment of androgen excess.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678069>Ingestion of lean meat elevates muscle inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 protein content independent of a distinct post-prandial circulating proteome in young adults with obesity.</a></h1><p>We have recently shown that a novel signalling kinase, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1), is implicated in whole-body  via its inhibitory action on Akt.  and  like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at 0 min (post-absorptive), 120 min and 300 min relative to the ingestion of 170 g pork loin (36 g protein and 5 g fat) to examine skeletal muscle protein signalling, plasma proteomic signatures, and whole-body phenylalanine disappearance rates (R).Phenylalanine R was not different in obese compared to lean individuals at all time points and was not responsive to a pork ingestion (basal, P = .056; 120 & 300 min, P > .05). IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle. In addition, proteomic analysis showed no differences in proteomic signatures between obese, overweight or lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Different epidemiologic studies have shown a significant relationship between lower intake of fibre and metabolic disorders. There are many naturally occurring dietary fibres among which gums are utmost important class e.g. guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, gellan gum, and gum acacia. Gum acacia has been considered as a safe dietary fibre by the United States, Food and Drug Administration and it is used widely as a stabilizer, thickening agent, and emulsifier in the food industry. Though gum acacia feeding has been reported to exert many beneficial effects in both rodents and humans, the underpinning for the different proposed molecular mechanisms are still elusive. So it would be of great relevance to conduct studies to understand the molecular mechanism of action of such fibres in the management of metabolic diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667161>Ethnic Differences in , Adiponectin Levels and Abdominal Obesity: Haitian Americans and African Americans, with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h1><p>Metabolic outcomes of obesity and its associated disorders may not be equivalent across ethnicity and diabetes status.In this paper, we examined the association of abdominal obesity, by ethnicity and diabetes status, for indicators of glucose metabolism in Blacks.A cross sectional study was conducted in Haitian Americans (n= 186) and African Americans (n= 148) with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Promoting the browning of white adipose tissue has been suggested as a potential strategy, but a drug still needs to be identified. Here, genetic deletion of activating transcription factor 3 (  ) in mice under a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in obesity and , which was abrogated by virus-mediated ATF3 restoration. ST32da, a synthetic ATF3 inducer isolated from , promoted ATF3 expression to downregulate adipokine genes and induce adipocyte browning by suppressing the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 axis. Furthermore, ST32da increased white adipose tissue browning and reduced lipogenesis in HFD-induced obese mice. The anti-obesity efficacy of oral ST32da administration was similar to that of the clinical drug orlistat. Our study identified the ATF3 inducer ST32da as a promising therapeutic drug for treating diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666643>Empagliflozin and Dulaglutide are Effective against Obesity-induced Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Fibrosis in A Murine Model.</a></h1><p>Patients with asthma with obesity experience severe symptoms, are unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment, and lack proper pharmacotherapy. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce weight, decrease , and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on obesity-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin (5 days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal serum levels of leptin and , and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs. Empagliflozin and dulaglutide could be a promising therapy for obesity-induced asthma and showed additive effects in combination.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695251>Molecular and Pathological Events Involved in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes-Associated Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is a rising epidemic in most part of the world and is often associated with multiple organ disorders such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular diseases. Liver is a major metabolic hub, and the metabolic disorders associated with diabetes result in liver dysfunctions culminating in spectrum of liver diseases such as fatty liver disorders, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The intervention strategies to prevent diabetes-associated liver injury require an overall understanding of the key factors and molecular pathways which can be strategically targeted. The present review focuses on some of the key aspects of fatty acid metabolism, fetuin-A regulation, inflammatory pathways, and genetic factors associated with , dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and so on involved in the nexus between diabetes and liver injury.

Therefore, -sensitizing agents are suggested to improve both reproductive as well as metabolic aspects of PCOS. This study aimed to compare the effects of metformin taken alone with that of a combination of metformin and pioglitazone on menstrual cycle, hormonal parameters, , and inflammatory biomarkers in women with PCOS. One hundred and six women with PCOS participated in the study. All subjects were randomized into two-arm intervention groups (Arm 1 and 2). Participants in Arm-1 received metformin (500 mg BD) daily while those in Arm-2 a combination of metformin (500 mg BD) and pioglitazone (15 mg BD) for 12 wks. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured using ELISA whereas  was assessed using HOMA-IR. At baseline women with PCOS had significantly elevated circulating concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8. Treatment decreased IL-6 in both the groups, however, only the combination group showed a significant decrease (p=0.005). Serum IL-8 level had a significant decrease after treatment in both groups (p <0.001). HOMA-IR and  levels also decreased in both the groups (both p <0.001). Testosterone, FSH, and prolactin significantly decreased in both groups. LH also decreased in both groups, however, the change was significant only in the combination group (p=0.013).

Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy. Metreleptin, the synthetic analog of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin and current therapy of choice for patients with lipodystrophy, successfully improves metabolic function. However, while leptin has been associated with hypertension, vascular diseases, and inflammation in the context of obesity, it remains unknown whether its daily administration could further impair cardiovascular function in patients with lipodystrophy. The goal of this short review is to describe the cardiovascular phenotype of patients with lipodystrophy, speculate on the etiology of the disorders, and discuss how the use of murine models of lipodystrophy could be beneficial to address the question of the contribution of leptin to lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease.Copyright: © 2019 Bruder-Nascimento T et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670618>Metformin: Up to Date.</a></h1><p>Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent extensively used as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes.

However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the association of serum LBP levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations. Methods and Results A total of 2568 community-dwelling Japanese individuals 40 years and older without prior CVD were followed for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum LBP levels were divided into quartiles (quartile 1: 2.20-9.68 μg/mL; quartile 2: 9.69-10.93 μg/mL; quartile 3: 10.94-12.40 μg/mL; quartile 4: 12.41-24.34 μg/mL). The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for the incidence of CVD were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 180 individuals developed CVD. The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of CVD increased significantly with higher serum LBP levels ( for trend=0.005). Individuals with higher serum LBP levels had a significantly greater risk of the development of CVD after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (quartile 1: HR, 1.00 [reference]; quartile 2: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.60-1.78]; quartile 3: HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.92-2.51]; and quartile 4: HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.17-3.09];  for trend=0.01). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of  ( for trend=0.01). However, when additional adjustment was made for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the association was attenuated to the nonsignificant level ( for trend=0.08). Conclusions The present findings suggest that higher serum LBP levels are associated with increased risk of the development of CVD in the general Japanese population. Low-grade endotoxemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD through chronic systemic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694213>Early Hepatic Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Changes Following Western Diet in Middle Aged Rats.</a></h1><p>To assess the effect of 4 weeks of high fat-high fructose feeding on whole body composition, energy balance, specific markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and  sensitivity in the liver of middle-aged rats, rats (1 year) were fed a diet rich in saturated fatty acids and fructose (HFF rats), mimicking the "Western diet", and compared with rats of the same age that were fed a low fat diet (LF rats). HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of body weight, energy, and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic , together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, , and early mitochondrial alterations in the liver. Therefore, this type of dietary habits should be drastically limited to pursue a "healthy aging".</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681178>Elevated Serum Mannose Levels as a Marker of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h1><p> Recent reports have highlighted the role of monosaccharide biosynthesis in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting that these processes may serve as a biomarker in PCOS. Mannose is the main monosaccharide for protein glycosylation in mammals; however, the correlation between mannose and PCOS remains largely unknown.  A total of 132 Chinese Han women were recruited at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. Mannose levels were measured in serum samples collected from 71 patients with PCOS (29 lean, 42 obese) and 61 control subjects (28 lean, 33 obese). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were prepared to compare the diagnostic performance of mannose and hormonal parameters, individually or in combination. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess whether serum mannose levels were associated with PCOS after adjusting for other co-variables.  We showed that serum mannose levels were significantly increased in PCOS patients compared with control subjects regardless of obese status, and hyperandrogenic PCOS patients had higher serum mannose levels than normo-androgenic PCOS and control subjects. In addition, serum mannose levels were significantly correlated with serum androgen levels. Mannose had an area under the curve (AUC) of 73% at a cutoff value of 225.79 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 66.2% and specificity of 73.8% for predicting PCOS. There were no differences between mannose, total testosterone, free testosterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the reliability of predicting PCOS using the method outlined by Hanley and McNeil. Combining mannose and total testosterone resulted in a higher AUC of 83.3%, and had moderate sensitivity (78.9%) and specificity (77%) for predicting PCOS. The positive and negative predictive values were 80% and 75.8%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher serum mannose levels were strongly associated with an increased risk of PCOS ( = 0.016; odds ratio, 5.623; 95% confidence interval, 1.371-23.070).  Taken together, substantially elevated serum mannose levels are significantly associated with PCOS, highlighting the importance of further research into the role of mannose in the pathogenesis of PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Feng, Shi, Bi, Sagnelli, Sun, Jiao, Wang and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658625> Receptor Trafficking: Consequences for  Sensitivity and Diabetes.</a></h1><p> receptor (INSR) has been extensively studied in the area of cell proliferation and energy metabolism.

The role of INSR activities and trafficking in  pathogenesis has been largely ignored. Ligand-activated INSR is internalized and trafficked to early endosome (EE), where INSR is dephosphorylated and sorted.

We explored whether mitochondrial dysfunction correlates with  and other metabolic complications.We investigated the changes of mRNA expression of genes encoding selected subunits of oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and citrate synthase (CS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) and peripheral monocytes (PM) and mitochondrial enzyme activity in platelets of 24 patients with active Cushing's syndrome and in 9 of them after successful treatment and 22 healthy control subjects.Patients with active Cushing's syndrome had significantly increased body mass index (BMI), homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and serum lipids relative to the control group. The expression of all investigated genes for selected mitochondrial proteins was decreased in SCAT in patients with active Cushing's syndrome and remained decreased after successful treatment. The expression of most tested genes in SCAT correlated inversely with BMI and HOMA-IR. The expression of genes encoding selected OXPHOS subunits and CS was increased in PM in patients with active Cushing's syndrome with a tendency to decrease toward normal levels after cure. Patients with active Cushing's syndrome showed increased enzyme activity of complex I (NQR) in platelets.Mitochondrial function in SCAT in patients with Cushing's syndrome is impaired and only slightly affected by its treatment which may reflect ongoing metabolic disturbances even after successful treatment of Cushing's syndrome.© 2019 Ježková et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693811>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, , and Ceramides.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684160>Is -Carbamoyl Putrescine, the Decarboxylation Derivative of Citrulline, a Regulator of Muscle Protein Metabolism in Rats?</a></h1><p>-carbamoyl putrescine (NCP), the decarboxylation derivative of citrulline, metabolically related to polyamines, may exert biological effects in mammals. The aim of this study was (i) to evaluate the nutritional properties of NCP in healthy rats and (ii) to determine the effect of NCP administration on muscle metabolism in malnourished old rats. The nutritional properties of NCP were first evaluated in 20 8-week-old male rats randomized to receive for two weeks a standard diet either alone (C group) or supplemented with NCP, 5 or 50 mg/kg/d. In a second study, 29 malnourished 18-month-old male rats were studied either before or after a 4-day refeeding with a standard diet either alone (REN group) or supplemented with NCP, 1 or 10 mg/kg/d. NCP had no effect on weight gain and body composition in either of the two studies. In healthy rats, muscle protein content was significantly increased in the soleus with NCP 5 mg/kg/d. A decrease in plasma glutamine and kidney spermine was observed at the 50 mg/kg/d dose; otherwise, no significant changes in plasma chemistry and tissue polyamines were observed. In malnutrition-induced sarcopenic old rats, refeeding with NCP 10 mg/kg/d was associated with higher tibialis weight and a trend for increased protein content in extensor digitorum longus (EDL). While the muscle protein synthesis rate was similar between groups, ribosomal protein S6 kinase was increased in tibialis and higher in the EDL in NCP-treated rats. The muscle RING-finger protein-1 expression was decreased in tibialis and urinary 3-methyl-histidine to creatinine ratio slightly lower with the supply of NCP. However, this initial period of refeeding was also associated with elevated fasted plasma triglycerides and glucose, significant in NCP groups, suggesting glucose intolerance and possibly . NCP was well-tolerated in healthy young-adults and in malnourished old rats. In healthy adults, NCP at 5 mg/kg/d induced a significant increase in protein content in the soleus, a type I fiber-rich muscle. In malnourished old rats, NCP supply during refeeding, may help to preserve lean mass by limiting protein breakdown; however, these effects may be limited in our model by a possible immediate refeeding-associated glucose intolerance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657304>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy or Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass for Patients with Metabolic Syndrome: An MBSAQIP Analysis.</a></h1><p>In patients undergoing bariatric surgery, the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) contributes to perioperative morbidity.

In conclusion, LSG is the predominant operation being performed for severely obese patients with MetS, and its popularity may in part be related to its improved perioperative safety profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697646>Catalpol induces autophagy and attenuates liver steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Impaired autophagy has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Catalpol (CAT), a bioactive compound from  (Di Huang) , is known to ameliorate  and the histological NAFLD spectrum in obese mice. Here, we investigated the effects of CAT on hepatic steatosis and autophagy in ob/ob and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, as well as in hepatocytes. In ob/ob mice, CAT reduced liver weight, liver triglyceride and cholesterol content, and hepatic lipogenic enzyme levels and increased fatty acid oxidase levels. In addition, CAT administration increased LC3-II levels and decreased SQSTM1/P62 levels in ob/ob mice. Similar effects on hepatic steatosis and autophagy were observed in high-fat diet-induced mice after administration of CAT. Additionally, we found that CAT stimulated AMPK and increased nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in obese mice and hepatocytes. Inhibition of AMPK completely blocked the effects of CAT on TFEB nuclear localization, hepatic autophagy, and liver steatosis. These findings revealed that diminished AMPK/TFEB-dependent autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of liver steatosis in obesity, and that CAT might be a novel therapeutic candidate for treatment of this condition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667577>Orexin A-induced inhibition of leptin expression and secretion in adipocytes reducing plasma leptin levels and hypothalamic leptin .</a></h1><p>Orexin A (OXA) is a neuropeptide associated with plasma  and leptin levels involved in body weight and appetite regulation. However, little is known about the effect of OXA on leptin secretion in adipocytes and its physiological roles. Leptin secretion and expression were analysed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Plasma leptin, adiponectin and  levels were measured by ELISA assay. Phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) levels in the hypothalamus were evaluated by western blotting. OXA dose-dependently suppressed leptin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes by inhibiting its gene expression while facilitating adiponectin secretion. The leptin inhibition by OXA was mediated via orexin receptors (OXR1 and OXR2). In addition to the pathway via extracellular signal-regulated kinases, OXA triggered adenylyl cyclase-induced cAMP elevation, which results in protein kinase A-mediated activation of cAMP response element-binding proteins (CREB). Accordingly, CREB inhibition restored the OXA-induced downregulation of leptin gene expression and secretion. Exogenous OXA for 4 weeks decreased fasting plasma leptin levels and increased hypothalamic pSTAT3 levels in high-fat diet-fed mice, regardless of increase in body weight and food intake. These results suggest that high dose of OXA directly inhibits leptin mRNA expression and thus secretion in adipocytes, which may be a peripheral mechanism of OXA for its role in appetite drive during fasting. It may be also critical for lowering basal plasma leptin levels and thus maintaining postprandial hypothalamic leptin sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678325>Extracellular vesicles as an emerging tool for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a series of interacting pathophysiological cascades, including the aggregation of β-amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles derived from hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. AD is the cause of approximately 70% of dementia, an irreversible and untreatable syndrome at its late stage. Hence, more efforts should be devoted to identifying at-risk or preclinical AD populations for early intervention and the improved design of drug trials. The exosome, a nanoscale subtype of extracellular vesicle that serves as a cell-to-cell communication messenger, is an emerging liquid biopsy tool for various diseases including AD. Recently, it has been discovered that brain-derived exosomes can flow through the blood-brain barrier to the peripheral blood, containing important protein and nucleic acid biomarkers that are associated with the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Other reports showed a strong involvement of exosomes in synaptic function, , and neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we summarize those studies and assess the value of exosomes as an emerging tool for the early detection of AD in conjunction with the current clinical diagnosis paradigm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to provide a basis for the clinical differential diagnosis of IAS and B-IRS. This was a retrospective study of the medical records of all patients diagnosed with IAS or B-IRS between January 2006 and March 2018 at the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Demographic, clinical, biochemistry, treatment, and follow-up data were examined. There were several different biochemical parameters between IAS (n=13) and B-IRS (n=6): white blood count (WBC, 7.05±3.06 vs. 2.70±0.73×10/l, p=0.004), platelet (249±56.6 vs. 111±68.0×10/l, p<0.001), serum creatine (59.0±17.8 vs. 43.1±7.05 μmol/l, p=0.013), serum albumin (42.3±5.17 vs. 33.6±3.40 g/l, p=0.002), triglyceride (median, 1.33 (1.01, 1.93) vs. 0.56 (0.50, 0.79) mmol/l, p=0.002), plasma IgG (1183±201 vs. 1832±469 mg/ml, p=0.018), IgA (328±140 vs. 469±150 mg/ml, p=0.018), and C3 (128±23.4 vs. 45.3±13.5 mg/l, p<0.001). Fasting  in the IAS and B-IRS patients was high (299-4708 vs. 118-851 mU/l, p=0.106), and there was a difference in 2 h oral glucose tolerance test  (4217-8343 mU/l vs. 274-1143 mU/l, p=0.012). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the B-IRS patients was higher than in IAS patients (114±14.4. vs. 40.6±8.89 mmol/mol, p<0.001). Serum -like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was lower in all B-IRS patients (25±0.00 vs. 132±52.7 ng/ml, p<0.001). Although IAS and B-IRS are autoimmune hyperinsulinemic dysglycemic syndromes, several clinical parameters (body mass index, HbA1c, WBC, platelet, albumin, triglyceride, IgG, C3, and IGF-1) are different between these two syndromes.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685055>The relationships between sarcopenic skeletal muscle loss during ageing and macronutrient metabolism, obesity and onset of diabetes.</a></h1><p>Skeletal muscle is integral to the metabolism and utilisation of macronutrients; however, substantial muscle loss and morphological changes occur with ageing. These are associated with loss of muscle function and accelerate rapidly from the age of 60 years, leading to the conditions of sarcopenia and frailty. As the relationship between muscle ageing and macronutrient metabolism and utilisation has seen limited research to date, this review focuses on the interactions between skeletal muscle changes during ageing, metabolism and utilisation of fat, carbohydrates and overall energy expenditure.Skeletal muscle contributes less to resting energy expenditure during ageing, potentially contributing to onset of obesity from middle age. Age-related changes to skeletal muscle lead to glucose dysregulation, with consequent reduction in glycaemic control, increased  and ultimately onset of type-2 diabetes. Recent studies indicate that high total fat and SFA intake are detrimental to skeletal muscle, while higher intakes of PUFA are protective. Age-associated changes in skeletal muscle may also reduce total fatty acid utilisation.In conclusion, further research is needed to understand the relationships between macronutrient metabolism and utilisation and age-related changes to skeletal muscle. No dietary recommendations exist specifically for skeletal muscle health during ageing, but we advise individuals to follow healthy eating guidelines, by consuming sufficient protein, fruit and vegetables, and limited SFA and to maintain physically active lifestyles. Clinicians responsible for managing type-2 diabetes need to be aware of growing evidence relating age-related skeletal muscle changes to diabetes onset and progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669002>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension and risk of chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.</a></h1><p>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been favorably linked to important risk factors associated with development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as , hypertension, and dyslipidemia. However, the protective role of DASH dietary patterns in development of CKD, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), remains inconsistent in the literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to summarize the findings of previous observational studies and quantify the potential association between DASH dietary patterns and the risk of CKD using meta-analysis.A comprehensive search was done with the use of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and Scopus databases to find relevant articles published prior to June 2019. Search terms included: ([Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension] OR [DASH]) AND ([Kidney Failure, Chronic] OR [Renal Insufficiency, Chronic] OR [Chronic Kidney Disease], OR [CKD] OR [End-Stage Renal Disease] OR [ESRD] OR [Kidney] OR [Renal]). To pool the risk estimates, fixed-effects and random-effects models were applied. Cochrane Q test was performed to detect sources of heterogeneity among the included studies.Out of the seven studies included in the systematic review, six were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The total sample size was 568,213 participants including 16,694 cases of CKD. Combined risk estimates for 2 cross-sectional and 4 prospective cohort studies showed an inverse association between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD (Pooled risk estimate: 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p = 0.01). Stratified analysis showed a marginally significant relationship between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD in prospective cohort studies (Pooled risk estimate: 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.01; p = 0.05), and no significant association in cross-sectional studies (Pooled risk estimate: 0.71, 95% CI 0.38-1.34; p = 0.29), respectively. A significant association was observed between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD in the studies extracted DASH based on nutrients (Pooled risk estimate: 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.97; p = 0.02), compared to the studies extracted DASH based on food groups (Pooled risk estimate: 0.66, 95% CI 0.28-1.58; p = 0.35).The results of the present study showed a significant inverse association between DASH dietary patterns and the risk of developing CKD. Adherence to DASH dietary patterns might have protective effects against CKD development and progression. Further research is required to confirm the certainty of estimates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

After excluding individuals aged <64 years or with a history of diabetes mellitus, 272 non-diabetic older adults (116 men, 156 women) met the inclusion criteria. According to the homeostasis model assessment of , the participants were divided into two groups; that is, the  group (homeostasis model assessment of  ≥1.73) and non- group (homeostasis model assessment of  <1.73). Muscle mass (lower limb, upper limb, appendicular and trunk) and muscle strength (grip strength and knee extension torque) were measured and divided by the weight, and then multiplied by 100 to calculate the weight ratio (%). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of each muscle index for risk of  was calculated separately for both men and women.Lower limb muscle mass (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.92 in men; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.96 in women, respectively) and appendicular muscle mass (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.94 in men; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.95 in women, respectively), but not other muscle indexes, were associated with risk of , after adjusting for age, body mass index, highly sensitive C-reacting protein and smoking habits.Lower limb muscle mass of non-diabetic older adults is independently related to .

Glioma represents a cancer resulting from an imbalance between glucose metabolism and tumor growth. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysregulated brain glucose metabolism and lactate accumulation in glioma remain to be elucidated. The present study identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) as a candidate to mediate glucose metabolism in glioma. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and  to apoptosis were evaluated in lncRNA-XIST-depleted glioblastoma cells by short hairpin RNA. Glucose uptake, lactate production, as well as levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3, were measured. Luciferase assay, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation were performed to validate the interactions among lncRNA-XIST, microRNA-126 (miR-126), and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). An in vivo analysis was carried out in nude mice bearing glioblastoma cell xenografts. The study found that lncRNA-XIST knockdown inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion,  to apoptosis, and glucose metabolism of glioblastoma cells. LncRNA-XIST functioned as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-126 and then regulated IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway in glioblastoma cells. In vivo results demonstrated lncRNA-XIST knockdown reduces the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. Taken together, we demonstrated a novel cellular mechanism that was dependent of the lncRNA-XIST/miR-126/IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway in enhanced glucose metabolism in glioma.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
