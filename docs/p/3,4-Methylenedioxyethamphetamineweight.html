Derivatization of the compound to a perfluoroalkylamide, prior to confirmation, typically yields better chromatographic separation. Once methamphetamine is detected, a second GC-MS test is necessary to distinguish positive results from the use of over-the-counter medication, Vicks inhaler, or from use of a prescription drug, selegiline (Deprenyl). R-(-)-Methamphetamine is the urinary product from legitimate use of these medications. The second GC-MS test is to confirm illicit use of (S)-(+)-methamphetamine. In the procedure, the two methamphetamine isomers are changed to the chromatographically separable diastereomers by a chiral derivatizing agent, (S)-(-)-trifluoroacetylprolyl chloride (TPC). But the method has inherent limitations. Racemization of the reagent produces mixed diastereomers even from pure (S)-(+)-methamphetamine. Instead of using TPC, we utilized (R)-(-)-alpha-methoxy-alpha-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride (MTPA) to prepare the amides of diastereomers of methamphetamine. No racemization was observed with this reagent. The method was extended to resolve GC peaks of (R)-(-)- and (S)-(+)-isomers of amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), N-methyl-MDA (MDMA), and N-ethyl-MDA (MDEA). Three ions from the drug and two ions from the deuterated internal standard were monitored to characterize and quantitate the drugs. For MDEA, only one ion was used. The quantitation was linear over 25 to 5000 ng/mL for MDEA and 25 to 10,000 ng/mL for all other drugs. Correlation coefficients were > 0.996. Precision calculated as the coefficient of variation at the calibrator concentration of 500 ng/mL was within +/- 11% for all drugs. The method was applied to test 43 urine specimens. In 91% of the methamphetamine-positive specimens, only the (S)-(+)-isomer was detected. In all MDMA-positive specimens, the concentrations of (R)-(-)-isomer were greater than the (S)-(+)-isomer indicating longer retention of (R)-(-)-isomer in the human . The specimen concentrations (R + S) compared well with that of a non-chiral method that used 4-carboethoxyhexafluorobutyryl chloride as derivatizing agent. But the MTPA method has some advantage. It alone can replace the two GC-MS methods needed to confirm the presence of (S)-(+)-isomers of amphetamine and methamphetamine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875234>GC-MS studies on side chain regioisomers related to substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamines: MDEA, MDMMA, and MBDB.</a></h1><p>Three regioisomeric 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamines having the same molecular  and major mass spectral fragments of equal mass have been reported as drugs of abuse in forensic studies in recent years. These compounds are 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine (MDMMA), and N-methyl-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-butanamine (MBDB). A series of seven additional side chain regioisomers have mass spectra essentially equivalent to the three controlled drug substances, all have molecular  of 207 and major fragment ions in their electron ionization mass spectra at m/z 72 and 135/136. The trifluoroacetyl, pentafluoropropionyl, and heptafluorobutryl derivatives of the primary and secondary regioisomeric amines were evaluated in GC-MS studies. The mass spectra for these derivatives were significantly individualized, and the resulting unique fragment ions allowed for specific side chain identification. The trifluoroacetyl and heptafluorobutryl derivatives provided more specific fragment ions for molecular individualization among these regioisomeric substances. These perfluoroacyl derivatives showed reasonable resolution on the polar stationary phase Rtx-200.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9869367>Quantitation of N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and its major metabolites in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection.</a></h1><p>A HPLC method has been developed for the analogue of Ecstasy MDE and its major metabolites N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HME) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) in human plasma. In the course of our investigations we found that the methylenedioxyamphetamines and HME exhibit fluorescence at 322 nm. Therefore the detection could be carried out with a fluorescence (FL) detector. Solid-phase extraction was used for sample preparation and yielded high recovery rates greater than 95%. The limit of quantitation for MDE and its metabolites in the extracts was between 1.5 and 8.9 ng/ml and the method standard deviations were less than 5%. This sensitive, rapid and reliable analytical method has been used successfully in the quantitation of the substances in plasma samples obtained from 14 volunteers in two clinical studies after p.o. administration of 100 to 140 mg MDE*HCI. The maximum plasma concentrations were 235-465 ng/ml (MDE), 67-673 ng/ml (HME) and 7-33 ng/ml (MDA), respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters have been investigated using the plasma concentration curves.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8471129>Psychological effects of MDE in normal subjects. Are entactogens a new class of psychoactive agents?</a></h1><p>The so-called entactogens 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ([MDMA] also known as "Ecstasy," or "Adam") and its analog  ([MDE] also known as "Eve") exert similar psychotropic effects in humans. Two double-blind placebo-controlled psychometric studies with normal control subjects were conducted. Placebo or MDE (140 mg) was administered orally to eight male volunteers at 1:30 P.M. and to six subjects (3 male, 3 female) at 11 P.M. Psychologic tests and clinical ratings were performed 1 hour before the administration of the drugs, as well as 2, 5, and 24 hours after drug intake and 7 days thereafter in the first study. In the second study,  were taken at times -1, +8.5, +24 hours, and +7 days. The majority of the psychotropic effects resembled those that have already been described in anecdotal reports. The substance produced a partially controllable state of enhanced insight, empathy, and peaceful feelings. All subjects displayed a general stimulation with increased psychomotor drive, logorrhea, and facilitation of communication. One of the fourteen volunteers developed a toxic psychosis. One volunteer displayed a dysphoric reaction, one suffered from episodes of anxiety for some days after the experiment. The findings support the hypothesis that MDMA and MDE represent a novel pharmacologic class.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681594>Neuroanatomic specificity and time course of alterations in rat brain serotonergic pathways induced by MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine): assessment using quantitative autoradiography.</a></h1><p>The widely abused "designer" drug MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) has been shown to cause marked and long-lasting changes in brain serotonergic systems. The present study uses quantitative in vitro autoradiography of 3H-paroxetine labeled 5-HT uptake sites to assess the time-dependent effects of MDMA on 5-HT neurons in specific neuroanatomic loci. Following treatment with MDMA (20 mg/kg, b.i.d. for 4 days), marked decreases in 5-HT uptake sites were observed in a number of brain regions known to receive projections of 5-HT neurons. These regions included cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, superior and inferior colliculi, geniculate nuclei, and most thalamic nuclei. In contrast, other areas such as the septal nuclei and some thalamic nuclei which also receive 5-HT projections were not substantially affected by this drug. In most regions, decreases in 5-HT uptake sites occurred within 24 hours of the last dose of MDMA and persisted at the 2 week time point. Some regions such as dorsal striatum exhibited a time-dependent reduction with greater reductions occurring at 2 weeks rather than immediately following the MDMA treatment regimen. The density of 5-HT uptake sites in other regions such as endopiriform nucleus and substantia nigra at the 2 week versus 18 hour time point indicated some degree of region-specific recovery. Regions which demonstrated no significant reduction in 5-HT uptake sites included the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area, central grey, interpeduncular nucleus, locus coerulus, pontine reticular formation and cerebellum. Likewise, regions containing 5-HT axons of passage (e.g., indusium griseum and lateral hypothalamus) appeared to be insensitive to the neurotoxic effects of MDMA on 5-HT neurons. Furthermore, the neurotoxic effects of MDMA showed specificity in that the catecholamine neurons labeled by 3H-mazindol were unaffected by the treatment regimen. These data indicate that the preferential degeneration of serotonergic neurons by MDMA is mediated primarily at 5-HT terminal regions, whereas regions containing 5-HT perikarya and axons of passage remain relatively unaffected. In addition, the observed time-dependent reductions and recovery of 5-HT uptake sites which were detected within 2 weeks of the treatment regimen in certain brain regions suggest region-specific differences in recovery of 5-HT systems from MDMA-induced lesion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17555628>GC-MS studies on the regioisomeric 2,3- and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamines related to MDEA, MDMMA, and MBDB.</a></h1><p>Three regioisomeric 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamines having the same molecular  and major mass spectral fragments of equal mass have been reported as drugs of abuse in forensic studies in recent years. These compounds are 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-N-dimethylamphetamine (MDMMA), and N-methyl-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-butanamine (MBDB). The mass spectra of the regioisomers (2,3-methylenedioxyphenethylamines) are essentially equal to the three compounds reported as drugs of abuse. This paper reports the synthesis, mass spectral characterization, and chromatographic analysis of these six regioisomeric amines. The six regioisomeric methylenedioxyphenethylamines are synthesized from commercially available starting materials. The electron impact mass spectra of these regioisomers show some variation in the relative intensity of the major ions with only a couple of minor ions that may indicate side chain specific fragments. Differentiation by mass spectrometry is only possible after the formation of the perfluoroacyl derivatives, pentafluoropropionylamides (PFPA) and heptafluorobutrylamides (HFBA). Gas chromatographic separation on non-polar stationary phases (Rtx-1 and Rtx-5) is not successful at resolving the three 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamines from the three 2,3-methylenedioxyphenethylamines as the underivatized amines. The six underivatized amines are resolved on the more polar trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane Rtx-200 stationary phase as well as a permethylated beta-cyclodextran Rtx-bDEX stationary phase. Gas chromatographic separation is successful at resolving the four PFPA and the four HFBA derivatives on the Rtx-200 stationary phase as well as the permethylated beta-cyclodextran stationary phase. The 2,3-methylenedioxyphenethylamine derivatives (compounds 4 and 6) eluted before the 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamine derivatives (compounds 1 and 3) as both the PFPA and HFBA derivatives.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9491967>Performance of Abusign drugs-of-abuse slide tests with particluar emphasis on concentrations near the cutoff: comparison with FPIA-ADx and confirmation of results with GC-MS.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of Abusign test slides in comparison with fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA)-ADx and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) confirmation with special emphasis on concentrations near the cutoff. Analysis was performed on 35 individual slide tests for cocaine (cutoff, 300 ng/mL), cannabinoids (cutoff, 100 ng/mL), and opiates (cutoff, 300 ng/mL); 104 tests for cannabinoids (cutoff, 50 ng/mL); and 34 panel slides (amphetamine cutoff 1000 ng/mL, cocaine cutoff 300 ng/mL, opiates cutoff 300 ng/mL, and cannabinoids cutoff 100 ng/mL). Urine samples that had a concentration measured with FPIA-ADx within +/-25% of the Abusign cutoff were selected. Inter- and intra-individual agreement were assessed from the readings of the slides (positive or negative) by four persons at t = 3, 5, and 10 min after sample incubation. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the cannabinoids slide test (50 ng/mL) were compared with those of FPIA-ADx using GC-MS as the gold standard. There was a considerable variation in the reading of the slides between different persons. In addition, for the same observer the reading could depend upon the time of incubation. In comparison with FPIA-ADx, the Abusign test slides showed a high sensitivity (46% vs. 87%) and a low specificity (95% vs. 51%). We concluded that the Abusign slide test is unsuitable for situations in which a reliable test result is desired because of the low interindividual agreement, the dependency of the test result upon time, and the low specificity. However, the test slides may be of value in toxicological screening.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18089653>Two-dimensional gas chromatography/electron-impact mass spectrometry with cryofocusing for simultaneous quantification of MDMA, MDA, HMMA, HMA, and MDEA in human plasma.</a></h1><p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug. Analysis of MDMA and metabolites in human plasma, particularly in pharmacokinetic studies, requires low limits of quantification. Two-dimensional GC/MS with cryofocusing is a chromatographic technique recognized for its increased selectivity and resolution.This method simultaneously quantifies 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), MDMA, and its metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) in human plasma. With hydrochloric acid, we hydrolyzed 1 mL plasma, fortified with internal standard. Analytes were subjected to solid-phase extraction, derivatized with heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride, and quantified using cryofocused 2-dimensional GC/MS operated in electron-impact selected ion-monitoring mode.Limits of quantification were 1.0 microg/L for MDA and 2.5 microg/L for MDEA, MDMA, HMMA, and HMA. Calibration curves were linear to 100 microg/L for MDA and HMA and to 400 microg/L for MDEA, MDMA, and HMMA, with r(2) > 0.997. At 3 concentrations spanning the linear dynamic range of the assay, mean overall extraction efficiencies from plasma were > or =85% for all compounds of interest. Recoveries were 85.6% to 107.2% of target, and intra- and interassay imprecision (CV) was <8.5% for all drugs at 3 concentrations within the range of the assay. None of the 66 exogenous compounds tested interfered with analyte quantification.This GC/MS assay provides low limits of quantification for simultaneous determination of MDEA, MDMA, and metabolites MDA, HMMA, and HMA in human plasma. The 2D chromatographic system should be suitable for application to other analytes and to other complex matrices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16466734>Development and application of a high-performance liquid chromatography method using monolithic columns for the analysis of ecstasy tablets.</a></h1><p>A rapid and selective HPLC method using monolithic columns was developed for the separation and quantification of the principal amphetamines in ecstasy tablets.

Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) techniques followed by GC-MS analysis were applied to extract amphetamines from hair. The group of amphetamines included methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA), methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) and internal standard mephentermine (MP). To validate information on amphetamine use in hair, powdered hair samples free from drugs were collected and soaked in a known amphetamine standard solution. Authentic fortified case hair samples taken from known drug users known to have consumed amphetamines were also analyzed for amphetamine. Results from this study show that amphetamine use can be detected in spiked and authentic fortified human hair using SFE techniques for qualitative and quantitative reproducible results.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16858076>Sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for simultaneous measurement of MDEA, MDMA, and metabolites HMA, MDA, and HMMA in human urine.</a></h1><p>A sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous measurement of MDEA, MDMA, and its metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or Ecstasy), and its metabolites, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMMA) in human urine.We hydrolyzed 1 mL urine, fortified with MDMA-d5, MDA-d5, and MDEA-d6, with 100 microL of concentrated hydrochloric acid at 120 degrees C for 40 min, then added 100 microL 10 N sodium hydroxide and 3 mL phosphate buffer 0.1 N (pH 6.0) were added to hydrolyzed urine specimens before solid-phase extraction. After elution and evaporation, we derivatized extracts with heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride and analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry operated in EI-selected ion-monitoring mode.Limits of quantification were 25 microg/L for MDEA, MDMA, and its metabolites. Calibration curves were linear to 5000 microg/L for MDEA, MDMA, HMA, MDA, and HMMA, with a minimum r2 > 0.99. At 3 concentrations spanning the linear dynamic range of the assay, mean overall extraction efficiencies from urine were >85.5% for all compounds of interest.

Isolation, identification, quantification, and synthesis of urinary metabolites.</a></h1><p>Studies on the isolation, identification, quantification, and synthesis of the urinary metabolites of racemic 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE) in humans are presented. After oral administration of 140 mg of racemic MDE to healthy volunteers, the following phase I metabolites could be isolated and identified by GC/MS: unchanged racemic MDE (I), racemic 3,4-dihydroxyethylamphetamine (II), racemic 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyethylamphetamine (IIIa), racemic 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (IV), racemic 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine (V), racemic 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (VIa), methylenedioxyphenylacetone (IXa), 3,4-methylenedioxyhippuric acid (X), and hydroxymethoxyhippuric acid (XII). The probable intermediate metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyhippuric acid (XI) could not be detected. Therefore, two overlapping phase I metabolic pathways for racemic MDE in humans could be postulated. The first and predominant pathway leads, via ring degradation by O-dealkylation, to the corresponding 3,4-dihydroxy metabolites, which are subsequently methylated at the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the aromatic ring. The second pathway leads, via side chain degradation by N-dealkylation, to the corresponding primary amines (IV, V, and VI). Oxidative N-deamination forms the substituted phenylacetones, which are degraded to the corresponding benzoic acids. This is followed by conjugation with glycine to form substituted hippurates. The structures of all of these metabolites were confirmed by chemical syntheses, which are described in this paper. All of the metabolites containing hydroxy groups are partly excreted in a conjugated form, because the amounts of these metabolites were much higher in urine extracts after enzymatic cleavage of conjugates. Quantification of the urinary excretion by HPLC revealed that 19% of the MDE dose was eliminated as I, 31.6% as IIIa, and 2.8% as IV within 32 hr.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20334173>Simultaneous determination of eight sympathomimetic amines in urine by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>A GC method was developed for the identification and quantitation of eight sympathomimetic amines in urine, i.e., amphetamine, methamphetamine, mephentermine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and methylenedioxyethylamphetamine. Methoxyphenamine was used as the internal standard (IS). The assay is rapid, sensitive, and simple to perform. It involves a liquid-liquid extraction procedure with simultaneous in-solution derivatization of the organic layer with pentafluorobenzoyl chloride (PFB-CI), followed by GC/MS analysis. These derivatives and the IS were extracted from 1 mL alkaline urine into hexane before derivatization with PFB-CI. The organic layer was then removed and evaporated to dryness before dissolution with hexane for GC/MS analysis. Calibration curves for each analyte showed linearity in the range of 25-5000 ng/mL (r2 > or = 0.997). Recoveries ranged from 88 to 99%, with the precision of recoveries typically < or = 5%.

In a patient sample set (blood, tissues, vitreous humor, etc.), analyzed with a dedicated liquid chromatographic-fluorescence detection method for the determination of methylenedioxy amphetamine, methylenedioxy methamphetamine, and methylenedioxy ethylamphetamine (MDEA), a "strange" inexplicable peak appeared at a retention time not corresponding to any of our reference materials. Based on the identical excitation and emission wavelengths in detection, and a retention behavior comparable to MDEA, it was assumed that this unknown compound was an isomer of the recreational drug MDEA. With a simple and straightforward methodological crossover between LC fluorescence detection and LC-MS/MS, additional information for structural elucidation was easily obtained. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypersil BDS C18 column (fluorescence detection part) and on a Hypersil BDS phenyl column (mass spectrometric detection part). MS showed that the unknown compound's molecular mass was identical to that of MDEA, and, in addition, its fragmentation pattern too proved quite similar to that of MDEA. A thorough literature overview and study of the fragmentation pattern by means of the MS/MS spectrum led to an evidence-based hypothesis of 3,4-methylenedioxy N,N-dimethylamphetamine (MDDM) being the unknown compound. To confirm this hypothesis, MDDM was synthesized and its presence in our biological sample was finally demonstrated by co-injection with alternatively synthesized MDDM and MDEA. This application shows the synergism between LC and MS in the elucidation of unknown compounds, nevertheless emphasizing the essence of chromatographic separation when dealing with isomers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515165>Quantitation of amphetamine-type compounds for which no reference compound is available: the validation of a theoretical model.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17646137>Validated liquid chromatographic-electrospray ionization mass spectrometric assay for simultaneous determination of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and its metabolites 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine in squirrel monkey plasma.</a></h1><p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a recreational drug with neurotoxic potential.

In the present study, to control for  reductions, we used litters with double the number of offspring to induce growth restriction comparable to that of standard size litters treated with MDMA. Litters were treated twice daily from P11 to 20 with vehicle or MDMA (20 mg/kg) or only weighed. Males, but not females, exposed to MDMA had longer latencies and more errors in the Cincinnati water maze compared to males of the other treatments. In the Morris water maze (210 cm pool, 10x10 cm platform), the MDMA animals were impaired relative to all other treatments during acquisition. Only the MDMA females showed deficits when the platform was shifted to a new location, however, both MDMA males and females were impaired when the location of the platform was again shifted and a reduced platform (5x5 cm) used. No differences were observed in the ability to swim a straight channel, locate a platform with a cue, or the endocrine response to forced swim among the treatment groups. No differences were seen between animals injected with saline and those only weighed. The data suggest that factors, such as growth retardation, multiple injections, or the composition of the litter, do not affect the development of learning and memory impairments resulting from P11 to 20 MDMA exposure. The large litter approach offers a novel method to control for undernutrition during the preweaning period in rodents.</p></html>
