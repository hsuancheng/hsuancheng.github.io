Pharmacokinetic studies employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated a terminal (beta) serum half-life of 2.19 h. Stomatitis, dermatitis, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy were observed. No significant leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, however, was noted. A-TDA administration led to hyperuricemia, which was adequately controlled with concurrent administration of allopurinol. Antitumor responses included one partial response in a patient with large cell carcinoma of the lung and three objective responses (2 non-small cell lung and 1 squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus). Two patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung had a marked improvement of  during A-TDA therapy.

A retrospective study was carried out on 140 cases of therapy related leukemia (TRL) caused by bimolane (BML) for  from 1984 to 1992. This series of BML-TRL consists of 90 male and 50 female patients. 87.1% of them were from 20 to 50 years old. Annual incidence varied from 4 to 24 cases, and was maintained at this level through the period from 1986 to 1991 without any declining tendency. The average time interval between BML administration and diagnosis of leukemia was 46 months. 138 cases were diagnosed as ANLL and 2 cases were suspected of having ALL. Subtype frequency was shown as follows: M3 >  > M5 > M4 > M1 > M6. 67.1% of the patients had a low peripheral white blood cell counts (< 5 x 10(9)/L). 116 patients received chemotherapy. A 26.7% remission rate was obtained with 18.1% complete remission and 8.6% partial remission. A 115 day median survival was calculated through a follow up survey of 95 patients. Finally, we concluded that: (1) This has been the largest group of non-cancer-therapy-related-leukemia patients ever reported. This type of leukemia is characterized by a shorter latent period, higher remission rate less incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome and more frequent occurrence of leukopenia, as compared with other types of TRL. BML is supposed to be a strong leukemia-causing cytotoxic agent.

We aimed to investigate a possible causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and .Following a review of published epidemiological evidence of the association between obesity and , mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test for a causal relationship with BMI. We used a genetic instrument comprising 97 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI as a proxy for BMI (expected to be much less confounded than measured BMI). One-sample MR was conducted using individual-level data (396,495 individuals) from the UK Biobank and the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway. Two-sample MR was performed with summary-level data (356,926 individuals) from published BMI and  genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The one-sample and two-sample MR estimates were meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model. To test for a potential reverse causal effect, MR analysis with genetic instruments comprising variants from recent genome-wide analyses for  were used to test whether genetic risk for this skin disease has a causal effect on BMI. Published observational data showed an association of higher BMI with . A mean difference in BMI of 1.26 kg/ (95% CI 1.02-1.51) between  cases and controls was observed in adults, while a 1.55 kg/ mean difference (95% CI 1.13-1.98) was observed in children. The observational association was confirmed in UK Biobank and HUNT data sets. Overall, a 1 kg/ increase in BMI was associated with 4% higher odds of  (meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.04; P = 1.73 × 10(-60)). MR analyses provided evidence that higher BMI causally increases the odds of  (by 9% per 1 unit increase in BMI; OR = 1.09 (1.06-1.12) per 1 kg/; P = 4.67 × 10(-9)). In contrast, MR estimates gave little support to a possible causal effect of  genetic risk on BMI (0.004 kg/ change in BMI per doubling odds of  (-0.003 to 0.011). Limitations of our study include possible misreporting of  by patients, as well as potential misdiagnosis by clinicians. In addition, there is also limited ethnic variation in the cohorts studied.Our study, using genetic variants as instrumental variables for BMI, provides evidence that higher BMI leads to a higher risk of .

Its mode of action is identical to that of 1-25 vitamin D3 (calcitriol), essentially by regulating the activity of genes capable of responding to vitamin D. Calcipotriol leads to reduction in keratinocyte proliferation and induces their differentiation as well as having important immunomodulator functions. Toxicology studies have demonstrated that phosphorus calcium metabolism anomalies are only observed for doses above those recommended for clinical use (100 g per week). The half-life of Calcipotriol is much shorter than that of calcitriol and its metabolites are inactive. The effects of Calcipotriol on phosphorus calcium metabolism are much less pronounced than those of calcitriol. Therapeutic trials in  have demonstrated the superiority of Calcipotriol over its excipient, class 2 dermatocorticoids, and reducers. Given in combination with phototherapy, cyclosporin or retinoids, Calcipotriol provides more complete improvement in lesions and allows a reduction in the cumulative doses of these treatments. Calcipotriol is effective in certain keratinization disorders (ichtyoses) as well as in localized sclerodermia and vitiligo, although the effect is less certain for the latter conditions. At recommended doses, adverse effects are limited to skin reactions with lesional and perilesional irritation in about 20 p. 100 of the cases. Contact dermatitis is rare. Photosensitivization can be observed when Calcipotriol is applied in patients undergoing UVB phototherapy. The marketing approval in France includes indications for  not involving more than 40 p. 100 of the skin surface. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Calcipotriol in children using the dose of 50 g per week per  body surface area. Contraindications include hypercalcemia, pregnancy and nursing. Three formulations are available (salve, cream, and lotion, all at 0.005 p. 100 concentration) for different administration schemes: two applications per day, alternative applications with dermocorticoid or in combination with systemic treatment for .

However, the role of IL-35 in  remains unclear. In this study, we assessed IL-35 in three well-known  models: a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), a keratin 14 (K14)-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)-transgenic (Tg) mouse model, and an imiquimod-induced  mouse model. First, we found that IL-35 suppressed the expression of IL-6, CXCL8, and S100A7, which are highly upregulated by a mixture of five proinflammatory cytokines in HaCaT. Second, a plasmid coding for the human IL-35 sequence coated with cationic liposomes showed potent immunosuppressive effects on K14-VEGF-A-Tg and imiquimod-induced  mouse models. In the K14-VEGF-A-Tg model, our results showed that several types of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced, whereas IL-10 was remarkably induced by IL-35. Compared with pcDNA3.1, there was a small number of CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells and a large number of CD4(+)IL-10(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in the IL-35 group. Most importantly, we found that IL-35 decreased the total number of macrophages and ratio of M1/ macrophages, which has not been reported previously. In addition, compared with dexamethasone, IL-35 showed long-term therapeutic efficacy. In summary, our results strongly indicate that IL-35 plays a potent immunosuppressive role in . Thus, IL-35 has potential for development as a new therapeutic strategy for patients with chronic  and other cutaneous inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600542>Decreased expression of response gene to complement 32 in  and its association with reduced  macrophage polarization.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1467290>Sustained renal function loss in  patients after withdrawal of low-dose cyclosporin therapy.</a></h2><p>Eight patients with  received low-dose cyclosporin (CyA) treatment for an average period of 12 months (range 4-16 months). There was great variability in minimal effective CyA dose. In 50% of the patients long-term treatment was limited by dose reductions necessitated by side-effects. A considerable impairment of renal function during CyA therapy was found.

TNF-α is mainly produced by macrophages. However, how macrophage polarization contributes to  remains unknown.We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of macrophage polarization in .8 patients with moderate to severe  (Male/Female: 4/4, average age: 47.9 years old) and 8 healthy controls (Male/Female: 4/4, average age: 49.3 years old) were recruited. Their peripheral CD14+ monocytes were isolated with magnetic beads and then were differentiated into macrophages. The differential macrophage polarization was compared among normal controls, psoriatic patients before and after TNF-α inhibitors. The U937 cells were used to investigate the mechanisms by which TNF-α altered the macrophage polarization.The ratio of M1 to M2a macrophage polarization was higher in psoriatic patients comparing with that in controls. The decreasing M1/M2a ratio was parallel to decreasing PASI severity score after adalimumab treatment. Consistently, TNF-α blockage decreased M1/M2a ratio in U937 cells. The induction of STAT1 and IRF-1 in polarized U937 M1 cells was inhibited by TNF-α inhibitor. However, STAT1 and/or IRF-1 interference could not resume M1 polarization. In skin, the increased M1 and  infiltration in lesions returned to baseline after successful treatment with TNF-α inhibitor.Increased M1 polarization is associated with higher disease severity in , resuming to baseline after successful treatment by TNF-α inhibitors.

The effects of low-dose cyclosporin (< 5 mg/kg body weight) on liver function and serum lipids and lipoproteins were examined in 40 normolipidaemic, normotensive  patients with normal renal function. After 3 months of treatment, serum cholesterol and bilirubin concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly (p = 0.001), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declined from 107 to 96 ml/min/1.73  (p = 0.05). All these values returned to pretreatment levels 3 months after cessation of cyclosporin. In 15 patients in whom lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation, there was an increase in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p = 0.05), but very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol concentrations did not change. The increases in serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase activity and LDL cholesterol, seen in individuals with normal baseline liver and renal function, which reverted to baseline following cessation of cyclosporin, suggest that cyclosporin-induced hypercholesterolaemia may be due to either decreased biliary excretion of cholesterol or impaired catabolism of LDL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25710874>A Population- and Hospital-based Cross-sectional Study of Renal Function in Hidradenitis Suppurativa.</a></h2><p>The chronic inflammatory skin diseases hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and  have been linked to cardiovascular risk factors and the latter has also been linked to possible renal dysfunction. Since basement membrane thinning in the skin of HS patients has been described, we speculated whether similar basement membrane defects might occur in renal tissue.

We performed a hospital and population-based cross-sectional study using estimated Glomerular-Filtration-Rate (eGFR) to assess renal function. Thirty-two hospital individuals with HS, 430 population individuals with HS, and 20,780 population individuals without HS were (controls) identified. The age-, sex-, smoking-, BMI-, hypertension- and diabetes-adjusted analysis revealed a statistically significant higher eGFR for the hospital group with HS and a mean difference in eGFR of 6.81 (1.27-12.35) ml/min/1.73  between the hospital group with HS and the population group without HS.

PAP-1 (5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen), a potent small-molecule blocker of the voltage-gated potassium Kv1.3 channel, is currently in preclinical development for . This study was undertaken to identify the major phase I metabolites of PAP-1 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 2. Five phase I metabolites, that is 5-(oxybutyric-acid)psoralen (M1), 5-[4-(4-hydroxybutoxy)]psoralen (), 5-[4-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)butoxy]psoralen (M3), 5-[4-(3-hydroxyphenoxy)butoxy]psoralen (M4), and 8-hydroxyl-5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (M5), were isolated from the bile of rats and identified by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The last four metabolites are new compounds. 3. Incubation of PAP-1 with SD rat liver microsomes rendered the same five major metabolites in a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent manner suggesting that cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in PAP-1 metabolism. Inhibitors of rat CYP1A1/2 (alpha-naphthoflavone) and CYP3A (ketoconazole) but not CYP2D6 (quinidine), CYP2E (diethyldithiocarbamate), or CYP2C9 (sulphaphenazole) blocked the metabolism of PAP-1 in rat microsomes. 4. Of the five metabolites M3, M4, and M5 were found to inhibit Kv1.3 currents with nanomolar IC50s, while M1 and  were inactive. Our results identified the Kv1.3-inactive M1 as the major phase I metabolite, and suggest that hydroxylation and O-dealkylation are the major pathways of PAP-1 metabolism. 5. We further conducted a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study with PAP-1 at 50 mg/kg in both male and female Lewis rats and did not observe any toxic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11702369>Bexarotene.</a></h2><p>Bexarotene is a selective retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist. It binds to, and activates RXRs which function as ligand-activated transcription factors that control gene expression. This leads to modulation of cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. In patients with refractory or persistent early stage cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), the overall response rate was 54% after oral bexarotene 300 mg//day. The overall response rate in patients with refractory or persistent advanced stage CTCL was 45% at the same dosage. An overall response rate of 63% was reported after topical bexarotene 0.1 to 1% twice daily in patients with early stage CTCL. Another trial reported an overall response rate of 44% after topical bexarotene 1% once daily escalated up to 4 times daily. Plaque elevation was significantly reduced, and the severity of moderate to severe  was substantially improved in patients receiving oral bexarotene 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day. At clinically relevant oral dosages, bexarotene significantly decreases levels of serum thyrotropin and free thyroxine. The most common adverse events associated with oral bexarotene are hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, central hypothyroidism and headache. Reversible acute pancreatitis has occurred during oral bexarotene therapy.

Doses were ascending (300, 600, 900, 1,200 mg/), and after the first 3 patients, doses were started at 600 mg/ and increased. Multiple blood samples were obtained after each 5-FU dose and plasma 5-FU concentration determined by HPLC. Response was determined by clinical assessment of skin thickening, redness, and scaling on upper and lower body and quantified as percent improvement. Among all patients total dose and total area under the plasma 5-FU concentration-time curve (AUC) was significantly related (r = 0.65; p less than 0.01). In contrast no relationship between either total 5-FU dose and response (r = -0.07) or AUC and response (r = -0.08) was identified. With each individual patient, total 5-FU dose and response were well correlated in 11 of 14 patients (r = 0.96, 0.92, 0.92, 0.97, 0.78, 0.85, 0.71, 0.89, 0.96, 0.76, 0.94) and less well related in 3 of 14 (r = 0.57, 0.51, 0.15).

The relationship of the 5-FU dose and AUC was nonlinear with normalized dose: AUC 1.0 at the lowest dose for each patient, at 1.5 dose AUC was 3.4 times baseline, at 2.0 dose AUC was 5.3 times baseline, and at 3.0 dose AUC was 36 times baseline. In patients with recalcitrant  5-FU is consistently absorbed into the systemic circulation with extent of absorption increased with increasing dose in a nonlinear manner.

As shown in experimental animals, which led to pilot clinical studies, elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes can be accomplished with high-dose chemoradiotherapy, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, by re-establishment of unresponsiveness to self antigens of newly generated lymphocytes, due to a mechanism of central clonal deletion. We hypothesized that self-reactive lymphocytes causing autoimmune disease may be successfully eliminated by highly immunosuppressive yet not necessarily myeloablative conditioning in conjunction with allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation, since immunocompetent alloreactive lymphocytes of donor origin can effectively eliminate residual host-type hematopoietic cells, self-reactive lymphocytes included, by a mechanism that resembles graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effects. The present report is an attempt to confirm the existence of graft-vs-autoimmunity (GVA) effects in parallel with amplification of the alloreactive potential of donor lymphocytes following allogeneic non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST).We identified a patient with severe psoriatic arthritis who also had Philadelphia (bcr/abl) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and therefore was fully eligible for NST. Both diseases responded initially to non-myeloablative conditioning involving fludarabine 30 mg/ x 6, anti-T-lymphocyte globulin 10 mg/kg X 4, and busulfan 4 mg/kg x 2.The initial NST procedure was uneventful and resulted in elimination of all signs of autoimmunity ( and arthritis). Recurrence of polyarthritis and exacerbation of  were observed in parallel with a significant increase in the proportion of male (host) DNA, and 5% of the mitoses were bcr/abl positive, indicating an increase in the clone of CML. Both bcr/abl-positive cells identified by RT-PCR and psoriatic arthritis were successfully eliminated following discontinuation of anti-GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine A (CSA), which resulted in activation of the alloreactive potential of donor T cells, accompanied by graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), suggesting the existence of GVA effects. RT-PCR for bcr/abl remains consistently negative for nearly 3 years, and all DNA remains donor type.The response of autoimmune disease manifestations to GVA effects in parallel with elimination of all host-derived hematopoietic cells supports our working hypothesis that autoimmune diseases caused by self-reactive lymphocytes may be effectively treated by elimination of alloreactive self-reactive lymphocytes following induction of host-vs-graft tolerance, in analogy with replacement of malignant or genetically abnormal host cells following DLI. It is therefore suggested that intentional GVA effects may be inducible by DLI following a conventional or preferably safer non-myeloablative regimen in recipients with life-threatening autoimmune diseases resistant to conventional modalities. Adoptive immunotherapy of autoimmunity may thus involve a two-step procedure: first, inducing host-vs-graft and graft-vs-host transplantation tolerance through a transient stage of mixed chimerism; second, inducing controlled GVA effects, initially by discontinuation of CSA and then, if indicated, by late outpatient DLI to eradicate residual hematopoietic cells of host origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9112426>Translocation t(7;11)(P15;P15) in a patient with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia following bimolane and ICRF-154 treatment for .</a></h2><p>The t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation is an uncommon balanced aberration which has been found predominantly in Orientals, frequently presenting as de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and occasionally as chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic crisis.

By combining the suction blister technique with studies on labelled albumin and inulin, the intra- and extravascular fluid volumes, the leakage of albumin from the total and the skin microvasculature, and the intra- and extravascular masses of albumin were measured before and after therapy. In accordance with previous studies, a shift of fluid from the intra- to the extravascular spaces, an increased leakiness of the involved skin microvasculature, and a lowered total mass of body albumin were found before therapy. Treatment induced a minor increase of the extracellular fluid volume [mean, 6.20 +/- 1.16 l/ (SD) v. 6.73 +/- 0.95 l/ (SD), P less than 0.1], a reduced vascular leakage of albumin from the involved skin vessels, and a significant increase of the total mass of albumin [mean, 124 +/- 20 g/ (SD) v. 139 +/- 30 g/ (SD), P less than 0.05]. The other measured variables did not change significantly. It is suggested that the observed change in extracellular fluid volume was mainly due to a treatment-induced decrease of the transepidermal water loss and/or a subclinical oedema of the skin, whereas the increase in total albumin mass was due to a reduction of the catabolism of the endogenous albumin caused by the decrease in the microvascular leakiness of the involved skin vessels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1434747>Specific chromosomal translocations and therapy-related leukemia induced by bimolane therapy for .</a></h2><p>This paper reports for the first time results of cytogenetic studies on 14 consecutive secondary acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (S-ANLL) induced by bimolane therapy.

As occlusion and hyperthermia caused by the suit can inhibit scaling, the objectives of the present study were to design an alternative method to measure the amount of scale lost, to estimate the protein content of the scale, and to propose suitable recommendations for protein supplementation.In 40 patients with ED, the total protein content lost through scaling per day (P) was determined by the following equation: P = TxIxYxX/25x10(4) g, where T is the total body surface area in square meters, I is the percentage area involved in scaling, estimated using computer-aided design (CAD graph), Y is the amount of scale lost per unit area (0.0025 ) in milligrams, and X is the quantity of protein present in 1 g of scale in milligrams estimated by a spectrophotometer.It was observed that patients with ED secondary to drug reactions, eczema, and  lost 7.2, 9.6, and 22.6 g of scale with a protein content of 4.2, 5.6, and 12.8 g respectively. The difference in the amount of protein lost in ED secondary to drug reactions and eczema was not statistically significant; however, the protein lost in  was significant (p < 0.01 to p < 0.05).ED may increase the daily protein loss by approximately 25-30% in  and 10-15% in other causes.

Five patients with extensive  and no significant preexisting renal disease were treated with oral cyclosporine (average dosage, 5 mg/kg per day; average duration of treatment, 9 weeks). Changes in serum creatinine measurements made immediately before and at the end of treatment were compared with changes in glomerular filtration rate as determined by 125I-iothalamate clearance. During treatment, the average serum creatinine value only increased from 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 mg/dl (+/- standard deviation), whereas iothalamate-based estimates of glomerular infiltration rate decreased from 100 +/- 22 to 63 +/- 37 ml/min/1.73  (p less than 0.02). Simultaneous 125I-iothalamate and 24-hour creatinine clearances were obtained in two patients at the end of treatment and at 2 weeks after cyclosporine therapy. Glomerular filtration rates determined by iothalamate clearance were 14% to 30% lower than those calculated by 24-hour creatinine clearances. Neither serum creatinine measurements nor creatinine clearances (whether calculated or measured) accurately reflect the cyclosporine-induced decline in renal function as determined by glomerular filtration rate. In contrast, 125I-iothalamate clearance is a more accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate, which provides a sensitive marker for monitoring potential cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7861719>A prospective study of renal structure and function in  patients treated with cyclosporin.</a></h2><p>The impact of long-term cyclosporin therapy on kidney structure and function was evaluated in  patients with normal baseline renal function.

In this exploratory analysis, the efficacy of adalimumab was evaluated in a subset of the CHAMPION patient population stratified by baseline body mass index (BMI).PASI responses and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores through 16 weeks of treatment were examined by baseline BMI category (<25 kg/ [normal], 25 to <30 kg/ [overweight], and ≥30 kg/ [obese]) in patients with  with a baseline PASI total score ≥12. Treatment differences between the adalimumab and the methotrexate or placebo groups were compared using Fisher's exact test for PASI responses and 1-way analysis of variance for DLQI scores.In all BMI categories, adalimumab treatment led to significantly greater rates of PASI75/90 responses at weeks 12 and 16 compared with methotrexate or placebo (P<0.05 for all). In normal weight, overweight, and obese patients at week 16, the respective PASI75 response rates were 85.0%, 85.7%, and 61.3% with adalimumab; 43.3%, 29.3%, and 26.1% with methotrexate; and 28.6%, 16.7%, and 0% with placebo.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether this differential infiltration with macrophage subsets was associated with a different local inflammatory milieu in SpA as compared with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).The effect of SpA and RA synovial fluid (SF) on macrophage polarization was tested in vitro on normal peripheral blood monocytes. SF levels of classically activated macrophage (M1)-derived and alternatively activated macrophage ()-derived mediators were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and multiparameter Luminex bead assay in 47 patients with non-psoriatic SpA, 55 with RA, and 15 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Paired synovial biopsy samples were analyzed histologically.SF from SpA patients promoted preferential expression of the  markers CD163 and CD200R in vitro, even if SF levels of the prototypical -polarizing factors (interleukin-4 [IL-4], IL-13, and IL-10) were not increased as compared with those in RA SF. Despite a similar degree of overall joint inflammation in SpA and RA, SpA synovitis displayed strongly reduced SF levels of M1-derived, but not -derived, mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), IL-1beta, IL-12p70, and interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10. SF levels of M1-derived mediators correlated well with peripheral joint inflammation in RA, but neither these mediators nor IL-1alpha and IL-17 did so in SpA. Of interest, the SF cytokine profile in PsA, a more destructive subtype of SpA, was similar to that in non-psoriatic SpA.The local inflammatory milieu is clearly different in SpA as compared with RA peripheral arthritis.

We performed two studies to define its activity against metastatic breast cancer. The first study was a phase II study in 14 patients with metastatic breast cancer who had received two or fewer chemotherapy treatments. The treatment schedule was tricirbine 20 mg/ per day by 24-h infusion (CI) daily for 5 days every 6 weeks as recommended by a previous open phase I trial. When neither response nor toxicity was seen in the phase II trial, we assumed the starting dose was too low for this group of patients with good performance status and repeated the phase I trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer with good performance status. The starting dose was 35 mg/ per day using the same 5-day CI schedule, and starting doses were increased in subsequent cohorts of three patients in increments of 5 mg/ until toxicity occurred. In the initial (phase II) study, one patient had stable disease for 18 weeks (three courses), the remainder progressed. There were no significant toxic effects. In the subsequent phase I study, ten patients were treated until the study was closed. The maximum dose was 40 mg/. Two patients died, one each at the 35 and 40 mg/ levels, respectively, 3 months and 6 weeks after their last course, one without intervening disease progression. Both had severe hypertriglyceridemia (18- and 21-fold elevation) and severe fatigue. At postmortem examination, one had congestive cardiomyopathy, and the other had severe pancreatitis and hypothyroidism. One patient had severe exacerbation of  which made her bedridden for more than 30 days. Four patients had hyperglycemia. Plasma pharmacology studies showed erratic drug levels, presumably related to enterohepatic circulation.

RA activity by disease activity score 28, IR by HOMA2-IR, body composition by impedance analysis, physical activity by accelerometry, abdominal fat distribution by magnetic resonance imaging, and serum level of key adipokines by ELISA were measured at baseline and during a 1-year follow-up period. Patient body mass index increased significantly (26.94 ± 3.88 vs. 28.06 ± 4.57 kg/, p=0.02) after 1 year of treatment. Body composition, in terms of fat and fat-free mass, remained unchanged except for a significant elevation in body cell mass (25.50 ± 4.60 vs. 26.60 ± 3.17 kg, p=0.02). Basal levels of IR in the RA patients included in this study were significantly higher than healthy controls (1.6 ± 0.8 vs. 1.11 ± 0.56, p=0.011) but did not change during the follow-up.

Through bioinformatics analyses of a comprehensive database of gene expression (BIGE: Body Index of Gene Expression) we observed that a small secreted protein encoded by a poorly characterized gene called meteorin-like (METRNL), is highly expressed in mucosal tissues, skin and activated macrophages. Further studies indicate that Metrnl is produced by Alternatively Activated Macrophages (AAM) and M-CSF cultured bone marrow macrophages (-like macrophages). In the skin, METRNL is expressed by resting fibroblasts and IFNγ-treated keratinocytes. A screen of human skin-associated diseases showed significant over-expression of METRNL in , prurigo nodularis, actinic keratosis and atopic dermatitis. METRNL is also up-regulated in synovial membranes of human rheumatoid arthritis. Taken together, these results indicate that Metrnl represents a novel cytokine, which is likely involved in both innate and acquired immune responses.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

There are studies on the dosage for 'sparing' application relevant to topical steroids but not for 'liberal' application. Though calcipotriol is a first line topical treatment for , approximately one-third of patients do not respond adequately. The aims of the present study were to define liberal dosage, to develop a method of calculation of area of involved skin and to evaluate the efficacy of calcipotriol in optimized liberal dosages, based on preliminary studies, in calcipotriol treatment failures. Weight/unit area of ointment and cream base, constituting liberal application, was determined in six normal volunteers. The area of psoriatic involvement in 24 calcipotriol non-responders was estimated by a 'fill-up' method and a modified 'hand' method. The results of the two methods were similar (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.68, P < 0.0001) but the 'hand' method proved easier in use and was the preferred method for the rest of the study. The patients applied calcipotriol at their accustomed rates for at least 2 weeks and then at the calculated liberal rates, using cream in the morning and ointment at night, for 4 weeks. The efficacy measures were  Area and Severity Index (PASI) (primary measure), a four-point efficacy score and a visual analogue scale. As a result of the preliminary study and the actual amounts used by the patients in the  treatment study reported below, liberal application has been defined as 50 g/ per application for ointment base and 40 g/ per application for cream. At this dosage, an average individual would use approximately 100 g of medication/week to treat 10% of the body surface. During the 4-week treatment study, the  patients used an average of 39 g (SD 17 g)/ per application of cream and 52 g (SD 13 g)/ per application of ointment.

Hypertension was observed in 28/63 (44.44%) patients with PPP. Eight (12.7%) had ischaemic heart disease, and 7/63 (11.11%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. There was no statistically significant difference between the patients with PPP and those in the control group. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 19/63 (30.16%) patients with PPP and in 12/37 (32.43%) patients with PSV. Thyroid disease was more prevalent among patients with PPP in comparison to patients with PSV (31.75% vs. 13.51%; p=0.0421). Body mass index was statistically significantly higher in patients with PSV (28.25 vs. 25.86 kg/m², p=0.0144).

Inappropriate and excessive activation of endosomal Toll-like receptors 7, 8, and 9 (TLRs 7-9) at the psoriatic site has been shown to play a pathogenic role in the onset of . Macrophage is a major inflammatory cell type that can be differentiated into phenotypes M1 and . M1 macrophages produce proinflammatory cytokines, and  macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines. The balance between these two types of macrophages determines the progression of various inflammatory diseases; however, whether macrophage polarization plays a role in psoriatic inflammation activated by endosomal TLRs has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of macrophages related to the pathogenic role of TLRs 7-9 in the progression of . Analysis of clinical data in database revealed significantly increased expression of macrophage markers and inflammatory cytokines in psoriatic tissues over those in normal tissues. In animal studies, depletion of macrophages in mice ameliorated imiquimod, a TLR 7 agonist-induced psoriatic response. Imiquimod induced expression of genes and cytokines that are signature of M1 macrophage in the psoriatic lesions. In addition, treatment with this TLR 7 agonist shifted macrophages in the psoriatic lesions to a higher M1/ ratio. Both of the exogenous and endogenous TLR 7-9 ligands activated M1 macrophage polarization. M1 macrophages expressed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and TLRs 7-9 than  macrophages. These results suggest that by rendering macrophages into a more inflammatory status and capable of response to their ligands in the psoriatic sites, TLR 7-9 activation drives them to participate in endosomal TLR-activated psoriatic inflammation, resulting in an amplified inflammatory response. Our results also suggest that blocking M1 macrophage polarization could be a strategy which enables inhibition of psoriatic inflammation activated by these TLRs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28209630>Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) reduces dermal fibrosis by interfering with the release of interleukin-6 from  macrophages.</a></h2><p>To investigate the disease-modifying effects of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibition in preclinical models of systemic sclerosis (SSc).We studied the effects of PDE4 inhibition in a prevention and a treatment model of bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis, in the topoisomerase mouse model as well as in a model of sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease. To better understand the mode of action of PDE4 blockade in preclinical models of SSc, we investigated fibrosis-relevant mediators in fibroblasts and macrophages from healthy individuals and patients suffering from diffuse-cutaneous SSc on blockade of PDE4.Specific inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram and apremilast had potent antifibrotic effects in bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis models, in the topoisomerase I mouse model and in murine sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease. Fibroblasts were not the direct targets of the antifibrotic effects of PDE4 blockade. Reduced leucocyte infiltration in lesional skin on PDE4 blockade suggested an immune-mediated mechanism. Further analysis revealed that PDE4 inhibition decreased the differentiation of  macrophages and the release of several profibrotic cytokines, resulting in reduced fibroblast activation and collagen release. Within these profibrotic mediators, interleukin-6 appeared to play a central role.PDE4 inhibition reduces inflammatory cell activity and the release of profibrotic cytokines from  macrophages, leading to decreased fibroblast activation and collagen release. Importantly, apremilast is already approved for the treatment of  and psoriatic arthritis. Therefore, PDE4 inhibitors might be further developed as potential antifibrotic therapies for patients with SSc. Our findings suggest that particularly patients with inflammation-driven fibrosis might benefit from PDE4 blockade.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Although IL-17A is critically involved in the pathogenesis of , the contribution of IL-17E remains unknown. Here we show that IL-17E(+) cells are more abundant than IL-17A(+) cells in lesional psoriatic skin. IL-17E synthesis is increased in keratinocytes within psoriatic plaques, and macrophages having a mixed M1/ phenotype represent an important proportion of the IL-17E(+) cells infiltrating the dermis. Mechanistically, macrophages do not synthetize but rather take up IL-17E via receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro polarized in , but not M1, express the IL-17E receptor and respond to IL-17E by preferentially producing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment. Remarkably, IL-17E expression in lesional psoriatic skin correlates with the number of neutrophils while being inversely proportional to the number of infiltrating T cells. These data provide strong evidence for a proinflammatory role of keratinocyte-derived IL-17E in , possibly via macrophage activation.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patients were treated with doses of 0.01 to 0.25 mg/ daily (five out of seven days) for four weeks, or 0.25 mg/ three times weekly for one week with escalation to 0.5 mg/ for the subsequent seven weeks. Some patients treated with the 0.25-mg/ dose showed improvement coincident with their therapy. Although recombinant interferon gamma may have some therapeutic activity in certain patients' , the magnitude of this effect is at best small. This result is in contrast to interferon alfa, which has been reported to cause an exacerbation of this disease. Staining of posttreatment biopsy specimens with a monoclonal antibody against HLA-DR antigen using an immunoperoxidase technique demonstrated HLA-DR expression by keratinocytes in some of the patients treated at the higher doses. No obvious correlation was seen between clinical improvement of the  and intensity or extent of HLA-DR antigen expression by keratinocytes in the skin biopsy specimens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483125>Cutaneous Leukemic Infiltrates Successfully Treated With Biomodulatory Therapy in a Rare Case of Therapy-Related High Risk MDS/AML.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous manifestations in hematologic malignancies, especially in leukemia, are not common and may be very variable. Here we report a very unusual case of a patient (female, 70 years old) who was admitted to the hospital in 2016 because of skin lesions on the face, the trunk of the body and the extremities. She had a history of breast cancer in the year 2004 (pT1b, pN0, cM0, L0, V0, R0) which had been resected and treated with adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracile) as well as  treated with methotrexate and cyclosporine. Because of mild cytopenia a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy was performed showing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with multilineage dysplasia. Cytogenetic review revealed a complex aberrant karyotype denoting adverse outcome. Simultaneously, a skin biopsy could confirm leukemic skin infiltration. Consequently, a therapy with azacitidine was started. After the first cycle the patient developed severe pancytopenia with a percentage of 13% peripheral blasts (previously 0-2%) as well as fever without evidence for infection which was interpreted as progressive disease. Therefore, the therapeutic regimen was changed to a biomodulatory therapy consisting of low-dose azacitidine 75 mg/day (given sc d1-7 of 28), pioglitazone 45 mg/day per os, and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 45 mg//day per os. After cycle 1 of this combined biomodulatory therapy the patient showed hematologic recovery; besides a mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl) she developed a normal blood count. Moreover, the cutaneous leukemic infiltrates which had been unaffected by the azacitidine ameliorated tremendously after 2 cycles resulting in a complete remission of the skin lesions after cycle 6. In conclusion, we report a very unusual case with cutaneous infiltrates being the first clinical manifestation of hematologic disease, preceding the development of acute myeloid leukemia. While azacitidine alone was ineffective, a combined biomodulatory approach resulted in a complete remission of the cutaneous manifestation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21428963>Inflammation: a role for NR4A orphan nuclear receptors?</a></h2><p>Inflammation is paradoxical; it is essential for protection following biological, chemical or physical stimuli, but inappropriate or misdirected inflammation is responsible for tissue injury in a variety of inflammatory diseases. The polarization of immune cells is critical in controlling the stages of inflammatory response. The acute phase of inflammation is characterized by a T-lymphocyte:Th2 cytokine profile and involves a co-ordinated migration of immune cells to the site of injury where production of cytokines and acute-phase proteins brings about healing. However, persistent inflammation can result in inappropriate and prolonged T-lymphocyte:Th1 cytokine-mediated action and reaction of self-molecules, leading to a chronic phase in diseases such as RA (rheumatoid arthritis), Ps () and atherosclerosis. The inflammatory response is also controlled by activated macrophage cells, with classically activated (M1) cells producing a wide variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, while alternatively activated () macrophages participate in anti-inflammatory response. Members of the NR4A subfamily (NR4A1/NUR77, NR4A2/NURR1 and NR4A3/NOR1) of orphan NRs (nuclear receptors) have emerged as key transcriptional regulators of cytokine and growth factor action in diseases affecting our aging population. As ligand-independent and constitutively active receptors, the activity of these transcription factors is tightly controlled at the level of expression, post-translational modification and subcellular localization. NR4A subfamily members are aberrantly expressed in inflamed human synovial tissue, psoriatic skin, atherosclerotic lesions, lung and colorectal cancer cells. Significantly, prolonged or inappropriate inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In activated cells, NR4A receptors are rapidly and potently induced, suggesting that these receptors may act as important transcriptional mediators of inflammatory signals. NR4A receptors may contribute to the cellular processes that control inflammation, playing a critical part in the contribution of chronic inflammation or they may have a protective role, where they may mediate pro-resolution responses. Here, we will review the contribution of the NR4A orphan NRs to integration of cytokine signalling in inflammatory disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1660907>Inhibition of 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [12(S)-HETE] binding to epidermal cells by ultraviolet-B.</a></h2><p>12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), the main eicosanoid in skin, is assumed to have both pathophysiologic effects in inflammatory skin diseases such as  and atopic eczema and a physiologic role in the biology of cutaneous reparative processes. Because 12-HETE exerts its effects via specific high-affinity epidermal receptors, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) is capable of modulating various cell-surface molecules, the effects of single and repeated UV-B irradiations on the 12(S)-HETE binding sites in a human epidermal cell line, SCL-II, were studied. UV-B (100-300 J/) induced a large decrease in 12(S)-HETE binding in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition occurred after a latency period of 6 h, reached its maximum at 18 h and slowly declined thereafter. A single UV-B dose of 300 J/ or repeated irradiation with 50 J/ of UV-B resulted in a 70% decrease in the number of binding sites (Bmax), whereas receptor affinity remained unaffected. The modulation of epidermal 12-HETE receptors by UV-B may partly explain the therapeutic effects of UV-B, but possibly also contribute to photodamage to skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1869645>Response to tumor necrosis factor in two cases of .</a></h2><p>A 70-year-old woman was treated for renal cell carcinoma with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, 450,000 U/ of body surface area, daily for 5 days, once a month.

An anemia consistent with a disturbance in rbc production was seen in most patients. Other toxic effects included stomatitis, rash, and myelosuppression. No complete or partial responses were noted, but two patients with alveolar cell carcinoma of the lung each had stable disease for 12 months. Most of the patients in this study tolerated the weekly dosage schedule well with only minimal myelosuppression, suggesting that this agent and schedule might be acceptable for use in combination chemotherapy. Several theoretic reasons favor the use of pyrazofurin in this manner.

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients achieving more than 75% change of the  area and severity index (PASI 75) from baseline. A longitudinal Emax model was established using the NONMEM method, and then applied to try to find an appropriate dose for following trials.In the final time-dose-response model, the primary outcome at week 6 of PASI 75 of the 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% benvitimod cream was 31%, 63%, and 75%, respectively, demonstrating that the 1.0% benvitimod cream was an appropriate dose for the next trial. The time parameters of ET50 and ET90 were 15 and 69 days for 1.0% benvitimod cream, indicating that the maximum efficacy of PASI change rate was obtained at approximately week 10. The accuracy of PASI change rate by extrapolation prediction was limited at week 10, so the treatment period should be longer in future trials.The established dose-response model could well describe the relationship between PASI change rate and doses of benvitimod cream in patients with mild and moderate  vulgaris. This modeling approach may help choose 1.0% benvitimod cream twice daily as a dosage regimen in following clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26062958>Increased Prevalence of Advanced Liver Fibrosis in Patients with : A Cross-sectional Analysis from the Rotterdam Study.</a></h2><p>Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increased in patients with .

We evaluated potential risk factors for incident gout in a nested case-control study with 50,000 controls frequency-matched by age, sex and calendar time. We calculated odds ratios (OR) by means of unconditional logistic regression adjusting for demographic variables, lifestyle variables, relevant medical conditions and drug exposures.The incidence of gout per 1,000 person-years was 2.68 (4.42 in men and 1.32 in women) and increased with age. Conventional risk factors were significantly and strongly associated with the risk of gout, with multivariate ORs of 3.00 (95% confidence interval (CI)) for excessive alcohol intake (that is, more than 42 units per week), 2.34 (95% CI 2.22 to 2.47) for obesity (body mass index > = 30 kg/), 2.48 (95% CI 2.19 to 2.81) for chronic renal impairment, and 3.00 (95% CI 2.85 to 3.15) for current diuretic use.

In this study, we investigated the effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and interleukin (IL)-17A on the activation of macrophages in in vivo mouse skin. We examined whether macrophages are activated in the skin of imiquimod (IMQ)-treated mice, a model for IL-17A-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation, and flaky-tail (Flg  ) mice, a model for IL-17A-induced chronic atopic dermatitis-like skin inflammation. LPS and IL-17A independently increased the expression levels of iNOS, CX3CR1, CD206, phospho-STAT1 and phospho-STAT3 proteins in the skin of B6 mice, and the effects of LPS was not altered by IL-17A. The expression levels of these proteins were increased in the skin of IMQ-treated and Flg  mice. IL-17A neutralization increased the expressions of iNOS and phospho-STAT1 in the IMQ-treated skin, but it decreased the expressions of CD206 and phospho-STAT3 proteins in the skin of Flg  mice, suggesting that macrophages to change from the  to the M1 state in the skin of these mice.

S100A8 is a low-molecular-weight calcium-binding protein, highly sensitive to oxidation. In this study, UVA-induced S100A8 expression by keratinocytes was investigated. UVA (50-100 kJ per ) strongly induced S100A8 in differentiated keratinocytes in the epidermis of BALB/c mice. Similarly, S100A8 mRNA and monomeric protein were significantly upregulated in PAM212 cells (a murine keratinocyte cell line) in response to 10 kJ per  UVA 24 h after irradiation. Although S100A9 associates with S100A8 in neutrophils and abnormally differentiated keratinocytes (human ), in this study it was not coinduced with keratinocyte S100A8. Dorsal application of 4-hydroxy-tempo (a superoxide dismutase-mimicking agent) to mice concentration-dependently reduced UVA-induced S100A8 expression. Incubation of PAM212 cells with superoxide dismutase and catalase during UVA irradiation also abrogated S100A8 induction.

Because pro-inflammatory macrophages have also been shown to overexpress a receptor for the vitamin folic acid (i.e., folate receptor beta; FR-β), folate-linked drugs have been explored for use in imaging and treatment of these same diseases. To determine whether allergic inflammatory disorders might be similarly targeted with folate-linked drugs, we have examined the characteristics of macrophages that are prominent in the pathogenesis of asthma. We report here that macrophages from the lungs of mice with experimental allergic asthma express FR-β. We further document that these FR-β(+) macrophages coexpress markers of alternatively activated (-type) macrophages, including the mannose receptor and arginase-1. Finally, we demonstrate that folate-conjugated fluorescent dyes and radioimaging agents can be specifically targeted to these asthmatic lung macrophages, with little uptake by macrophages present in healthy lung tissue. These data suggest strategies for the development of novel diagnostic agents for the imaging of asthma and other diseases involving alternatively activated macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15479606> remission after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity.</a></h2><p> is a chronic skin disease characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and an accelerated rate of epithelial turnover affecting approximately 1-3% of the population.

Macrophages are roughly categorized into two different subsets named inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory  macrophages. We herein identified a unique pathogenic macrophage subpopulation driven by IL-23 with a distinct gene expression profile including defined types of cytokines. The freshly isolated resting mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with different cytokines in vitro, the expression of cytokines and chemokines were detected by microarray, real-time PCR, ELISA and multiple colors flow cytometry. Adoptive transfer of macrophages and imiquimod-induced psoriasis mice were used. In contrast to M1- and -polarized macrophages, IL-23-treated macrophages produce large amounts of IL-17A, IL-22 and IFN-γ. Biochemical and molecular studies showed that IL-23 induces IL-17A expression in macrophages through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-retinoid related orphan receptor-γ T (RORγT) pathway. T-bet mediates the IFN-γ production in IL-23-treated macrophages. Importantly, IL-23-treated macrophages significantly promote the dermatitis pathogenesis in a psoriasis-like mouse model. IL-23-treated resting macrophages express a distinctive gene expression prolife compared with M1 and  macrophages.

In this study, we found PKM2 is highly expressed in melanoma patients and the malignance is positively corelated with high PKM2 activity and glycolytic capability in melanoma cells. Suppression of PKM2 expression by knocking down markedly attenuated malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo, and restoration of PKM2 expression in PKM2 depleted cells could rescue melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and metastasis. With the data indicating PKM2 as a potential therapeutic target, we performed screening for PKM2 inhibitors and identified benserazide (Ben), a drug currently in clinical use. We demonstrated that Ben directly binds to and blocks PKM2 enzyme activity, leading to inhibition of aerobic glycolysis concurrent up-regulation of OXPHOS. Of note, despite PKM2 is very similar to PKM1, Ben does not affect PKM1 enzyme activity. We showed that Ben significantly inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. The specificity of Ben was demonstrated by the findings that, suppression of PKM2 expression diminishes the efficacy of Ben in inhibtion of melanoma cell growth; ectopic PKM2 expression in normal cells sensitizes cells to Ben treatment. Interestingly, PKM2 activity and aerobic glycolysis are up-regulated in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. As a result, BRAFi-resistant cells exhibit a heightened sensitivity to suppression of PKM2 expression or treatment with Ben both in vitro and in vivo. This article is protected by copyright.

At these sites, a membrane integrin can be acquired by virtue of the presence of CD4+ T cells and specific dendritic cells and correlates with a regulatory behavior of these cells. This membrane integrin conjugates the beta7 subunit and the alphaE subunit, also known as CD103. CD103 expression requires high levels of TGF-beta and retinoic acid; in addition, expression of CD103 by T cells requires antigen recognition. Whether CD103 is found in the entheses has not yet been investigated. CD103 is expressed at high levels in the skin, eyes, and bowel but it is found in only very low levels in the bloodstream. CD8+ CD103+ T cells differ markedly from other CD103+ cells in that they are resident cells with no tendency to migrate and usually exert predominantly cytotoxic functions as opposed to regulatory functions. Several bacteria, such as Salmonella, can become dormant within the mucous membranes and/or their lymph nodes, where they use CD103+ dendritic cells and CD4+ CD103+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) to evade the immune response. This phenomenon could be studied in other tissues targeted by spondyloarthritides, where dormant microorganisms can migrate by using  macrophages as Trojan horses, since  macrophages express the CD103 ligand E-cadherin. Microorganism peptide recognition by CD8+ CD103+ T cells (which are overrepresented in  and joint fluid in some forms of spondyloarthritis) induces an inflammatory response that may be sufficient to transiently reverse the regulatory function of the CD103+ dendritic cells and CD4+ CD103+ T cells during disease flares. The sensitivity of these diseases to retinoids further supports a pathogenic role for transient CD103+ cell failure.Copyright © 2014 Société française de rhumatologie. Published by Elsevier SAS.

IL-8 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases such as . In this study, IL-8 mRNA expression and protein production were determined in normal cultured human epidermal keratinocytes after ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation. Messenger RNA levels were determined by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Total RNA was extracted from cultured keratinocytes at various time points post-irradiation, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and amplified by PCR using a labeled specific primer for the target gene. Amplified products were sized by electrophoresis, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by densitometry. Autoradiographs were normalized relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G3PDH) signals. Constitutive expression of IL-8 mRNA was seen in normal cultured keratinocytes. After 100 or 300 J/ UVB irradiation, a rapid increase in IL-8 mRNA level was observed within 1 h after irradiation. At 24 h after irradiation, the mRNA level was elevated 11-13 times compared with the control level. Production of IL-8 protein in culture supernatants was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significant levels of IL-8 protein were observed at 24 h after irradiation. Cycloheximide treatment blocked this IL-8 protein induction. As IL-8 is known to be an inflammatory cell chemotactic factor, these results suggest a possible role for IL-8 in UVB-induced skin inflammation and diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19757693>Lipid profile in patients with  presenting at Liaquat University Hospital Hyderabad.</a></h2><p>To determine the lipid abnormalities in patients with  and compare it with healthy controls.Across-sectional controlled study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology Liaquat University Hospital Hyderabad from January 2007 to November 2007.

The two different methods of dosing were used on consecutive treatment days and the plasma 8-MOP concentration was measured on each occasion 2 h after ingestion of the crystalline form of 8-MOP, given to the nearest 10 mg. Body weight calculated doses ranged from 30 to 60 mg with a significant difference in the plasma 8-MOP concentration between the dose groups, indicating a systematic variation according to the weight of the patient. When calculated according to body surface area, only two doses were used (40 or 50 mg), and there was no significant difference in plasma 8-MOP concentration between the groups.

The precise mechanisms of action, however, are not absolutely clear. Therefore, the effect of PUVA on the release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was studied. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from humans were incubated with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and exposed to UV-A (20 kJ/). This treatment resulted in a significant reduction of IL-6 and IL-8 amounts in the supernatants. In addition, an inhibition of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PBMC was observed upon PUVA treatment. Accordingly, northern blot analysis showed decreased levels of mRNA encoding for IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF alpha in PUVA-treated PBMC. Finally PBMC were obtained from psoriatics undergoing oral photochemotherapy before the beginning and after completion of treatment. The PBMC collected after PUVA spontaneously produced significantly less IL-6 and IL-8 in comparison to the respective samples obtained before therapy. A similar suppression of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha by in vivo PUVA was found in LPS-stimulated PBMC. The present data demonstrate that PUVA both in vitro and in vivo suppresses the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF alpha by PBMC. Because these cytokines are important in the mediation of inflammatory reactions, one may speculate that the inhibitory effects could contribute to the antiinflammatory activity of PUVA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11347392>A system for simultaneous ultraviolet light and electromagnetic field exposure in in vitro experiments.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet light (UV) is a common treatment for skin diseases such as , but bears the risk of carcinogenic side effects. We have biological evidence that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) can act additively with UV so that new therapeutic protocols combining UV and EMF might be developed to improve  phototherapy. In this study we report on a system that allows in vitro experiments testing this hypothesis. For simultaneous exposure of cell cultures to UVB and EMF, we built Merritt coils with an integrated UV exposure system. The coils can be operated in a sham or experimental mode (up to 1.5 mT and 20,000 Hz). Two UV bulbs were fitted inside the coils for UVB doses between 100-1000 J//nm. In the exposure area the EMF is uniform within 0.0038%. For exposure, the cells are cultured in standard culture plates and placed in a specifically designed box. The box holds two plates in a top chamber covered with a Saran Wrap lid (91% UV transmission) so that cells are exposed to UVB and EMFs. The bottom chamber holds two plates, where cells are screened from UVB and only exposed to EMFs. Temperature control is maintained (+/- 1 degree C) by airflow vents on the side of the box and a fan placed 25 cm away from the cell culture box. To maintain sterility within the box the vents are covered with a bacterial filter. The box lid has additional ventilation through two air direction changes to create an additional bacterial barrier similar to that in culture plate lids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26357664> and Diabetes: A Multicenter Study in 222078 Type 2 Diabetes Patients Reveals High Levels of Depression.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the association between  and disease outcome in type 2 diabetes (T2D).222078 T2D patients (≥10 years old) from the prospective, multicenter diabetes patient registry were analyzed.

It has been proposed that regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted protein (RANTES), which is one of the chemokines produced by epidermal keratinocytes, might play an important role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous inflammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis and  vulgaris. This study was designed to determine whether UVB irradiation could affect the production of RANTES that is induced in cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes upon stimulation by inflammatory cytokines. We measured levels of the transcript of the gene for RANTES in cultured keratinocytes and of RANTES itself in culture supernatants by semiquantitative reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), respectively. Neither the transcript nor RANTES itself was detected without prior stimulation of cells by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and/or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and production of RANTES was not induced by UVB (100 J/) irradiation alone. Cells were irradiated with UVB just before addition of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to the medium and then cells and culture supernatants were harvested 12, 24, and 36 h later. In both irradiated and non-irradiated cells, RANTES mRNA was first detected at 12 h and the level increased subsequently. RANTES itself was detected at 24 h, with a higher level at 36 h. At all time points examined, UVB irradiation inhibited the production of RANTES mRNA and of the protein itself. These results suggest that suppression of the production of RANTES by epidermal keratinocytes might be involved in the modulatory effects of UVB irradiation on cutaneous inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27602427>Overweight and Weight Gain Predict  Development in a Population-based Cohort.</a></h2><p>Overweight is a proposed risk factor for .

Two hours after ingestion, serum 8-methoxypsoralen concentration was determined and phototesting was performed at 350 +/- 30 nm (0.45-14 J per cm2). The minimal phototoxic dose at 72 h was recorded, erythema was measured using a reflectance instrument, and dose-response curves were constructed. Each subject was tested on three occasions using doses of 25 mg per  (conventional dose) or conventional dose +/- 10 mg. Median serum 8-methoxypsoralen concentration increased from 96 to 143 to 229 ng per ml with dose increases from conventional dose - 10 mg to conventional dose and conventional dose + 10 mg, respectively (p < 0.001).
