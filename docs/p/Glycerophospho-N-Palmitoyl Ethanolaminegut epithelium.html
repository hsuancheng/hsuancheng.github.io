Dysbiosis of the  microbiota associated with increased intestinal permeability facilitates the passage of endotoxins and other microbial products, including indoxyl sulfate in the circulation. Although an emerging body of evidence has suggested that indoxyl sulfate is a key substance for the development of chronic kidney disease, few studies have investigated the direct association of indoxyl sulfate with vascular function. We hypothesized that indoxyl sulfate adversely affects vascular function. Aortas isolated from male Wistar rat were examined in the presence or absence of indoxyl sulfate to assess the vascular function, including vasorelaxation and vasocontraction. Indoxyl sulfate (vs. vehicle) (1) decreased vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine (ACh) but not by sodium nitroprusside; (2) had no significant alterations of noradrenaline-induced vasocontraction in the absence and presence of endothelium; (3) decreased adenylyl cyclase activator (forskolin)-induced vasorelaxation, while such a difference was eliminated by endothelial denudation; and (4) decreased vasorelaxations induced by calcium ionophore (A23187) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 agonist (GSK1016790A). The indoxyl sulfate-induced decrease in the vasorelaxations induced by ACh and A23187 increased by cell-permeant superoxide dismutase or by organic anion transporter inhibitor. However, apocynin, an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, had no effects on vasorelaxations induced by ACh, A23187, forskolin, and GSK1016790A in the presence of indoxyl sulfate. These results suggest that indoxyl sulfate directly affects the vascular function, particularly, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and this effect may be attributable to increased oxidative stress after cell transportion via organic anion transporter, and such increased oxidative stress may not be attributable to activation of NADPH oxidase activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448587>Intestinal uptake and toxicity evaluation of acetazolamide and its multicomponent complexes with hidroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in rats.</a></h1><p>Large oral doses of ACZ lower the intraocular pressure (IOP), but usually lead to a multitude of systemic side effects, including gastrointestinal upset. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of ACZ on the histological structure of rat duodenal mucosa and to assess a possible protective role of the complex formation of ACZ with HP-β-CD, either separately or in combination with a third compound, on the gut epithelial layer by histological and ultrastructural examinations of sections of rat duodenum exposed to ACZ or its formulations. In addition, the transport process of ACZ and its binary or ternary complexes across the duodenal mucosa by means of the single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) method in rats was evaluated. Evidence was found that ACZ alters intestinal permeability and induces damage to the rat small intestine. In contrast, ACZ-induced intestinal injury may be abrogated by ACZ complexation. In addition, the complexation of ACZ with HP-β-CD, alone or in combination with a third compound, facilitated significant levels of ACZ uptake across the rat duodenal segment. Ternary complexes of ACZ with HP-β-CD in combination with TEA (triethanolamine) or calcium ions were found to provide an excellent approach that enabled an increased apparent permeability of ACZ across the duodenal epithelium, with a concomitant ability to preserve the integrity of the gut epithelium from ACZ-induced injury. These results could be useful for the design and development of novel ACZ formulations that can reduce GI toxicity, while still maintaining their essential therapeutic efficacies.Copyright © 2014.

Because it is derived from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine, it is particularly prevalent in the gastrointestinal tract, which is membrane rich due to turnover of the intestinal epithelium and the resident microbiota. Intriguingly, many gut pathogens carry the  ( utilization) genes. EA utilization has been studied for about 50 years, with most of the early work occurring in just a couple of species of  Once the metabolic pathways and enzymes were characterized by biochemical approaches, genetic screens were used to map the various activities to the  genes. With the rise of genomics, the diversity of bacteria containing the  genes and surprising differences in  gene content were recognized. Some species contain nearly 20 genes and encode many accessory proteins, while others contain only the core catabolic enzyme. Moreover, the  genes are regulated by very different mechanisms, depending on the organism and the  regulator encoded. In the last several years, exciting progress has been made in elucidating the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern  gene expression. Furthermore, a new appreciation for how EA contributes to infection and  in the host is emerging. In addition to providing an overview of EA-related biology, this minireview will give special attention to these recent advances.Copyright © 2018 Kaval and Garsin.</p></html>
