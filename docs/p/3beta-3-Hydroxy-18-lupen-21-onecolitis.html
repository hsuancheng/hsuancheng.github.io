Recent data also demonstrate efficacy in Crohn's disease (CD); however, little is known about target drug levels to achieve endoscopic remission.We performed a retrospective analysis of IBD patients on maintenance golimumab. Median trough levels were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test, and logistic regression was used to construct a probabilistic model to determine sensitivity and specificity of levels predicting mucosal healing.Fifty-eight patients on maintenance golimumab were included (n = 39 CD, n = 19 UC/IBD-unclassified [IBDU]). Forty percent (n = 23) were cotreated with an immunomodulator, 95% (n = 55) of patients were anti-TNF experienced, and 15.5% (n = 9) had 3 or more prior biologic therapies. Forty-four percent of patients achieved mucosal healing with endoscopic response in a further 26% of patients. Clinical remission was recorded in 41% of patients, and 82% had clinical response. Patients were treated with doses generally higher than the approved maintenance dose. In CD patients, median golimumab trough levels were higher in patients with mucosal healing (8.8 μg/mL vs 5.08 μg/mL, P = 0.03). After calculation of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for mucosal healing vs nonresponse, a trough level >8 μg/mL was associated with mucosal healing, with 67% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 3:4.Treatment with golimumab was associated with mucosal healing in 44% of all IBD patients. Higher golimumab levels were associated with mucosal healing in CD. These findings support the need for prospective studies to determine target golimumab levels in IBD, which may impact current clinical practices in relation to selection of maintenance dosing.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Fibrosis is a common and incurable complication of IBD. When fibrotic complications occur, patients often have to undergo disfiguring surgery. Thus, research has focused on regenerative therapies as a means to prevent and treat established fibrosis. Both cell and non-cell therapies (exosomes) have anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties. This review discusses these emerging therapeutics and their potential to treat intestinal fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term functional outcomes after Ta-IPAA versus transabdominal IPAA (Abd-IPAA) in UC.A multicentre cohort analysis was done between March 2002 and September 2017. Patient characteristics, surgical details and postoperative outcomes were compared. CGQL (Cleveland global quality of life) score at 12 months with a functioning pouch was considered the primary endpoint.A total of 374 patients (100 Ta-IPAA vs 274 Abd-IPAA) were included. Ta-IPAA demonstrated a comparable overall quality of life (CGQL score) to Abd-IPAA (0.75 ± 0.11 vs 0.71 ± 0.14; respectively, p=0.1). Quality of life (7.71 ± 1.17 vs 7.30 ± 1.46; p=0.04) and energy level items (7.16 ± 1.52 vs 6.66 ± 1.68; p=0.03) were significantly better after Ta-IPAA, while the quality of health item was comparable (7.68 ± 1.26 vs 7.64 ± 1.44; p=0.96). Analysis excluding anastomotic leaks did not change the overall CGQL scores. Stool frequencies (>10/ 24 hrs:22% vs 21%; p=1.0) and the rate of single episode of major incontinence during the 12-month period (27% vs 26%; p=0.89) were similar. The differences in thirty-day morbidity rates (33% vs 41%; p=0.2) and the anastomotic leak rates were not significant (6% vs 13%; p=0.09).This study provides evidence of comparable long-term functional outcome and quality of life after Ta-IPAA and Abd-IPAA for UC.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

We investigated IL-33-mediated colonic homeostasis using a mechanistic method. Il33 mice were more tolerant to dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute  than the wild type and also showed delayed recovery from  with recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) administration. Unexpectedly, microarray analysis identified significant downregulation of the Abcg5/8 genes in mouse colons following rIL-33 treatment. ABCG5/8 are known cholesterol transporters in the small intestine and liver, though their colon activities have not been elucidated, thus their role in IL-33-mediated inflammation was investigated. In vitro, toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation upregulated ABCG5/8 mRNA expression in Caco2 and HCT-15 cells, with subsequent downregulation by rIL-33, while inhibition of ABCG5/8 along with their siRNA increased TLR-stimulated IL-8 production. Together, these results indicated that colonic ABCG5/8 play a regulatory role in TLR-induced inflammation, while histological inflammation in human UC was correlated positively with the level of mucosal IL-33 and inversely with that of colonic ABCG5/8. This is the first report of IL-33-mediated downregulation of colonic ABCG5/8 in a  recovery phase, indicating their involvement in UC pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental .</a></h1><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced .  was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after  induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental  even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689461>Inflammation-triggered local drug release ameliorates  by inhibiting dendritic cell migration and Th1/Th17 differentiation.</a></h1><p>Enteric-coated formulations using Eudragit® polymers have been extensively used for delivering drugs to the lower gastrointestinal tract. However, these drug-delivery systems cannot accurately deliver the therapeutic cargoes to colon because of early degradation of the polymers at alkaline pH of the small intestine. Here, we describe a precise method of delivering drugs to inflammation sites in colon using an oral drug delivery system. Tacrolimus (FK506)-loaded microspheres were prepared using a thioketal-based polymer that releases drug in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are abundantly produced at the sites of inflammation in acute . Orally-administered FK506-loaded thioketal microspheres (FK506-TKM) led to substantial accumulation of FK506 in inflamed colon and effectively alleviated dextran-sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine . At the molecular level, FK506-TKM significantly inhibited infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes in colon and differentiation of CD4 T cells to Th1 and Th17 cells in colon-draining mesenteric lymph nodes via restricting dendritic cell migration from colon. Our findings indicate orally-administered thioketal-based drug delivery system as a promising means of treating acute inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative , liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.</a></h1><p>IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) is a chronic, non-specific, inflammatory gastrointestinal disease that mainly consists of Crohn's disease and ulcerative . However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are still unclear. B10 (IL-10 producing regulatory B) cells, a subset of regulatory B cells, are known to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the aberrant frequency of B10 cells is associated with IBD. We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced IBD model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease  severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production by ManLAM-treated B cells contributes to keeping the balance between CD4 T cell subsets and protect mice from DSS-induced IBD.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656567>Recent advances in monoclonal antibody therapy in IBD: practical issues.</a></h1><p>The advent of monoclonal antibody therapies has revolutionised inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment and delivered great benefits to patients. The optimal use of this class of drugs requires careful management and a clear understanding of their properties. In this review article, we consider how to maximise the benefit of our most novel biological agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. For each agent, we consider practical aspects including dose flexibility, evidence for use in combination with a conventional immunomodulator and the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring. We also address positioning of the various mechanisms and agents in treatment algorithms as well as important aspects of managing patients receiving monoclonal antibodies, such as disease reassessment. Finally, we look ahead to the future of monoclonal antibodies, where not only have biosimilars increased the number of agents available but there are also a range of novel mechanisms currently in late phase clinical trials.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

He had watery diarrhea on day 18 and was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus enterocolitis. In addition, computed tomography performed on day 27 and colonoscopy revealed gastric emphysema and intestinal pseudolipomatosis, respectively.

However, there is only limited clinical experience. We now present the first-in-patient treatment using (CRS/RA) for VT in Germany.A 78-year-old male patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and significantly reduced ejection fraction (15%) presented with monomorphic VT refractory to poly-anti-arrhythmic medication and causing multiple implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions over the course of several weeks, necessitating prolonged treatment on an intensive care unit. Ultra-high-resolution electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) revealed a re-entry circuit in the cardiac septum inaccessible for catheter ablation. Based on the EVM, CRS/RA with a single session dose of 25 Gy (83% isodose) was delivered to the VT substrate (8.1 cc) using a c-arm-based high-precision linear accelerator on November 30, 2018.CRS/RA was performed without incident and dysfunction of the ICD was not observed. Following the procedure, a significant reduction in monomorphic VT from 5.0 to 1.6 episodes per week and of ICD shock interventions by 81.2% was observed. Besides periprocedural nausea with a single episode of vomiting, no treatment-associated side effects were noted. Unfortunately, the patient died 57 days after CRS/RA due to sepsis-associated cardiac circulatory failure after Clostridium difficile-associated  developed during rehabilitation. Histopathologic examination of the heart as part of a clinical autopsy revealed diffuse fibrosis on most sections of the heart without apparent differences between the target area and the posterior cardiac wall serving as a control.CRS/RA appears to be a possible treatment option for otherwise untreatable patients suffering from refractory VT and electrical storm. A relevant reduction in VT incidence and ICD interventions was observed, although long-term outcome and consequences of CRS/RA remain unclear. Clinical trials are strongly warranted and have been initiated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644188>Vancomycin.</a></h1><p>Vancomycin (van" koe mye' sin) is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Streptococcus orientalis with primary activity against gram positive bacteria. Vancomycin has a large, complex and unusual structure and is believed to act by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis via binding to the cell wall precursor molecules. Vancomycin is active against, and its major use is in therapy of, infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), including antibiotic-induced pseudomembranous , staphylococcal enterocolitis, bacterial endocarditis, and sepsis. For systemic infections, vancomycin is given intravenously. For localized or nonsystemic infections, other routes of administration are used, including oral, rectal, topical, inhalational, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, and intraventricular. The recommended parenteral dosage in adults is 500 mg iv every 6 hours or 1000 mg every 12 hours, with modification to achieve a therapeutic range as needed. The recommended oral dosage in the treatment of antibiotic induced pseudomembranous enterocolitis is 125 to 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days. Vancomycin is available generically and under several commercial names including Vancoled, Vancor, Lyphocin, and Vancocin in 125 and 250 mg pulvules and as power for injection or oral administration. Vancomycin was first approved for use in the United States in 1958 and it continues to be widely used, particularly with the recent rise in incidence of serious MRSA infections. Vancomycin is largely well tolerated; common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, nephrotoxicity and neutropenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644942>Healing effects of Cornus mas L. in experimentally induced ulcerative  in rats: From ethnobotany to pharmacology.</a></h1><p>The ethnobotanical studies conducted in Turkey and other countries have revealed that Cornus mas L., from the family Cornaceae have been used against stomachache, diarrhea and .The objective the present study is to determine the possible activity of C. mas in experimentally induced ulcerative  in rats and to identify its phytochemical feature.2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced  model was induced in rats. The rats were orally treated with different doses (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of C. mas 80% methanol extract for 14 days. Increase in body weight, consumed amount of feed, form of the stool, presence of rectal prolapse were followed every day. At the end of the experiment, colon tissues were removed and wet weights for each animal were measured and colon damages were scored. Total antioxidant and total oxidant status, cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) and protein levels of colon tissues were evaluated and histopathological analyses were carried out. After the detection of the effective dose as 400 mg/kg, the aqueous methanol extract was fractionated by using liquid-liquid fractionation technique and the sub-extracts were also tested for in vivo biological activities. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analyses were conducted to determine the phytochemical profile of the active crude extract and n-butanol sub-extract.Amount of feed consumed per day and increase in body weight were the lowest in the control group, while those values were determined to be the highest in 80% methanol extract (at 400 mg/kg dose), n-butanol sub-extract and reference groups. Following  induction, it was determined that the fecal form was yellow-slippery in all groups and returned to normal after the treatment with C. mas extracts. Rectal prolapse score was less in the extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract treated groups. Total antioxidant, total oxidant status, cytokine and protein levels were found to be in parallel with macroscopic findings. 80% methanol extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract provided the best healing according to the wet weight measurements and colon damage scoring performed on the removed colon tissues. These findings supported the results of histopathological analysis. According to the chromatographic analysis, ellagic acid was determined in both extracts and its amount was quantified.The present study has verified the ethnomedical use of C. mas for the treatment of ulcerative .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the action mechanisms of sword bean have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, the whole parts of a ripened sword bean (RSB) and the green sword bean (GSB) containing bean pod were extracted with ethanol by reflux extraction. The two crude extracts (RSBE and GSBE) from RSB and GSB were validated by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of gallic acid as a reference chemical. The anti-inflammatory effects of two sword bean extracts were extensively investigated using LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. First, RSBE and GSBE significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandinE (PGE), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RSBE and GSBE showed no cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. In addition, the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased by RSBE and GSBE. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis showed that RSBE and GSBE inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-B subunits, which correlated with the inhibitory effects on inhibitor kappa B (IB) degradation. In dextran sulfated sodium (DSS)-induced  mice model, RSBE restored body weight, colon length, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-6, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon- (IFN-).

Primary symptoms of UC are well known, yet similarities and differences of disease experience in adults and adolescents are not well characterized.To understand the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptomatic experience of UC, in-depth interviews were conducted in the US with 21 adults (20-70 years) and 14 adolescents (12-17 years). Eligibility and medical history were confirmed by clinician report. A previously conducted literature review and resultant conceptual model informed the discussion guide to explore symptoms and HRQoL. Age appropriate creative tasks ("animal" task and collage) were employed to facilitate discussion. Transcripts and collages were subjected to thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti software.Clinician-reported UC severity included 24% mild, 38% moderate, 38% severe among adults; and 64% mild, 29% moderate, 7% severe among adolescents. Among adults, 52% were female, 67% were white. Among adolescents, 50% were female, 71% were white. During analysis it was noted that all participants reported stomach/abdominal pain. Other key symptoms identified were frequent bowel movements, diarrhea, blood in stools, sudden need for bowel movement, stomach cramping, bloating, and feeling gassy/passing gas (≥75% of participants). Key impacts identified were embarrassment, dietary limitations, having to plan around UC, worry/fear, anger, low mood/depression, and relationship with others, (≥75% of participants). In creative tasks, animals were chosen to represent their UC and content included in the collages reflected the most commonly discussed themes from the interviews. Only adults discussed feeling dehydrated, while only adolescents discussed the impact of UC on school life.Open-ended interviews highlighted the HRQoL and symptomatic experiences of UC from the patient's perspective, which were similar between adult and adolescent UC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682913>A self-assembled, ROS-responsive Janus-prodrug for targeted therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>A self-assembled and oxidation-degradable Janus-prodrug, termed as Bud-ATK-Tem (B-ATK-T), was fabricated by ROS-responsive aromatized thioketal (ATK) linked anti-inflammatory drug budesonide (Bud) and antioxidant tempol (Tem). Benefiting from the hydrophobic interactions and π-π stacking interactions of ATK, prodrug B-ATK-T could self-assemble into nanoparticles (NP) in water containing lecithin and DSPE-PEG. The morphology of B-ATK-T NP (approximate 100-120 nm) was confirmed to be regular spherical by transmission electron microscope. B-ATK-T NP was endowed high drug loading content with 41.23% for Bud and 15.55% for Tem. The rapid drug release from B-ATK-T NP proceeded in an extensive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. More than 98% of Bud and Tem in B-ATK-T NP could release in the mimic inflammation microenvironment or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated macrophages within short time. The release of drugs in a simultaneous and proportional manner ensures that B-ATK-T NP can increase the combined efficacy of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. It is worth noting that B-ATK-T NP could be passively accumulated and dramatically increasing the maximum drugs concentration in the inflamed colon of mice with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by oral route, and avoiding potential systemic side effects. B-ATK-T NP could not only relieve  via inhibiting the expression of oxidative and proinflammatory mediators more than combination of free drugs, but also significantly reduce -caused death. Taken together, the self-assembled, Janus-prodrug B-ATK-T NP is a promising candidate therapies for IBD, even for other inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

In recent years, the immunomodulating effects of vitamin D have gained a huge interest in its possible pathogenic influence on the pathophysiology of IBD. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent among patients with IBD. Several clinical studies have pointed to a critical role for vitamin D in ameliorating disease outcomes. Although causation versus correlation unfortunately remains an overwhelming issue in the illusive chicken versus egg debate regarding vitamin D and IBD, here we summarise the latest knowledge of the immunological effects of vitamin D in IBD and recommend from available evidence that physicians regularly monitor serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with IBD. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for optimising vitamin D status in patients with IBD in clinical practice. Awaiting well-powered controlled clinical trials, we consider vitamin D supplementation to be an affordable and widely accessible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate IBD clinical outcomes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the levels may be false negative or false positive in some situations.To evaluate the usefulness of immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of tissue calprotectin (T-CPT) in bowel mucosa in children with ulcerative  (UC). We focused at correlation of T-CPT with levels of F-CPT and endoscopic and microscopic disease activity at the time of diagnosis and tested whether T-CPT could serve as predictor of complicated course of the disease.Forty-nine children with newly diagnosed UC between 6/2010-1/2018 entered the study. Endoscopic activity was objectified using the Ulcerative  Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS), clinical activity by Pediatric Ulcerative  Activity Index (PUCAI) and microscopic activity by Geboes and Nancy score. The IHC staining for CPT antigen was performed on bioptic samples from 6 bowel segments and the number of CPT + cells were counted per 1HPF. During the minimal follow-up of 12 months we searched for presence of complications. As outcome for Cox regression model we used composite endpoints: A) Acute Severe , colectomy, anti-TNF treatment; B) systemic corticotherapy; C) systemic 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.Neither levels of T-CPT nor values of UCEIS, Geboes or Nancy score predicted the given complications. We found F-CPT levels (HR 2.42 and 2.52) and PUCAI > 40 points (HR 2.98) as predictors of time to endpoints B and C. Good correlation was found between T-CPT levels and Geboes score (k = 0.65) and Nancy score (k = 0.62) and modest with F-CPT (k = 0.44), UCEIS (k = 0.38) and PUCAI (k = 0.42).T-CPT correlated well with microscopic scores. F-CPT and PUCAI appear to be better predictors of unfavorable outcome in patients with UC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The diagnosis depends on characteristic histological findings. Bile acid malabsorption and autoimmune conditions, including coeliac disease, are more frequently found in patients with MC, but colorectal neoplasia and mortality are not increased. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton-pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and smoking tobacco confer an increased risk of developing MC. Although a so-called benign disease, which rarely causes serious complications, it does have an impact on the quality of life. Several treatment options exist, but budesonide is the only treatment proven in randomised-controlled trials to be effective and safe for induction and maintenance of remission. This article provides a practical overview for the gastroenterologist looking after patients with MC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0.5 h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner. These experiments suggest that NX-13 is safe and well-tolerated in rats given oral doses as high as 1000 mg/kg with a favorable gastrointestinal localized pharmacokinetic profile, confirming NX-13 as a promising therapeutic for Crohn's disease and ulcerative .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670372>Dining With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Review of the Literature on Diet in the Pathogenesis and Management of IBD.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic immune-related diseases hypothesized to be a sequela of an interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. The global incidence of IBD is increasing, and more patients are exploring diet as a means to explain and treat their IBD. In fact, many patients strongly believe diet plays a fundamental role in the onset and management of their IBD. However, a significant proportion of patients report limited nutritional education from their provider, and providers report limited nutritional resources to aid in discussions with patients. This imbalance between supply and demand likely reflects the previous paucity of available literature characterizing the influence of diet in IBD. To address this gap in knowledge, we review the available literature to characterize the role of diet in the pathogenesis, exacerbation, and treatment of IBD. We aim to provide patients and providers with resources to better understand and discuss the role of diet in IBD, with the overall goal of improving patient care and satisfaction.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

IBD is genetically determined and many common risk alleles have been identified. Yet, a large proportion of genetic predisposition remains unexplained. In this study we report the identification of an ultrarare missense variant (NM_006998.3:c.230G>A;p.Arg77His) in the  gene causing Mendelian early-onset ulcerative .  encodes a calcium sensor that is exclusively expressed in neuroendocrine lineages, including enteroendocrine cells and gut neurons. SCGN interacts with the SNARE complex, which is required for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We show that the  mutation identified impacted the localization of the SNARE complex partner, SNAP25, leading to impaired hormone release. Finally, we show that mouse models of  deficiency recapitulate impaired hormone release and susceptibility to DSS-induced . Altogether, these studies demonstrate that functional deficiency in SCGN can result in intestinal inflammation and implicates the neuroendocrine cellular compartment in IBD.© 2019, Sifuentes-Dominguez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676049>Preoperative Considerations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Patients with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease often present to surgery malnourished and on combination immunosuppression.

Interleukin (IL)-33 is involved in various immune responses, with reported proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which may be associated with  and -associated cancer. IL-33 induces the inflammatory cascade through its receptor, suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (ST-2). Binding of IL-33 to membrane-bound ST-2 (mST-2) recruits the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and activates intracellular signaling pathways. However, whether IL-33/ST-2 is triggered by  infection and whether this interaction occurs in lipid rafts remain unclear. Our study showed that both IL-33 and ST-2 expression levels were significantly elevated in -infected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that ST-2 mobilized into the membrane lipid rafts during infection. Depletion of membrane cholesterol dampened -induced IL-33 and IL-8 production. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed IL-33/ST-2 upregulation, and severe leukocyte infiltration was observed in gastric tissues infected with . Together, these results demonstrate that ST-2 recruitment into the lipid rafts serves as a platform for IL-33-dependent  infection, which aggravates inflammation in the stomach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692324>Synthetic Oligosaccharide-based Vaccines Protect Mice from Clostridioides difficile Infections.</a></h1><p>Infections with Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) have risen in incidence, morbidity and mortality over the past decade. Preventing infections is becoming increasingly important, as frontline antibiotics become less effective and frequently induce recurrence by disrupting intestinal microbiota. The clinically most advanced vaccine approaches prevent symptoms once C. difficile infection is established by inducing immunity to secreted clostridial cytotoxins. However, they do not inhibit bacterial colonization and thereby favor asymptomatic carriage. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the C. difficile surface glycans PS-I, PS-II, and PS-III are immunogenic and serve as basis for colonization-preventing vaccines. Here, we demonstrate that glycoconjugate vaccine candidates based on synthetic oligosaccharides protected mice from infections with two different C. difficile strains. Four synthetic antigens, ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharides, were conjugated to CRM197, a carrier protein used in commercial vaccines. The vaccine candidates induced glycan-specific antibodies in mice and substantially limited C. difficile colonization and  after experimental infection. The glycoconjugates ameliorated intestinal pathology more substantially than a toxin-targeting vaccine. Colonization of the gut by C. difficile was selectively inhibited while intestinal microbiota remained preserved. Passive transfer experiments with anti-PS-I serum revealed that protection is mediated by specific anti-glycan antibodies, however, cell-mediated immunity likely also contributed to protection in vivo. Thus, glycoconjugate vaccines against C. difficile are a complementary approach to toxin-targeting strategies and are advancing through preclinical work.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648574>An approach to acute severe ulcerative .</a></h1><p>: Despite the introduction of novel therapies and treatment strategies for ulcerative  (UC), many patients develop acute, severe episodes, warranting prompt care and aggressive management.

Patient demographics, ethnic codes, disease phenotype (Montreal classification), disease activity and treatment within 3 months of diagnosis were recorded onto the Epicom database.Across a population of 2271406 adults, 339 adult patients were diagnosed with IBD over one year: 218 with ulcerative  (UC, 64.3%), 115 with Crohn's disease (CD, 33.9%) and 6 with IBD unclassified (1.8%). The crude incidence of IBD, UC and CD was 17.0/100000, 11.3/100000 and 5.3/100000 respectively. The age adjusted incidence of IBD and UC were significantly higher in the Indian group (25.2/100000 and 20.5/100000) compared to White European (14.9/100000,  = 0.009 and 8.2/100000,  < 0.001) and Pakistani groups (14.9/100000,  = 0.001 and 11.2/100000,  = 0.007). The Indian group were significantly more likely to have extensive disease than White Europeans (52.7%  41.7%,  = 0.031).

When at least two familial cases existed in our cohort, they were included in the concordance analysis (κ index). The concordance between younger and older members for IBD type [Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC)] and phenotypic characteristics such as disease extent and location, disease behavior, the use of medication, and need for surgery were evaluated.A positive family history of IBD was noted in 216 patients with CD (7.0%) and in 238 patients with UC (6.7%). Of all patients, 167 consanguineous pairs in 146 families were identified. The crude concordance rate for IBD type was 82.6% with a κ index of 0.656 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.545-0.768, good concordance].

Its composition and function are shaped by host-microbiota and intra-microbiota interactions. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that target bacteria and have the potential to modulate bacterial communities.To summarise phage biology and the clinical applications of phages in gastroenterology METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies.Phages induce bacterial cell lysis, integration of viral DNA into the bacteria and/or coexistence in a stable equilibrium. Bacteria and phages have co-evolved and their dynamic interactions are yet to be fully understood. The increasing need to modulate microbial communities (e.g., gut microbiota, multidrug-resistant bacteria) has been a strong stimulus for research in phages as an antibacterial therapy. In gastroenterology, phage therapy has been mainly studied in infectious diseases such as cholera. However, it is currently being explored in several other circumstances such as treating Clostridioides difficile , targeting adherent-invasive Escherichia coli in Crohn's disease or eradicating Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer. Overall, phage therapy has a favourable and acceptable safety profile. Presently, trials with phage therapy are ongoing in Crohn's disease.Phage therapy is a promising therapeutic tool against pathogenic bacteria in the fields of infectious diseases and gastroenterology.

Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), characterized by compromise of the intestinal wall with gas-filled cysts, has rarely been reported with IBD. The presentation, best management and outcomes of PI with IBD are poorly defined.We conducted a search for PI in all abdominal computed tomography (CT) reports at 2 large tertiary care hospitals from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017, cross referenced to ICD codes for IBD. CT and chart review was performed to confirm PI and IBD respectively. A systematic review excluding case reports was performed for PI with IBD for comparison.Of 5,990 patients with a CT abdomen report mentioning PI, we identified 11 cases of PI with IBD, 4 UC, 6 CD, and 1 indeterminate . PI was limited to the small bowel in 5 patients, the right colon in 5, and small bowel and colonic in 1. All 3 mortalities had CD, small intestinal PI and portal/mesenteric venous gas. The systematic literature search identified 9 articles describing 58 patients with IBD and PI. These cases were mostly included in larger cohorts of PI patients without extractable data on presentation or outcomes in the IBD subpopulation.Ours appears to be the first reporting of presentations and outcomes, outside of case reports, for those with PI and IBD.

Information about disease control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by disease activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and 5% for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe disease activity compared to patients with mild or no disease activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/2.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed IBD treatment at least once during the last 3 years.

We prospectively enrolled 310 IBD (191 Crohn's disease CD, 119 ulcerative , UC) patients with a follow-up period of 104 weeks (IQR: 103-104) in a nationwide registry. The corticosteroid-free clinical remission rate (Harvey Bradshaw Index ≤4, short clinical  activity index ≤2) at week 52 and 104 was 28% and 19% for CD and 27% and 28% for UC, respectively. 59% maintained corticosteroid-free clinical remission between week 52 and 104. Vedolizumab with concomitant immunosuppression showed comparable effectiveness outcomes compared to vedolizumab monotherapy (week 104: 21% vs. 23%, p=0.77), while 8 out of 13 severe infections occurred in patients treated with concomitant immunosuppression. To conclude, the clinical effect was 19% for CD and 28% for UC after 2 years of follow-up regardless of concomitant immunosuppression.© 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694581>Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis: a case report and literature review.</a></h1><p>Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a low-incidence disease that confuses many doctors. A vast number of factors are suspected to contribute to its pathogenesis, such as Crohn's disease, intestinal stenosis, ulcerative , drug use, extra-gastrointestinal diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most consider its pathogenesis interrelated to an increase in intra-intestinal pressure and the accumulation of gas produced by aerogenic bacteria, and patients with atypical symptoms and imaging manifestations tend to be misdiagnosed.A 64-year-old man complained of a 3-month history of bloody stool without mucopurulent discharge, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed multiple nodular projections into the segmental mucosa of the sigmoid colon. Crohn's disease and malignant disease ware suspected first according to the patient's history, but laboratory examinations did not confirm either. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed multiple cystic lesions in the submucosa. Moreover, computer tomography scan showed multiple bubble-like cysts. Combined with ultrasonography, computed tomography, and pathology findings, we ultimately made a diagnosis of PCI. Instead of surgery, we recommended conservative treatment consisting of endoscopy and oral drug administration. His symptoms improved with drug therapy after discharge, and no recurrence was noted on follow-up.The incidence of PCI is low. Due to a lack of specificity in clinical manifestations and endoscopic findings, it often misdiagnosed as intestinal polyps, tumors, inflammatory bowel disease, or other conditions. Colonoscopy, computed tomography, and ultrasonography have demonstrated benefit in patients with multiple nodular projections in colon. Compared to the treatment of the above diseases, PCI treatment is effective and convenient, and the prognosis is optimistic. Therefore, clinicians should increase their awareness of PCI to avoid unnecessary misdiagnosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639211>Comment on: Prospective cohort study of appendicectomy for treatment of therapy-refractory ulcerative .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690068>Orally Administered CLA Ameliorates DSS-induced  in Mice via Intestinal Barrier Improvement, Oxidative Stress Reduction, Inflammatory Cytokine and Gut Microbiota Modulation.</a></h1><p>Dietary supplementation with CLA has been reported to alleviate the effect of  in mice, but the mechanisms involved need further exploration. The study aimed to investigate how orally administered CLA alleviates DSS-induced  in mice. CLA was administered at five different doses: 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d, 10 mg/d, 5 mg/d and 2.5 mg/d. Doses of CLA at 10 mg/d and higher alleviated  symptoms and reduced inflammation induced by DSS, in which 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d and 10 mg/d CLA significantly increased the concentration of MUC2 and goblet cells, but neither 5 mg/d CLA nor 2.5 mg/d CLA had any effects. Meanwhile, 40 mg/d CLA and 20 mg/d CLA treatments significantly up-regulated the concentration of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-3) and ameliorated epithelial apoptosis caused by DSS. Moreover, oxidative stress-related enzymes (SOD, GSH-PX, CAT) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6) were modulated by 40 mg/d CLA and 20 mg/d CLA. Furthermore, 40 mg/d CLA rebalanced the gut microbiota damaged by DSS, including reducing Bacteroides and increasing Bifidobacterium and Odoribacter. In conclusion, CLA supplementation alleviated DSS-induced  in a dose-dependent manner by modulating inflammatory cytokines and oxidation stress, maintaining the mucosal barrier and reverting microbiota changes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686385>Vaccination in the Elderly and IBD.</a></h1><p>Significant gaps in knowledge and utilization of vaccinations exist among practitioners providing care for patients with IBD.

(PGT-A). Retrospective cohort study comparing clinical outcomes of patients with Inflammatory bowel disease who underwent IVF with PGT-A with a subsequent euploid single embryo transfer (SET) against a matched control group. Thirty-eight patients with an IBD diagnosis were compared to 114 controls. There was no significant difference in cycle outcomes among IBD and Control cohorts [implantation rate (71.0% vs. 78.0% ( = .68)], clinical pregnancy rate [50.0% vs. 60.5% ( = .68)], live birth [62.9% vs. 73.0% ( = .06)] multiple pregnancy rate [0% vs. 1.1% ( = .25)] and clinical pregnancy loss rate [10.5% vs. 5.7% ( = .54)]. An IBD diagnosis was not found to significantly modify the odds of implantation [adjusted OR = 0.6 (95% CI -1.2 to 0.8)]. Additionally, the odds of implantation in patients with IBD were not altered by having ulcerative  or Crohn's disease diagnosis. (OR = 0.4 95% CI 0.1-1.9). Patients diagnosed with IBD who undergo a SET have clinical outcomes comparable to the general infertile population.

Phyto-ingredients have been evaluated for their ability to protect against IBD because of their anti-inflammatory activities. In our previous study, we identified a novel derivative of chrysin (HE-chrysin) using irradiation technology, which exhibited stronger anti-cancer activity in human colorectal cancer cells than the original chrysin. Here, to determine whether HE-chrysin is a new therapeutic candidate for IBD, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of HE-chrysin on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and dextran sodium salt (DSS)-induced  in mice. HE-chrysin more effectively inhibited BMDC maturation compared to chrysin, as demonstrated by the decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, surface molecules, antigen-presenting ability, and T cell proliferation/activation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMDCs. These anti-inflammatory effects of HE-chrysin were regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, oral administration of HE-chrysin attenuated DSS-induced  symptoms and clinical signs in the mouse model. The protective effects of HE-chrysin treatment against  were mediated by decreasing Th1- and Th17-type cytokine levels. These results indicate that HE-chrysin is attractive candidate for IBD therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Laquinimod (LAQ), a poorly water-soluble compound, was proved to be effective for  remission at low dose of 0.5 mg/kg in patients with Crohn's disease. Due to its extremely low solubility in water, it was difficult to develop an injectable liquid dosage form. Herein, D-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) polymeric micelles were developed as a delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. Using the LAQ/TPGS ratio of 1:100, LAQ-loaded micelles were successfully prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The solubility of LAQ in water was significantly increased from 10.5 μg/mL in pure water to 500 μg/mL in TPGS micelles. LAQ-loaded micelles of TPGS exhibited the fine particle size of 34.6 nm and Zeta potential of -0.67 mV. Moreover, the good stability of LAQ-loaded micelles in physiology-mimicking medium was confirmed by detecting their particle size, zeta potential and leakage of the loading drug. Therapeutic effect of LAQ-loaded micelles on DSS-induced mice was proved by detecting DAI score, colon length and loss of body weight. Moreover, the morphology and colonic mucosal barrier of the injured colon of DSS-induced mice was largely recovered after treatment with LAQ-loaded micelles. Meanwhile, the inflammation of  colon was also obviously alleviated by LAQ-loaded micelles. Conclusively, polymeric micelles of TPGS may be a promising delivery vehicle of LAQ for the management of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Taking advantage of this possibility, TuMV virus-like particles (VLPs) have been genetically derivatized with a peptide from the chaperonin Hsp60, a protein described to be involved in inflammation processes and autoimmune diseases. Antibodies against the peptide have been previously shown to have a diagnostic value in at least one autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. The functionalized Hsp60-VLPs showed their significant increase in sensing potency when compared to monoclonal antibody detection of the peptide in a conventional immunoassay. Additionally, the developed Hsp60-VLPs allowed the detection of autoantibodies against the Hsp60 peptide in an in vivo mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced . The detection of minute amounts of the autoantibodies allowed us to perform the analysis of their evolution during the progression of the disease. The anti-Hsp60 autoantibody levels in the sera of the inflamed mice went down during the induction phase of the disease. Increased levels of the anti-HSP60 autoantibodies were detected during the resolution phase of the disease. An extension of a previously proposed model for the involvement of Hsp60 in inflammatory processes is considered, incorporating a role for Hsp60 autoantibodies. This, and related models, can now be experimentally tested thanks to the autoantibody detection hypersensitivity provided by the functionalized VLPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637413>Natural history of perianal fistulizing lesions in patients with elderly-onset Crohn's disease: a population-based study.</a></h1><p>Most studies of elderly-onset Crohn's disease (CD, diagnosed in patients aged 60 or over) have described a mild course. However, data on the natural history of perianal fistulizing CD (pfCD) in this population are scarce. In a population-based cohort study, we described the prevalence, natural history and treatment of pfCD in patients with elderly-onset CD vs. patients with pediatric-onset CD.All patients diagnosed with CD at or after the age of 60 between 1988 and 2006 were included (n=372). Logistic regression, Cox models, and a nested case-control method were used to identify factors associated with pfCD.Thirty-four elderly patients (9%) had pfCD at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 6 years [IQR: 3-10], 59 patients (16%) had pfCD; the same prevalence (16%) was observed in pediatric-onset patients. At last follow-up, anal incontinence was more frequent in elderly patients with pfCD than in elderly patients without pfCD (22% vs. 4%, respectively; p<10-4). Rectal CD at diagnosis was associated with pfCD (hazard ratio [95% CI]=2.8 [1.6-5.0]). Although 37% of the patients received immunosuppressants and 17% received anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, 24% (14 out of 59) had a definitive stoma at last follow-up.During the first 6 years of disease, the prevalence of pfCD was similar in elderly and pediatric patients. Rectal involvement was associated with the appearance of pfCD in elderly-onset patients. Around a quarter of patients with elderly-onset CD will have a stoma.

The gold standard for  detection is stool culture followed by cytotoxic assay, although it is laborious and time-consuming. We developed a screening test based on a two-step conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to detect D, the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme gene, which is a marker for screening of . Targeting D comparing to the conserved stable genetic element of pathogenicity locus (PaLoc), with an accessory gene of 3, was an effective method for the detection of this pathogen from patients with enterocolitis. METHODS Fresh fecal samples of the patients who were clinically suspicious for antibiotic-associated  were collected. Stool specimens were cultured on the cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (CCFA) in an anaerobic condition, following alcohol shock treatment and enrichment in  Brucella broth (CDBB). On confirmed colonies, PCR was carried out for detection of PaLoc subsidiary gene, 3, and toxicogenic genes, A and B. The D that is GDH gene detection was performed by conventional PCR on the extracted DNA from 578 fresh stool samples. RESULTS 57 (9.8%) strains of  were approved by conventional PCR for D and 3 genes, in which 37 (6.4%) colonies had A+/B+ genotype, 2 (0.3%) A+/B-, 4 (0.7%) A-/ B+ and the remaining 14 (2.4%) colonies were A and B negative. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that targeting D by PCR is quite promising for rapid detection of  from fresh fecal samples. Furthermore, the multiple-gene analysis for A and B assay proved a reliable approach for diagnosing of toxigenic strains among clinical samples.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696975>Efficacy of adjuvant curcumin therapy in ulcerative : A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Aminosalicylic acids are recognized to be the first-line treatment options for ulcerative . Currently, the effectiveness of curcumin as an adjuvant treatment in ulcerative  has been investigated, which was still controversial. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy and safety of curcumin as an adjuvant treatment in ulcerative .The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from original to July 2019, and relevant randomized controlled clinical trials were enrolled and analyzed. The primary outcomes were clinical and endoscopic remission; meanwhile, the secondary outcomes were clinical and endoscopic improvement. Subgroup analyses of doses, delivery way, form, and intervention time of curcumin were also conducted.Six randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 349 patients were included. Eligible trials suggested that adjuvant curcumin treatment in ulcerative  was effective in inducing clinical remission (odds ratio [OR] = 5.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.84-14.56, P = 0.002), endoscopic remission (OR = 5.69, 95% CI: 1.28-25.27, P = 0.02), and endoscopic improvement (OR = 17.05, 95% CI: 1.30-233.00, P = 0.03), but not in clinical improvement (OR = 4.79, 95% CI: 1.02-22.43, P = 0.05). We can see the potential advantages in large dosage, topical enema, special drug form, and longer duration from the enrolled studies. There were no severe side effects reported.Curcumin, as an adjuvant treatment of mesalamine, was proved to be effective and safe in ulcerative . Better efficacy can be achieved with suitable dose, delivery way, formation, and intervention time, which needs further study to verify.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638536>Stercoral : A Surgical Dilemma.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696961>Complete histologic normalisation is associated with reduced risk of relapse among patients with ulcerative  in complete endoscopic remission.</a></h1><p>Clinical and endoscopic remission are treatment targets in ulcerative  (UC). The value of histologic healing in altering clinical outcomes among patients with complete endoscopic healing is not well established.To quantify the association between histologic activity and clinical relapse among patients with UC who were in complete endoscopic remission.This study included patients with UC from a prospective registry who were in complete endoscopic remission. Histologic activity was quantified by a senior gastrointestinal pathologist. Histologic activity was defined as lack of normalisation (Geboes score > 0) as well as histologically active disease (Geboes score ≥2.1 and ≥3.1). The primary outcome was clinical relapse within 2 years. Multivariable regression adjusting for potential confounders examined the independent predictive value of histologic changes.The study included 83 patients (51% women) (median age 44 years; median disease duration 11 years). Forty-one (49%) had complete histologic normalisation. Within two years, 26 (31%) experienced clinical relapse. Patients with complete histologic normalisation were less likely to experience relapse (5/41, 12%) compared to those without normalisation (21/42, 50%, P < 0.001) (multivariable OR 7.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.48-24.70) by the Geboes score. The individual components of the Geboes score predictive of relapse were architectural changes (P = 0.03) and increased chronic inflammatory infiltrate (P < 0.001).Complete histologic healing using the Geboes score was associated with reduced rates of clinical relapse among patients with UC in endoscopic remission.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643033>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Pyridostigmine Bromide Attenuates Gut Pathology and Bacterial Dysbiosis in a Murine Model of Ulcerative .</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is a Th2 inflammatory bowel disease characterized by increased IL-5 and IL-13 expression, eosinophilic/neutrophilic infiltration, decreased mucus production, impaired epithelial barrier, and bacterial dysbiosis of the colon. Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666502>Gadd45β promotes regeneration after injury through TGFβ-dependent restitution in experimental .</a></h1><p>Dysregulated immune responses and impaired function in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45β) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory symptoms. However, the role of Gadd45β in IBD is completely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Gadd45β in IBD. Gadd45β-KO mice exhibited drastically greater susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  and mortality than C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution.

The treatment group was lavaged with S. boulardii (5 × 10 CFU/d) for 12 weeks. The mice were sacrificed and the tumor load in the treatment group was compared with that of a control group. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in colon tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The influence of S. boulardii on TNF-α and IL-6 regulation was also investigated using different colon cell lines. Differences in intestinal microbiota in both stool and intestinal mucosa samples were assessed using 16S rDNA sequencing.S. boulardii treatment reduced AOM/DSS-induced UC carcinogenesis in mice, as indicated by the reduced tumor load and reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels in vivo, as well its effects on TNF-α and IL-6 activities in vitro. Significant changes in both fecal and mucosal microbiota were observed among the control, the AOM/DSS treated, and AOM/DSS plus S. boulardii treated groups. For fecal microbiota, the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Lactobacillus, but higher in Oscillibacter and Lachnoclostridium than the control group. After intervention with S. boulardii, the percentage of Bacillus and Lactococcus increased, but Lachnoclostridium, Oscillibacter, Bacteroides, and Pseudomonas decreased. For the intestinal mucosal microbiota, the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and higher in Alloprevotella than the control group. After S. boulardii exposure, the percentage contributions of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 increased.S. boulardii effectively reduced UC carcinogenesis in an AOM/DSS induced mice model. This positive result can likely be attributed to the reduction of TNF-α and IL-6 levels or the blockade of their function combined with alterations to the intestinal microbiota.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678983>An Autopsy Case of Rupture of Infectious Thoracic Aortitis Induced by Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND Infectious aortitis has a poor prognosis and high mortality rate if untreated. Here, we report a case of rupture of infectious aortitis induced by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). CASE REPORT An 83-year-old female patient was hospitalized due to continuous fever and diarrhea, which was diagnosed as . The  was determined to have been induced by small vessel vasculitis upon histological examination. Fasting and central venous hyperalimentation using a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) were carried out for rest of the intestine. Swelling and pus were observed at the insertion site of the PICC. Since methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in the culture of the pus and the blood, the patient was treated with vancomycin. After confirming that the blood culture became negative, prednisolone (PDL) was started as therapy for the . Her diarrhea and fever improved. After vancomycin was stopped, MRSA-arthritis appeared. She suddenly died due to acute massive hemorrhage into the mediastinum and left thoracic cavity from the atherosclerotic ulcer of the thoracic aorta. It took 98 days from the first detection of MRSA in her blood to her death. We found gram-positive coccus in the ruptured aortic ulcer and we also detected MRSA gene by polymerase chain reaction in the ulcer. These results suggest that MRSA could colonize in the aortic ulcer during the MRSA-bacteremia and the MRSA could contribute to the vulnerability of the aortic wall.

However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients.To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist's interview on IBD patients' acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®.After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients' association (Association François Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars.93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02-0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01-1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07-2.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient's opinion on biosimilars.This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient's acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the risk of new onset IBD in patients with COPD and new onset COPD in IBD patients.We performed a systematic review of observational studies exploring the risk of both associations. Two independent reviewers explored the EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS and DOAJ databases, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBBINS-I tool. Data from included studies was pooled in a random effect meta-analysis following a DerSimonian-Laird method. The quality of the evidence was ranked using GRADE criteria.Four studies including a pooled population of 1355 new cases were included. We found association between new onset IBD in COPD population. The risk of bias was low in most of them. Only one study reported tobacco exposure as a potential confounding factor. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for a new diagnosis of IBD in COPD patients was 2.02 (CI, 1.56 to 2.63), I = 72% (GRADE: low). The subgroup analyses for Crohn's disease and ulcerative  yielded RRs of 2.29 (CI, 1.51 to 3.48; I = 62%), and 1.79 (CI, 1.39 to 2.29; I = 19%.), respectively.According to our findings, the risk of new onset IBD was higher in populations with COPD compared to the general population without this condition.

In advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, there have been few reports about the correlation between irAEs and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30.5 days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.5). The median progression-free survival was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.5) in the irAE group and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.11, p < 0.001). The median overall survival was 16.8 months (95% CI, 4.4 to not reached) in the irAE group and 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.1) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.17, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number of metastatic sites ≥2 (HR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.54), high ALP level (HR = 2.50; 95% CI, 1.27 to 4.54), and absence of irAEs (HR = 9.54, 95% CI, 3.34 to 27.30 for yes vs. no) were associated with a poor prognosis. The most frequent irAEs was diarrhea/ (n = 5). Grade 3 adverse events were observed in 6 patients; hyperglycemia (n = 2), diarrhea/ (n = 1), adrenal insufficiency (n = 1), aspartate aminotransferase increased (n = 1), peripheral motor neuropathy (n = 1). There were no grade 4 or 5 adverse events related to nivolumab.Development of irAEs was associated with clinical benefit for AGC patients receiving nivolumab monotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666808>Increased expression of kynurenine aminotransferases mRNA in lymphocytes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Complex interaction of genetic defects with environmental factors seems to play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in IBD. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with IBD, during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative  (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that IBD is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in IBD seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in IBD. Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with IBD, as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650411>Increased risk of herpes zoster infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study is to better characterize this possible association by conducting a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of relevant literature until April 30, 2019, was performed. Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with IBD and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative  (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.88). Steroid users and anti-TNFα users were at increased risk of HZ in UC, with RRs of 1.99 (95% CI 1.64-2.42) and 2.29 (95% CI 1.52-3.45), respectively. Begg's test and Egger's test suggested no publication bias. There was a 74% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with CD and 40% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with UC compared with that in non-IBD. IBD patients with high risk of HZ infection may benefit from an HZ vaccine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648921>Are we choosing wisely for inflammatory bowel disease care? The IG-IBD choosing wisely campaign.</a></h1><p>The "Choosing Wisely" campaigns have the aim of promoting a better clinician-patient relationship.The Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD) conducted a choosing wisely campaign for IBD.Ten IG-IBD panellists conducted the campaign through a modified Delphi process. All IG-IBD members were asked to submit five statements starting with "Do not…" addressing any IBD-related procedure or treatment the necessity of which should be questioned. All recommendations were evaluated by the panellists who prioritised each item. The top ten recommendations were prioritised again by IG-IBD members, and the top five recommendations were identified.110 members (mean age 42 ± 12; 62 males) participated in the campaign. The top five recommendations were as follow: 1. Do not use corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, or without a clear indication; 2. Do not forget venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalised patients with active disease; 3. Do not treat perianal Crohn's disease with biologics without prior surgical evaluation; 4. Do not discontinue IBD-related medications during pregnancy unless specifically indicated; 5. Do not delay surgery.The IG-IBD promoted a campaign with a bottom-up approach, identifying five recommendations that could be useful for providing a better IBD care, especially among non-IBD experts.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Here, we characterized their capacity to modulate both the mucosal cytokine production and the phenotype of circulating antigen presenting cells (APCs) in active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The IBD mucosa produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines referred to healthy controls (HCs). Peptides B7 and B12, however, did not ameliorate the mucosal cytokine milieu in IBD. Human circulating APCs (B-cells, monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)) were characterized by flow cytometry in presence/absence of the peptides. Circulating B-cells, monocytes, and cDCs from IBD patients were more activated than those from HCs. Peptide B7, but not B12, decreased CCR2 expression on all APC subsets from HC, but not IBD patients. Moreover, both peptides tend to further increase their pro-inflammatory profile in IBD. In summary, IBD patients display mucosal and circulating APC pro-inflammatory properties. Peptide B7 immunomodulatory capacity elicited over circulating APCs from HC, but not IBD patients, suggests the presence of disrupted modulatory mechanisms for this peptide in IBD. Future studies should address the effect of bacteria-derived immunomodulatory peptides in non-inflamed (quiescent) IBD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650217>F-FDG PET-MR enterography in predicting histological active disease using the Nancy index in ulcerative : a randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the diagnostic performance of PET-MR enterography in detecting histological active inflammation in patients with ulcerative  and the impact of bowel purgation on diagnostic accuracies of PET-MR parameters.Fifty patients were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov []). Forty patients were randomized in two study arms, in which bowel purgation was performed either before or after PET-MR enterography. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy with mucosal biopsies after PET-MR within 24 h. Diagnostic performance of MR morphological parameters (MRmorph), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and PET in detecting histological inflammation determined by the Nancy index was compared with each other and between study arms. Correlation between PET and histological inflammatory severity was calculated.In study arm without previous bowel purgation, SUV ratio of bowel segment (relative to SUV of the liver) facilitated the highest specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared with MRmorph and DWI. Bowel cleansing led to markedly increased metabolic activity of bowel segments, resulting in significantly reduced specificity of PET compared with study arm without purgation (0.808 vs. 0.966, p = 0.007, respectively). Inter-observer concordance for assessing MRmorph was clearly increased after bowel cleansing (Cohen's κ, 0.847 vs. 0.665; p = 0.013, respectively), though diagnostic performance of MRmorph was not significantly improved. Our findings suggested that the change of metabolic status was mainly associated with the grade of neutrophil infiltrate and less dependent on chronic infiltrate.PET-MR enterography was an excellent non-invasive diagnostic method in the assessment of histological active inflammation in ulcerative  without the need of previous bowel purgation.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687015>lncRNA Mirt2 Is Downregulated in Ulcerative  and Regulates IL-22 Expression and Apoptosis in Colonic Epithelial Cells.</a></h1><p>lncRNA Mirt2 is a lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) inducible inflammation inhibitor. We found that Mirt2 was downregulated in plasma of ulcerative  (UC) patients and the downregulation of Mirt2 distinguished UC patients from healthy controls. IL-22 was also downregulated in UC patients and positively correlated with Mirt2. Mirt2 overexpression led to upregulated, while Mirt2 siRNA silencing led to inhibited secretion of IL-22 from colonic epithelial cells treated with LPS. In addition, under LPS treatment, Mirt2 overexpression led to decreased, while Mirt2 siRNA silencing led to increased apoptotic rate of colonic epithelial cells. Therefore, Mirt2 is downregulated in ulcerative  and regulates IL-22 expression in colonic epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019 Guangrong Ding et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657630>Intestinal epithelial deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 alters expression of inflammatory mediators and barrier function.</a></h1><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are important hormones involved in the regulation of multiple physiologic functions. GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue immunity, improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and  Organisation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688337>Endoscopic management of inflammatory bowel disease-associated complications.</a></h1><p>The main complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are strictures, fistulas, abscesses, and -associated neoplasia.

Opioid use continues to be more prevalent in IBD than any other chronic gastrointestinal condition, and the majority of IBD patients consume narcotics during hospitalization despite the risks of infection and death.We performed a retrospective review of 57 subjects aimed at quantifying pain and opiate consumption for IBD-related admissions over a 3-month period. For each patient, the average and maximum of each day's pain scores were used to measure changes in pain from admission to discharge using mixed model regression, with opiate use as a time-dependent covariate.The daily average pain score over the entire hospitalization was 4.23 ± 2.09, and the maximum pain score was 8.28 ± 1.75. Among opioid users (n = 51), the daily average pain score was 4.65 ± 2.16 and the maximum pain score was 7.53 ± 2.56. Across all cases from admission to discharge, there was less than a 1-point change in daily average pain (- 0.96 ± 2.03, p = 0.0009), and no change in maximum pain (- 0.89 ± 3.59, p = 0.0671). Opioid users, a subset of the overall cohort, had a similar less than one-point drop in daily average pain (- 0.94 ± - 0.29, p = 0.0024) and no change in daily maximum pain scores (- 0.81 ± - 0.47, p = 0.0914). Patients on average used 20 ± 25 mg morphine equivalents per day. Opioid-naïve patients used similar doses to those who used opioids prior to admission (PTA). Almost half of all cases (47%) were discharged with an opioid prescription, the majority (71%) of whom were not on opioids PTA.Pain in IBD is not well controlled through hospitalization, with less than a 1-point change from admission to discharge, despite significant opioid consumption.

AIEC bacteria survival increased within MDM from CD patients compared to UC ( = 0.0019). AIEC bacteria survival increased in patients with CD-associated polymorphism  ( = 0.05) and reduced in those with CD-associated polymorphisms  ( = 0.026) and  ( = 0.033). AIEC infection led to an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β ( < 0.0001) and TNF-α ( < 0.0001) in CD macrophages. ULK-1 expression increased in AIEC-infected MDM from CD patients compared to MDM from UC patients or healthy subjects ( = 0.0056) and correlated with AIEC survival ( = 0.0013). Moreover, the expression of ULK-1 phosphorylation on Serine 757 decreased following to AIEC infection ( < 0.0001). Short-term silencing of ULK-1 and IRGM genes restricted and promote, respectively, AIEC survival within MDM ( = 0.0018 and  = 0.0291). In conclusion, the macrophage defect to mediate AIEC clearance in CD patients is linked to polymorphisms related to autophagy such as IRGM and ULK-1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662857>Are there reliable predictive factors of nonresponse to aminosalicylates in patients with ulcerative ?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653485>Inflammatory bowel disease and the risk for cardiovascular disease: Does all inflammation lead to heart disease?</a></h1><p>Inflammation has a strong role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Several systemic inflammatory conditions have been linked to an increased risk of ASCVD; however, this has not been well established in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD is comprised of Ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, both of which involve chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, often with evidence of systemic involvement. Several ASCVD risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, poor diet and the presence of obesity may increase the risk of ASCVD in patients suffering from IBD, despite a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Medications used to treat IBD and target inflammation, such as steroids, may also accelerate the risk of the risk for ASCVD heart failure while exacerbating ASCVD risk factors. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in these patients, most notably in women and in younger patients. Some cohort studies have also suggested a link between IBD and both atrial fibrillation and heart failure, particularly during periods of active flares. All IBD patients, particularly younger individuals, should be screened for ASCVD risk factors with aggressive risk factor modification to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to identify how to prevent and treat cardiovascular events that occur in patients with IBD, particularly during active flares.Copyright © 2019.

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat containing X1 (NLRX1) is a unique NLR with regulatory and anti-inflammatory functions resulting in protection from IBD in mouse models. NX-13 is an orally active, gut-restricted novel drug candidate that selectively targets and activates the NLRX1 pathway locally in the gut. In vitro and in vivo efficacy of NLRX1 activation by NX-13 was examined. Oral treatment with NX-13 alleviates disease severity, colonic leukocytic infiltration, and cytokine markers of inflammation in three mouse models of IBD (dextran sulfate sodium, Mdr1a, and CD45RB adoptive transfer). Treatment of naive CD4 T cells with NX-13 in vitro decreases differentiation into Th1 and Th17 subsets with increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased NF-κB activation and reactive oxygen species. With stimulation by PMA/ionomycin, TNF-α, or HO, PBMCs from ulcerative  patients treated with NX-13 had decreased NF-κB activity, TNF-α and IFN-γ CD4 T cells and overall production of IL-6, MCP1, and IL-8. NX-13 activates NLRX1 to mediate a resistance to both inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress in mouse models and human primary cells from ulcerative  patients with effects on NF-κB activity and oxidative phosphorylation. NX-13 is a promising oral, gut-restricted NLRX1 agonist for treating IBD.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657973>Inflammatory bowel diseases: interrelationships between dietary vitamin D, exposure to UV radiation and the faecal microbiome.</a></h1><p>: Environmental factors and an altered faecal microbiome are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are environmental factors that are associated by several pathways, including changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome, with the development and course of IBD. : This review explores the interaction of vitamin D, and UVR, with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune systems, and how they may influence the gut microbiome and the subsequent development, and progression, of IBD. : Vitamin D and UVR both regulate innate and adaptive immunity through a combination of common and independent mechanisms, with the overall effect being the promotion of immune tolerance. Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal microbiome either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal immunity, fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host immunity and the gut microbiome. Further research and increased understanding of environment-host interactions is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of preventing and curing IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667468>Elevated Pretreatment Plasma Oncostatin M Is Associated With Poor Biochemical Response to Infliximab.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that elevations of plasma Oncostatin M (OSM) would be associated with infliximab nonresponse.Plasma OSM was measured in Crohn disease patients pre-infliximab with biochemical response (>50% reduction in fecal calprotectin) as the primary outcome.The median OSM in biochemical responders was 86 (69-148) pg/mL compared with 166 (74-1766) pg/mL in nonresponders ( = 0.03).

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful, bowel preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative  and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± 2.88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486.5 μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663424>Antitumor properties of triptolide: phenotype regulation of macrophage differentiation.</a></h1><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which generally exhibit an M2-like phenotype, play a critical role in tumor development. Triptolide exerts a unique bioactive spectrum of anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to determine whether triptolide has any effect on the activation of TAMs and the production of tumor-promoting mediators. ICR-1 mice with azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colon tumors and BALB/c mice co-inoculated with 4T1 cells and M2-polarized RAW264.7 cells were used to examine whether the inhibitory effect of triptolide on tumor progression was mediated by the targeting of TAMs. Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry assays were performed to determine the expression of cell surface markers and cytokine production. The results showed that triptolide inhibited macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype and abolished M2 macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the expression of M2 markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of M2-polarized macrophages and TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity. Our findings provide important information for the potential clinical application of triptolide in cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690143>Expert opinion on fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of  infection and beyond.</a></h1><p> Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure involving transfer of stool from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a diseased recipient to restore intestinal microbial composition and functionality.

Pouchoscopies were performed at least once to diagnose pouchitis according to the modified pouchitis disease activity index. SNP genotyping was performed for 8 SNPs reportedly associated with UCAC and pouchitis, namely: ELF1 (rs7329174), FCGR2A, (rs1801274), interleukin-1β (IL-1B; rs1143627), ITLN1 (rs2274910), MHC (rs7765379), TNFα (rs1799964), TNFSF15 (rs3810936), and UHMK1 (rs768910), using TaqMan genotyping technologies.

We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first 2 months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: 5.10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and 5.9% of UC patients had an IBD-related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD.

Kimura disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of idiopathic etiology. The clinical presentation of Kimura's disease is painless solitary or multiple subcutaneous nodules, asymmetric, mostly in the head and neck region with often association with lymphadenopathy. Typically, the nodules are found on preauricular, submandibular, and popliteal regions as well as oral cavity, larynx, and parotid glands. In the present report, we describe a case of a 27-year-old male presented to our hospital with history of right neck and lip swelling for 10 days. In the history, the patient mentioned that he had bloody diarrhea four to six times day and he lost 10 kg in 1 month. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination which showed the lymph node architecture is preserved with significant increase number of eosinophils which is consistent with Kimura's disease. There is no agreement on the management aspects in Kimura's disease so far. The primary treatment for Kimura's disease includes surgical resection. Additional medical therapy including regional or systemic steroid therapy, cytotoxic therapy, and radiation has also been utilized.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative  patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of . The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of  that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti-inflammation effect in DSS-induced . These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota regulated by L-Arabinose. L-Arabinose could be a remarkable candidate as a functional food or novel therapeutic strategies for intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650020>The Role of Adaptor Protein CARD9 in -Associated Cancer.</a></h1><p>The adaptor protein CARD9 plays an important role in anti-fungal immunity responses, linking detection of fungi by surface receptors to activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).

This study explored societal costs and disease diagnoses 10 years before Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) diagnosis in Denmark.This national register study included patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2015 identified in the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and controls who were individually matched on age and sex from the general population. Societal costs included health care services, prescription medicine, home care services, and labor productivity loss. Prediagnostic hospital contact occurring before CD or UC diagnosis was identified using the NPR. Average annual costs per individual were calculated before the patient's first CD or UC diagnosis. A 1-sample t test was then applied to determine significance in differences between cases and controls.Among CD (n = 9019) and UC patients (n = 20,913) the average societal costs were higher throughout the entire 10-year period before the diagnosis date compared with the general population. The difference increased over time and equaled €404 for CD patients and €516 for UC patients 10 years before diagnosis and €3377 and €2960, respectively, in the year before diagnosis. Crohn's disease and UC patients had significantly more diagnoses before their CD and UC diagnosis compared with the general population.Compared with the general population, the societal costs and number of additional diagnoses among CD and UC patients were substantially higher in the 10-year period before diagnosis.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693080>Loop Ileostomy a Viable Alternative for Clostridium difficile ?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638607>Tinidazole efficacy for amebic  therapeutic prophylaxis in patients with de novo acute leukemia receiving intensive chemotherapy.</a></h1><p>In Mexico, seroprevalence of Entamoeba histolytica is 8.4%.

Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying diseases, disease locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult IBD patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with IBD [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying disease type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at 2 h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying disease type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

Several studies have been conducted to investigate the association of Glutathione S-Transferase M1 (GSTM1) null genotype with UC and CD, but the results are inconsistent. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify this controversy based on relative large sample size.A systematic article searching was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, WOS, ProQuest, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Wanfang databases up to August 31, 2019. Meta-analysis results were synthesized by using crude odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and publication bias were assessed by using STATA 11.0 software.A total of 15 relevant studies including 4353 IBDs patients (1848 CD cases, 2505 UC cases) and 5413 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Totally, we found a significant association between GSTM1 null genotype and risk to IBDs in the overall populations (OR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.13-1.65, P = .001). Stratified by ethnicity, we found a significant association between GSTM1 null genotype and risk to IBDs in the Asian population (OR = 2.54, 95%CI = 2.15-3.00, P = .001), but not in the Caucasian population. Stratified by disease type, we found a significant association between GSTM1 null genotype with CD in the Asian population (OR = 2.37, 95%CI = 1.11-5.06, P = .026), and with UC in the Asian (OR = 2.48, 95%CI = 1.93-3.20, P = .001) population. In addition, funnel plot and Egger linear regression test suggests no publication bias in all genetic models.GSTM1 null genotype is associated with susceptibility to IBD, UC, and CD in the Asian population.

As surgical fistula closure is not commonly offered in Crohn's patients, long-term data is limited. This study aims to evaluate outcomes after LIFT and AF in Crohn's high perianal fistulas.All consecutive Crohn's patients ≥18 years treated with LIFT or AF between January 2007 and February 2018 were included. Primary outcome was clinical healing and secondary outcomes included radiological healing, recurrence, postoperative incontinence, and Vaizey Incontinence Score.Forty procedures in 37 patients (LIFT:19, AF:21, 35.1% male) were included. A non-significant trend was seen towards higher clinical healing percentages after LIFT compared to AF (89.5% versus 60.0%; P=0.065). Overall radiological healing rates were lower for both approaches (LIFT 52.6% and AF 47.6%). Recurrence rates were comparable: 21.1% and 19.0% respectively. In AF a trend was seen towards higher clinical healing percentages when treated with anti-TNF/immunomodulators (75.0% versus 37.5%; P=0.104).Newly developed postoperative incontinence occurred in 15.8% after LIFT and 21.4% after AF. Interestingly, 47.4% of patients had postoperatively improved Vaizey Score (LIFT:52.9% and AF:42.9%). The mean Vaizey Score decreased from 6.8 (SD 4.8) preoperatively to 5.3 (SD 5.0) postoperatively (P=0.067).Both the LIFT and AF procedure resulted in satisfactory closure rates in Crohn's high perianal fistulas. However, a discrepancy between clinical and radiological healing rates was found. Furthermore, almost half of the patients benefitted from surgical intervention with respect to continence.© European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677072>It's What's Up Front That Counts-Part Two: Esophageal Crohn's Disease Complicated by Recurrent Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642989>Correction to: Estimated prevalence of ulcerative  and Crohn's disease in Japan in 2015: an analysis of a nationwide survey.</a></h1><p>The authors would like to correct the errors in the publication of the original article.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689346>Fighting the Hype for Predictors of Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687419> Enteritis in Patients Following Total Colectomy-a Rare but Genuine Clinical Entity.</a></h1><p> infection (CDI) frequently causes  following antibiotic exposure and is a leading cause of gastrointestinal infectious mortality.

While pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a well-defined disease with established guidelines, Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic  (EoC) remain a clinical enigma with evidence based on limited anecdotal case reports. Large cross-sectional studies in US defined a prevalence of EoG and EoGE ranging from 1,5 to 6,4/100.000 and from 2,7 to 8,3/100.000 subjects respectively, while prevalence of EoC ranges from 1,7 to 3,5/100.000 subjects. Regarding the pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that EGIDs result from the interplay between genetic predisposition, intestinal dysbiosis and environmental triggers. Clinically, EGIDs might present with different and nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the involved intestinal tract and the extension of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The diagnosis of EGIDs requires: 1. recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, 2. increased eosinophils for high power field in biopsy specimens, 3. absence of secondary causes of gastrointestinal eosinophilia. No validated guidelines are available on the clinical management of patients with EGIDs. Evidence from case reports and small uncontrolled case series suggests the use of dietary and corticosteroids as the first-line treatments. Considering the clinical follow-up of EGIDs, three different patterns of disease course are identified: single flare, recurring course-disease and chronic course-disease. This review will focus on pediatric EGIDs distal to esophagus, including Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic  (EoC).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683521>Echinochrome A Reduces  in Mice and Induces In Vitro Generation of Regulatory Immune Cells.</a></h1><p>Echinochrome A (Ech A), a natural pigment extracted from sea urchins, is the active ingredient of a marine-derived pharmaceutical called 'histochrome'. Since it exhibits several biological activities including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, it has been applied to the management of cardiac injury and ocular degenerative disorders in Russia and its protective role has been studied for other pathologic conditions. In the present study, we sought to investigate the therapeutic potential of Ech A for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using a murine model of experimental . We found that intravenous injection of Ech A significantly prevented body weight loss and subsequent lethality in -induced mice. Interestingly, T cell proliferation was significantly inhibited upon Ech A treatment in vitro. During the helper T (Th) cell differentiation process, Ech A stimulated the generation regulatory T (Treg) cells that modulate the inflammatory response and immune homeostasis. Moreover, Ech A treatment suppressed the in vitro activation of pro-inflammatory M1 type macrophages, while inducing the production of M2 type macrophages that promote the resolution of inflammation and initiate tissue repair. Based on these results, we suggest that Ech A could provide a beneficial impact on IBD by correcting the imbalance in the intestinal immune system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688306>Distinct patterns of short-chain fatty acids during flare in patients with ulcerative  under treatment with mesalamine or a herbal combination of myrrh, chamomile flowers, and coffee charcoal: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty acids are involved in the regulation of the gut immune system.

This study followed the occurrence of PGL, toxoplasmosis, and Cytomegalovirus infection in 32 HIV-positive patients and analyzed the clinical signs of disease in relation to the number of CD4 T lymphocytes. In monitored patients, the average number of CD4 T lymphocytes was 940.8 ± 396.7/µL of blood. Severe immunodeficiency was recorded in four persons, who also suffered from  and/or retinitis and pneumonitis. The number of CD4 T cells in patients with PGL was significantly lower than that in patients without lymphadenopathy. In 6 (18.8%) IgM and 11 (34.4%) IgG   seropositive patients, the number of CD4 T lymphocytes was significantly lower than that in seronegative patients. The presence of IgM and IgG antibodies to Cytomegalovirus was recorded in all examined patients, and CMV infection clinically manifested in five persons. The occurrence of PGL, the higher viral load, and seropositivity to  were significantly related to decline in the CD4 T lymphocyte number.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells play important roles in the development of immune‑mediated hepatitis and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Tofacitinib, a new Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is under investigation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; it is also helpful in treating ulcerative  and psoriasis. The roles of tofacitinib were investigated in conferring protection against immune‑mediated liver injury in mice. T cell‑mediated hepatitis was induced by concanavalin A (ConA). The mice in the treatment groups were administered with tofacitinib intragastrically before the ConA injection. Histopathological examination was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the serum transaminase and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined using an automatic biochemistry analysis apparatus or cytometric bead array (CBA) kits. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect Tregs and Th17 cells. Tofacitinib significantly decreased the hepatic injury induced by ConA and prominently decreased the liver transaminase level. The secretion of several anti‑inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)‑10 was upregulated in mice from the treatment group, compared to that in mice treated with ConA alone, while the expression of interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ) and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) decreased. Tofacitinib treatment increased the number of Tregs and reduced the number of Th17 cells. Furthermore, tofacitinib could relieve liver fibrosis under conditions of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The present results indicated that tofacitinib improved immune‑mediated hepatitis and restored the impaired Treg/Th17 cell ratio, which suggests that it may serve as a novel treatment approach for immune‑mediated liver diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669103>Protective effects of flavonoid composition rich P. subpeltata Ortega. on indomethacin induced experimental ulcerative  in rat models of inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>Polyphenolics (flavonoid and phenolic) rich plants are the effective source for the treatment of acute and chronic degenerative diseases including inflammatory bowel disease.This study was aimed to examine the effects of polyphenolics rich leaf acetone extract of P. subpeltata against the indomethacin induced ulcerative  in rats.Two consecutive days administration of indomethacin produced chronic inflammation in GIT tissues of rats. Further, the plant extract 200 and 400 mg/kg treatment were continued until 11th day. Then hematological, enzymatic antioxidants, MPO and histological evaluations were analyzed. Moreover, the extracts were treated with RAW267.4 cells for the cytotoxicity, NO and TNF-α analysis.The obtained results revealed, that higher dose of the plant extract dropped neutrophil infiltration followed by inhibiting the MPO enzyme levels and controls the enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD, CAT, GSH and LPO.

Abundance is reduced in ulcerative  (UC), as is the relative proportion of sulphated mucin in the mucus gel layer (MGL). It is unknown if these phenomena are related, however reduced sulphated mucins could contribute to reduced abundance, owing to a lack of substrate. The aim of this study was to quantify A. muciniphila within the MGL and to relate these findings with markers of inflammation and the relative proportion of sulphomucin present. Colonic biopsies and mucus brushings were obtained from 20 patients with active UC (AC), 14 with quiescent UC (QUC) and 20 healthy controls (HC). A. muciniphila abundance was determined by RT-PCR.

A positive association was found between A. muciniphila abundance and higher percentage of sulphated mucin (ρ 0.546, p = 0.000). Lower abundances of A. muciniphila correlated with higher inflammatory scores (ρ = 0.294 (p = 0.001)).

Disruption of function or frequency of either cell type can lead to fatal autoimmunity. We previously described that mice constitutively lacking DCs (∆DC) develop autoimmunity characterized by reduced body weight, autoantibodies, and pronounced intestinal inflammation. In this study, we show that lack of DCs leads to an altered gene expression profile in peripheral but not thymic Tregs with increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The suppressive function of Tregs from ΔDC mice was impaired in T cell cocultures. In a model of transfer , Tregs from ∆DC mice were only functional in the presence of DCs in recipient mice. Lack of MHC class II on DCs also resulted in upregulation of inhibitory receptors on Tregs, reduced body weight, and elevated serum IgA levels. Further analysis of the IgA response revealed an expansion of IgA germinal center B cells and plasma cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and more IgA-coated commensal bacteria in feces of ∆DC mice. Thus, we show a critical role for DCs to establish intestinal homeostasis by regulating Treg function for prevention of spontaneous inflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687031>The Effects of Hypoxia on the Immune-Modulatory Properties of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.</a></h1><p>The therapeutic repertoire for life-threatening inflammatory conditions like sepsis, graft-versus-host reactions, or  is very limited in current clinical practice and, together with chronic ones, like the osteoarthritis, presents growing economic burden in developed countries. This urges the development of more efficient therapeutic modalities like the mesenchymal stem cell-based approaches. Despite the encouraging  data, however, clinical trials delivered ambiguous results. Since one of the typical features of inflamed tissues is decreased oxygenation, the success of cellular therapy in inflammatory pathologies seems to be affected by the impact of oxygen depletion on transplanted cells. Here, we examine our current knowledge on the effect of hypoxia on the physiology of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, one of the most popular tools of practical cellular therapy, in the context of their immune-modulatory capacity.Copyright © 2019 Zsolt Fábián.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687151>Vedolizumab use in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases undergoing surgery: clinical trials and post-marketing experience.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases frequently require surgery, but immunotherapies used in disease management may increase the risk of post-operative complications. We investigated frequencies of post-operative complications in patients who received vedolizumab-a gut-selective antibody approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative  and Crohn's disease-in clinical-trial and post-marketing settings.This post hoc analysis of safety data from GEMINI 1, GEMINI 2, and long-term safety studies included patients who had had colectomy or bowel surgery/resection. Data from the post-marketing Vedolizumab Global Safety Database were also analysed (data cutoff point: 19 May 2016). Adverse events relating to post-operative complications were identified using  preferred terms.Of 58 total surgeries in patients included in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, post-operative complications were reported for 3/51 vedolizumab-treated patients (5.9%) and 1/7 placebo-treated patients (14.3%). In the long-term safety study, 157/2,243 patients (7%) had colectomy or bowel surgery/resection; of these 157 patients who underwent surgery, 11 (7%) experienced a post-operative complication. Median time between last pre-operative vedolizumab dose and surgery was 23 days in GEMINI 1, 20 days in GEMINI 2, and 39‒40 days in the long-term safety study. In the post-marketing setting, based on data covering approximately 46,978 patient-years of vedolizumab exposure, post-operative complications were reported in 19 patients.In clinical trials, complications of colectomy and bowel surgery/resection appeared infrequent, with minimal difference between vedolizumab and placebo. The frequency of post-operative complications in the post-marketing setting appears low.© The Author(s) 2019.

Currently, there is a considerable need for the development of orally bioavailable dosage forms that enable the safe and effective delivery of therapeutic drugs to local diseased lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.  In this study, we developed orally deliverable nanotherapeutics for the synergistic treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and CAC. Water-insoluble curcumin (CUR) and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), which served as anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic agents, respectively, were chemically engineered into hydrophilic mucoadhesive chitosan for the generation of chitosan-drug amphiphiles. Results: The resulting amphiphilic constructs formed core-shell nanostructures in aqueous solutions and were orally administered for  therapeutic studies. Using a preclinical CAC mouse model, we showed that the orally delivered nanotherapeutics locally accumulated in inflamed intestinal regions and tumor tissues. Furthermore, the therapeutic synergy of the combined nanotherapeutics in CAC mice was evaluated. Compared with their individual drug forms, combined CUR and SN38 nanoparticles yielded synergistic effects to alleviate intestinal inflammation and protect mice from ulcerative . Notably, the combinatorial therapy demonstrated a remarkable tumor shrinkage with only ~6% of the total tumors exceeding 4 mm in diameter, whereas ~35% of tumors were observed to exceed a diameter of 4 mm in the saline-treated CAC mice. These data suggest a new and reliable approach for improving the treatment of IBD and CAC.  Our results showed that bioadhesive chitosan materials can be used to produce colloidal-stable nanotherapeutics that are suitable for oral delivery. Both nanotherapeutics exhibited substantial accumulation in inflamed intestinal regions and tumor tissues and showed good synergy for treating CAC, warranting further clinical translation.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635244>β-Caryophyllene in the Essential Oil from  Induces G Phase Cell Cycle Arrest in Human Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p> is a plant widespread in East Asia, used in folk medicine to treat various disorders, such as pneumonia, , stomatitis, and carbuncle. Whether the essential oil from  (ECB) and its active constituents have anti-proliferative activities in lung cancer is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of ECB in A549 and NCI-H358 human lung cancer cells. Culture of A549 and NCI-H358 cells with ECB induced apoptotic cell death, as revealed by an increase in annexin V staining. ECB treatment reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), disrupted the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and activated caspase-8, -9, and -3, as assessed by western blot analysis. Interestingly, pretreatment with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) significantly attenuated ECB-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of ECB identified six compounds. Among them, β-caryophyllene exhibited a potent anti-proliferative effect, and thus was identified as the major active compound. β- Caryophyllene induced G cell cycle arrest by downregulating cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) -2, -4, and -6, and RB phosphorylation, and by upregulating p21 and p27. These results indicate that β-caryophyllene exerts cytotoxic activity in lung cancer cells through induction of cell cycle arrest.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671188>Risk Factors for Medication Nonadherence to Self-Injectable Biologic Therapy in Adult Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC), nonadherence to biologic therapy increases risk of disease flare. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy. In patients with CD, the probability of nonadherence increased as the number of risk factors increased.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s &  Foundation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683524>Cystatin from Filarial Parasites Suppress the Clinical Symptoms and Pathology of Experimentally Induced  in Mice by Inducing T-Regulatory Cells, B1-Cells, and Alternatively Activated Macrophages.</a></h1><p>Potential alternative therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated disorders are being increasingly recognized and are studied extensively.

Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of UC.To assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and escalation in patients with UC.We evaluated data (November 2017 data cut-off) from OCTAVE Open, an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension study. The dose de-escalation group comprised 66 tofacitinib induction responders in remission following 52 weeks' tofacitinib 10 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently de-escalated to 5 mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open. The dose escalation group comprised 57 tofacitinib induction responders who experienced treatment failure while receiving 5 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently escalated to 10 mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open.After tofacitinib de-escalation, 92.4% (61/66) and 84.1% (53/63) of patients maintained clinical response and 80.3% (53/66) and 74.6% (47/63) maintained remission, at months 2 and 12, respectively.

Western blot analysis showed CA-I and CA-II as the major isoforms and CA-IV as a minor one in the colon, and they all are expressed as minor isoforms in the ileum. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed colocalization of NHE-1 with CA-I and CA-II, but not with CA-IV. TNBS significantly reduced the levels of NHE-1 and CA protein isoforms in the colon, but not in the uninflamed ileum. A similar reduction profile of the expression of CA isozymes was also obtained in ex vivo treatment of normal colon strips with TNF-α. The level of uncoupling as detected by co-immunoprecipitation was significantly more pronounced. A peptide (83 aa) from the NHE-1 C-terminus demonstrated binding of CA-II only, but not of the CA-I or CA-IV isoform. Furthermore, the profile of inflammatory test markers confirmed inflammation in the tissue used. These findings taken together suggest an inflammation-induced uncoupling of CA and NHE-1, which might be a putative mechanism for reducing the activity of NHE-1 in experimental . This uncoupling might lead to an intracellular accumulation of H resulting in acidosis and necrosis in the inflamed colon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657950>Inflammatory bowel disease: current and future non-invasive diagnostic techniques in clinical practice.</a></h1><p>: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common disease with significant morbidity. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques are lacking in IBD. Currently, faecal calprotectin is a sensitive marker of gut inflammation however is not specific to Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC) alone. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were shown to have potential in IBD diagnosis. : This systematic review aimed to examine the next-generation diagnosis of IBD in adults and children using VOCs. An in-depth literature-based search of current clinical studies of VOCs in the diagnosis of IBD was undertaken. Accuracy of IBD detection varied according to the technologies applied. Breath VOCs studies were pooled giving an overall sensitivity of 85% (95%CI: 79-89%) and specificity of 79% (95%CI 73-84%) whilst pooled faecal VOCs studies revealed a sensitivity of 87% (95%CI 77-93%) and specificity of 91% (95%CI 82-96%). Studies were limited by the variance of techniques applied in VOCs detection and the absence of well-designed longitudinal studies. : VOCs can be consistently and effectively detected in urine, breath, and stool in IBD patients. The sensitivity of breath VOCs in detecting IBD was comparable to faeces. However, optimal VOCs detection methodology and biological sampling still need to be standardised.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693324>Biologics versus Immunomodulators for the Treatment of Ulcerative : A Review of Comparative Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].</a></h1><p>INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease involving inflammation conditions located in colon and small intestines. Ulcerative  (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two primary types of IBD with different characteristics. UC is a mucosal disease that often affects the rectum and all or part of the colon. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish UC and CD clinically. The symptoms commonly seen in the patients with UC include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus, and crampy abdominal pain. The inflammation may cause major consequences, particularly a fibrostenotic obstructing pattern or a penetrating fistulous pattern. Depending on disease severity, the options of conventional treatment for IBD include 5-aminosalicylic acid agents, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and immunomodulators. Immunomodulators include azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and cyclosporine, and modify the activities of the immune system. The use of immunomodulators are associated with minor or severe adverse events, such as headache, infection, and certain cancers. Due to such risks, the use of immunomodulators needs to be closely monitored. Conventionally, a “step-up” treatment strategy usually include a sequential use of aminosalicylates, steroids, immunomodulators, and finally biologics. Medications such as 5-aminosalicylic acids or prednisolone are tried first. Biologics or pharmacological immunomodulators are particularly useful when patients are not responsive to steroids for induction or relapse prevention. BIOLOGICS: Recent advances in IBD treatment include biologics (also called biologic agents or biologic therapies), particularly for patients unresponsive to conventional therapy. Biologics are protein-based molecules that can block inflammation in several immune-related diseases. The first biologic approved for IBD is infliximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin (IgG)1 antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The usual dose of infliximab is to repeat infusion 5mg/kg every eight weeks. Infliximab was approved by Health Canada to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, CD, fistulizing Crohn disease (FCD), and UC. Currently, three types of biologics are approved for the treatment of one or both primary types of IBD: anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab), anti-integrin agents (vedolizumab) and anti-interleukin (IL) 12/23 IgG1 kappa agents (ustekinumab). PLACE IN THERAPY: Health Canada has approved several biologics or biosimilars for the treatment of ulcerative  in patients without adequate response to conventional therapy, including infliximab and vedolizumab. Although, infliximab and other biologics are often reserved for patients unresponsive to conventional therapy, some practitioners argue that early adoption of biologics or immunomodulators may be beneficial to patients with IBD. The benefits of early adoption may include avoiding toxic effects of immunomodulators and fewer adverse effects related to conventional therapy. It is uncertain whether early adoption of biologics or immunomodulators may be beneficial to patients with UC. This study aims to review the literature and understand the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of biologics and immunomodulators among UC patients naïve to both types of drugs.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689354>Minor Hematochezia Decreases Use of Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Despite increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pharmacologic prophylaxis rates remain low. We sought to understand the reasons for this by assessing factors associated with VTE prophylaxis in patients with IBD and the safety of its use.This was a retrospective cohort study conducted among patients hospitalized between January 2013 and August 2018. The primary outcome was VTE prophylaxis, and exposures of interest included acute and chronic bleeding. Medical records were parsed electronically for covariables, and logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with VTE prophylaxis.There were 22,499 patients studied, including 474 (2%) with IBD. Patients with IBD were less likely to be placed on VTE prophylaxis (79% with IBD, 87% without IBD), particularly if hematochezia was present (57% with hematochezia, 86% without hematochezia). Among patients with IBD, admission to a medical service and hematochezia (adjusted odds ratio 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16-0.46) were among the strongest independent predictors of decreased VTE prophylaxis use. Neither hematochezia nor VTE prophylaxis was associated with increased blood transfusion rates or with a clinically significant decline in hemoglobin level during hospitalization.Hospitalized patients are less likely to be placed on VTE prophylaxis if they have IBD, and hematochezia may drive this. Hematochezia appeared to be minor and was unaffected by VTE prophylaxis. Education related to the safety of VTE prophylaxis in the setting of minor hematochezia may be a high-yield way to increase VTE prophylaxis rates in patients with IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Previous studies have found a positive correlation between thymic atrophy and  severity. It was, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the effect of thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active domain of the thymopoietin, on .  Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced  mice were treated with TP5 by subcutaneous injection. Body weight, colon length, colon weight, immune organ index, disease activity index (DAI) score, and the peripheral blood profile were examined. The immune cells of the spleen and colon were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histology was performed on isolated colon tissues for cytokine analysis. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse colonic feces to assess the intestinal microbiota. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), HCT116, CT26, and splenocytes were cultured and treated with TP5.  TP5 treatment increased the body weight and colon length, decreased the DAI score, and restored colon architecture of colitic mice. TP5 also decreased the infiltration of immune cells and expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Importantly, the damaged thymus and compromised lymphocytes in peripheral blood were significantly restored by TP5. Also, the production of IL-22, both in innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, was triggered by TP5. Given the critical role of IL-22 in mucosal host defense, we tested the effect of TP5 on mucus barrier and gut microbiota and found that the number of goblet cells and the level of Mucin-2 expression were restored, and the composition of the gut microbiome was normalized after TP5 treatment. The critical role of IL-22 in the protective effect of TP5 on  was further confirmed by administering the anti-IL-22 antibody (αIL-22), which completely abolished the effect of TP5. Furthermore, TP5 significantly increased the expression level of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), a transcription factor for IL-22. Consistent with this, RORγt inhibitor abrogated the upregulation of IL-22 induced by TP5.  TP5 exerts a protective effect on DSS-induced  by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. This study delineates TP5 as an immunomodulator that may be a potential drug for the treatment of UC.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647834>Impact of faecal calprotectin measurement on clinical decision-making in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative .</a></h1><p>Faecal calprotectin (FC) seems to be the best available biomarker for the detection of intestinal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study is to clarify whether the measurement of FC has changed the number of ultrasound and endoscopic procedures, drug modifications, as well as FC re-measurements in IBD patients.This retrospective study included 242 IBD patients with available FC values (case cohort) and 46 patients without an available FC value (control cohort). Clinical consequences such as carrying out abdominal ultrasound, endoscopy, drug modification or FC re-measurement at the next ambulatory presentation or during in-patient stay were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between clinical decision-making and patient's characteristics, especially FC value.Overall, 192 (67%) clinical consequences were noted in both cohorts. In the case cohort 174 (91%) implications were noted compared to 18 (9%) in the control cohort (P < 0.001). In the case cohort, significantly more clinical consequences were detected in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) as well as in ulcerative  (UC) patients with a FC value > 250 mg/Kg than in patients with a value of ≤ 250 mg/Kg. In CD patients with high FC values significantly increased numbers of abdominal ultrasounds, endoscopies and FC re-measurements were noted. In UC patients with high FC values significantly increased numbers of abdominal ultrasounds, drug modifications and FC re-measurements were noted.Measurement of FC may alter physician's clinical decision-making in IBD patients beside other clinical and diagnostic parameters.

Cervical dysplasia was categorized as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 2 and 3.Of 124 IBD patients (30 ulcerative  and 94 Crohn's disease), 17 (13.7%) had high-risk HPV among whom 9 (7.3%) had HPV 16/18 infection and 4 (3.2%) had cervical CIN (3 CIN 3, 1 CIN 1) by pathology. Among 372 controls, 33 (8.9%) had high-risk HPV and only 1 (0.3%) had HPV 16 infection. Cervical TCT detected atypical squamous cells of unknown significance in one control; no control had CIN. The HPV 16/18 infection rate and CIN prevalence were significantly higher in IBD patients than controls (both  < 0.001). The HPV-infection rate was higher in patients administered methotrexate [ = 0.005, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 4.76 (1.471-15.402)] or more than two immunosuppressants [ = 0.013, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.64 (1.255-10.562)]. Thiopurine, steroid, infliximab and disease behavior/location were not associated with HPV infection. Only 29.3% of patients had undergone cervical-cancer screening. Awareness of HPV infection and HPV-related cervical cancer was poor (28.2%).Female IBD patients are at increased risk of high-risk HPV infection and cervical neoplasia, which may be associated with immunosuppressants. Education and routine follow-up with HPV-DNA testing and TCT are recommended, especially in female Chinese IBD patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to evaluate the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients after LT from a tertiary center case series and an updated literature review.Inflammatory bowel disease patients undergoing LT between 1985 and 2018 and requiring combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were identified from the London Health Sciences Transplant Registry (Ontario, Canada). Safety outcomes were extracted by medical chart review. For an updated literature review, EMBASE, Medline, and CENTRAL were searched to identify studies evaluating the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in IBD patients.In the case series, 19 patients were identified. Most underwent LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; 14/19, 74%) treated with anti-integrins (8/19, 42%) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) antagonists (6/19, 32%). Infections occurred in 11/19 (58%) patients, most commonly Clostridium difficile (4/19, 21%). Two patients required colectomy, and 1 patient required re-transplantation. In the literature review, 13 case series and 8 case reports reporting outcomes for 122 IBD patients treated with biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were included. PSC was the indication for LT in 97/122 (80%) patients, and 91/122 (75%) patients were treated with TNF antagonists. Infections occurred in 32/122 (26%) patients, primarily Clostridium difficile (7/122, 6%).Inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT appeared to be at increased risk of Clostridium difficile. Compared with the general liver transplant population in the published literature, there was no increased risk of serious infection.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the microbiota to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative  patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's disease patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal probiotics Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative . Modulation of the fungal microbiota can be considered as a therapeutic approach for IBD. Future research should focus on understanding how the fungal microbiota interacts with other components of the gut microbiota in association with the pathogenesis and development of IBD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636462>Commensal viruses maintain intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes via noncanonical RIG-I signaling.</a></h1><p>Much attention has focused on commensal bacteria in health and disease, but the role of commensal viruses is understudied. Although metagenomic analysis shows that the intestine of healthy humans and animals harbors various commensal viruses and the dysbiosis of these viruses can be associated with inflammatory diseases, there is still a lack of causal data and underlying mechanisms to understand the physiological role of commensal viruses in intestinal homeostasis. In the present study, we show that commensal viruses are essential for the homeostasis of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Mechanistically, the cytosolic viral RNA-sensing receptor RIG-I in antigen-presenting cells can recognize commensal viruses and maintain IELs via a type I interferon-independent, but MAVS-IRF1-IL-15 axis-dependent, manner. The recovery of IELs by interleukin-15 administration reverses the susceptibility of commensal virus-depleted mice to dextran sulfate sodium-induced . Collectively, our results indicate that commensal viruses maintain the IELs and consequently sustain intestinal homeostasis via noncanonical RIG-I signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676052>Elective Abdominal Surgery for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Elective abdominal surgery for inflammatory bowel disease is common.

Consecutive patients with strict diagnostic criteria of severe IC, including colonoscopy, histology, and laboratory tests, were recruited. Main outcome measures were in-hospital mortality and number of operations counted within the hospital stay. Severity scores were calculated and biomarkers determined during the course of the hospital stay.A total of 342 patients with an International Classification of Diseases of IC were identified. About 151 patients met the diagnostic criteria and a total of 44 patients fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria of severe IC and constituted the group of patients eligible for analysis. Five out of 44 patients (11.4%) died (in-hospital mortality). Surgery was performed in 3 patients (6.8%), 2 patients survived. The hospital stay lasted 14.0 ± 8.5 day and was significantly correlated with comorbidity (rs = 0.314, p = 0.038).

The objective our study was assessment of pan-drug-resistant (PDR) Klebsiella oxytoca pathogenicity and virulence factors causing AAHC in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).Among a total of 300 healthy and 300 patients with antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic  (AAHC) and CRC, 200 K. oxytoca were identified during May 2015-January 2019. The virulence properties and biofilm formation among the isolates were investigated by phenotypic, PCR, and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) techniques.The bla (20%), bla (11%), bla (33%), and AmpC encoding CIT (2%) ESBL genes, carbapenemase-encoding genes blaIM (4%) and bla (2%), and colistin-resistant mcr-1 gene (2.5%) were detected. The virulence-encoding genes including fimA (80%), pilQ (100%), matB (100%), mrkA (80%), and npsB (100%) were amplified. Therefore, PDR K. oxytoca containing adhesins and toxin-encoding genes with ability of biofilm formation causing AAHC and CRC were isolated. There was a significant difference between healthy and patients with CRC regarding the presence of K. oxytoca (p = 00.221).Bacterial enteric pathogens possibly play a role in CRC. Biofilm formation by K. oxytoca strains prevents the efficient infection elimination; therefore, rapid identification and control measure are chief requirements.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of IBD are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal microbiota in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of IBD is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not "common" in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian IBD centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

Presently there is no cure, and many IBD treatments incur negative side effects. We previously discovered treatment with exogenous irisin resolved inflammatory changes in the colon, gut lymphatics, and bone in a mild IBD rodent model. Here we assess irisin treatment in severe IBD induced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Male Sprague Dawley rats (2-mo-old) were untreated (Con) or given 2% DSS in drinking water. In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro-inflammatory factors. These data highlight the negative impact of chronic gut inflammation on bone as well as the therapeutic potential of irisin as an anti-inflammatory treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679016>Histopathologic Patterns of  in Patients With Impaired Renal Function.</a></h1><p>To characterize the histopathologic features of  in patients with impaired renal function.We retrospectively identified 413 patients who underwent colonoscopic evaluation for  between 2011 and 2015.

This study aimed to review the current knowledge regarding the efficacy of dietary and nutritional intervention in IBD patients. Exclusive enteral nutrition might be inferior to corticosteroid treatment in adults with active Crohn's disease (CD) but might even be superior considering the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment in children. Total parenteral nutrition has no advantage over enteral nutrition, which is considered a more physiologic modality in organ function. Current guidelines do not yet recommend ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for the prevention and maintenance of remission in IBD patients. Dietary fiber supplementation could be effective in the relief of symptoms and maintenance of remission in ulcerative  (UC). Although vitamin D may be favorable to clinical course of IBD and bone density. Probiotic supplementation has proven to be effective in preventing and treating pouchitis for UC but is less effective in treating CD. Nutritional interventions not only correct nutritional deficiencies but also improve symptoms and clinical courses of the disease. Hence, nutritional approaches need to be developed to significantly evaluate the effectiveness of dietary interventions used to treat IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657664>Cyanidin-3--Glucoside and Cyanidin Protect Against Intestinal Barrier Damage and 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid-Induced .</a></h1><p>Anthocyanin-rich extracts have shown anti-inflammation activity in mouse  models. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti-inflammatory activity in both  mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti-inflammatory effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, C3G or Cy could be potential preventive agents or supplementary medicines for inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676053>Abdominal Emergencies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Although improved medical therapies have been associated with decreased rates of emergent intestinal resection for inflammatory bowel disease, prompt diagnosis and management remain of utmost importance to ensure appropriate patient care with reduced morbidity and mortality.

Our recent study has demonstrated that a novel andrographolide derivative, AL-1, ameliorated TNBS-induced  in mice. However, the effect of AL-1 on DSS-induced murine  and the underlying mechanisms are yet unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of AL-1 against DSS-induced UC in mice and to define its mechanisms of action. Oral administration of AL-1 attenuated body weight loss, reduced colon length shortening, lowered the disease activity index score, and alleviated colon histological damage. AL-1 significantly inhibited myeloperoxidase activity and suppressed immune inflammatory responses in colonic tissues. Moreover, AL-1 reversed DSS-altered expression of inflammatory cytokines in DSS-induced  mice. Importantly, the efficacy of 45 mg/kg of AL-1 was higher than that of 100 mg/kg of the positive control drugs 5-aminosalicylic acid and mesalazine. AL-1 decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in cultured macrophages in vitro; it also reversed the altered expression of inflammatory cytokines. In both in vivo and in vitro studies, Western blot analysis revealed that AL-1 reduced the expression of phosphorylated NF-B p65 and IB, downregulated the expression of iNOS and COX-2, and attenuated the expression of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK, and JNK. In conclusion, AL-1 alleviated DSS-induced murine  by inhibiting activation of the NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways.

The EP4 receptor is known to mediate the protective effect of prostaglandin (PG) E in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the exact role of epithelial EP4 in intestinal pathophysiology remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of epithelial EP4 in maintaining colonic homeostasis by characterizing the intestinal epithelial cell-specific EP4 knockout (EP4 cKO) mice. Mice harboring the epithelial EP4 deletion showed significantly lower colonic crypt depth and lower numbers of secretory cell lineages, as well as impaired epithelial cells in the colon. Interestingly, EP4-deficient colon epithelia showed a higher number of apoptotic cells. Consistent with the defect in mucosal barrier function of colonic epithelia and secretory cell lineages, EP4 cKO colon stroma showed enhanced immune cell infiltration, which was accompanied by increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, EP4-deficient colons were susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced .

We investigated the current rate of postoperative infections in these cases within a large, U.S.We retrospectively reviewed elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies from the 2016-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Our primary outcome was postoperative surgical site infection; secondary was Clostridium difficile infection. Logistic models evaluated the associations of patient and operation characteristics with these outcomes.Surgical infection occurred in 1.0% of cases (293/30,579). Cdifficile infection occurred in 0.1% (31 cases). In our adjusted multivariable models, other/unknown race/ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, American Society of Anesthesiologists >2, operative minutes, and wound class 4 were associated with a significantly higher odds of surgical infection; no covariates were significantly associated with Cdifficile infection.In the setting of modern U.S. surgical practice, the incidence of infection after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is very low, on par with clean cases. Our study identified several patient characteristics that were strongly associated with surgical infection. Many of these are not included as risk factors in current guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis and may help to identify those at higher risk for this rare complication.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report on birth and infant outcomes (up to 2 years) following gestational exposure to IFX based on a summary of cumulative pregnancy reports in women exposed to IFX during pregnancy from the Janssen global safety database.Prospective and medically confirmed safety data on IFX-exposed pregnancies from Janssen's global safety surveillance database since authorization in 1998 are summarized. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize pregnancy and infant outcomes overall, by disease and timing of exposure.As of 23 August 2018, 1850 maternally IFX-exposed pregnancies with known outcomes were identified from the safety database. Of the 1850 pregnancies (mean age 29.7 years), 1526 (82.5%) resulted in live births. When reported, most women had Crohn's disease (67.7%) or ulcerative  (18.4%), and 82.8% of live births were exposed to IFX in the first trimester. Spontaneous abortion/intrauterine death/ectopic pregnancy/molar pregnancy (12.1%), preterm births (9.2%), low birth weight infants (3.6%), congenital anomalies (2.0%), and infant infections (1.2%) were documented. The type of congenital anomalies and frequency of serious infant infections observed were consistent with the general population. Frequencies of congenital anomalies and other adverse outcomes were similar in women exposed to IFX in the first trimester and those exposed in the third trimester. More preterm births (13-18.8%) and infant complications (8.7-12.5%) were reported with concomitant immunosuppressant use.The observed prevalence of adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes including congenital anomalies following exposure to IFX did not exceed estimates reported for the general population and no unexpected patterns were observed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665831>Tacrolimus in pediatric ulcerative : does it have a role?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654756>Role of Allopurinol and Febuxostat in the amelioration of dextran-induced  in rats.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  is a chronic auto-inflammatory disorder confined to the colorectal region. It is challenging to find an absolute treatment and current therapy aims to ameliorate symptoms, decrease relapses and prevent prognosis of colorectal cancer. In the present study, we investigated the possible action of xanthine oxidase inhibitors in murine  model by measuring different indicative parameters and comparing the results to those of the reference sulfasalazine. Also, we compared the effects of combining sulfasalazine and allopurinol to each drug alone. Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) is used in this study to induce ulcerative  in male wistar rats as it is known to be the closest model that mimics human ulcerative . Allopurinol was given prior to  induction by four days and febuxostat for six days before induction with DSS (5% w/v) and continue to give them concomitantly during the induction.Il-1β, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione (GSH), xanthine oxidase, and superoxide dismutase were measured in colonic tissue. We also measured concentrations of IL-1β, Il-6 and uric acid in serum.Allopurinol dose-dependently ameliorated biochemical injuries. Febuxostat has shown better results than allopurinol and sulfasalazine, and this is the first study to demonstrate this.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we examined whether the inflammatory properties of diets are associated with disease activity in patients with IBD.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 143 IBD patients, including 32 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 111 patients with ulcerative  (UC). Dietary intakes were assessed by a valid 168-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The inflammatory potential of the diet was assessed by calculating the two scores of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP), and CD and UC disease activity were determined by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and the Mayo score, respectively. Associations of the inflammatory indices as median and as tertiles with disease activity were analyzed using logistic regression in a univariate model and after adjusting for total energy intake (continuous), type of disease (CD and UC) and drug consumption (no drugs, single drug, and multiple drugs).Sixty-four IBD patients (44.8%) in this study had active disease.The DII® score and the EDIP did not differ significantly between active and inactive patients (- 1.45 ± 1.04 vs.- 1.20 ± 1.24; 0.56 ± 0.22 vs. 0.53 ± 0.28, respectively). After adjusting for energy intake, drug use, and IBD type, the odds (95%CIs) of active disease among patients in tertile 3 compared to those in tertile 1 were 0.84 (0.32-2.17) for DII and 1.50 (0.61-3.72) for EDIP; neither of which were statistically significantly different from the rates in tertile 1.Although point estimates were in the expected direction of increased risk, the inflammatory potential of diet, assessed using DII or EDIP, was not associated with severity of disease in IBD patients. Whether diet-related inflammation affects disease activity in patients with IBD deserves further investigations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648810>Limitations of the determination of faecal calprotectin in patients with ulcerative  and inflammatory polyps.</a></h1><p>Faecal calprotectin is a useful technique for detecting activity in patients with ulcerative . However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative . Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative  owing to the presence of inflammatory polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for 2 years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in 5 of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative , inflammatory polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-2,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the inflammatory polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative  activity, but due to other lesions such as inflammatory polyps. This fact must be taken into account before carrying out relevant changes such as step-up therapy to immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs in patients with confirmed high calprotectin levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

However, monitoring individual VWR performance usually requires single housing, which itself might have a negative effect on wellbeing. In consideration of the 3Rs principle, VWR behaviour was evaluated under group-housing conditions. To test the applicability for severity assessment, this readout was evaluated in a dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced  model. For continuous monitoring, an automated system with integrated radio-frequency identification technology was used, enabling detection of individual VWR. After a 14-day adaptation period mice demonstrated a stable running performance. Analysis during DSS treatment in combination with repeated facial vein phlebotomy and faecal sampling procedure resulted in significantly reduced VWR behaviour during the course of  and increased VWR during disease recovery. Mice submitted to phlebotomy and faecal sampling but no DSS treatment showed less reduced VWR but a longer-lasting recovery. Application of a cluster model discriminating individual severity levels based on VWR and body weight data revealed the highest severity level in most of the DSS-treated mice on day 7, but a considerable number of control mice also showed elevated severity levels due to sampling procedures alone. In summary, VWR sensitively indicated the course of DSS  severity and the impact of sample collection. Therefore, monitoring of VWR is a suitable method for the detection of disturbed wellbeing due to DSS  and sampling procedure in group-housed female laboratory mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665969>Defining body-weight reduction as a humane endpoint: a critical appraisal.</a></h1><p>In many animal experiments scientists and local authorities define a body-weight reduction of 20% or more as severe suffering and thereby as a potential parameter for humane endpoint decisions. In this study, we evaluated distinct animal experiments in multiple research facilities, and assessed whether 20% body-weight reduction is a valid humane endpoint criterion in rodents. In most experiments (restraint stress, distinct models for epilepsy, pancreatic resection, liver resection, caloric restrictive feeding and a mouse model for Dravet syndrome) the animals lost less than 20% of their original body weight. In a glioma model, a fast deterioration in body weight of less than 20% was observed as a reliable predictor for clinical deterioration. In contrast, after induction of chronic diabetes or acute  some animals lost more than 20% of their body weight without exhibiting major signs of distress. In these two animal models an exclusive application of the 20% weight loss criterion for euthanasia might therefore result in an unnecessary loss of animals. However, we also confirmed that this criterion can be a valid parameter for defining the humane endpoint in other animal models, especially when it is combined with additional criteria for evaluating distress. In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that experiment and model specific considerations are necessary for the rational integration of the parameter 'weight loss' in severity assessment schemes and humane endpoint criteria. A flexible implementation tailored to the experiment or intervention by scientists and authorities is therefore highly recommended.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673529>Expression of CXC Chemokine Receptors in Acute Ulcerative : Initial Study from an Animal Model.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is an inflammatory disease which is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, crypt abscesses, distortion of the mucosal glands, and goblet cell depletion. The existence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in colon tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of 2 ml 4% acetic acid into the large colon through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639187>Can we Improve the Prognostic Value of Phenotype at Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diagnosis?</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678865>Estrogen receptor β activation ameliorates DSS-induced chronic  by inhibiting inflammation and promoting Treg differentiation.</a></h1><p>Estrogen receptor (ER) β activation has anti-inflammatory activity. However, its effect on the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the underlying mechanism have not been clarified. This study aimed to assess the clinical value of ERβCD4 T cells in IBD patients and examine the anti-inflammatory role of ERβ activation in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic  in mice. We investigated the effects of ERB041 (an ERβ-specific agonist) on inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory T-cell and regulatory T-cell (Treg) responses in murine . We tested the role of ERβ activation on Treg differentiation and its activity to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro. We found that reduced frequency of circulating ERβCD4 T cells in IBD patients was negatively correlated with inflammation and disease severity. ERβ and FoxP3 expression co-localized in the intestinal tissues of IBD patients. Treatment with ERB041 significantly mitigated -induced weight loss, inflammation, and disease severity. It also restored the ERβCD4 T cell population in the spleen and colon lamina propria of these mice. ERB041 treatment inhibited CD4CD25 and CD8 T cell infiltration and restored Tregs and activated T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) Tregs in the colon lamina propria. In vitro, we found that ERβ activation enhanced Treg differentiation, immunosuppression, and TGF-β1/Smad signaling in CD4 T cells. Our data suggest that ERβCD4 T cells represent a potential biomarker for evaluating IBD disease severity, and ERβ activation may be valuable for the treatment of IBD by enhancing the Treg response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, alternative treatments are desperately needed. This work demonstrated that systemic administration of exosomes from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-Exos) significantly mitigated  in various models of IBD. MSC-Exos treatment downregulated inflammatory responses, maintained intestinal barrier integrity and polarized M2b macrophages, but did not favor intestinal fibrosis. Mechanistically, infused MSC-Exos mainly acted on colonic macrophages and macrophages from colitic colons acquired obvious resistance to inflammatory re-stimulation when prepared from mice treated with MSC-Exos versus untreated mice. The beneficial effect of MSC-Exos was blocked by macrophage depletion. Besides, the induction of IL-10 production from macrophages was partially involved in the beneficial effect of MSC-Exos. MSC-Exos were enriched in proteins involved in regulating multiple biological processes associated with the anti-colitic benefit of MSC-Exos. Particularly, metallothionein-2 in MSC-Exos was required for the suppression of inflammatory responses. Taken together, MSC-Exos are critical regulators of inflammatory responses and may be promising candidates for IBD treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670624>Therapeutic effects of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. fruit in traditional and modern medicine: a review.</a></h1><p>Ziziphus jujuba Mill. belonging to the Rhamnaceae family, has been consumed since ancient times as a medicine and food.

Furthermore, we aim to provide recommendations for the clinicians in regard to the acute and long-term management of ischaemic . A review of the English literature over the last 15 years was performed using Embase and Medline. Search terms were ischaemic OR ischemic,  OR colon. Two reviewers screened the papers against pre-determined eligibility criteria. A senior consultant surgeon performed a final overview. Three hundred sixty-eight papers were identified on the initial search; 318 were irrelevant and 17 were conference abstracts; both were excluded. Thirty-three full articles were assessed for suitability; nine were further excluded. Twenty-four articles were included in the final analysis and cross-referenced against those listed in the systematic reviews. There is a large clinical heterogeneity in inclusion criteria (histological, radiological, endoscopic, surgical specimen). Twelve out of 24 articles included patients only based on histological diagnosis. The definition of right and left (or nonright) ischaemic  was variable based on whether hepatic or splenic flexure was used as the cut-off point. Five retrospective case series highlighted that patients with isolated right-sided ischaemic  had a worse prognosis than those with left-sided  (higher mortality, need for surgery, length of hospital stay). The overall recurrence was 9%. There is a need for a higher-level evidence to guide clinicians on the long-term management of patients following an episode of acute colonic ischaemia.

However, the role of SIRT1 in ulcerative  (UC) is still confusing.To investigate the role of SIRT1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in UC and further explore the underlying mechanisms.We developed a coculture model using macrophages and Caco-2 cells. After treatment with the SIRT1 activator SRT1720 or inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM), the expression of occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) was assessed by Western blot analysis. Annexin V-APC/7-AAD assays were performed to evaluate Caco-2 apoptosis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  mice were exposed to SRT1720 or NAM for 7 d. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were conducted to assess apoptosis in colon tissues. The expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12, caspase-9, and caspase-3 in Caco-2 cells and the colon tissues of treated mice were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot.SRT1720 treatment increased the protein levels of occludin and ZO-1 and inhibited Caco-2 apoptosis, whereas NAM administration caused the opposite effects. DSS-induced  mice treated with SRT1720 had a lower disease activity index ( < 0.01), histological score ( < 0.001), inflammatory cytokine levels ( < 0.01), and apoptotic cell rate ( < 0.01), while exposure to NAM caused the opposite effects.

Although a few reports have described a small number of such cases, the relationship between these two disorders is still unclear. We evaluated 27 patients with diagnosis of either ulcerative  (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) and LC/CC. Clinical, endoscopic, and pathological features were reviewed. 10 patients with initial diagnoses of LC (n=2)/CC (n=8) evolved into UC (n=7) or CD (n=3) after a median interval of 14months (range, 2-44months). Among these, 4 patients with LC/CC evolving into IBD also had recurrent CC in a quiescent phase of IBD. Seventeen patients with initial diagnosis of UC (n=11) or CD (n=6) developed LC (n=6)/CC (n=11) after a median interval of 108months (range, 15-548months). IBD patients with initial presentation of LC/CC were significantly older than those who developed LC/CC after onset of IBD (66.5 vs.34.0years old, P=.001). The interval time between LC/CC to IBD was significantly shorter than that of IBD to LC/CC (14 vs. 108months, P=.007). Quiescent UC with superimposed CC was the most common pattern (n=8). Patients with CD had shorter interval time to develop LC/CC than UC patients, although it was not statistically significant (60.5 vs. 139months, P=.14). Endoscopically, most of patients started with LC/CC had unremarkable findings, but 11 of 17 patients who developed LC/CC after IBD showed quiescent chronic . Histologically, LC/CC patients with diagnosis of IBD, either before or after, more frequently show active inflammation. Chronicity was more commonly seen in biopsy of LC/CC patients with a history of IBD. Our study found that IBD patients with initial presentation of LC/CC tend to occur in older age, with shorter interval time and frequent active inflammation in initial LC/CC. These findings suggest that LC/CC maybe a spectrum of IBD as the initial presentation in a subset of older IBD patients. On the other hand, IBD patients can develop LC/CC associated with chronic mucosal injury many years after the onset of IBD (typically with >10years interval time while patients are in remission phase), for which these two processes seem unrelated to each other.Copyright © 2019.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Alpinetin has been shown to improve intestinal barrier homeostasis under  condition, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here, we showed that alpinetin significantly improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in TNF-α-stimulated Caco-2 cells, which was mainly mediated by inhibiting the apoptosis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that alpinetin markedly increased the production of autophagosomes, along with obvious regulation of LC3B-II, beclin-1, p62, Atg7 and Atg5 expressions. In addition, it also markedly repressed the activation of mTORC1 signaling pathway, which was ascribed to TSC2 rather than p-AKT, p-ERK, p-AMPKα or PTEN expressions in Caco-2 and NCM460 cells. Furthermore, the enrichment of H3K9me3 at TSC2 promoter region was decreased and ubiquitin proteasome degradation of suv39h1 was increased. Additionally, alpinetin activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and promoted co-localization of AhR with suv39h1 in the cytoplasm. The relationship between alpinetin-regulated AhR/suv39h1/TSC2/mTORC1 signals, autophagy and apoptosis of Caco-2 and NCM460 cells was confirmed by using CH223191, siAhR, siTSC2 and chloroquine.

Long-term pouch survival and quality of life (QoL) were compared between index and redo IPAAs.There were 305 patients, 253 with an index IPAA and 52 having a redo IPAA. Their median ages were 33 years (index IPAA) and 32 years (redo IPAA) (p = 0.91); there were 47% and 53% men in each group, respectively (p = 0.54). Pouch salvage with redo IPAA was possible in 75% of redo pouches. Biologic agents were given in 8% of index IPAA and 34% redo IPAA patients (p < 0.01). Cumulative Kaplan Meier 5-year pouch survival was 80% vs. 60% in index and redo IPAA (p < 0.0001), at 10 years 74% vs. 38%, respectively (p < 0.0001).

We investigated these consequences by evaluating the effects of IL-6 deletion on the spontaneous  of IL-10 deficient mice (IL-10-/-).IL-6/IL-10 double-deficient mice (IL-6-/-/IL-10-/-) were generated and analyzed for intestinal inflammation, general phenotypes, and molecular/biochemical changes in the colonic mucosa by comparing to those of WT and IL-10-/- mice.Unexpectedly, the IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice manifested more pronounced gut inflammation and earlier disease onset than IL-10-/- mice, both locally (colon and small bowel) and systemically (splenomegaly, ulcerative dermatitis, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and monocytosis). IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice exhibited elevations of multiple cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-12, TNFα) and chemokines (MCP-1 and MIG), but not IFN-γ (Th1), IL-17A and IL-17G (Th17), or IL-22 (Th22). FOXP3 and TGF-β, two key factors for Regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation, were significantly down-regulated in the colonic mucosa, but not in the thymus or mesenteric lymph nodes, of IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice. CTLA-4 was diminished while iNOS was upregulated in the colonic mucosa of IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice.In IL-10-/- mice, complete IL-6 blockade significantly aggravates gut inflammation, at least in part by suppressing Treg/CTLA-4 and promoting the IL-1β/Th2 pathway. In addition, the double mutant exhibits signs of severe systemic inflammation. Our data define a new function of IL-6 and suggest that caution should be exercised when targeting IL-6 in IBD patients, particularly those with defects in IL-10 signaling.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

The activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling promotes inflammation in  of mice, but the role of TLR4 in intestinal tumorigenesis is not yet clear. About 80%-90% of colorectal tumours contain inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) tumour suppressor, and intestinal adenoma carcinogenesis in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is also closely related to the germline mutations in Apc. The Apc (multiple intestinal neoplasia) model mouse is a well-utilized model of FAP, an inherited form of intestinal cancer. In this study, Apc intestinal adenoma mice were generated on TLR4-sufficient and TLR4-deficient backgrounds to investigate the carcinogenic effect of TLR4 in mouse gut by comparing mice survival, peripheral blood cells, bone marrow haematopoietic precursor cells and numbers of polyps in the guts of Apc WT and Apc TLR4 mice. The results revealed that TLR4 had a critical role in promoting spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. Significant differential genes were screened out by the high-throughput RNA-Seq method. After combining these results with KEGG enrichment data, it was determined that TLR4 might promote intestinal tumorigenesis by activating cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in cancer signalling pathways. After a series of validation experiments for the concerned genes, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF (CSF2), IL11, CCL3, S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly decreased in gut tumours of Apc TLR4 mice compared with Apc WT mice. In the functional study of core down-regulation factors, it was found that IL6, GM-CSF, IL11, CCL3 and S100A8/9 increased the viability of colon cancer cell lines and decreased the apoptosis rate of colon cancer cells with irradiation and chemical treatment.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to determine the association with disease activity and intestinal permeability.Uc.261 level in colon mucosa and Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) were evaluated in 20 active CD patients. Uc.261 expression and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were determined in Caco2 and T84 cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. Body weight, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological index (HI), intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran, uc.261, and tight junction proteins (TJPs) levels were evaluated in BALB/C mice treated with saline enema, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol enema, and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody injection, respectively.Uc.261 expression was overexpressed in CD patients, TNF-α treated cells, and  mice. Uc.261 expression was positively correlated with HBI ( = 0.582,  = 0.007) in CD patients, and positively correlated with TNF-α concentration and negatively correlated TEER in Caco2 and T84 cells (all  < 0.05). Furthermore, uc.261 was positively correlated with DAI ( = 0.824,  = 0.008), HI ( = 0.672,  = 0.021), and intestinal permeability ( = 0.636,  = 0.012), while negatively correlated with body weight ( = -0.574,  = 0.035), colon length ( = -0.866,  = 0.017), and TJP expression (all  < 0.05) in  mice.Uc.261 expression was closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in CD. Anti-TNF-α treatment may play its role through suppressing uc.261 expression in  mice.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676056>Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Special Considerations.</a></h1><p>Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease may present differently than adult onset disease. It is important to consider a broader differential diagnosis in very early onset disease. Diagnostic and treatment decisions must consider the long term risks and benefits over a lifetime. Surgical triggers in children may include impaired growth and inability to wean from steroids in addition to standard adult indications. Effective transition of care to adult providers is a key to prevent flares and loss of follow-up.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is well established that the imbalance between Tregs and Th17 cells play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of UC. In this study, we investigated the impact of functional changes in Treg subsets on Treg/Th17 ratio, and further explored their clinical significance in the activity of UC. Treg subsets were comprehensively analyzed using flow cytometry and in vitro cultured in both active and remission UC patients, of which nine active UC patients were further followed up. The correlation analyses were performed to explore the potential associations between Treg subsets and clinical indicators, as well as the impact of serum cytokines, detected by ELISA, on IL-17A secretion and CCR6 co-expression of Treg subsets. In active UC patients, we found CD45RA FoxP3 Tregs were obviously decreased and inversely correlated with disease activity, while CD45RA FoxP3 Tregs were increased and positively correlated with disease activity. Meanwhile, IL-17A secretion and CCR6 co-expression levels in Tregs were significantly increased in active UC. Moreover, Tregs co-expressing CCR6 possess higher level of IL-17A secretion. In nine followed-up patients, we observed down-regulated IL-17A secreting and CCR6 co-expression when achieving remission from active stage. In addition, IL-17A FoxP3 and IL-17A FoxP3 CCR6 Tregs were positively correlated with serum IL-21 and disease activity, respectively. These findings suggested that up-regulated IL-17A secretion and CCR6 co-expression in Treg subsets may be related to the imbalance between Treg and Th17 cells, and associated with the disease activity in UC patients.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689519>Phloretin ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative  in mice by regulating the gut microbiota.</a></h1><p>Phloretin, extracted from the pericarp and velamen of apples or pears, is a dihydrochalcone flavonoid with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. It has been reported that phloretin has anti-inflammatory effects in ulcerative  (UC) mice. However, the role of the gut microbiota in the phloretin anti-UC process remains unclear. In this study, we observed that the anti-UC effect of phloretin was affected by co-housing, probably because of the transmissible nature of the gut micobiota. Through fecal micobiota transplantation (FMT), the effects of the gut microbiota on the anti-UC of phloretin were further confirmed. UC was induced in mice by administrating 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. Phloretin (60 mg/kg) was administered by gavage every day during the experiment. Fecal microbes (10 CFU/mL) from phloretin-treated UC mice were administered by gavage to non-phloretin-treated UC mice for 7 days. The results showed that FMT, like phloretin, ameliorated UC by improving disease symptoms and colon inflammation, balancing inflammatory cytokines, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, restoring systemic immune function, inhibiting NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorating the oxidant stress. Both FMT and phloretin treatment increased the levels of Bacteroidetes, Alistipes and Lactobacillus and decreased those of Firmicutes, Oscillibacter and Ruminiclostridium_6. Correlation analysis between gut microbes and micro-environmental factors revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively correlated with DAI, pathological score, and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels, and Alistipes was more abundant in phloretin or FMT treated UC mice. Oscillibacter abundance was significantly positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-1β levels and pathological score, and Oscillibacter was increased in UC mice. Furthermore, network analysis of the dominant genera revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively related to Oscillibacter abundance. In conclusion, this study suggests that the anti-UC effects of phloretin are achieved through regulation of the gut microbiota and phloretin has the potential to be developed as a promising agent for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2019.

Children who received conventional therapy (including 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176 IBD patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [2.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.2% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up. Higher CRP [1.006 (1.001-1.011)], lower albumin [1.050 (1.012-1.086)] and growth impairment [1.214 (1.014-1.373)] in CD patients and higher PUCAI score [1.038 (1.006-1.072)] and low iron [1.023 (1.003-1.043)] in UC patients were associated with treatment failure (all p < 0.05).Only 32% pediatric IBD patients will remain free of biologics or surgery 5-years after diagnosis. Especially children with a high disease burden at diagnosis were more likely to fail conventional therapy.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p></html>
