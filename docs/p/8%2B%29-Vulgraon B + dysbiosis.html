Here, we evaluate gut microbiota alterations and host cytokine responses in a population of Taiwanese patients with PD.Fecal microbiota communities from 80 patients with PD and 77 age and gender-matched controls were assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Diet and comorbidities were controlled in the analyses. Plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-18, GM-CSF, IFNγ, and TNFα were measured by a multiplex immunoassay and relationships between microbiota, clinical characteristics, and cytokine levels were analyzed in the PD group. We further examined the cytokine changes associated with the altered gut microbiota seen in patients with PD in another independent cohort of 120 PD patients and 120 controls.Microbiota from patients with PD was altered relative to controls and dominated by Verrucomicrobia, Mucispirillum, Porphyromonas, Lactobacillus, and Parabacteroides. In contrast, Prevotella was more abundant in controls. The abundances of Bacteroides were more increased in patients with non-tremor PD subtype than patients with tremor subtype. Bacteroides abundance was correlated with motor symptom severity defined by UPDRS part III motor scores (rho = 0.637 [95% confidence interval 0.474 to 0.758], P < 0.01). Altered microbiota was correlated with plasma concentrations of IFNγ and TNFα. There was a correlation between Bacteroides and plasma level of TNFα (rho = 0.638 [95% CI: 0.102-0.887], P = 0.02); and a correlation between Verrucomicrobia abundance and plasma concentrations of IFNγ (rho = 0.545 [95% CI - 0.043-0.852], P = 0.05). The elevated plasma cytokine responses were confirmed in an additional independent 120 patients with PD and 120 controls (TNFα: PD vs. control 8.51 ± 4.63 pg/ml vs. 4.82 ± 2.23 pg/ml, P < 0.01; and IFNγ: PD vs. control: 38.45 ± 7.12 pg/ml vs. 32.79 ± 8.03 pg/ml, P = 0.03).This study reveals altered gut microbiota in PD and its correlation with clinical phenotypes and severity in our population. The altered plasma cytokine profiles associated with gut microbiome composition alterations suggest aberrant immune responses may contribute to inflammatory processes in PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851248>Lactobacillus fermentum Improves Tacrolimus-Induced Hypertension by Restoring Vascular Redox State and Improving eNOS Coupling.</a></h2><p>The aim is to analyze whether the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (LC40) can prevent endothelial dysfunction and hypertension induced by tacrolimus in mice.Tacrolimus increases systolic blood pressure (SBP) and impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and these effects are partially prevented by LC40. Endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus is related to both increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-driven superoxide production and Rho-kinase-mediated eNOS inhibition. LC40 treatment prevents all the aortic changes induced by tacrolimus. LC40 restores the imbalance between T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T (Treg) cells induced by tacrolimus in mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen. Tacrolimus-induced gut , that is, it decreases microbial diversity, increases the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio and decreases acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria, and these effects are prevented by LC40. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from LC40-treated mice to control mice prevents the increase in SBP and the impaired relaxation to acetylcholine induced by tacrolimus.LC40 treatment prevents hypertension and endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus by inhibiting gut . These effects are associated with a reduction in vascular oxidative stress, mainly through NOX2 downregulation and prevention of eNOS uncoupling, and inflammation possibly because of decreased Th17 and increased Treg cells polarization in mesenteric lymph nodes.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Such pathological condition is even more prevailing in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Of note, indoxyl sulphate (IS), a gut-derived uremic toxin, is notorious for its pro-inflammatory feature in CKD patients. IS accumulates in the body as the urinary excretion of uremic toxins is impaired, and further worsens the kidney function in a vicious cycle to CKD. Dietary restriction in vegetables, fruits and yogurt leads to the predominance of indole-producing intestinal microbial flora and further exaggerates the accumulation of IS in CKD patients. Recently, interventional studies have shown that circulating IS can be reduced by dietary prebiotic and/or probiotic supplements. However, further randomized controlled trials are warranted to examine whether such beneficial effect of dietary prebiotic/probiotic supplements could be extrapolated to better hard outcomes in CKD population. In this review, we would also like to emphasize the importance of achieving sufficient intake of dietary fibre by proper vegetable pre-treatment and accurate fruit selection, instead of directly avoiding these potassium-rich yet fibre-rich and base-producing foods.© 2018 The Authors Nephrology published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30280940>Pembrolizumab for the treatment of gastric cancer.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer is one of a few gastrointestinal malignancies in which immunotherapy has shown meaningful activity.

Recently, metabolic disorders have been associated with most cases of patients with ASD. The aim of this study was to investigate, through a new and more sophisticated mass technique, such as UHPLC-mass spectrometry (Q-exactive analyzer), alteration in metabolisms analyzing ASD children urine samples from children showing simultaneous vitamin B6, B9 and B12 deficiencies. This in order to study how these concurrent deficiencies may influence some phenotypic aspects of autistic disorder. Thus, urinary metabolic patterns specific to ASD were explored at an early age in 60 children with ASD, showing lower three vitamins levels, and 60 corresponding controls (age group 3-8, M: F=42:18). The results showed significant block of cystathionine formation with consequent accumulation of homocysteine. A lower glutathione levels (GSH), with reduction of essential intracellular reducing environment required for normal immune function, detoxification capacity and redox-sensitive enzyme activity. Increased concentration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which leads to a lower availability of methyl group and significant decrease in urinary methionine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) concentrations, the major methyl donor. The latter justify the well-known reduction in protein and DNA methylation reported in autistic children. As a final consideration, the concomitant deficiencies of all three  vitamins, recorded in a significant number of autistic children, suggests that intestinal  in these patients may be the main cause of a reduction in their absorption, in addition to the genetic mutation of a specific gene.Copyright © 2019.

An increasing number of studies indicate that dietary amino acids play significant roles in preventing and treating intestinal inflammation. The review aims to summarize the functions and signaling mechanisms of amino acids in intestinal inflammation. Amino acids, including essential amino acids (EAAs), conditionally essential amino acids (CEAAs), and nonessential amino acids (NEAAs), improve the functions of intestinal barrier and expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines and tight junction proteins but decrease oxidative stress and the apoptosis of enterocytes as well as the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines in the intestinal inflammation. The functions of amino acids are associated with various signaling pathways, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), nuclear factor-kappa- (NF-), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2), general controlled nonrepressed kinase 2 (GCN2), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630898>Gut Microbiota Promotes Tumor Growth in Mice by Modulating Immune Response.</a></h2><p>We studied the effects of gut microbiome depletion by oral antibiotics on tumor growth in subcutaneous and liver metastases models of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. Gut microbiome depletion significantly reduced tumor burden in all the models tested. However, depletion of gut microbiome did not reduce tumor growth in Rag1-knockout mice, which lack mature T and  cells. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that gut microbiome depletion led to significant increase in interferon gamma-producing T cells with corresponding decrease in interleukin 17A and interleukin 10-producing T cells. Our results suggest that gut microbiome modulation could emerge as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Through meta-analytic synthesis, accumulating evidence from prospective or database cohorts suggests a link between infant antibiotic treatment and the development of atopy. Stronger associations seen with multiple course and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment add to biological plausibility. A major bias, confounding by indication, has been addressed in studies on antibiotic treatment of conditions which do not precede allergic disease. Areas covered: Our review provides an up-to-date synthesis of the current literature on associations between infant antibiotic exposure and future allergic disease. We discuss methods that assist in reducing study bias and look at new insights from studies of the infant gut microbiome. Expert commentary: Large-scale profiling of the gut microbiome provides a new tool for disentangling biases found in observational studies of infant antibiotic use. To date, microbial  of the infant gut has been reported to predict allergic disease independent of antibiotic exposure up to 3 months after birth. However, these studies have not accounted for antibiotic treatment in later infancy. Continued study of the infant gut microbiome, mycobiome, or resistome will provide a closer link to antibiotic treatment or refute it as a cause of allergic disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382927>Association of Constipation with risk of end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem. Many risk factors were identified and interventions were applied accordingly, but the incidence of end-stage renal disease continued increasing. Some other risk factors may be ignored. Gut  has been recognized as an important endogenous organ. The kidney-gut axis would contribute to gut dysbiosis, which might worsen CKD. Constipation, commonly seen in CKD, was one of the clinical presentation of gut dysbiosis. The clinical impact of constipation to CKD remains unknown. Our study aimed at assessing the risk of ESRD between CKD patients with and without constipation in a nationwide database.We identified newly diagnosed cases of CKD without constipation history before in 2000-2011 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Subjects who developed constipation later formed constipation group. The others without constipation matched by propensity score formed non-constipation group. The incidence rates and hazards of ESRD in patients with and without constipation by the end of 2013 were compared by using Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable.The incidences of ESRD per 1000 person-years were 22.9 for constipation group and 12.2 for non-constipation group, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.90 (95% CI, 1.60-2.27). Compared to the CKD patients without constipation, adjusted hazard ratio for the CKD patients with laxatives < 33, 33-197 and ≥ 198 days per year were 0.45 (0.31-0.63), 1.85 (1.47-2.31) and 4.41 (3.61-5.39) respectively.In a population of newly-diagnosed CKD patients, we observed that subjects with de novo constipation, as compared with non-constipation, have increased risk of developing ESRD. More severe constipation would increase the risk further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258540>Manipulation of Gut Microbiota Influences Immune Responses, Axon Preservation, and Motor Disability in a Model of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota  has been implicated in MS and other immune diseases, although it remains unclear how manipulating the gut microbiota may affect the disease course. Using a well-established model of progressive MS triggered by intracranial infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), we sought to determine whether  induced by oral antibiotics (ABX) administered on pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease influences its course. We also addressed the effects of microbiota recolonization after ABX withdrawn in the presence or absence of probiotics. Central and peripheral immunity, plasma acetate and butyrate levels, axon damage and motor disability were evaluated. The cocktail of ABX prevented motor dysfunction and limited axon damage in mice, which had fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS, while gut microbiota recolonization worsened motor function and axonal integrity. The underlying mechanisms of ABX protective effects seem to involve CD4CD39 T cells and CD5CD1d  cells into the CNS. In addition, microglia adopted a round amoeboid morphology associated to an anti-inflammatory gene profile in the spinal cord of TMEV mice administered ABX. The immune changes in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were modest, yet ABX treatment of mice limited IL-17 production . Collectively, our results provide evidence of the functional relevance of gut microbiota manipulation on the neurodegenerative state and disease severity in a model of progressive MS and reinforce the role of gut microbiota as target for MS treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30058404>Changes of intestinal microbiota in early life.</a></h2><p>There is an increasing evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in the maturation of the immune system and in the prevention of diseases occurring during the neonatal period, childhood, and adulthood. A number of nonphysiological conditions during the perinatal period (i.e. caesarean section, prolonged hospitalization, formula feeding, low gestational age) may negatively affect the normal development of the microbiota, leading to decreased amounts of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and increased amounts of Clostridia. In addition, perinatal antibiotics can cause intestinal  that has been associated with short- and long-term diseases. For example, prolonged early empiric antibiotics increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) in preterm neonates, whereas the administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, and atopic conditions, such as eczema and wheezing. Promoting breastfeeding, reducing the length of hospital stay, and reducing unnecessary antibiotic therapies are useful strategies to counterbalance unintended effects of these conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425977>Regulation of Nuclear Factor Kappa-Light-Chain-Enhancer of Activated  Cells (NF-κβ) in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing both Crohn Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are globally prevalent diseases, impacting children of all ages. The hallmark of IBD is a perturbed immune system that leads to continuous inflammation in the gut and challenges optimal treatment. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κβ), a nuclear transcription factor, plays a major role in gut homeostasis and contributes significantly toward a balanced, homeostatic immune system. Dysregulation in the NF-κβ pathway and factors that regulate it lead to a state of uncontrolled inflammation and altered immunity, as typically observed in IBD. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines that are regulated through NF-κβ are increased in both CD and UC. Genes known to activate NF-κβ, such as, Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) and Interleukin 23 (IL-23), are associated with IBD. Factors involved in inhibition of NF-κβ, such as A20 and TOLLIP, are also affected in IBD, resulting in failed inflammation suppression/regulation. NOD-2 and A20 have specifically been found to be strongly associated with pediatric IBD. Gut commensals are known to exert anti-inflammatory activities toward NF-κβ and can have a potential role in attenuating inflammation that likely occurs due to microbial  in IBD. Failure to terminate/downregulate NF-κβ signaling results in chronic inflammation in IBD. Well-regulated control of inflammation in children with IBD can help better control the disease and suppress immune responses. Better understanding of factors that control NF-κβ can potentially lead toward discovering targeted therapeutic interventions for IBD. Suppression of NF-κβ can be achieved through many modalities including anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs), siRNA (small interfering RNA), factors regulating NF-κβ, and microbes. This review focuses on the role of NF-κβ, especially in pediatric IBD, and potential therapeutic venues for attenuating NF-κβ-induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429354>Commensal bacteria contribute to insulin resistance in aging by activating innate B1a cells.</a></h2><p>Aging in humans is associated with increased hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (collectively termed IR) and dysregulation of the immune system. However, the causative factors underlying their association remain unknown. Here, using "healthy" aged mice and macaques, we found that IR was induced by activated innate 4-1BBL B1a cells. These cells (also known as 4BL cells) accumulated in aging in response to changes in gut commensals and a decrease in beneficial metabolites such as butyrate. We found evidence suggesting that loss of the commensal bacterium  impaired intestinal integrity, causing leakage of bacterial products such as endotoxin, which activated CCR2 monocytes when butyrate was decreased. Upon infiltration into the omentum, CCR2 monocytes converted B1a cells into 4BL cells, which, in turn, induced IR by expressing 4-1BBL, presumably to trigger 4-1BB receptor signaling as in obesity-induced metabolic disorders. This pathway and IR were reversible, as supplementation with either  or the antibiotic enrofloxacin, which increased the abundance of , restored normal insulin response in aged mice and macaques. In addition, treatment with butyrate or antibodies that depleted CCR2 monocytes or 4BL cells had the same effect on IR. These results underscore the pathological function of B1a cells and suggest that the microbiome-monocyte- cell axis could potentially be targeted to reverse age-associated IR.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Using spectrophotometric analysis, the activity of β-galactosidase (Gal), β-glucosidase (Glu) and β-glucuronidase (Gluс) was studied in the content of the cecum of Wistar rats receiving a semi-synthetic diet and a 20% solution of fructose instead of drinking water (hfr diet) or a semi-synthetic diet with a high (30%) fat content and a 20% solution of fructose instead of drinking water (hf/hfr diet). . Feeding rats with the hfr diet for 20 weeks led to the suppression of Gal activity by 35, Glu by 46 and Gluс by 31%. With the inclusion of quercetin in the hfr diet at a dose of 34 mg/kg .w. enzyme activity was restored to the control values and exceeded the level of activity in rats fed hfr ration without quercetin by 60, 100 and 47%, respectively, for Gal, Glu, and Gluс. Feeding rats with the hf/hfr diet for 10 weeks did not have a significant impact on the activity of bacterial enzymes. The inclusion of resveratrol in the hf/hfr diet at a dose of 10 mg/kg .w. resulted in a decrease in Glu activity by 58 and Gluс by 28%, and an increase in resveratrol dose to 100 mg/kg .w. caused further suppression of Gal activity by 30, Glu by 76 and Gluc by 64% comparative to the activity in rats on the hf/hfr diet without resveratrol. . The obtained data suggest that quercetin restores reduced by hfr diet activity of glycosyl hydrolases of the cecum microflora of rats, most likely due to an increase in the representation of the types of enzyme activity carriers. The suppressive effect of resveratrol on the activity of glycosyl hydrolases of the cecum microflora of rats fed a hf/hfr diet may be the result of its direct action on enzymes and is not associated with the effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.Copyright© GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30509441>The role of HLA-*27 in spondyloarthritis.</a></h2><p>The mechanism by which HLA-*27 predisposes to spondyloarthritis remains unresolved. Arthritogenic peptides have not been defined in humans and are not involved in experimental models of spondyloarthritis. Aberrant properties of HLA-*27 can activate the IL-23/IL-17 axis in HLA-*27 transgenic rats and humans. In HLA-*27-independent rodent models, spondyloarthritis can be driven by IL-23 triggering entheseal-resident CD4/CD8 T cells or CD4 Th17 T cells.

Studies have demonstrated alterations in the gut microbiota in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to characterize the gut microbiota of fistulizing perianal CD.Stool and fistula samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for CD-related anorectal fistulae. Microbial compositions of matched stool and fistula samples were characterized using 16S rRNA gene profiling. The effect of sample type, patient gender, disease classification (Montreal A/), disease activity (Harvey Bradshaw Index), antibiotic use, and presence of active proctitis on microbial composition was assessed.Samples were obtained from 18 patients. Bacteroides was the most abundant genera across all samples collected, followed by Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium. Bifidobacterium was present at significantly higher levels in fecal samples than fistula samples, whereas Achromobacter and Corynebacterium were present at significantly higher levels in fistula samples.

Chronic intestinal inflammation develops against resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. We hypothesized that host intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) G can be used to identify bacteria involved in IBD pathogenesis.IgG-bound and -unbound microorganisms were collected from 32 pediatric terminal ileum aspirate washes during colonoscopy [non-IBD (n = 10), Crohn disease (n = 15), and ulcerative colitis (n = 7)], and composition was assessed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. In vitro analysis of invasive capacity was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and gentamicin invasion assay; immune activation was measured by qPCR. Despite considerable inter-individual variations, IgG binding favored specific and unique mucosa-associated species in pediatric IBD patients. Burkholderia cepacia, Flavonifractor plautii, and Rumminococcus sp. demonstrated increased IgG binding, while Pseudomonas ST29 demonstrated reduced IgG binding, in IBD. In vitro validation confirmed that . cepacia, F. plautii, and Rumminococcus display invasive potential while Pseudomonas protogens did not.Using IgG as a marker of pathobionts in larger patient cohorts to identify microbes and elucidate their role in IBD pathogenesis will potentially underpin new strategies to facilitate development of novel, targeted diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches.

The evidence suggests that this pathogenic gut-brain circuit involves: (i) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the GI-tract resident enterotoxigenic Gram-negative bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (BF-LPS); (ii) LPS transit across the GI-tract barrier into the systemic circulation; (iii) transport of a highly pro-inflammatory systemic BF-LPS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain-parenchyma and neuronal-cytoplasm; (iv) activation and signaling via the pro-inflammatory NF-kB (p50/p65) transcription-factor complex; (v) NF-kB-coupling and significant up-regulation of the inducible pro-inflammatory microRNA-146a (miRNA-146a) and microRNA-155 (miRNA-155); each containing multiple NF-kB DNA-binding and activation sites in their immediate promoters; and (vi) subsequent down-regulation of miRNA-146a-miRNA-155 regulated mRNA targets such as that encoding complement factor H (CFH), a soluble complement control glycoprotein and key repressor of the innate-immune response.

Faecal and digesta samples were collected repeatedly during the study. Selected samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, culture counts, and organic acid, biogenic amine and tissue gene expression analysis. Treatment had a significant effect on the faecal microbial community composition on day 28 and 42, and colonic community on day 28. Faecal species richness (observed and estimated) and Shannon index, and colonic species richness, were higher in AB compared to PRO piglets on day 28, and were not significantly different from day 42. PRO piglets had the highest faecal concentration of iso-butyric acid on day 7 and a higher butyric acid concentration compared to CTRL piglets.

Recent evidence indicated that microbiota  plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and metabolism-related disorders. The circadian clock system originally identified in the brain was later found in the gastrointestinal tract. Although the light-controlled central clock in the brain is responsible for the synchronization of peripheral clocks, the timing of meal consumption serves as another cue for the rhythmic setting of gastrointestinal digestion, absorption, and epithelial renewal and barrier functions. Multiple lines of evidence have indicated that in addition to daylight and food intake, microbiota (as an environmental factor) are involved in the circadian control of gut homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that microbial metabolites and innate signaling orchestrate the host circadian rhythm, revealing unforeseen molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory role of microbiota in intestinal physiology and systemic metabolism. In this review, we discuss the host-microbe interplay that contributes to the regulation of intestinal clock signals and physiological functions and explore how microbiota  may cause misalignment of circadian systems leading to the development of chronic inflammatory and metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864231>Current understanding of the role of gut  in type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that results from destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells.

Fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome, one of the chronic liver diseases in laying hens, has great similarity to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans. It is characterized by the pathological accumulation of liver fat. Non-invasive techniques are needed for early identification of fibrosis. As primary de novo lipogenesis in the liver of chicken is similar to that of humans, mature chicken is an ideal animal model for the understanding of NAFLD. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationships between gut microbiota and natural chronic liver disease (i.e., non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH] and fibrosis stages) in a well-characterized laying hen population. One hundred 20-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were used and fed with basal diets until 52 wk of age. At the end of the experiment, birds were killed for sampling blood, liver, and cecal contents, and then classified by liver histology measurement into different groups. We investigated microbial community structure of cecum using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Subjects in stage 0 fibrosis without NASH were classified as low NAFLD (Group A), subjects in stage 1-2 fibrosis with mild to moderate NASH were defined as low NASH (Group ), and subjects in stage 3 fibrosis were defined as severe NASH (Group C). The abundance of Firmicutes was reduced in Groups  and C (P < 0.001), whereas opposite results were observed for the abundance of Bacteroidetes. Additionally, the families Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae Lachnospiraceae, and lactobacillae were significantly different between groups of differing fibrosis stages (P < 0.001), driven entirely by alterations of Bacteroides and lactobacillus and lachnospiraceae genera (P < 0.001), were observed. Results indicated that cecal  was linked with the severity of fibrosis and NASH; importantly, increased levels of serum AST, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid were accompanied with liver fibrosis and NASH severity. Collectively, these data highlight the role of gut-liver axis and associations between the gut microbiota and fibrosis and NASH severity.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30459840>Intestinal probiotics restore the ecological fitness decline of  by irradiation.</a></h2><p>The sterile insect technique (SIT) as an eco-friendly and reliable strategy has been used to control populations of insect pests of agricultural, veterinary and human health importance. Successful applications of SIT rely on the high-level ecological fitness of sterile males. A suitable and stable gut microbiome can contribute to the ecological fitness of insect by influencing their physiology, biochemistry and development processes. Here, we show that a shift in the gut bacterial composition and structure by sterilizing irradiation, characterized by a decrease in the major gut microbiota community Enterobacteriaceae, an expansion of the minor members (e.g., Bacillaceae) and a higher richness and diversity, is tightly linked to radiation-induced ecological fitness (male mating competitiveness, flight capacity, survival rate and life span) decline in  (Hendel) sterile males. Function prediction of gut microbiota indicated that changes in microbiome taxonomy tend to drive microbiome functional shifts. A higher nutrient consumption of the flourishing minor gut microbiota may cause a decline in nutrients and energy metabolic activity of host and then result in the reduced ecological fitness of irradiated flies. Furthermore, we found that a gut bacterial strain  (BD177) can restore ecological fitness by improving food intake and increasing haemolymph sugar and amino acid levels of irradiated  flies. Our findings suggest that gut symbiont-based probiotics can be used as agents for reversing radiation-induced ecological fitness decrease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252582>Metagenomic analysis of intestinal mucosa revealed a specific eukaryotic gut virome signature in early-diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Intestinal  is one of the causes underlying the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Besides bacteria, microbiota comprises both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together compose the gut virome. Few works have defined the viral composition of stools, while the virome populating intestinal mucosae from early-diagnosed IBD patients has never been studied. Here we show that, by in-depth metagenomic analysis of RNA-Seq data obtained from gut mucosae of young treatment-naïve patients, early-diagnosed for CD and UC, and from healthy subjects (Ctrl), UC patients display significantly higher levels of eukaryotic Hepadnaviridae transcripts by comparison with both Ctrl and CD patients, whereas CD patients show increased abundance of Hepeviridae versus Ctrl. Moreover, we found that UC gut mucosa is characterized by lower levels of Polydnaviridae and Tymoviridae, whereas the mucosa of patients with CD showed a reduced abundance of Virgaviridae. Our findings support the idea that certain eukaryotic viruses might trigger intestinal inflammation and contribute to IBD pathogenesis and pave the way not only for the discovery of novel diagnostic biomarkers but also for the development of anti-viral drugs for the treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252579>Learning from the research on amebiasis and gut microbiome: Is stimulation by gut flora essential for effective neutrophil mediated protection from external pathogens?</a></h2><p>Amebiasis, caused by intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica, is one of the leading causes of parasite infection-related mortality and morbidity globally. Although its pathogenesis, including determinant factors of infection outcome, remains unclear, recent clinical data indicate that the gut microbiome plays a role in determining the severity of amebiasis. Recently, we investigated the effects of the gut microbiome on neutrophil mediated protection from E. histolytica infection using a mouse model. We identified that surface expression of CXCR2 on neutrophils was diminished in mice with , which resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment to the infection site, allowing more aggressive intestinal tissue damage by E. histolytica. Our results indicated that oxidase activity during E. histolytica infection was also diminished after , consistent with the results from prior research. Thus, the gut microbiome plays an important role in regulating neutrophil phenotype when fighting against external pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669633>Development and validation of GC-MS/MS method useful in diagnosing intestinal .</a></h2><p> is a disorder of the bacterial flora of the human digestive tract.

The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as  markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, has long been associated with bacterial infections and inflammation-causing immunosenescence. Recent studies examining the intestinal microbiota of AD patients revealed that their microbiome differs from that of subjects without dementia. In this work, we prospectively enrolled 108 nursing home elders and followed each for up to 5 months, collecting longitudinal stool samples from which we performed metagenomic sequencing and  T84 intestinal epithelial cell functional assays for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, a critical mediator of intestinal homeostasis. Our analysis identified clinical parameters as well as numerous microbial taxa and functional genes that act as predictors of AD dementia in comparison to elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We further demonstrate that stool samples from elders with AD can induce lower P-gp expression levels  those samples from elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We also paired functional studies with machine learning approaches to identify bacterial species differentiating the microbiome of AD elders from that of elders without dementia, which in turn are accurate predictors of the loss of dysregulation of the P-gp pathway. We observed that the microbiome of AD elders shows a lower proportion and prevalence of bacteria with the potential to synthesize butyrate, as well as higher abundances of taxa that are known to cause proinflammatory states. Therefore, a potential nexus between the intestinal microbiome and AD is the modulation of intestinal homeostasis by increases in inflammatory, and decreases in anti-inflammatory, microbial metabolism. Studies of the intestinal microbiome and AD have demonstrated associations with microbiome composition at the genus level among matched cohorts. We move this body of literature forward by more deeply investigating microbiome composition via metagenomics and by comparing AD patients against those without dementia and with other dementia types. We also exploit machine learning approaches that combine both metagenomic and clinical data. Finally, our functional studies using stool samples from elders demonstrate how the c microbiome of AD elders can affect intestinal health via dysregulation of the P-glycoprotein pathway. P-glycoprotein dysregulation contributes directly to inflammatory disorders of the intestine. Since AD has been long thought to be linked to chronic bacterial infections as a possible etiology, our findings therefore fill a gap in knowledge in the field of AD research by identifying a nexus between the microbiome, loss of intestinal homeostasis, and inflammation that may underlie this neurodegenerative disorder.Copyright © 2019 Haran et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443102>Colonization by . infantis EVC001 modulates enteric inflammation in exclusively breastfed infants.</a></h2><p>Infant gut dysbiosis, often associated with low abundance of bifidobacteria, is linked to impaired immune development and inflammation-a risk factor for increased incidence of several childhood diseases.

The fecal  was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA, proinflammatory cytokines using multiplexed immunoassay, and fecal calprotectin using ELISA at three time points: days 6 (Baseline), 40, and 60 postnatal.Fecal calprotectin concentration negatively correlated with Bifidobacterium abundance (P < 0.0001; ρ = -0.72), and proinflammatory cytokines correlated with Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, yet negatively correlated with Bifidobacteriaceae abundance. Proinflammatory cytokines were significantly lower in EVC001-fed infants on days 40 and 60 postnatally compared to baseline and compared to control infants.Our findings indicate that gut dysbiosis (absence of . infantis) is associated with increased intestinal inflammation.

However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which CHD results in intestinal damage remains incomplete. Here, we investigated the impact of chronic drinking on transcriptional and functional responses of lamina propria leukocytes (LPLs) isolated from the 4 major gut sections. Although no significant differences were detected between LPLs isolated from the ethanol and control groups at resting state within each major gut section, our analysis uncovered key regional differences in composition and function of LPLs independent of alcohol consumption. However, in response to phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin, duodenal LPLs from ethanol-drinking animals generated a dampened response, whereas jejunal and ileal LPLs from ethanol-drinking animals produced a heightened response. Transcriptional responses following stimulation were pronounced in ileal and duodenal LPLs from the ethanol-drinking group but less evident in jejunal and colonic LPLs compared with controls, suggesting a more significant impact of alcohol on these gut regions.

Polyphenols and fibers, often eaten together, have been reported to have prebiotic actions, but their health promoting benefits still need to be further characterized and defined. This study attempted to understand how polyphenol rutin and polysaccharide inulin influence intestinal health in mouse model fed a HF (60 kcal%) diet. A total of 48 C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups fed with a low fat (10% kcal%) control diet (LC), a high fat control diet (HC), a high-fat diet supplemented with rutin (HR), or a high-fat diet supplemented rutin and inulin (HRI) for 20 weeks. Rutin supplementation reduced the HF diet-induced increase of / (F/) ratio,  population and plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( < 0.05); ameliorated inflammation as indicated by the decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines ( < 0.05) and the reduced expressions of intestinal inflammatory mediators ( < 0.05); and attenuated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in Paneth cells as indicated by the decreased expressions of the ER markers ( < 0.05). Compared to the rutin supplementation alone, the co-administration of rutin with inulin improved the utilization of rutin as indicated by its decreased excretion, suppressed a number of harmful bacteria including  and  ( < 0.05), and further reduced the expression of the key inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and increased the production of butyrate, despite the supplementation of inulin reversed the decrease of body weight induced by rutin supplementation due to an increased food intake.

Rosemary extracts (RE), the crucial active constituents extracted from  Linn, have drawn wide concerns because of their potential for anti-inflammatory effects. However, no study has highlighted the antidepressant effects of RE on chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice, and the inflammatory mechanisms related to gut microbiome have not yet been elucidated. This study showed that depressive-like behaviors, gut microbiota , and activation of inflammatory reactions in the hippocampus and serum of CRS mice, as well as activation of inflammatory reactions in BV-2 microglia cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), could be attenuated by RE. We found that the pretreatment with RE increased the time in the center of open field test (OFT), and decreased immobility duration in tail suspension test (TST) as well as forced swimming test (FST). Furthermore, RE enhanced the sequences proportion of Lactobacillus and Firmicutes, and reduced the sequences proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in feces. Moreover, RE obviously suppressed protein expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, p-NF-κ  p65 and Iba1 in hippocampus, and elevated BDNF as well as p-AKT/AKT expression. Importantly, pre-incubation with RE protected microglia by alleviating protein expression of IL-1β, TNF-α and p-NF-κ  p65 induced by LPS. Additionally, RE downregulated the level of IL-1β and TNF-α in serum. In conclusion, this study showed the antidepressant effects of RE are mediated by anti-inflammatory effects in hippocampus, serum and BV-2 microglia as well as rebalancing gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430944>Recognizing the Leaky Gut as a Trans-diagnostic Target for Neuroimmune Disorders Using Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Immunology Assays.</a></h2><p>Increased intestinal permeability with heightened translocation of Gramnegative bacteria, also known as "leaky gut", is associated with the pathophysiology of neuroimmune disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CSF) and (deficit) schizophrenia, as well as with general medical disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome.

We examined the role of endotoxin-responsive, cAMP-specific, Pde4 subfamily  (Pde4b) enzyme in gut  induced neuro-inflammation and white matter loss following spinal cord injury (SCI). Using a thoracic contusion model in C57Bl/6 wild type female mice, SCI led to significant shifts in the gut bacterial community including an increase in the phylum Proteobacteria, which consists of endotoxin-harboring, gram-negative bacteria. This was accompanied by increased systemic inflammatory marker, soluble CD14, along with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR) and inflammation in the SCI epicenter. Deletion of Pde4b reduced epicenter expression of markers for the ERSR and inflammation, at both acute and chronic time points post-SCI. Correspondingly, expression of oligodendrocyte mRNAs increased. Within the injury penumbra, inflammatory protein markers of activated astrocytes (GFAP), macrophage/microglia (CD11b, Iba1), and the proinflammatory mediator Cox2, were decreased in Pde4b mice. The absence of Pde4b improved white matter sparing and recovery of hindlimb locomotion following injury. Importantly, SCI-induced gut , bacterial overgrowth and endotoxemia were also prevented in Pde4b mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that PDE4B plays an important role in the development of acute and chronic inflammatory response and consequent recovery following SCI.Copyright © 2018.

Given this we collected gastric antrum and gastric body biopsies from healthy controls (HC.A and HC. group) and gastric antrum, gastric body and polyp biopsies from patients with multiple gastric polyps (GP.A, GP. and GP.P group) for 16S rDNA sequencing. The results showed that the diversity of the gastric flora in the GP group was significantly lower than that of the HC group. The gastric flora composition of the GP group was significantly different from the HC group. However, flora diversity and compositions in different parts of the stomach (gastric antrum, gastric body or polyp tissue) were not significantly different.

This gut bacteria  could develop in early life and contribute to chronic disease risk such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.To determine how dietary macronutrients are associated with the relative abundance of gut bacteria in healthy adolescents.Fifty-two obese participants (12-19 years) from two studies, many who were primarily of Hispanic background, provided fecal samples for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Dietary macronutrients were assessed using 24-hour diet recalls and body composition was assessed using DEXA. General regression models assuming a negative binomial distribution were used to examine the associations between gut bacteria and dietary fiber, saturated fat, unsaturated fats, protein, added sugar, total sugar and free fructose after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, body fat percentage, study and caloric intake.The genera Eubacterium (Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) corrected p-value = 0.10) and Streptococcus (BH corrected p-value = 0.04) were inversely associated with dietary fructose intake. There were no other significant associations between abundances of gut microbes and other dietary macronutrients, including fiber, fat, protein, total sugar or added sugar.High dietary fructose was associated with lower abundance of the beneficial microbes Eubacterium and Streptococcus, which are involved with carbohydrate metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450035>Chronic lead exposure induces histopathological damage,  dysbiosis and immune disorder in the cecum of female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica).</a></h2><p>Lead (Pb) is one of the most hazardous metals to human and wildlife and it also has multiple negative impacts on birds. However, its influences on bird gut morphology and intestinal  were still unclear. We used female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to examine the effects of chronic lead exposure (0, 50 ppm and 1000 ppm) on cecal histology, microbial communities and immune function. The results showed 50 ppm lead exposure caused subtle damages of cecum cell structure. However, 1000 ppm lead exposure caused severe cecum histopathological changes characterized by mucosa abscission, Lieberkühn glands destruction and lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, both lead concentrations induced ultrastructural damages featured by nucleus pyknosis, mitochondrial vacuolation and microvilli contraction. Meanwhile, microbial community structure, species diversity, taxonomic compositions and taxa abundance in the cecum were affected by lead exposure. Furthermore, the mRNA relative expression of immunity-related genes such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) was significantly downregulated while that of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and natural killer kappa  (NF-κ) was significantly upregulated in the cecum of 50 and 1000 ppm lead exposure groups. We concluded that lead exposure may cause gut health impairment of female Japanese quails by inducing cecal histopathological changes,  dysbiosis and cecal immune disorder.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of xenobiotic biotransformation; however, little is known about its interactions with PBDEs. Primary bile acids (BAs) are metabolized by the gut microbiome into more lipophilic secondary BAs that may be absorbed and interact with certain host receptors. The goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that PBDEs cause  and aberrant regulation of BA homeostasis. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice were orally gavaged with corn oil (10 mg/kg), BDE-47 (100 mol/kg), or BDE-99 (100 mol/kg) once daily for 4 days ( = 3-5/group). Gut microbiome was characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing of the large intestinal content in CV mice. Both BDE-47 and BDE-99 profoundly decreased the alpha diversity of gut microbiome and differentially regulated 45 bacterial species. Both PBDE congeners increased  and Erysipelotrichaceae  spp., which have been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antiobesity functions. Targeted metabolomics of 56 BAs was conducted in serum, liver, and small and large intestinal content of CV and GF mice. BDE-99 increased many unconjugated BAs in multiple biocompartments in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. This correlated with an increase in microbial 7-dehydroxylation enzymes for secondary BA synthesis and increased expression of host intestinal transporters for BA absorption. Targeted proteomics showed that PBDEs downregulated host BA-synthesizing enzymes and transporters in livers of CV but not GF mice. In conclusion, there is a novel interaction between PBDEs and the endogenous BA-signaling through modification of the "gut-liver axis".Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919578>Faecal microbiota from patients with cirrhosis has a low capacity to ferment non-digestible carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Cirrhosis is associated with , but its functional consequences are still largely unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) account for physiological interactions between the gut microbiota and host. Our aim was to assess the impact of cirrhotic  on the production of SCFAs.Seventeen patients with cirrhosis and 17 controls were selected. Microbiota composition in faecal samples was assessed by next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing. SCFAs were measured with GC-MS in faecal samples and after in vitro batch fermentations using arabinoxylan, resistant starch, pectin, and lactulose as substrates.Among the 17 cirrhotic patients (mean age 58, eight males), six, nine and two were, respectively, Child-Pugh class A,  and C. Eleven patients were on oral antibiotics, 11 on lactulose and 13 on proton pump inhibitors. Cirrhotic patients showed marked differences in the composition and diversity of gut microbiome when compared to controls, that were more pronounced with increased severity. Stool samples from cirrhotic patients showed lower SCFAs content and reduced capacity to produce SCFAs in batch fermentations, with butyrate production being the most abnormal. These functional aberrancies were more pronounced with greater liver disease severity. Abundance of Ruminococcus faecis (in family Ruminococcaceae), Faecalicatena fissicatena and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans (in family Lachnospiraceae) was positively correlated with the SCFAs production.Cirrhotic  is associated with a decreased capacity to ferment non-digestible carbohydrates into SCFAs, especially into butyrate. These functional abnormalities are more pronounced as disease progresses. These results might inform the design of gut-targeted therapies for cirrhosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Our previous study shows that dietary β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) improves lipid metabolism in a pig model. However, it remains unclear whether HMB blocks obesity through gut microbiota. In this study, we found that HMB reduced body weight, alleviated the whitening of brown adipose tissue, and improved insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). High-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA demonstrated that HMB administration significantly reversed the gut microbiota  in HFD-fed mice, including the diversity of gut microbiota and relative abundances of  and . Moreover, microbiota transplantation from HMB-treated mice attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Furthermore, HFD-fed mice showed lower short-chain fatty acids, whereas administration of HMB increased the propionic acid production. Correlation analysis identified a significant correlation between propionic acid production and the relative  abundance. Sodium propionate treatment also attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Collectively, our results indicated that HMB might be used as a probiotic agent to reverse HFD-induced obesity, and the potential mechanism was associated with reprogramming gut microbiota and metabolism, especially -mediated propionic acid production. In future studies, more efforts should be made to confirm and expand the beneficial effects of HMB to human models.-Duan, Y., Zhong, Y., Xiao, H., Zheng, C., Song, ., Wang, W., Guo, Q., Li, Y., Han, H., Gao, J., Xu, K., Li, T., Yin, Y., Li, F., Yin, J., Kong, X.

ALD rat models were established by intragastric liquor [50% (v/v) ethanol] administration at 10 mL/kg body weight for 20 days. Rats were divided into six groups: normal group (no treatment), model group (ALD rats), Essentiale group (ALD rats fed with Essentiale, 137 mg/kg), and LREE high/moderate/low dose groups (ALD rats fed with 4, 2, or 1 g LREE/kg). NF-κ and LPS levels were evaluated. Liver pathological changes and intestinal ultrastructure were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. The gut microbiota composition was evaluated by 16S rDNA sequencing. Expression levels of TLR4 and CD68 in liver tissue, and occludin and claudin-1 in intestinal tissue were measured. LREE treatment significantly reduced NF-κ and LPS levels, improved liver pathological changes, and ameliorated intestinal ultrastructure injury. Meanwhile, LREE-fed groups showed a higher abundance of Firmicutes and a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes than the rats in the model group. Administration of LREE suppressed TLR4 overexpression and promoted the expression of occludin and claudin-1 in intestine tissue. Thus, LREE could partly ameliorate microflora , suppress the inflammatory response, and attenuate liver injury in ALD rats.

The current study determined the impact of LBW on intestinal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism under both control and Western diet (high fat, high fructose, and cholesterol) conditions in 5-wk-old LBW and normal birth weight (NBW) Landrace-Large White × Duroc pigs. A 2-step modified oral glucose and fat challenge test was performed. Mesenteric lymph, jejunal mucosal scrapings, and cecal digesta samples were also collected. LBW offspring were lower in weight and gained less weight per day. LBW pigs on either control or Western diets displayed increased triglyceride (TG) secretion into lymph ( = 0.0135). Western diet-fed LBW pigs developed fasting ( = 0.03) and postprandial ( < 0.05) hypertriglyceridemia, muscle steatosis ( = 0.0072), had higher insulin excursion ( < 0.01), increased jejunal stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 mRNA and increased hepatic fibrosis ( = 0.0017) compared with NBW piglets.

It focuses on the bidirectional signaling between the microbiota and the brain, here defined as the microbiota-gut-vagus-heart-brain (MGVHB) axis and its systemic disruption accompanying altered neurodevelopment. Data derived from clinical and animal studies document increased prevalence of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms in both premature and autistic children and suggest an incomplete maturation of the gut-blood barrier resulting in a "leaky gut," , abnormalities in vagal regulation of the heart, altered development of specific brain regions, and behavior. Furthermore, this review posits the hypothesis that common genetic variants link the abnormalities in the MGVHB axis in premature and autistic pathologies. This hypothesis is based on the recently identified common genetic variants: early  cell factor 1 (EBF1), selenocysteine tRNA-specific eukaryotic elongation factor (EEFSEC), and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2), in the maternal and infant DNA samples, associated with risk of preterm birth and independently implicated in a risk of autism.

Four arabinoxylans extracts were obtained from Argentinian soft and hard wheat. In vitro assays were performed to describe the extent to which the extracts from whole wheat flour support selective growth of Bifidobacterium breve and probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC23272 in a defined media. The prebiotic effect was evaluated by three quantitative scores: relative growth, prebiotic activity score and prebiotic index. For prebiotic index equation the growth of Bacteroides and Clostridium strains was compared to that of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. All the arabinoxylans extracts supported the growth of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, reaching higher prebiotic activity score values than inulin (0·37 and 0·36 for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium respectively). AX2 from soft wheat and AX4 from hard showed similar prebiotic index value to commercial inulin (2·64, 2·52 and 2·22 respectively), and AX3 extract presented higher prebiotic index value (4·09) than the positive control and other prebiotic index reported for arabinoxylans.

Despite the endless supply of sunlight in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries which includes United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, Vitamin D deficiency in the (GCC) general population at various age groups remains alarmingly high. In parallel runs the increasing prevalence of acute and chronic illnesses including, autoimmune diseases, cancer, type 1 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and Inflammatory bowel disease in the adult as well as the pediatric population of these countries. The exact association between Vitamin D deficiency and chronic disease conditions remains unclear; however, studies have focused on the mechanism of Vitamin D regulation by assessing the role of the Vitamin D associated genes/proteins such as VDR (Vitamin D receptor), VDBP (Vitamin D Binding protein), CYP27B1 as these are integral parts of the Vitamin D signaling pathway. VDR is known to regulate the expression of more than 200 genes across a wide array of tissues in the human body and may play a role in controlling the Vitamin D levels. Moreover, reduced Vitamin D level and downregulation of VDR have been linked to gut , highlighting an intriguing role for the gut microbiome in the Vitamin D metabolism.

Treatment for myocarditis is still a difficult task in clinical practice. The gut microbiota is related to cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. However, little is known about the role of the gut microbiota in myocarditis. In our study, we tested the hypothesis that gut  is associated with myocarditis. We focused on whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can be used as an effective treatment for myocarditis. We used an experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mouse model. Fecal samples were isolated from the control and EAM groups for bacterial genome analysis. We observed an increase in microbial richness and diversity in the myocarditis mice. These changes were accompanied by an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. We also evaluated the efficacy of FMT for the treatment of myocarditis. EAM mouse guts were repopulated with fecal contents from an untreated male mouse donor. We found that myocardial injury was improved by diminished inflammatory infiltration, showing that IFN-γ gene expression in the heart tissue and CD4IFN-γ cells in the spleen were decreased after FMT in EAM mice. We also found that FMT was able to rebalance the gut microbiota by restoring the Bacteroidetes population and reshaping the microbiota composition. Myocarditis is associated with gut microbiota  and characterized by an increased F/ ratio. FMT treatment can rebalance the gut microbiota and attenuate myocarditis.

We hypothesised that a lack of butyrate produced by the gut microbiota may be compensated by its supplementation in PN mixtures. We tested whether  butyrate administration would (a) positively modulate intestinal defence mechanisms and () counteract PN-induced . Male Wistar rats were randomised to chow, PN, and PN supplemented with 9 mM butyrate (PN+But) for 12 days. Antimicrobial peptides, mucins, tight junction proteins, and cytokine expression were assessed by RT-qPCR. T-cell subpopulations in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were analysed by flow cytometry. Microbiota composition was assessed in caecum content. Butyrate supplementation resulted in increased expression of tight junction proteins (), antimicrobial peptides (), and lysozyme in the ileal mucosa. Butyrate partially alleviated PN-induced intestinal barrier impairment and normalised IL-4, IL-10, and IgA mRNA expression. PN administration was associated with an increase in Tregs in MLN, which was normalised by butyrate. Butyrate increased the total number of CD4+ and decreased a relative amount of CD8+ memory T cells in MLN. Lack of enteral nutrition and PN administration led to a shift in caecal microbiota composition.

Genomics-based reconstruction and predictive modeling of these interactions would provide a framework for diagnostics and treatment of -related syndromes via rational selection of therapeutic prebiotics and dietary nutrients. Of particular interest are micronutrients, such as -group vitamins, precursors of indispensable metabolic cofactors, that are produced  by some gut bacteria (prototrophs) but must be provided exogenously in the diet for many other bacterial species (auxotrophs) as well as for the mammalian host. Cross-feeding of  vitamins between prototrophic and auxotrophic species is expected to strongly contribute to the homeostasis of microbial communities in the distal gut given the efficient absorption of dietary vitamins in the upper gastrointestinal tract. To confidently estimate the balance of microbiome micronutrient biosynthetic capabilities and requirements using available genomic data, we have performed a subsystems-based reconstruction of biogenesis, salvage and uptake for eight  vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12) and queuosine (essential factor in tRNA modification) over a reference set of 2,228 bacterial genomes representing 690 cultured species of the human gastrointestinal microbiota. This allowed us to classify the studied organisms with respect to their pathway variants and infer their prototrophic vs. auxotrophic phenotypes. In addition to canonical vitamin pathways, several conserved partial pathways were identified pointing to alternative routes of syntrophic metabolism and expanding a microbial vitamin "menu" by several pathway intermediates (vitamers) such as thiazole, quinolinate, dethiobiotin, pantoate. A cross-species comparison was applied to assess the extent of conservation of vitamin phenotypes at distinct taxonomic levels (from strains to families). The obtained reference collection combined with 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic profiles was used to deduce phenotype profiles of the human gut microbiota across in two large cohorts. This analysis provided the first estimate of -vitamin requirements, production and sharing capabilities in the human gut microbiome establishing predictive phenotype profiling as a new approach to classification of microbiome samples.

In this review, we first make a brief introduction on current understandings of normal gut microbiota, microbiome, and their roles in homeostasis of mucosal immunity and gut integrity. Then, under the situation of microbiota , development of chronic inflammations in the intestine occurs, leading to leaky gut situation and systematic chronic inflammation in the host. These subsequently resulted in development of many important diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, liver inflammations, and other diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC), obesity-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the compromised lung immunity, and some on brain/neuro disorders. The strategy used to optimally implant the effective prebiotics, probiotics and the derived postbiotics for amelioration of the diseases is presented.

Meta-analysis of case-control studies nested within prospective cohorts showed that  infection was associated with a 5.9-fold increased risk of non-cardia gastric cancer.

Recent studies showed that eradication of  resulted in an increase in the bacterial diversity and restoration of the relative abundance of other bacteria to levels similar to  non-infected subjects in the gastric microbiota. The administration of antibiotics may also alter the composition of intestinal microbiota. The α-diversity and β-diversity of fecal microbiota are significantly altered immediately after  eradication but are gradually restored to levels similar to those before therapy. Yet, the rate of recovery varies with regimens. The diversity was restored at week 8 after triple therapy but was not yet fully recovered at 1 year after concomitant and quadruple therapies. Some studies showed that supplementation of probiotics may reduce the  during  eradication therapy. Although some earlier studies showed high levels of macrolide resistance after triple therapy, recent studies showed that the increased antibiotic resistance rate may be restored 2-12 months after eradication therapy. These results collectively provide evidence of the long-term safety of  eradication.

We investigated which markers are most relevant to assess intestinal permeability in UC patients and whether probiotics had an effect on these markers.In this twelve-week placebo-controlled randomized double-blind study, twenty-five subjects with UC in remission received either placebo or a multispecies probiotics. Samples of blood, urine, and faeces were taken at baseline, week 6, and week 12 to assess intestinal permeability and inflammation. Diaries and Bristol stool scale were kept to record stool frequency and consistency. Quality of life was scored from 32-224 with the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBD-Q).This group of UC patients, in clinical remission, did not show increased intestinal permeability at baseline of this study. During the study, no significant group or time effects were found for intestinal permeability measured by the 5-sugar absorption test, serum zonulin, and faecal zonulin. Likewise, the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), calprotectin, and the cytokines IFN, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 were not significantly affected. Stool frequency and consistency were not significantly affected either. The IBD-Q score, 194 for the probiotics group and 195 for the placebo group, remained unaffected. Correlations were tested between all outcomes; urinary sucrose excretion was significantly correlated with serum zonulin ( = 0.62) and faecal calprotectin ( = 0.55). Faecal zonulin was not significantly correlated with any of the other markers.Serum zonulin may be a more relevant biomarker of intestinal permeability than faecal zonulin, due to its correlation with other biomarkers of intestinal permeability. UC patients in remission did not show an effect of the probiotic treatment or a change in gut permeability. This should not discourage further studies because effects might be present during active disease or shortly after a flare up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606811>The vermiform appendix: an immunological organ sustaining a microbiome inoculum.</a></h2><p>The hominoid vermiform appendix has been characterized as a diverticulum of the caecum and describes an entity at the juxtaposition of the colon in the confluence of tanias. The independent development of the lymphoid follicle centres of the appendix is progressed at birth in the presence of the intestinal commensal microbiome, an obligatory prompt for the diversification of intestinal and extra-intestinal mucosal immunological tissue. In the vermiform appendix, this activity is centred on further developing the inventory of primary antibodies and the maturation of T- and -lymphocyte cells in the follicles within the lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, the columnar epithelia, enterocytes and goblet cells comprise the complement of cells that occupy the  and  of the vermiform appendix's mucosa, while macrophages and an abundance of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G generating plasma cells seed the  Intraepithelial immune cells consisting predominantly of specific CD8 T regulatory lymphocytes occupy sites in the appendix analogous to those present in the intestinal epithelia of the caecal colon. The complement of bacterial genera concealed in the vermiform appendix is posited extant as a biofilm inoculum of the intestinal commensal microbiome. This facilitates re-inoculation of the proximal colon and to a lesser degree the terminal ilium post an intestinal perturbation such as occurs with daily lifestyle stressors, dietary choices and the short-term administration of antibiotics rather than an infectious fulminant colitis. A plausible appreciation results of the importance of multiple immunological aspects of a healthy vermiform appendix and the provision of a commensal biofilm to the gut that repairs a dysbiotic microbiome contributing to balancing intestinal pro- and anti-inflammatory activity for maintaining homeostasis in the gut. Since the composition of the gut microbiome can vary over the short-term and long-term, it is plausible that the appendix inoculum may be instrumental in maintaining the intestinal microbiome.© 2019 The Author(s).

Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, ., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

Metabotype-A only produces urolithin-A, metabotype- yields urolithin- and isourolithin-A in addition to urolithin-A, and metabotype 0 does not produce urolithins. Metabotype-A has been suggested to be 'protective', and metabotype- dysbiotic-prone to cardiometabolic impairments. We analyzed the gut- of 40 healthy women and determined their metabotypes and enterotypes, and their associations with anthropometric and gut-microbial changes after 3 weeks, 4, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Metabotype-A was predominant in mothers who lost weight (≥2 kg) (75%) versus metabotype- (54%). After delivery, the  of metabotype-A mothers changed, unlike metabotype-, which barely changed over 1 year. The metabotype-A discriminating bacteria correlated to the decrease of the women's waist while some metabotype- bacteria were inversely associated with a reduction of body mass index (BMI), waist, and waist-to-hip ratio. Metabotype- was associated with a more robust and less modulating microbial and anthropometric profiles versus metabotype-A, in which these profiles were normalized through the 1-year follow-up postpartum. Consequently, urolithin metabotypes assessment could be a tool to anticipate the predisposition of women to normalize their anthropometric values and gut-, significantly altered during pregnancy and after childbirth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546592>Fish Oil, but Not Olive Oil, Ameliorates Depressive-Like Behavior and Gut Microbiota  in Rats under Chronic Mild Stress.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of fish oil and olive oil in improving  and depressive-like symptoms.Male rats were fed normal, fish oil-rich or olive oil-rich diets for 14 weeks.

In the present study, we examined the gut microbiota of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normoglycaemic pregnant women in late pregnancy and about 8 months postpartum.Gut microbiota profiles of women with GDM (n = 50) and healthy (n = 157) pregnant women in the third trimester and 8 months postpartum were assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the V1-V2 region. Insulin and glucose homeostasis were evaluated by a 75 g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test during and after pregnancy.Gut microbiota of women with GDM was aberrant at multiple levels, including phylum and genus levels, compared with normoglycaemic pregnant women. Actinobacteria at phylum level and Collinsella, Rothia and Desulfovibrio at genus level had a higher abundance in the GDM cohort. Difference in abundance of 17 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) during pregnancy was associated with GDM. After adjustment for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), 5 of the 17 OTUs showed differential abundance in the GDM cohort compared with the normoglycaemic pregnant women with enrichment of species annotated to Faecalibacterium and Anaerotruncus and depletion of species annotated to Clostridium (sensu stricto) and to Veillonella. OTUs assigned to Akkermansia were associated with lower insulin sensitivity while Christensenella OTUs were associated with higher fasting plasma glucose concentration. OTU richness and Shannon index decreased from late pregnancy to postpartum regardless of metabolic status. About 8 months after delivery, the microbiota of women with previous GDM was still characterised by an aberrant composition. Thirteen OTUs were differentially abundant in women with previous GDM compared with women with previous normoglycaemic pregnancy.GDM diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a disrupted gut microbiota composition compared with normoglycaemic pregnant women, and 8 months after pregnancy, differences in the gut microbiota signatures are still detectable.

We have shown that gut  plays a causal role in the development of hypertension in a rat model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Functional analysis of the dysbiotic microbiota in OSA demonstrates a loss of short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. However, measurements of short chain fatty acid concentrations and testing of their role in blood pressure regulation are lacking. We hypothesized that reduced short chain fatty acids in the gut are responsible for OSA-induced hypertension. OSA significantly increased systolic blood pressure at 7 and 14 days ( P<0.05), an effect that was abolished by the probiotic Clostridium butyricum or the prebiotic Hylon VII. The 16S rRNA analysis identified several short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that were significantly increased by Cbutyricum and Hylon treatment. Acetate concentration in the cecum was decreased by 48% after OSA ( P<0.05), an effect that was prevented by Cbutyricum and Hylon. Cbutyricum and Hylon reduced OSA-induced , epithelial goblet cell loss, mucus barrier thinning, and activation of brain microglia ( P<0.05 for each). To examine the role of acetate in OSA-induced hypertension, we chronically infused acetate into the cecum during 2 weeks of sham or OSA. Restoring cecal acetate concentration prevented OSA-induced gut inflammation and hypertension ( P<0.05). These studies identify acetate as a key player in OSA-induced hypertension. We demonstrate that various methods to increase cecal acetate concentrations are protective from the adverse effects of OSA on the microbiota, gut, brain, and blood pressure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791759>Emerging treatments for short bowel syndrome in adult patients.</a></h2><p>Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is the major cause of chronic intestinal failure (IF), defined as 'the reduction of gut function below the minimum necessary for the absorption of macronutrients and/or water and electrolytes, such that intravenous supplementation is required to maintain health and/or growth'.

Here, we investigated whether oral administration of a bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin (LFCA)-encoding Lactococcus lactis (LL-LFCA) strain could alleviate experimental colitis. LFCA derived from LL-LFCA inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. In mice, administration of LL-LFCA decreased the disease activity index and attenuated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced body weight loss and colon shortening. LL-LFCA treatment also ameliorated DSS-induced colon damage, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, significantly decreased myeloperoxidase activity, and ameliorated DSS-induced disruption of intestinal permeability and tight junctions. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that LL-LFCA reversed DSS-induced gut . The production of proinflammatory mediators in serum and the colon was also reduced by administration of LL-LFCA. In vitro, LFCA derived from LL-LFCA decreased the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory factors. The underlying mechanisms may involve inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) pathway. The results demonstrate that LL-LFCA ameliorates DSS-induced intestinal injury in mice, suggesting that LL-LFCA might be an effective drug for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30231491>The Dynamic Changes of Gut Microbiota in  Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut  is associated with colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis, and the genetic deficiency of the  gene causes spontaneous development of colitis and colorectal cancer.

Furthermore, gut  has been associated with increased inflammatory status and risk of cardiovascular events.  To assess the effect of Kyolic aged GARlic extract on Gut microbiota, Inflammation, and Cardiovascular markers, including blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness.  A total of 49 participants with uncontrolled hypertension completed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks, investigating the effect of daily intake of aged-garlic-extract (1.2 g containing 1.2 mg S-allylcysteine) or placebo on blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness, inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota.  Mean blood pressure was significantly reduced by 10 ± 3.6 mmHg systolic and 5.4 ± 2.3 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo. Vitamin B12 status played a role in responsiveness to garlic on blood pressure in 17% of patients.

Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila and Eubacterium hallii have been identified as candidates for next generation probiotics (NGPs) with exciting potential for the prevention and treatment of such of -associated diseases. The challenges of these non-conventional native gut bacteria lie mainly on their extreme sensitivity to O traces. If these strains are to be used successfully in food, supplements or drugs they need to be stable and active in humans. In the present review, we present an overall perspective of the most updated scientific literature on the newly called NGPs through the 5W1H (What, Why, Who, Where, When, and How) method, an innovative and attractive problem-solving approach that provides the reader an effective understanding of the issue at hand.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29715498>Linking gut microbiota to cardiovascular disease and hypertension: Lessons from chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Bidirectional interactions exist between the kidneys and the gut. These interactions are commonly referred to as the gut-kidney axis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to disturbances of the gut ecosystem. Key features include the increase of protein fermentation at the expense of carbohydrate fermentation and a disrupted epithelial barrier. A disturbed gut ecosystem may contribute to the high burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD. The present review discusses the impact of CKD on the gut microenvironment and provides an update as to how gut  and a leaky gut may be linked to accelerated cardiovascular disease and hypertension.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Oral vaccination efficacy has been found to vary considerably with differences in geographical locations and socioeconomic status. Specifically, in children living in resource-poor countries, undernourishment and chronic gastrointestinal (GI) infection are associated with the failure of OVs, which is a tragic outcome for the children who would benefit most from mucosal-based protection from infection. Both undernutrition and GI infection have been shown to profoundly affect the microbiota, inducing '' characterized by narrowed bacterial diversity and increased frequency of bacterial clades associated with the induction of inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the microbiota exerts a profound effect on the development of mucosal immune responses. Therefore, it seems likely that OV failure in resource-poor regions is affected by alterations to the immune response driven by dysbiotic changes to the microbiota. Here, we review the contribution of the microbiota to OV efficacy in the context of diet and GI infection.© 2018 The Author(s).

Eighteen-week-old NZBWF1 [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and NZW/LacJ (control) mice were treated with vehicle or LC40 (5 × 10 colony-forming units/d) for 15 wk. LC40 treatment reduced lupus disease activity, blood pressure, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and splenomegaly in SLE mice. LC40 reduced the elevated T, , regulatory T cells (T), and T helper (T)-1 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes of lupus mice. LC40 lowered the higher plasma concentration of proinflammatory cytokines observed in lupus mice. Aortas from SLE mice showed reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine. Endothelial dysfunction found in SLE is related to an increase of both NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide production and eNOS phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr. These activities returned to normal values after a treatment with LC40. Probiotic administration to SLE mice reduced plasma LPS levels, which might be related to an improvement of the gut barrier integrity. LC40 treatment increases the  count in gut microbiota of SLE mice. In conclusion, our findings identify the gut microbiota manipulation with LC40 as an alternative approach to the prevention of SLE and its associated vascular damage.-Toral, M., Robles-Vera, I., Romero, M., de la Visitación, N., Sánchez, M., O'Valle, F., Rodriguez-Nogales, A., Gálvez, J., Duarte, J., Jiménez, R.

We previously observed that the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis (Pd) in stool was inversely associated with intestinal tumor burden and IL-1β concentrations in mice. Here, we assessed the anti-inflammatory capacity of Pd membrane fraction (PdMb) in colon cancer cell lines. In addition, we tested whether Pd could suppress colon tumorigenesis in mice. Six-week old male A/J mice were fed a low-fat diet (LF), high-fat diet (HF), or HF+ whole freeze-dried Pd (HF+Pd, 0.04% w/w) for 24 weeks. After 1 week on diet, mice received 4 weekly injections of azoxymethane (AOM). PdMb robustly suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lowered the abundance of MyD88 and pAkt (ser473) induced by E. coli lipopolysaccharide in colon cancer cell lines. Moreover, PdMb induced apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines and blocked TLR4 activation in a reporter line. Colon tumors were observed in 0% of LF (0 of 19), 25% of HF (5 of 20) and 0% of HF+Pd mice (0 of 20) (P = 0.005). The latter group also displayed a lower abundance of MyD88 and pAkt (ser473) in colonic mucosa than HF mice. Taken together, these data suggest that Pd has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties that are likely mediated by the suppression of TLR4 and Akt signaling, as well as promotion of apoptosis.

While many intra-facility factors are known to influence the structure of mouse microbiomes, the contribution of inter-facility variation to mouse microbiome composition, especially in the context of disease, remains under-investigated. We replicated microbiome experiments using identical mouse lines housed in two separate animal facilities and report drastic differences in composition of microbiomes based upon animal facility of origin. We observed facility-specific microbiome signatures in the context of a disease model [the Ednrb (endothelin receptor type ) Hirschsprung disease mouse] and in normal C57BL/6J mice. Importantly, these facility differences were independent of cage, sex, or sequencing-related influence. In addition, we investigated the reproducibility of microbiome  previously associated with Ednrb (knock-out; KO) mice. While we observed genotype-based differences in composition between wild-type (WT) and KO mice, these differences were inconsistent with the previously reported conclusions. Furthermore, the genotype-based differences were not identical across animal facilities. Despite this, through differential abundance testing, we identified several conserved candidate taxa and candidate operational taxonomic units that may play a role in disease promotion or protection. Overall, our findings raise the possibility that previously reported microbiome-disease associations from murine studies conducted in a single facility may be heavily influenced by facility-specific effects. More generally, these results provide a strong rationale for replication of mouse microbiome studies at multiple facilities, and for the meticulous collection of metadata that will allow the confounding effects of facility to be more specifically identified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975748> and  emerge as lone survivors following long-term starvation of oral microbiota.</a></h2><p>It is well-understood that many bacteria have evolved to survive catastrophic events using a variety of mechanisms, which include expression of stress-response genes, quiescence, necrotrophy, and metabolic advantages obtained through mutation. However, the dynamics of individuals leveraging these abilities to gain a competitive advantage in an ecologically complex setting remain unstudied. In this study, we observed the saliva microbiome throughout the ecological perturbation of long-term starvation, allowing only the species best equipped to access and use the limited resources to survive. During the first several days, the community underwent a death phase that resulted in a ∼50-100-fold reduction in the number of viable cells.

MetaOmics analyses provided several leads for further investigation regarding the ecological success of the Enterobacteriaceae. The isolates accumulated single nucleotide polymorphisms in known growth advantage in stationary phase alleles and produced natural products closely resembling antimicrobial cyclic depsipeptides. The results presented in this study suggest that pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae persist much longer than their more benign neighbors in the salivary microbiome when faced with starvation. This is particularly significant, given that hospital surfaces contaminated with oral fluids, especially sinks and drains, are well-established sources of outbreaks of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor is a promising therapeutic strategy to change and restore composition of the recipient's gut microbiota. Rapidly increasing clinical literatures confirmed the truth of the benefits of FMT on recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) and inflammatory bowel disease. This article retrospectively reviewed nine cases (four cases had ulcerative colitis [UC], five cases had rCDI) who received FMT in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital from April 2016 to November 2018. We summarized the procedure including donor selection, fecal materials preparation, transplantation delivery methods, and clinical outcomes. All of the four UC cases got clinical improvement and four rCDI cases achieved clinical remission after FMT. The other one rCDI case remained positive stool Toxin A+ result after FMT, and got remission after salvage treatment with fidaxomicin. FMT is considered to be a well-tolerated adjuvant treatment for UC and effective salvage treatment for rCDI in our initial experience. Multiple infusions of FMT in UC and rCDI might have exceptional clinical efficiency, and enteral tube insertion could be a useful method to reach this goal and make multiple sessions of FMT easier.© 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to identify clinically relevant subgroups of CRS patients based on distinct microbial signatures, with a comparison to the commonly used phenotypic subgrouping approach. The underlying drivers of these distinct microbial clusters were also investigated, together with associations with epithelial barrier integrity. Sinus biopsy specimens were collected from CRS patients ( = 23) and disease controls ( = 8). The expression of 42 tight junction genes was evaluated using quantitative PCR together with microbiota analysis and immunohistochemistry for measuring mucosal integrity and inflammation. CRS patients clustered into two distinct microbial subgroups using probabilistic modelling Dirichlet (DC) multinomial mixtures. DC1 exhibited significantly reduced bacterial diversity and increased dispersion and was dominated by , , and  DC2 had significantly elevated  cells and incidences of nasal polyps and higher numbers of , , , , and  In addition, each DC exhibited distinct tight junction gene and protein expression profiles compared with those of controls. Stratifying CRS patients based on clinical phenotypic subtypes (absence or presence of nasal polyps [CRSsNP or CRSwNP, respectively] or with cystic fibrosis [CRSwCF]) accounted for a larger proportion of the variation in the microbial data set than with DC groupings. However, no significant differences between CRSsNP and CRSwNP cohorts were observed for inflammatory markers, beta-dispersion, and alpha-diversity measures. In conclusion, both approaches used for stratifying CRS patients had benefits and pitfalls, but DC clustering provided greater resolution when studying tight junction impairment. Future studies in CRS should give careful consideration to the patient subtyping approach used. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a major human health problem that significantly reduces quality of life. While various microbes have been implicated, there is no clear understanding of the role they play in CRS pathogenesis. Another equally important observation made for CRS patients is that the epithelial barrier in the sinonasal cavity is defective. Finding a robust approach to subtype CRS patients would be the first step toward unravelling the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous condition. Previous work has explored stratification based on the clinical presentation of the disease (with or without polyps), inflammatory markers, pathology, or microbial composition. Comparisons between the different stratification approaches used in these studies have not been possible due to the different cohorts, analytical methods, or sample sites used. In this study, two approaches for subtyping CRS patients were compared, and the underlying drivers of the heterogeneity in CRS were also explored.Copyright © 2019 Biswas et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848026>From germ theory to germ therapy.</a></h2><p>Germ theory of disease and Koch's postulates has been governing our understanding of the role of microbes in human health since 19th century.

The study objective was to assess tolerability of a probiotic (Bifidobacterium infantis) in combination with a bovine colostrum product (BCP) as a source of prebiotic oligosaccharides and to evaluate GI, microbiome and immune factors in children with ASD and GI co-morbidities. This pilot study is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial of combination treatment (BCP + . infantis) vs. BCP alone in a cross-over study in children ages 2-11 with ASD and GI co-morbidities (n = 8).

Results suggest that the combination treatment is well-tolerated in this cohort. The most common side effect was mild gassiness. Some participants on both treatments saw a reduction in the frequency of certain GI symptoms, as well as reduced occurrence of particular aberrant behaviors. Improvement may be explained by a reduction in IL-13 and TNF-α production in some participants.

The aim of this work is to verify the anti-inflammatory effects of a probiotic formulation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum (Serobioma).To mimic the natural host compartmentalization between probiotics and immune cells through the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro, the transwell model was used. We focused on a particular subset of immune cells that play a key role in the mucosal immune system. The immunomodulatory effects of probiotic formulation were investigated in the human macrophage cell line THP1 and macrophages derived from ex vivo human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Probiotic formulation induced a significant increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) production and was able to decrease the secretion of the major proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 by 70% and 80%, respectively.

The population consisted of 10 men and 13 women with a mean age of 75 ± 3 years. The time between the last prescription of an antimicrobial drug and sampling was determined and categorized. The use of antimicrobial drugs prior to urine sampling was associated with statistically significant differences in the beta-diversity of the genitourinary microbiota. No association was found between antimicrobial drug use and the alpha-diversity of the genitourinary microbiota. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were lowest in participants who used antimicrobial drug belonged to Lactobacillus and Finegoldia. In contrast, an OTU belonging to the genus Parabacteroides had higher abundances. Also, an OTU belonging to the species E.coli was higher in the participants who used antimicrobial drugs.Prior use of antimicrobial drugs is associated with a different composition of the genitourinary microbiota. Our results might indicate a persisting effect of antimicrobial drugs on the composition of the microbiota, but reverse causality cannot be ruled out. Future studies are needed to differentiate between two possibilities. Genitourinary  could be the result of antimicrobial drug use or genitourinary  could be a risk factor for urinary tract infections resulting in increased use of antimicrobial drugs.

However, the physiological effects of diet-induced microbial changes on the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain debatable. We hypothesized that high-fat intake for 6 weeks would promote intestinal  by increasing gram-positive bacteria, inducing the intestinal production of proinflammatory cytokines and subsequent hepatic lipid infiltration in young male rats. Six-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups and fed either a standard rodent chow or a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks. Chromogenic endotoxin quantification assays indicate an increase in lipopolysaccharide concentration in the plasma of HFD rats (p = 0.032). Additionally, Western blot analyses of the cecum showed significantly greater protein expression of the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa  (NF-kB), (p = 0.037) and the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), (p = 0.042) in rats fed HFD. Linear discriminate analysis of effect size (LEfSe) showed greater abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the samples collected from the cecum of HFD rats compared to chow. Consistent with the development of steatosis, the Oil-Red-O-stained area was increased in liver sections from HFD rats. Hepatic triacylglycerol concentrations (p < 0.001) and plasma alanine aminotransferase (p < 0.001) were significantly increased in HFD-fed animals compared to chow. These findings show that a short duration of high-fat consumption can have profound deleterious effects on gastrointestinal health and the inflammatory state of these young male Sprague-Dawley rats.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423810>Therapeutic Microbiology: The Role of  as Food Supplement for the Prevention/Treatment of Paediatric Diseases.</a></h2><p>The human intestinal microbiota, establishing a symbiotic relationship with the host, plays a significant role for human health. It is also well known that a disease status is frequently characterized by a dysbiotic condition of the gut microbiota. A probiotic treatment can represent an alternative therapy for enteric disorders and human pathologies not apparently linked to the gastrointestinal tract. Among bifidobacteria, strains of the species  are widely used in paediatrics.  is the dominant species in the gut of breast-fed infants and it has also been isolated from human milk. It has antimicrobial activity against human pathogens, it does not possess transmissible antibiotic resistance traits, it is not cytotoxic and it has immuno-stimulating abilities. This review describes the applications of  strains mainly for the prevention/treatment of paediatric pathologies. The target pathologies range from widespread gut diseases, including diarrhoea and infant colics, to celiac disease, obesity, allergic and neurological disorders. Moreover,  strains are used for the prevention of side infections in preterm newborns and during antibiotic treatments or chemotherapy.

Study of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mice contributed to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of human allergic contact dermatitis. Here we report a negative regulatory role of the RIG-I-like receptor adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) on DTH by modulating gut bacterial ecology. Cohousing and fecal transplantation experiments revealed that the dysbiotic microbiota of   mice conferred a proallergic phenotype that is communicable to wild-type mice. DTH sensitization coincided with increased intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation within lymphoid organs that enhanced DTH severity. Collectively, we unveiled an unexpected impact of RIG-I-like signaling on the gut microbiota with consequences on allergic skin disease outcome.

Though there have been major advances in the field, there is much yet to be understood. Areas covered: PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase were searched for articles related to pediatric NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) between January 1998 and January 2018. The areas considered to be 'unmet needs' were the relationship between the intestinal microbiome and perinatal events, clinical event risk stratification, and mechanisms underlying portal inflammation. Expert commentary: In utero and ex utero factors have been associated with NAFLD and also with the intestinal microbiome, but it is not yet known how intestinal  can be reversed and whether intervention in high-risk neonates could alter their propensity for the metabolic syndrome. Children with NAFLD are at increased risk of cardiovascular, diabetic, and hepatic diseases, but it is unclear how best to stratify children into appropriate risk groups for targeted interventions. Finally, the immune processes underlying pediatric NASH are thought to differ to those in adult NASH, yet the events surrounding activation of periportal lymphocytes are poorly understood.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) appears to be promising in inducing UC remission, but there are no reports regarding administration using capsules.  Seven patients with active UC, aged 27-50 years, were treated with 25 multidonor FMT capsules daily for 50 days as a supplement to their standard treatment in an open-label pilot study. The primary objective was to follow symptoms through the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI). Secondary objectives were to follow changes in fecal calprotectin and microbial diversity through fecal samples and quality of life through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Participants were followed through regular visits for six months.  From a median of 6 at baseline, the SCCAI of all participants decreased, with median decreases of 5 ( = .001) and 6 ( = .001) after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Three of the seven patients had flare-up/relapse of symptoms after the active treatment period. The median F-calprotectin of ≥1800 mg/kg at baseline decreased significantly during the treatment period, but increased again in the follow-up period. The median IBDQ improved at all visits compared to baseline. The fecal microbiota α-diversity did not increase in the study period compared to baseline. All participants completed the treatment and no serious adverse events were reported.

Increasing evidences showed that the distribution of HCC was related to the incidence of chronic hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection and other factors, such as alcoholism, aflatoxin B1 ingestion and obesity. Recent studies demonstrated that gut  plays an important role in liver diseases. However, the researches on gut microbiota of HBV and non-HBV non-HCV related HCC have not been reported. In this study, we investigated the differences between the gut microbiota of HBV related HCC (-HCC) and non-HBV non-HCV related HCC (NBNC-HCC), finally found some potential bacteria, linking different pathological mechanism of both types of HCCs.We carried out 16S rRNA analyses in a cohort of 33 healthy controls, 35 individuals with HBV related HCC (-HCC) and 22 individuals with non-HBV non-HCV (NBNC) related HCC (NBNC-HCC). We found that the species richness of fecal microbiota of -HCC patients was much higher than other two groups. Interestingly, the feces of NBNC-HCC patients harbored more potential pro-inflammatory bacteria (-, ) and reduced levels of , ,  which results in decrease potential of anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids. The feces of NBNC-HCC patients had relatively fewer abundance of multiple biological pathways related to amino acid and glucose metabolism, but high level of transport and secretion in some types. However, the -HCC patients had opposite results of bacterial composition and associated multiple biological pathways versus NBNC-HCC patients. Meanwhile, we found that aberrant network of gut microbiota occurred differently in -HCC and NBNC-HCC patients.Our study indicated that -HCC and NBNC-HCC patients showed differential abundance of bacteria involved in different functions or biological pathways. We suggested the modification of specific gut microbiota may provide the therapeutic benefit for -HCC and NBNC-HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30693343>Brain-gut axis after stroke.</a></h2><p>Stroke leads to inflammatory and immune response in the brain and immune organs. The gut or gastrointestinal tract is a major immune organ equipped with the largest pool of immune cells representing more than 70% of the entire immune system and the largest population of macrophages in the human body. The bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut is commonly known as brain-gut or gut-brain axis. Stroke often leads to gut dysmotility, gut microbiota , "leaky" gut, gut hemorrhage, and even gut-origin sepsis, which is often associated with poor prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that gut inflammatory and immune response plays a key role in the pathophysiology of stroke and may become a key therapeutic target for its treatment. Ischemic brain tissue produces damage-associated molecular patterns to initiate innate and adaptive immune response both locally and systemically through the specialized pattern-recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors). After stroke, innate immune cells including neutrophils, microglia or macrophages, mast cells, innate lymphocytes (IL-17 secreting γδ T-cell), and natural killer T-cell respond within hours, followed by the adaptive immune response through activation of T and  lymphocytes. Subpopulations of T-cells can help or worsen ischemic brain injury. Pro-inflammatory Th1, Th17, and γδ T-cells are often associated with increased inflammatory damage, whereas regulatory T-cells are known to suppress postischemic inflammation by increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Although known to play a key role, research in the gut inflammatory and immune response after stroke is still in its initial stage. A better understanding of the gut inflammatory and immune response after stroke may be important for the development of effective stroke therapies. The present review will discuss recent advances in the studies of the brain-gut axis after stroke, the key issues to be solved, and the future directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177014>Virome and bacteriome: two sides of the same coin.</a></h2><p>Although bacterial  has been previously associated with carcinogenesis and HIV infection, the impact of the virome and these disease states has been less well studied. In this review, we will summarize what is known about the interplay between both the bacterial and the viral components of the microbiome on cancer and HIV pathogenesis. Bacterial  has been associated with carcinogenesis such as colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. The dysbiotic pathogenesis may be species-based or community-based and can have varying mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The human virome was also associated with certain cancers. Viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human papilloma virus (HPV), hepatitis  virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), all had associations with cancers. It was also reported that an altered bacteriophage community may lead to carcinogenesis by allowing opportunistic, oncogenic bacteria to proliferate in a gastrointestinal biofilm. This mechanism shows the importance of analyzing the bacteriome and the virome concurrently as their interactions can provide insight into new mechanisms in the pathogenesis of not only cancer, but other diseases as well. The enteric bacteriome was shown to be distinctly altered in immunocompromised HIV-infected individuals, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was shown to at least partially reverse the alterations that HIV causes in the bacteriome. Studies have shown that the progression to HIV is associated with changes in the plasma concentration of commensal viruses. HIV also acts synergistically with multiple other viruses, such as HPV, EBV, varicella zoster virus (VZV), and HHV-8. Although it has been shown that HIV infection leads to enteric virome expansion in humans, most of the research on HIV's effect on the virome was conducted in non-human primates, and there is a lack of research on the effect of HAART on the virome. Virome-wide analysis is necessary for identifying novel viral etiologies. There is currently a wealth of information on the bacteriome and its associations with cancer and HIV, but more research should be conducted on the virome's associations and reaction to HAART as well as the bacteriome-virome interactions that may play a major role in pathogenesis and recovery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Specifically, the nasopharyngeal microbiota could play a role as a risk or protective factor in the development of invasive disease caused by .  We analyzed the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and that of healthy controls matched by age, sex, and seasonality from Catalonia, Spain. Epidemiological, microbiological and clinical variables were considered to compare microbiota profiles, analyzed by sequencing the V1-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.  Twenty-eight children with IPD (median age 43 months) and 28 controls (42.6 months) were included in the study. IPD children presented a significantly higher bacterial diversity and richness ( < 0.001). Principal coordinate analysis revealed three different microbiota profiles: microbiota A, dominated by the genus  (44.3%); Microbiota , mostly represented by  (36.9%) and  (21.3%) and a high diversity of anaerobic genera including  and ; and Microbiota C, mainly containing  (52.1%) and  (31.4%). The only explanatory factor for the three microbiotas was the classification of children into disease or healthy controls ( = 0.006). A significant negative correlation was found between  vs.  ( = 0.029), suggesting a potential antagonistic effect against pneumococcal pathogens.  The higher bacterial diversity and richness in children with IPD could suggest an impaired immune response. This lack of immune competence could be aggravated by breastfeeding <6 months and by the presence of keystone pathogens such as , a bacterium which has been shown to be able to manipulate the immune response, and that could favor the overgrowth of many proteolytic anaerobic organisms giving rise to a dramatic . From an applied viewpoint, we found suggestive microbiota profiles associated to IPD or asymptomatic colonization that could be used as disease biomarkers or to pave the way for characterizing health-associated inhabitants of the respiratory tract. The identification of beneficial bacteria could be useful to prevent pneumococcal infections by integrating those microorganisms in a probiotic formula.

Each synbiotic capsule consisted of seven strains probiotic bacteria (2× 10) plus fructooligosaccharide as a prebiotic. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests were assessed at baseline and at the end of week 12 for fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), peptide YY (PYY), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The mean changes of weight, BMI, FBS, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and GLP-1 between the two groups was statistically significant (p < .001).

This is because this sporulating, obligate anaerobe germinates and proliferates rapidly in the dysbiotic gut, which is an indirect consequence of their use. During its growth, C. difficile produces two toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin  (TcdB), which are responsible for the majority of clinical symptoms associated with the disease. Three parenterally delivered vaccines, based on detoxified or recombinant forms of these toxins, have undergone or are undergoing clinical trials. Each offers the opportunity to generate high titres of toxin neutralising antibodies. Whilst these data suggest these vaccines may reduce primary symptomatic disease, they do not in their current form reduce the capacity of the organism to persist and shed from the vaccinated host. The current progress of vaccine development is considered with advantages and limitations of each highlighted. In addition, several alternative approaches are described that seek to limit C. difficile germination, colonisation and persistence. It may yet prove that the most effective treatments to limit infection, disease and spread of the organism will require a combination of therapeutic approaches. The potential use and efficacy of these vaccines in low and middle income countries will be depend on the development of a cost effective vaccine and greater understanding of the distribution and extent of disease in these countries.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis identified specific members that were essential for the function of the consortium. In conclusion, species deletions from microbial consortia could be a useful approach to identify relevant interactions between microorganisms and defining metabolic roles in the gut microbiome. Gut microbes associate, compete for, and specialize in specific metabolic tasks. These interactions are dictated by the cross-feeding of degradation or fermentation products. However, the individual contribution of microbes to the function of the gut microbiome is difficult to evaluate. It is essential to understand the complexity of microbial interactions and how the presence or absence of specific microorganisms affects the stability and functioning of the gut microbiome. The experimental approach of this study could be used for identifying keystone species, in addition to redundant functions and conditions that contribute to community stability. Redundancy is an important feature of the microbiome, and its reduction could be useful for the design of microbial consortia with desired metabolic properties enhancing the tasks of the keystone species.Copyright © 2019 Gutiérrez and Garrido.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373492>Bacterial imbalance and gut pathologies: Association and contribution of E. coli in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Hosts and microbes have co-evolved over millions of years.

Recent studies show that gut microbiota diversity and functional activity are synchronized with the host circadian rhythms in healthy individuals, and circadian disruption elicits  in mammalian models. However, no studies have determined the associations between circadian disruption in early life, microbiota colonization, and the consequences for microbiota structure in birds. Chickens, as a major source of protein around the world, are one of the most important agricultural species, and their gut and metabolic health are significant concerns. The poultry industry routinely employs extended photoperiods (>18 h light) as a management tool, and their impacts on the chicken circadian, its role in gut microbiota acquisition in early life (first 3 weeks of life), and consequences for later life microbiota structure remain unknown. In this study, the objectives were to (a) characterize circadian activity under two different light regimes in layer chicken (12/12 h' Light/Dark (LD) and 23/1 h LD), () characterize gut microbiota acquisition and composition in the first 4 weeks of life, (c) determine if gut microbiota oscillate in synchrony with the host circadian rhythm, and (d) to determine if fecal microbiota is representative of cecal microbiota in early life. Expression of clock genes (, , and ) was assayed, and fecal and cecal microbiotas were characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses from birds raised under two photoperiod treatments. Chickens raised under 12/12 LD photoperiods exhibited rhythmic clock gene activity, which was absent in birds raised under the extended (23/1 LD) photoperiod. There was differential microbiota acquisition under different photoperiod regimes in newly hatched chicks.

Hericium erinaceus (H. erinaceus) is a Chinese medicinal fungus, with the effect of prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, we have tested the anti-inflammatory effect of polysaccharide of H. erinaceus (HECP, Mw: 86.67 kDa) in the model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Our data indicated that HECP could improve clinical symptoms and down-regulate key markers of oxidative stresses, including nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). HECP also suppressed the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and decreased the expression of related mRNA. Meanwhile, HECP blocked phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) p65, NF-κ inhibitor alpha (Iκ-α), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Protein kinase  (Akt) in DSS-treated mice. Moreover, HECP reversed DSS-induced gut  and maintained intestinal barrier integrity. In conclusion, HECP ameliorates DSS-induced intestinal injury in mice, which suggests that HECP can serve as a protective dietary nutrient against IBD.Copyright © 2018.

The composition of  varies from host to host, and it changes during the lifetime. It is known that  may be changed because of a diet, bacteriophages and different processes for example, such as inflammation. Like all other areas of medicine, there is a continuous growth in the area of microbiology. Different microbes can reside in all sites of a human body, even in locations that were previously considered as sterile; for example, liver, pancreas, brain and adipose tissue. Presently one of the etiological factors for liver disease is considered to be pro-inflammatory changes in a host's organism. There are lot of supporting data about intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability and its effect on development of liver disease pointing to the gut-liver axis. The gut-liver axis affects pathogenesis of many liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis , chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Gut  has been implicated in the regulation of brain health, emphasizing the gut-brain axis. Also, experiments with mice showed that microorganisms have significant effects on the blood-brain barrier integrity.  can modulate a variety of mechanisms through the gut-liver axis and gut-brain axis. Normal intestinal flora impacts the health of a host in many positive ways, but there is now significant evidence that intestinal , especially altered, have the ability to impact the pathologies of many diseases through different inflammatory mechanisms.

We performed an analytical validation of human immunoassays for cobalamin and folate measurement (AIA-900 analyzer, Tosoh Bioscience) and compared results with those obtained using chemiluminescence assays (Immulite 2000 analyzer, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics). Accuracy, precision, total observable error (TE%), and σ values were calculated for the immunoassays. Correlation and agreement were evaluated with Deming regression, Passing-Bablok regression, and Bland-Altman analysis. Cobalamin intra-assay and inter-assay CVs were 1.8-9.3% and 2.6-6.8%, respectively. Folate intra-assay and inter-assay CVs were 1.5-9.1% and 3.4-8.1%, respectively. TE (%) were ≤19 and ≤31 for cobalamin and folate, respectively. Sigma values were 3.60-11.50 for cobalamin and 2.90-7.50 for folate.

Although not well understood, alterations in the gut microbiota, or , may be responsible for age-related inflammation.Using stroke as a disease model, we tested the hypothesis that a youthful microbiota, when established in aged mice, produces positive outcomes following ischemic stroke. Conversely, an aged microbiota, when established in young mice, produces negative outcomes after stroke. Young and aged male mice had either a young or an aged microbiota established by fecal transplant gavage (FTG). Mice were subjected to ischemic stroke (middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCAO) or sham surgery. During the subsequent weeks, mice underwent behavioral testing and fecal samples were collected for 16S ribosomal RNA analysis of bacterial content.We found that the microbiota is altered after experimental stroke in young mice and resembles the biome of uninjured aged mice. In aged mice, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F:), two main bacterial phyla in gut microbiota, increased ∼9-fold (p < 0.001) compared to young. This increased F: ratio in aged mice is indicative of . Altering the microbiota in young by fecal gavage to resemble that of aged mice (∼6-fold increase in F: ratio, p < 0.001) increased mortality following MCAO, decreased performance in behavioral testing, and increased cytokine levels. Conversely, altering the microbiota in aged to resemble that of young (∼9-fold decrease in F: ratio, p < 0.001) increased survival and improved recovery following MCAO.Aged biome increased the levels of systemic proinflammatory cytokines. We conclude that the gut microbiota can be modified to positively impact outcomes from age-related diseases.

NK33 and NK98 potently suppressed NF-κ activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells. Treatment with NK33 and/or NK98, which were orally gavaged in mice before or after IS treatment, significantly suppressed the occurrence and development of anxiety/depression, infiltration of Iba1⁺ and LPS⁺/CD11b⁺ cells (activated microglia) into the hippocampus, and corticosterone, IL-6, and LPS levels in the blood. Furthermore, they induced hippocampal BDNF expression while NF-κ activation was suppressed. NK33 and/or NK98 treatments suppressed IS-induced colon shortening, myeloperoxidase activity, infiltration of CD11b⁺/CD11c⁺ cells, and IL-6 expression in the colon. Their treatments also suppressed the IS-induced fecal Proteobacteria population and excessive LPS production. They also induced BDNF expression in LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells in vitro.

However, the link between obesity-associated microbiota and gastric pathogenesis has not been clarified. We demonstrated that high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding causes intestinal metaplasia, which are precancerous lesions of the stomach, with augmented gastric leptin signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the precise role of leptin signaling in the altered microbiota composition and pathogenesis in the stomach during diet-induced obesity.Male C57 BL/6 J, leptin receptor (Lepr)-mutated db/db, and gastrointestinal epithelium-specific Lepr conditional knockout (T3 -Lepr cKO) mice were fed a HFD or control diet. Gastrointestinal microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequences and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transplantation of gastric microbiota of HFD-fed mice was performed to evaluate metaplasia onset in recipient mice.One week of HFD caused severe microbial  in the stomach. The microbiota changes were accompanied by increased gastric leptin, leading to the consequent development of intestinal metaplasia. Transplantation of gastric microbiota from HFD-fed mice induced intestinal metaplasia in recipient mice; however, only a limited effect on pathogenesis was noted. HFD-fed db/db mice did not show a decrease in microbial abundance. Moreover, T3 -Lepr cKO mice failed spontaneous obesity, and suppressed decreased abundance of gastric microbiota and occurrence of intestinal metaplasia during HFD feeding similar to db/db mice.Gastric leptin signaling modulates the gastric microbiota community and regulates the pathogenesis in the gastric mucosa.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Sixteen healthy research cats received clindamycin with food, followed 1 h later by either a placebo or synbiotic, daily for 21 days. Fecal samples were collected during baseline, antibiotic administration, and 6 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed, and mass spectrometry was used to determine fecal metabolomic profiles. Results were compared using mixed-model analyses, with  < 0.05 considered significant. Alpha and beta diversity were altered significantly during treatment, with persistent changes in the Shannon and  indices. The relative abundance of  (),  (),  (),  () and  ([]) decreased and relative abundance of  () and  () increased during treatment, followed by variable return to baseline relative abundances. Derangements in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), bile acid, tryptophan, sphingolipid, polyamine, benzoic acid, and cinnaminic acid pathways occurred with significant group by time, group, and time interactions for 10, 5, and 106 metabolites, respectively. Of particular note were changes related to polyamine synthesis. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the role of these alterations in prevention of AAGS in cats, people, and other animals treated with synbiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804187>Chronic ingestion of deoxynivalenol at human dietary levels impairs intestinal homeostasis and gut microbiota in mice.</a></h2><p>The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is a frequent contaminant of cereals and their by-products in areas with a moderate climate. Produced by Fusarium species, it is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins in cereal crops worldwide, and the most frequently occurring type  trichothecene in Europe. Due to its toxic properties, high stability and prevalence, the presence of DON in the food chain could represent a major public health risk. However, despite its well-known acute toxicological effects, information on the adverse effects of realistic exposure remains limited. We orally exposed mice during 9 months to DON at doses relevant for currently estimated human intake and explored the impact on various gut health parameters. DON exposure induced recruitment of regulatory  cells, and activation of regulatory T cells and dendritic cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. Several inflammatory parameters were increased in colon of DON-exposed mice, whereas inversely inflammatory markers were decreased in ileum. Histomorphological impairments were observed from the duodenum to the colon. Both colon and jejunum presented a hyperproliferation of epithelial cells and an increased expression of mature absorptive cells markers. Finally, DON exposure reshaped gut microbial structure and drastically disturbed the abundance of several bacterial phyla, families, and genera, leading to . Chronic oral exposure to human relevant doses of DON induces several disturbances of gut homeostasis with likely pathological implications for susceptible individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189133>Early genistein exposure of California mice and gut microbiota-brain axis effects.</a></h2><p>Human offspring encounter high amounts of phytoestrogens, such as genistein (GEN), through maternal diet and soy-based formulas. Such chemicals can exert estrogenic activity and thereby disrupt neurobehavioral programming. Besides inducing direct host effects, GEN might cause gut  and alter gut metabolites. To determine whether exposure to GEN affects these parameters, California mice (Peromyscus californicus) dams were placed two weeks prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation on a diet supplemented with GEN (250 mg/kg feed weight) or AIN93G phytoestrogen-free control diet (AIN). At weaning, offspring socio-communicative behaviors, gut microbiota and metabolite profiles were assayed. Exposure of offspring to GEN induced sex-dependent effects on gut microbiota and metabolites. GEN exposed females were less likely to investigate a novel female mouse when tested in a three-chamber social test. When isolated, GEN males and females exhibited increased latency to elicit their first call, suggestive of reduced motivation to communicate with other individuals. Correlation analyses revealed interactions between GEN-induced microbiome, metabolome, and socio-communicative behaviors. For instance, comparison of GEN males with AIN males revealed the fraction of calls above 20 kHz was associated with daidzein, tocopherol, Flexispira spp., and Odoribacter spp. Results suggest early GEN exposure disrupts normal socio-communicative behaviors in California mice, which are otherwise evident in these social rodents. Such effects may be due to GEN disruptions on neural programming but might be attributed to GEN-induced microbiota shifts and resultant changes in gut metabolites. Findings indicate cause for concern that perinatal exposure to GEN might detrimentally affect offspring microbiome-gut-brain axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131910>Epigenetic and inflammatory events in experimental periodontitis following systemic microbial challenge.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to determine inflammatory and epigenetic features following induction of oral and gut  in experimental periodontitis in order to examine the interplay between oral and systemic infection.Periodontitis was induced in 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice by (a) Ligature placement (Lig group) (oral challenge); () P. gingivalis gavage (Pg group) (systemic challenge); and (c) the combination of the two models oral and systemic challenge (Pg + Lig). The duration of the experiment was 60 days, and the animals were then sacrificed for analyses. Alveolar bone loss was assessed, and a multiplex immunoassay was performed. Maxillae and gut tissues were immunostained for DNMT3b (de novo methylation marker),  and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and IL-18R1 (inflammation markers).Pg and Pg + Lig groups exhibited higher bone loss when compared to Sham. BAFF, VEGF, RANKL, RANTES and IP-10 were significantly higher with Pg gavage. Likewise, DNMT3b was overexpressed in both gut and maxilla after the Pg administration. The same pattern was observed for BTLA and IL-18R1 in gut tissues.The systemic microbial challenge either alone or in combination with local challenge leads to distinct patterns of inflammatory and epigenetic features when compared to simply locally induced experimental periodontitis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Various preventive and adjuvant therapies based on modulating the gut flora have been proposed for hepatic injury. We aimed to explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CGMCC15058 on rat liver failure, as well as the potential microecological and immunological mechanisms of those effects. . adolescentis CGMCC15058 (3 × 10 CFU), isolated from healthy human stool, was gavaged to Sprague-Dawley rats for 14 days. Acute liver injury was induced on the 15th day by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine. After 24 h, liver and terminal ileum histology, liver function, plasma cytokines, bacterial translocation and gut microbiota composition were assessed. We found that pretreatment with . adolescentis significantly relieved elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bile acid and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and enhanced the expression of mucin 4 and the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. . adolescentis exhibited anti-inflammatory properties as indicated by decreased levels of mTOR and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, as well as elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukins-10 in the liver. Similar anti-inflammatory signs were also found in plasma. . adolescentis significantly altered the microbial community, depleting the common pathogenic taxon Proteus and markedly enriching the taxa Coriobacteriaceae, Bacteroidales and Allobaculum, which are involved in regulating the metabolism of lipids and aromatic amino acids.

Probiotics showed pleiotropic effects on functions of the central nervous system via microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, no studies displayed the neuroprotective effects of probiotics in the Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to test the neuroprotective effects of probiotics in two different models of PD. We evaluated neuroprotective effects of a probiotic cocktail containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium animalis lactis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in PD models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or rotenone utilizing behavioral tests, immunohistochemistry and neurochemical analysis. To assure the neuroprotection came from increased production of butyrate, we further determined beneficial effects of butyrate in the MPTP-mediated PD model. The probiotic mixture overtly protected the dopaminergic neurons against MPTP neurotoxicity. However, the probiotics downregulated expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO)  in the striatum, which was accompanied by a lower level of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), the main neurotoxic metabolite of MPTP. Thus, we extended the investigation into the rotenone-induced PD model. Rescuing effects of the probiotics were observed in the setup, which came with increased levels of neurotrophic factors and butyrate in the brain. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was identified to be a major contributor to the induction of neurotrophic factors and downregulation of MAO . Finally, we demonstrated that sodium butyrate attenuated MPTP-induced neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal pathway. Probiotics could ameliorate neurodegeneration at least partially by increasing butyrate level. These data highlight the role of probiotics for brain health, and their potential as a preventive measure for neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A major contributor to morbidity and mortality in SLE is lupus nephritis (LN). To date, the cause of SLE and LN is incompletely understood but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be involved. In recent years, there have been attempts to consider the intestinal microbial profiles, microbiota, and its role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The composition and elements of gut microbiota have major roles in antibody production, shaping the human  cell repertoire, homeostasis of different populations of helper T cell and Th17:Treg balance, and regulation of the levels of different Th17 cell subpopulations. Disturbance of gut microbiota, called , leads to the development of autoimmunity. To date, few studies have characterized the microbiota composition in SLE. In this review, we will highlight novel findings describing the effect of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors on gut microbiota and immune system. Moreover, we will discuss the possible association between SLE and microbiota composition and concerning how its changes may contribute to the onset of SLE and LN.

One of the organs significantly affected by age is the gut. Age-dependent changes of the gut-associated microbiome have been linked to increased frailty and systemic inflammation. This change in microbial composition with age occurs in parallel with a decline in function of the gut immune system; however, it is not clear whether there is a causal link between the two. Here we report that the defective germinal centre reaction in Peyer's patches of aged mice can be rescued by faecal transfers from younger adults into aged mice and by immunisations with cholera toxin, without affecting germinal centre reactions in peripheral lymph nodes. This demonstrates that the poor germinal centre reaction in aged animals is not irreversible, and that it is possible to improve this response in older individuals by providing appropriate stimuli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615687>Therapeutic effect of a Chlamydia pecorum recombinant major outer membrane protein vaccine on ocular disease in koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus).</a></h2><p>Chlamydia pecorum is responsible for causing ocular infection and disease which can lead to blindness in koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). Antibiotics are the current treatment for chlamydial infection and disease in koalas, however, they can be detrimental for the koala's gastrointestinal tract microbiota and in severe cases, can lead to  and death. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects provided by a recombinant chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) vaccine on ocular disease in koalas. Koalas with ocular disease (unilateral or bilateral) were vaccinated and assessed for six weeks, evaluating any changes to the conjunctival tissue and discharge. Samples were collected pre- and post-vaccination to evaluate both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. We further assessed the infecting C. pecorum genotype, host MHC class II alleles and presence of koala retrovirus type (KoRV-). Our results clearly showed an improvement in the clinical ocular disease state of all seven koalas, post-vaccination. We observed increases in ocular mucosal IgA antibodies to whole C. pecorum elementary bodies, post-vaccination. We found that systemic cell-mediated immune responses to interferon-γ, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17A were not significantly predictive of ocular disease in koalas. Interestingly, one koala did not have as positive a clinical response (in one eye primarily) and this koala was infected with a C. pecorum genotype (E') that was not used as part of the vaccine formula (MOMP genotypes A, F and G). The predominant MHC class II alleles identified were DAb*19, DAb*21 and DBb*05, with no two koalas identified with the same genetic sequence. Additionally, KoRV-, which is associated with chlamydial disease outcome, was identified in two (29%) ocular diseased koalas, which still produced vaccine-induced immune responses and clinical ocular improvements post-vaccination. Our findings show promise for the use of a recombinant chlamydial MOMP vaccine for the therapeutic treatment of ocular disease in koalas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29557050>Dissecting cause and effect in host-microbiome interactions using the combined worm-bug model system.</a></h2><p>High-throughput molecular studies are greatly advancing our knowledge of the human microbiome and its specific role in governing health and disease states.

The etiology of the disease is complex and involves a combination of genetic, environmental, immunological and gut microbial factors. Recurring and bloody diarrhea is the most prevalent and debilitating symptom in IBD. The pathogenesis of IBD-associated diarrhea is multifactorial and is essentially an outcome of mucosal damage caused by persistent inflammation resulting in dysregulated intestinal ion transport, impaired epithelial barrier function and increased accessibility of the pathogens to the intestinal mucosa. Altered expression and/or function of epithelial ion transporters and channels is the principle cause of electrolyte retention and water accumulation in the intestinal lumen leading to diarrhea in IBD. Aberrant barrier function further contributes to diarrhea via leak-flux mechanism. Mucosal penetration of enteric pathogens promotes  and exacerbates the underlying immune system further perpetuating IBD associated-tissue damage and diarrhea. Here, we review the mechanisms of impaired ion transport and loss of epithelial barrier function contributing to diarrhea associated with IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358825>Enterotype-based Analysis of Gut  along the Conventional Adenoma-Carcinoma Colorectal Cancer Pathway.</a></h2><p>The dysbiosis of human gut  is strongly associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The dysbiotic features of the transition from advanced polyp to early-stage CRC are largely unknown. We performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing and enterotype-based gut  analysis study. In addition to Bacteroides- and Prevotella-dominated enterotypes, we identified an Escherichia-dominated enterotype. We found that the dysbiotic features of CRC were dissimilar in overall samples and especially Escherichia-dominated enterotype. Besides a higher abundance of Fusobacterium, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas in all CRC faecal , we found that the most notable characteristic of CRC faecal  was a decreased abundance of potential beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria. Notably, Oscillospira was depleted in the transition from advanced adenoma to stage 0 CRC, whereas Haemophilus was depleted in the transition from stage 0 to early-stage CRC. We further identified 7 different CAGs by analysing bacterial clusters. The abundance of  in cluster 3 significantly increased in the CRC group, whereas that of cluster 5 decreased. The abundance of both cluster 5 and cluster 7 decreased in the Escherichia-dominated enterotype of the CRC group. We present the first enterotype-based faecal  analysis.

Stool and plasma samples from 114 subjects, including in SLE ( = 27), SjS ( = 23), PAPs ( = 11) and undifferentiated connective tissue (UCTD,  = 26) patients, and geographically-matched healthy controls (HCs,  = 27), were collected for  (16s rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolome (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry) analysis to identify shared characteristics across diseases. Out of 130 identified microbial genera, a subset of 29 bacteria was able to differentiate study groups (area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) = 0.730 ± 0.025). A fair classification was obtained with a subset of 41 metabolic peaks out of 254 (AUROC = 0.748 ± 0.021). In both models, HCs were well separated from SADs, while UCTD largely overlapped with the other diseases. In all of the SADs pro-tolerogenic bacteria were reduced, while pathobiont genera were increased. Metabolic alterations included two clusters comprised of: (a) members of the acylcarnitine family, positively correlating with a Prevotella-enriched cluster and negatively correlating with a butyrate-producing bacteria-enriched cluster; and () phospholipids, negatively correlating with butyrate-producing bacteria.

Cell therapy has emerged as an experimental treatment, but current cell sources such as human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stem cells display only partial recapitulation of mature dopaminergic neuron phenotype and function. Nonetheless, stem cell grafts ameliorate PD-associated histological and behavioral deficits likely through stem cell graft-secreted therapeutic substances. We recently demonstrated the potential of hUCB-derived plasma in enhancing motor capabilities and gastrointestinal function, as well as preventing dopaminergic neuronal cell loss, in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD. Recognizing the translational need to test in another PD model, we now examined here the effects of an intravenously transplanted combination of hUCB and plasma into the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned adult rats. Animals received three separate doses of 4 × 10 hUCB cells with plasma beginning at 7 days after stereotaxic 6-OHDA lesion, then behaviorally and immunohistochemically evaluated over 56 days post-lesion. Whereas vehicle-treated lesioned animals exhibited the typical 6-OHDA neurobehavioral symptoms, hUCB and plasma-treated lesioned animals showed significant attenuation of motor function, gut motility, and nigral dopaminergic neuronal survival, combined with diminished pro-inflammatory microbiomes not only in the nigra, but also in the gut.

According to recent clinical studies, the intestinal microbiota play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. We investigated whether specific alterations in the gut microbiota contribute to the reduced exercise capacity of elderly patients with hypertension. This study enrolled 56 subjects, and all patients performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test and underwent fecal bacteria sequencing (16 s ribosomal RNA V4 region). According to peak oxygen uptake values, patients were divided into three groups (Weber A = 19, Weber  = 20, and Weber C = 17). The alpha diversity was not significantly different among the three groups. Regarding the beta diversity, Weber A samples were separate from the other two groups in the nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination plot (ANOSIM pairwise comparisons generated an R > 0.5; p < 0.05). The abundance of Betaproteobacteria, Burkholderiales, Alcaligenaceae, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcaceae was diminished in subjects with a reduced exercise capacity (LDA score > 4.0). Escherichia coli are a primary producer of trimethylamine and inflammation in the human gut, and the abundance of this bacteria was increased in patients with a reduced exercise capacity (LDA score > 4.0).

Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, we screened murine intestinal tracts to identify and quantify αGalCers, and we investigated the αGalCer response to different dietary and physiologic conditions. In both the caecum and the colon of mice, we found 1-15 pmol αGalCer/mg protein; in contrast, mice lacking  (germ-free mice) and fed identical diet did not harbor αGalCer. The identified αGalCer contained a β(R)-hydroxylated hexadecanoyl chain N-linked to C18-sphinganine, which differed from what has been reported with Bacteroides fragilis. (Unlike β-anomeric structures, but similar to αGalCers from . fragilis, the synthetic form of the murine αGalCer induced iNKT cell activation in vitro. Last, we observed a decrease in αGalCer production in mice exposed to conditions that alter the composition of the gut , including Western type diet, colitis, and influenza A virus infection. Collectively, this study suggests that αGalCer is produced by commensals in the mouse intestine and reveals that stressful conditions causing dysbiosis alter its synthesis. The consequences of this altered production on iNKT cell-mediated local and systemic immune responses are worthy of future studies.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532247>Lipid and Cholesterol Homeostasis after Arsenic Exposure and Antibiotic Treatment in Mice: Potential Role of the Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Arsenic-induced liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) signaling inhibition is a potential mechanism underlying the cardiovascular effects caused by arsenic. The gut microbiota can influence arsenic toxic effects.We aimed to explore whether gut microbiota play a role in arsenic-induced LXR/RXR signaling inhibition and the subsequent lipid and cholesterol .Conventional and antibiotic-treated mice (AB-treated mice) were exposed to  and  arsenic for 2 wk. Hepatic mRNAs were extracted and sequenced. The expression levels of genes associated with LXR/RXR signaling were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and serum and hepatic cholesterol levels were measured. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based lipidomics were used to examine serum and hepatic lipids.Pathway analysis indicated that arsenic exposure differentially influenced the hepatic signaling pathways in conventional and AB-treated mice. The expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (), and cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (), as well as cholesterol efflux genes, including ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 5/8 () and cluster of differentiation 36 (), was lower in arsenic-exposed conventional mice but not in AB-treated mice. Similarly, under arsenic exposure, the hepatic expression of scavenger receptor class  member 1 (), which is involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), was lower in conventional mice, but was higher in AB-treated animals compared with controls. Correspondingly, arsenic exposure exerted opposite effects on the serum cholesterol levels in conventional and AB-treated mice, i.e., higher serum cholesterol levels in conventional mice but lower levels in AB-treated mice than in respective controls. Serum lipid levels, especially triglyceride (TG) levels, were higher in conventional mice exposed to  arsenic, while arsenic exposure did not significantly affect the serum lipids in AB-treated mice. Liver lipid patterns were also differentially perturbed in a microbiota-dependent manner.Our results suggest that in mice, the gut microbiota may be a critical factor regulating arsenic-induced LXR/RXR signaling perturbation, suggesting that modulation of the gut microbiota might be an intervention strategy to reduce the toxic effects of arsenic on lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4415.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413188>Microbiota  and barrier dysfunction in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancers: exploring a common ground hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease which arises as a result of the interaction of genetic, environmental, barrier and microbial factors leading to chronic inflammation in the intestine. Patients with IBD had a higher risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC), of which the subset was classified as colitis-associated cancers. Genetic polymorphism of innate immune receptors had long been considered a major risk factor for IBD, and the mutations were also recently observed in CRC. Altered microbial composition (termed microbiota dybiosis) and dysfunctional gut barrier manifested by epithelial hyperpermeability and high amount of mucosa-associated bacteria were observed in IBD and CRC patients. The findings suggested that aberrant immune responses to penetrating commensal microbes may play key roles in fueling disease progression. Accumulative evidence demonstrated that mucosa-associated bacteria harbored colitogenic and protumoral properties in experimental models, supporting an active role of bacteria as pathobionts (commensal-derived opportunistic pathogens). Nevertheless, the host factors involved in bacterial  and conversion mechanisms from lumen-dwelling commensals to mucosal pathobionts remain unclear. Based on the observation of gut leakiness in patients and the evidence of epithelial hyperpermeability prior to the onset of mucosal histopathology in colitic animals, it was postulated that the epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with mucosal enrichment of specific bacterial strains may predispose the shift to disease-associated microbiota. The speculation of leaky gut as an initiating factor for microbiota  that eventually led to pathological consequences was proposed as the "common ground hypothesis", which will be highlighted in this review. Overall, the understanding of the core interplay between gut microbiota and epithelial barriers at early subclinical phases will shed light to novel therapeutic strategies to manage chronic inflammatory disorders and colitis-associated cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206804>Gut microbial-derived butyrate is inversely associated with IgE responses to allergens in childhood asthma.</a></h2><p>A comprehensive metabolomics-based approach to address the impact of specific gut microbiota on allergen sensitization for childhood rhinitis and asthma is still lacking.Eighty-five children with rhinitis (n = 27) and with asthma (n = 34) and healthy controls (n = 24) were enrolled.

Levels of histidine and butyrate metabolites were significantly reduced in children with rhinitis (P = 0.029) and asthma (P = 0.009), respectively. In children with asthma, a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria, including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia spp., and an increase in Clostridium spp. were negatively correlated with fecal amino acids and butyrate, respectively (P < 0.01). Increased Escherichia spp. accompanied by increased β-alanine and 4-hydroxybutyrate appeared to reduce butyrate production. Low fecal butyrate was significantly associated with increased total serum and mite allergen-specific IgE levels in children with asthma (P < 0.05).A reduced fecal butyrate is associated with increased mite-specific IgE levels and the risk of asthma in early childhood. Fecal β-alanine could be a specific biomarker connecting the metabolic  of gut microbiota, Clostridium and Escherichia spp., in childhood asthma.© 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Microbiome protection via antibiotic inactivation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents a strategy to limit antibiotic exposure of the colonic microbiota. Proof of concept for this approach was achieved with an orally-administered beta-lactamase enzyme, SYN-004 (ribaxamase), that was demonstrated to degrade ceftriaxone excreted into the GI tract and protect the gut microbiome from antibiotic-mediated . Ribaxamase efficiently degrades penicillin and cephalosporin beta-lactam antibiotics, but is not active against carbapenems. To expand this microbiome protection strategy to include all classes of beta-lactams, three distinct carbapenemases were evaluated for manufacturability, antibiotic degradation spectrum, and stability in human intestinal fluid.  production strains were generated for P2A, a novel metallo-enzyme isolated from , New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), and  carbapenemase (KPC). While all three enzymes effectively inactivated a broad range of antibiotics, including penicillins, most cephalosporins, and carbapenems in vitro, only P2A retained biological activity when incubated with human chyme. As functional stability in the intestinal tract is a key requirement for an orally-delivered enzyme, P2A was chosen as a potential clinical candidate. An enteric formulation of P2A was developed, called SYN-006, that was inert under high acid conditions, with enzyme dissolution occurring at pH > 5.5. SYN-006 has the potential to expand microbiome protection via antibiotic inactivation to include all classes of beta-lactam antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29892745>Bifidobacteria attenuate the development of metabolic disorders, with inter- and intra-species differences.</a></h2><p>Host gut microbiota  occurs for multiple reasons and is often accompanied by chronic inflammation induced by a high-fat-high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and related metabolic disorders. Intervention with probiotics is a novel strategy for amelioration of metabolic syndrome, which is believed to regulate the gut microbiota composition to some extent. We investigated the relationship amongst bifidobacteria treatment, HFHS diet-induced metabolic disorders and the gut microbiota composition. Seven strains of bifidobacteria from four species were individually administered to rats fed a HFHS diet for 12 weeks. Various bifidobacteria strains showed various effects on the recovery of metabolic disorders and gut microbiota , and these effects seemed to be inter- or intra-species specific. Bifidobacterium longum, . adolescentis and . bifidum seemed to affect the blood glucose balance, whilst two strains of . breve showed extremely different effects in this area. However, only one strain of . longum and the . adolescentis displayed significant regulation of blood lipid levels. The protective effects of bifidobacteria on the pancreas were strongly correlated with those on blood glucose. Furthermore, the influence of bifidobacteria on gut microbiota  also showed a potential relationship with symptoms of metabolic disorders. Of these seven strains, . adolescentis Z25 displayed an outstanding ability to alleviate metabolic syndrome, including glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, tissue damage and gut microbiota . This strain, coupled with other prebiotics and probiotics, could be used as a potential treatment approach for metabolic syndrome induced by a HFHS diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600845>Gut microbiota  in patients with hepatitis  virus-induced chronic liver disease covering chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The information regarding the effect of hepatitis  virus (HBV) infection on gut microbiota and the relationship between gut microbiota  and hepatitis  virus-induced chronic liver disease (HBVCLD) is limited. In this study, we aimed at characterizing the gut microbiota composition in the three different stages of hepatitis  virus-induced chronic liver disease patients and healthy individuals. Faecal samples and clinical data were collected from HBVCLD patients and healthy individuals. The 16S rDNA gene amplification products were sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis including alpha diversity and PICRUSt was performed. A total of 19 phyla, 43 classes, 72 orders, 126 families and 225 genera were detected. The beta-diversity showed a separate clustering of healthy controls and HBVCLD patients covering chronic hepatitis (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); and gut microbiota of healthy controls was more consistent, whereas those of CHB, LC and HCC varied substantially. The abundance of Firmicutes was lower, and Bacteroidetes was higher in patients with CHB, LC and HCC than in healthy controls. Predicted metagenomics of microbial communities showed an increase in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism-related genes and lipid metabolism-related genes in HBVCLD than in healthy individuals. Our study suggested that HBVCLD is associated with gut , with characteristics including, a gain in potential bacteria and a loss in potential beneficial bacteria or genes. Further study of CHB, LC and HCC based on microbiota may provide a novel insight into the pathogenesis of HBVCLD as well as a novel treatment strategy.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30608881>Phosphatidylglycerols are induced by gut  and inflammation, and favorably modulate adipose tissue remodeling in obesity.</a></h2><p>Lipidomic techniques can improve our understanding of complex lipid interactions that regulate metabolic diseases. Here, a serum phospholipidomics analysis identified associations between phosphatidylglycerols (PGs) and gut microbiota . Compared with the other phospholipids, serum PGs were the most elevated in patients with low microbiota gene richness, which were normalized after a dietary intervention that restored gut microbial diversity. Serum PG levels were positively correlated with metagenomic functional capacities for bacterial LPS synthesis and host markers of low-grade inflammation; transcriptome databases identified PG synthase, the first committed enzyme in PG synthesis, as a potential mediator. Experiments in mice and cultured human-derived macrophages demonstrated that LPS induces PG release. Acute PG treatment in mice altered adipose tissue gene expression toward remodeling and inhibited ex vivo lipolysis in adipose tissue, suggesting that PGs favor lipid storage. Indeed, several PG species were associated with the severity of obesity in mice and humans. Finally, despite enrichment in PGs in bacterial membranes, experiments employing gnotobiotic mice colonized with recombinant PG overproducing Lactococcus lactis showed limited direct contribution of microbial PGs to the host. In summary, PGs are inflammation-responsive lipids indirectly regulated by the gut microbiota via endotoxins and regulate adipose tissue homeostasis in obesity.-Kayser, .

Herein, we investigated the effects of maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption on the gut microbiota and serum profile of mice offspring, and attempted to explore the beneficial roles of maternal probiotics intervention. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed with normal diet, HFD or HFD with daily probiotics (. breve DM8310, L. acidophilus DM8302, L. casei DM8121 and S. thermophilus DM8309) by gavage starting 6 weeks prior to breeding and continued throughout gestation and lactation. Pups of HFD dams had higher levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glucose, insulin and leptin compared to those of chow-fed dams. Maternal probiotics intervention resulted in a decrease in the lipid levels in all the pups, while the glucose, insulin and leptin levels were decreased only in adult female pups compared to those from HFD-fed dams; the decreased levels were similar to those in the pups of chow-fed dams. In line with these plasma changes, maternal HFD persistently altered the composition of the offspring gut microbiota in a sex specific way. Maternal probiotics intervention could ameliorate gut microbiota  in the offspring. Such intervention showed better effects particularly for the female pups at adulthood. In conclusion, maternal HFD-induced gut microbiota  and metabolic disorder could persist through the adulthood of the offspring. Maternal probiotics intervention can negate the detrimental effects of maternal HFD on the gut microbiota and metabolism in the offspring in a sex specific way.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892034>Oral Administration of Bovine Lactoferrin-Derived Lactoferricin (Lfcin)  Could Attenuate Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Induced Intestinal Disease through Improving Intestinal Barrier Function and Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Lactoferricin (Lfcin) , derived from lactoferrin in whey, has attracted considerable attention because of its multiple biological functions. Zoonotic enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 has adverse effects on intestinal epithelial barrier function, leading to serious intestinal disease. In this study, the EHEC O157:H7-induced intestinal dysfunction model was developed to investigate the effects of Lfcin  on EHEC O157:H7-induced epithelial barrier disruption and microbiota . Results showed that the inflammatory infiltration indexes in the jejunum of Lfcin -treated animals were significantly decreased.

The abundance of  and  was quantified relative to the total amount of bacteria using quantitative-PCR. To assess butyrate production of gut microbiota, gene copy numbers of the butyryl-CoA:acetate-CoA transferase (BCoAT) gene were quantified by qPCR. The inflammatory activity was defined by fecal (f)-calprotectin.  No correlation between the relative abundance of , the  group, or copy numbers of the BCoAT gene, and f-calprotectin was observed in the total sample set.

Probiotics are routinely used to treat AAD in clinical practice; however, the effectiveness and mechanisms by which probiotics alleviate symptoms remain poorly understood. We previously isolated a non-toxic  strain ZY-312, which has been verified to be beneficial in certain infection disorders. However, the precise role of this commensal bacterium in AAD is unknown. In this study, we successfully established an AAD rat model by exposing rats to appropriate antibiotics. These rats developed diarrhea symptoms and showed alterations in their intestinal microbiota, including overgrowth of some pathogenic bacteria. In addition, gastrointestinal barrier defects, indicated by compromised aquaporin expression, aberrant tight junction proteins, and decreased abundance of mucus-filled goblet cells, were also detected in ADD rats compared with control animals. Of note, oral treatment with  strain ZY-312 ameliorated AAD-related diarrhea symptoms by increasing the abundance of specific commensal microbiota. Interestingly, we demonstrated that these changes were coincident with the restoration of intestinal barrier function and enterocyte regeneration in AAD rats. In summary, we identified a potential probiotic therapeutic strategy for AAD and identified the vital roles of  strain ZY-312 in modulating the colonic bacterial community and participating in microbiota-mediated epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901846>The Safety and Tolerability of a Potential Alginate-Based Iron Chelator; Results of A Healthy Participant Study.</a></h2><p>Evidence supporting the ferro-toxic nature of iron in the progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is becoming well established. A microbial  is observed in IBD patients, and intra-luminal colonic-iron is able to support a more pathogenic community of bacteria; whether this is attributed to the development of IBD and how iron could be mediating these microbial changes is still unknown. Dietary fibres are commonly used in pre-biotic supplements to beneficially affect the host by improving the viability of bacterial communities within the colon. Alginates are a class of biopolymers considered as prebiotics due to their fibre-like composition and are able to bind metal cations, in particular, iron. Considering that iron excess is able to negatively alter the microbiome, the use of alginate as a food supplement could be useful in colonic-iron chelation. As such, this first-in-man study aimed to assess whether the use of alginate as a dietary iron chelator was both safe and well tolerated. In addition, the impact of alginate on the microbiome and iron levels was assessed by using an intestinal model SHIME (Simulation of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem). Alginate was supplemented into the diets (3 g/day) of healthy volunteers ( = 17) for 28 days. Results from this study suggest that daily ingestion of 3 g alginate was well tolerated with very minor side effects. There were no detrimental changes in a variety of haematological parameters or the intestinal microbiome. The bacterial communities within the SHIME model were also not influenced by iron and or alginate; it is possible that alginate may be susceptible to bacterial or enzymatic degradation within the gastro-intestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29693447>Chronic kidney disease, uremic milieu, and its effects on gut bacterial microbiota .</a></h2><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that gut bacterial microbiota is altered in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), though the mechanism of which this  takes place is not well understood.

Increased intestinal urea concentration has been hypothesized as a leading contributor to dysbiotic changes in CKD. We show that urea transporters (UT)-A and UT- mRNA are both expressed throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract. The noted increase in intestinal urea concentration appears to be independent of UTs' expression. Urea supplementation in drinking water resulted in alteration in bacterial gut microbiota that is quite different than that seen in CKD.

Autologous transplantation of fecal microbiota of Ldlr mice served as control. Mice were cohoused for 8 or 13 weeks and fed chow or high-fat cholesterol-rich diet. Fecal samples were collected, and factors related to inflammation, metabolism, intestinal health, and atherosclerotic phenotypes were measured. Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr microbiota into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice.

A breakdown in this tolerance leads to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanisms by which intestinal macrophages normally become conditioned to promote microbial tolerance are unclear. Strong epidemiological evidence linking disruption of the gut microbiota by antibiotic use early in life to IBD indicates an important role for the gut microbiota in modulating intestinal immunity. Here, we show that antibiotic use causes intestinal macrophages to become hyperresponsive to bacterial stimulation, producing excess inflammatory cytokines. Re-exposure of antibiotic-treated mice to conventional microbiota induced a long-term, macrophage-dependent increase in inflammatory T helper 1 (T1) responses in the colon and sustained . The consequences of this dysregulated macrophage activity for T cell function were demonstrated by increased susceptibility to infections requiring T17 and T2 responses for clearance (bacterial  and helminth  infections), corresponding with increased inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were depleted during antibiotic administration; supplementation of antibiotics with the SCFA butyrate restored the characteristic hyporesponsiveness of intestinal macrophages and prevented T cell dysfunction. Butyrate altered the metabolic behavior of macrophages to increase oxidative phosphorylation and also promoted alternative macrophage activation. In summary, the gut microbiota is essential to maintain macrophage-dependent intestinal immune homeostasis, mediated by SCFA-dependent pathways. Oral antibiotics disrupt this process to promote sustained T cell-mediated dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections, highlighting important implications of repeated broad-spectrum antibiotic use.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The profile of bioregulators in women with premature births was characterized by a high content of TLR-4, TNF-a and an increase in PLA2 activity and a decrease in the activity of the p65 subunit of NF-kB. 89 women aged 20-39 years were examined at 34-40 weeks gestation. They were divided into two groups: 42 women with preterm birth at 34-36.6 weeks, the control group is represented by 47 patients. The risk factors for PB are the presence of PB in history, endocervicitis, colpitis, , diseases of the urinary system (chronic pyelonephritis, chronic cystitis), aggravated obstetric and gynecological history (the threat of abortion during gestation, moderate preeclampsia, anemia of the pregnant woman). The obtained data of the studied bioregulators testify to the role of the infectious inflammatory process in the development of PB, which is evidenced by the high level of TLR-4, a component of innate immunity leading to the activation of the TLR-4 signaling pathway, which increases the activity of PLA2-factor of premature contractile activity of the uterus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445037>Antigen-Specific Mucosal Immunity Regulates Development of Intestinal Bacteria-Mediated Diseases.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of the  has been associated with development of complex diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. However, no method has been developed to control disease-associated commensal microbes. We investigated whether immunization with microbial antigens, using CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan as adjuvants, induces systemic antigen-specific IgA and IgG production and affects development of diseases in mice.C57BL/6 mice were given intramuscular injections of antigens (ovalbumin, cholera toxin -subunit, or pneumococcal surface protein A) combined with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan. Blood and fecal samples were collected weekly and antigen-specific IgG and IgA titers were measured. Lymph nodes and spleens were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antigen-specific splenic T-helper 1 cells, T-helper 17 cells, and memory  cells. Six weeks after primary immunization, mice were given a oral, nasal, or vaginal boost of ovalbumin; intestinal lamina propria, bronchial lavage, and vaginal swab samples were collected and antibodies and cytokines were measured. Some mice were also given oral cholera toxin or intranasal Streptococcus pneumoniae and the severity of diarrhea or pneumonia was analyzed. Gnotobiotic mice were gavaged with fecal material from obese individuals, which had a high abundance of Clostridium ramosum (a commensal microbe associated with obesity and diabetes), and were placed on a high-fat diet 2 weeks after immunization with C ramosum. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Serum and fecal samples from mice given injections of antigens in combination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and curdlan for 3 weeks contained antigen-specific IgA and IgG, and splenocytes produced interferon-gamma and interleukin 17A. Lamina propria, bronchial, and vaginal samples contained antigen-specific IgA after the ovalbumin boost. This immunization regimen prevented development of diarrhea after injection of cholera toxin, and inhibited lung colonization by S pneumoniae. In gnotobiotic mice colonized with C ramosum and placed on a high-fat diet, the mice that had been immunized with C ramosum became less obese than the nonimmunized mice.Injection of mice with microbial antigens and adjuvant induces antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. Immunization with S pneumoniae antigen prevented lung infection by this bacteria, and immunization with C ramosum reduced obesity in mice colonized with this microbe and placed on a high-fat diet. This immunization approach might be used to protect against microbe-associated disorders of intestine.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using  and  models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut , defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. A better understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD pathogenesis may provide better sub-classification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches for disease management.

Bacterial metabolism is an important regulator of susceptibility in vitro and likely plays a large role within the host. We applied a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to link antibiotic-induced taxonomic and transcriptional responses within the murine microbiome. We found that antibiotics significantly alter the expression of key metabolic pathways at the whole-community and single-species levels. Notably, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which blooms in response to amoxicillin, upregulated polysaccharide utilization. In vitro, we found that the sensitivity of this bacterium to amoxicillin was elevated by glucose and reduced by polysaccharides. Accordingly, we observed that dietary composition affected the abundance and expansion of . thetaiotaomicron, as well as the extent of microbiome disruption with amoxicillin. Our work indicates that the metabolic environment of the microbiome plays a role in the response of this community to antibiotics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Intestinal microbiota alterations during adolescence influence the expression of molecular factors involved in neuronal development in both the ENS and CNS. In this study, we have evaluated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin-related kinase  (TrkB) in juvenile mice ENS and CNS, after a 2-week antibiotic (ABX) treatment. In both mucosa and mucosa-deprived whole-wall small intestine segments of ABX-treated animals, BDNF and TrKB mRNA and protein levels significantly increased. In longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations of ABX-treated mice the percentage of myenteric neurons staining for BDNF and TrkB was significantly higher than in controls. After ABX treatment, a consistent population of BDNF- and TrkB-immunoreactive neurons costained with SP and CGRP, suggesting up-regulation of BDNF signaling in both motor and sensory myenteric neurons. BDNF and TrkB protein levels were downregulated in the hippocampus and remained unchanged in the prefrontal cortex of ABX-treated animals. Immunostaining for BDNF and TrkB decreased in the hippocampus CA3 and dentate gyrus subregions, respectively, and remained unchanged in the prefrontal cortex. These data suggest that  differentially influences the expression of BDNF-TrkB in the juvenile mice ENS and CNS.

We investigated associations between bacteremia from specific intestinal microbes and occurrence of CRC.We performed a retrospective study after collecting data on 13,096 adult patients (exposed group) in Hong Kong hospitalized with bacteremia (identified by blood culture test) without a previous diagnosis of cancer from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2015. We collected data on intestinal microbes previously associated with CRC (genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Filifactor, Fusobacterium, Gemella, Granulicatella, Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Solobacterium, and Streptococcus). Clinical information, including patient demographics, comorbid medical conditions, date of bacteremia, and bacterial species identified, were collected. The incidence of biopsy-proved CRC was compared between the exposed and unexposed (patients without bacteremia matched for age, sex, and comorbidities) groups.The risk of CRC was increased in patients with bacteremia from  fragilis (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.85, 95% CI = 2.62-5.64, P = 5.5 × 10) or Streptococcus gallolyticus (HR = 5.73, 95% CI = 2.18-15.1, P = 4.1 × 10) compared with the unexposed group. In addition, the risk of CRC was increased in patients with bacteremia from Fusobacterium nucleatum (HR = 6.89, 95% CI = 1.70-27.9, P = .007), Peptostreptococcus species (HR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.47-6.35, P = .003), Clostridium septicum (HR = 17.1, 95% CI = 1.82-160, P = .013), Clostridium perfringens (HR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.16-4.52, P = .017), or Gemella morbillorum (HR = 15.2, 95% CI = 1.54-150, P = .020).

Here, three (APDE-8, CODE-9, and CYDE-21) novel cationic amphiphilic bolaamphiphiles (CABs) were synthesized and tested for their ability to form nano-sized vesicles or vesicle-like aggregates (CABVs), which were characterized based on their physiochemical properties, their antibacterial activities, and their toxicity toward colonocyte (Caco-2) cell cultures. The antibacterial activity of empty CABVs was tested against cultures of E. coli, . fragilis, and E. faecalis, and against C. difficile by "loading" CABVs with 25-mer antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting dnaE. Our results demonstrate that empty CABVs have minimal colonocyte toxicity until concentrations of 71 µM, with CODE-9 demonstrating the least toxicity. Empty CABVs had little effect on C. difficile growth in culture (MIC90 ≥ 160 µM). While APDE-8 and CODE-9 nanocomplexes demonstrated high MIC against C. difficile cultures (>300 µM), CYDE-21 nanocomplexes demonstrated MIC at CABV concentrations of 19 µM. Empty CABVs formed from APDE-8 and CODE-9 had virtually no effect on E. coli, . fragilis, and E. faecalis across all tested concentrations, while empty CYDE-21 demonstrated MIC of >160 µM against E. coli and >40 µM against . fragilisand E. faecalis. Empty CABVs have limited antibacterial activity and they can deliver an amount of ASO effective against C. difficile at CABV concentrations associated with limited colonocyte toxicity, while sparing other bacteria. With further refinement, antisense therapies for CDI may become a viable alternative to conventional antibiotic treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383855>Enteric infection coupled with chronic Notch pathway inhibition alters colonic mucus composition leading to , barrier disruption and colitis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal mucus layer disruption and gut microflora modification in conjunction with tight junction (TJ) changes can increase colonic permeability that allows bacterial dissemination and intestinal and systemic disease. We showed previously that Citrobacter rodentium (CR)-induced colonic crypt hyperplasia and/or colitis is regulated by a functional cross-talk between the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. In the current study, mucus analysis in the colons of CR-infected (108 CFUs) and Notch blocker Dibenzazepine (DBZ, i.p.; 10μmol/Kg .w.)-treated mice revealed significant alterations in the composition of trace O-glycans and complex type and hybrid N-glycans, compared to CR-infected mice alone that preceded/accompanied alterations in 16S rDNA microbial community structure and elevated EUB338 staining. While mucin-degrading bacterium, Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) along with Enterobacteriaceae belonging to Proteobacteria phyla increased in the feces, antimicrobial peptides Angiogenin-4, Intelectin-1 and Intelectin-2, and ISC marker Dclk1, exhibited dramatic decreases in the colons of CR-infected/DBZ-treated mice. Also evident was a loss of TJ and adherens junction protein immuno-staining within the colonic crypts that negatively impacted paracellular barrier. These changes coincided with the loss of Notch signaling and exacerbation of mucosal injury. In response to a cocktail of antibiotics (Metronidazole/ciprofloxacin) for 10 days, there was increased survival that coincided with: i) decreased levels of Proteobacteria, ii) elevated Dclk1 levels in the crypt and, iii) reduced paracellular permeability. Thus, enteric infections that interfere with Notch activity may promote mucosal  that is preceded by changes in mucus composition. Controlled use of antibiotics seems to alleviate gut  but may be insufficient to promote colonic crypt regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29637269>Study on the effects of an oral lactobacilli and lactoferrin complex in women with intermediate vaginal microbiota.</a></h2><p>In the vagina of healthy reproductive-aged women, several microbial species maintain a finely tuned mutualistic relationship with the host providing the first-line of defense against the colonization by opportunistic pathogens, which are the leading cause of  or vaginal infections (bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and aerobic vaginitis). The use of probiotic lactobacilli to prevent vaginal infections has a good rationale, and an excellent safety record, but so far only a few strains have been clinically proven to be effective, particularly to prevent BV. The aim of the clinical trial was to evaluate the changes in Nugent score in women with intermediate vaginal microbiota treated with oral Lactobacillus acidophilus GLA-14 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 mixture, in combination with bovine lactoferrin RCX™ (Respecta) or placebo, for 15 days.Vaginal swabs were collected from each woman at baseline and at the end of probiotic treatment and analyzed by RT-PCR. Both symptoms of abnormal vaginal micorbiota and adverse effects were assessed throughout the study.The results showed that oral intake of lactobacilli/lactoferrin mixture led to significant vaginal colonization by L. acidophilus GLA-14 and L. rhamnosus HN001 showing that both strains can colonize vagina following oral ingestion. The effect of such colonization is correlated with the restoration of normal Nugent score (values 0-3) and an improvement of symptoms of abnormal vaginal micorbiota including itching and discharge.Oral consumption of lactobacilli/lactoferrin complex corroborates the effectiveness of using lactobacilli for supporting vaginal health and provides a rational basis for future studies on vaginal infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480433>Bone Diseases in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis is a frequently observed complication in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly liver cirrhosis and cholestatic liver diseases. In addition, osteoporosis is critical in patients receiving a liver transplant. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated bone diseases in patients with more frequently observed chronic liver disease, such as chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Osteoporosis is a disease caused by an imbalance in the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

Importantly, activated immune cells affect the progression of osteoporosis, and chronic inflammation may exert an additional effect on the existing pathophysiology of osteoporosis. The  of the intestinal tract may also affect the progression of bone loss in patients with chronic liver disease. Recently, studies regarding the effects of chronic inflammation on dysbiosis in bone diseases have been conducted. However, mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver disease are complex and precise mechanisms remain unknown. The following special considerations in patients with chronic liver disease are reviewed: bone diseases in patients who underwent a liver transplant, the association between chronic hepatitis  virus infection treatment and bone diseases, the association between sarcopenia and bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease, and the association between chronic liver disease and avascular necrosis of the hip. Few guidelines are currently available for the management of low bone mineral density or bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease. Due to increased life expectancy and therapeutic advances in chronic liver disease, the importance of managing osteoporosis and other bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease is expected to increase.

GM, which is also called "the new virtual metabolic organ", makes axis with a number of extraintestinal organs, such as kidneys, brain, cardiovascular, and the bone system. The gut-liver axis has attracted greater attention in recent years. GM communication is bi-directional and involves endocrine and immunological mechanisms. In this way, gut- and composition of "ancient" microbiota could be linked to pathogenesis of numerous chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis  (CHB), chronic hepatitis C (CHC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), development of liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this paper, we discuss the current evidence supporting a GM role in the management of different chronic liver diseases and potential new therapeutic GM targets, like fecal transplantation, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics. We conclude that population-level shifts in GM could play a regulatory role in the gut-liver axis and, consequently, etiopathogenesis of chronic liver diseases.
