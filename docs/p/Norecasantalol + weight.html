However, the mechanical properties of the generated fibers are still lacking. Therefore, we are presenting in this work a promising improvement in the elasticity properties of PVDF nanofibrous membrane through thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) additives. Morphological, physical, and mechanical analyses were performed for membranes developed from different blend ratios. Then, the impact of added  ratio of TPU on the piezoelectric response of the formed nanofibrous composite membranes was studied. The piezoelectric characteristics were studied through impulse loading testing where the electric voltage had been detected under applied mass . Piezoelectric characteristics were investigated further through a pressure mode test the developed nanofibrous composite membranes were found to be mechanically deformed under applied electric potential. This work introduces promising high elastic piezoelectric materials that can be used in a wide variety of applications including energy harvesting, wearable electronics, self-cleaning filters, and motion/vibration sensors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659696>When global and local molecular descriptors are more than the sum of its parts: Simple, But Not Simpler?</a></h2><p>In this report, we introduce a set of aggregation operators (AOs) to calculate global and local (group and atom type) molecular descriptors (MDs) as a generalization of the classical approach of molecular encoding using the sum of the atomic (or fragment) contributions. These AOs are implemented in a new and free software denominated MD-LOVIs ( http://tomocomd.com/md-lovis ), which allows for the calculation of MDs from atomic  vector and LOVIs (local vertex invariants). This software was developed in Java programming language and employed the Chemical Development Kit (CDK) library for handling chemical structures and the calculation of atomic . An analysis of the complexities of the algorithms presented herein demonstrates that these aspects were efficiently implemented. The calculation speed experiments show that the MD-LOVIs software has satisfactory behavior when compared to software such as Padel, CDKDescriptor, DRAGON and Bluecal software. Shannon's entropy (SE)-based variability studies demonstrate that MD-LOVIs yields indices with greater information content when compared to those of popular academic and commercial software. A principal component analysis reveals that our approach captures chemical information orthogonal to that codified by the DRAGON, Padel and Mold2 software, as a result of the several generalizations in MD-LOVIs not used in other programs. Lastly, three QSARs were built using multiple linear regression with genetic algorithms, and the statistical parameters of these models demonstrate that the MD-LOVIs indices obtained with AOs yield better performance than those obtained when the summation operator is used exclusively. Moreover, it is also revealed that the MD-LOVIs indices yield models with comparable to superior performance when compared to other QSAR methodologies reported in the literature, despite their simplicity. The studies performed herein collectively demonstrated that MD-LOVIs software generates indices as simple as possible, but not simpler and that use of AOs enhances the diversity of the chemical information codified, which consequently improves the performance of traditional MDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662172>Benefits and Barriers to Exercise among Individuals with Class III Obesity.</a></h2><p> In this paper, we describe the degree of exercise and sedentary behavior among individuals with class III obesity, identify perceived benefits and barriers to exercise, and discuss the association of exercise barriers with activity and sedentary behavior.  This was a cross-sectional study at a tertiary care center. Adults with class III obesity referred to the Bariatric Program completed the exercise benefits/barriers scale, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form, and the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire. Participants were asked to list additional exercise barriers.  The 80 participants engaged in a median of 699.0 MET-minutes/week of physical activity, and were sedentary 10.4 ± 4.5 hours/day. The mean exercise benefits/barriers score was 126.3 ± 12.8 (barrier score = 31.6 ± 5.3, benefit score = 87.8 ± 9.4). Less than 60% identified exercise as enjoyable, or a form of social interaction. More than 60% identified exercise barriers related to physical exertion. Additional barriers included pain and musculoskeletal comorbidities (39.4%), psychological factors (14.7%), and  (12.6%). There was no statistically significant association between exercise barriers and sedentary behavior (p = .69) or physical activity (p = .08).  Participants reported low physical activity, with high sedentary behavior and exercise barriers. Physical exertion, pain and musculoskeletal comorbidities were common barriers, which highlights importance of thoughtful exercise with attention to exercise barriers in this population .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663091>Poly(triazolyl methacrylate) glycopolymers as potential targeted unimolecular nanocarriers.</a></h2><p>Synthetic glycopolymers are increasingly investigated as multivalent ligands for a range of biological and biomedical applications. This study indicates that glycopolymers with a fine-tuned balance between hydrophilic sugar pendant units and relatively hydrophobic polymer backbones can act as single-chain targeted nanocarriers for low molecular  hydrophobic molecules. Non-covalent complexes formed from poly(triazolyl methacrylate) glycopolymers and low molecular  hydrophobic guest molecules were characterised through a range of analytical techniques - DLS, SLS, TDA, fluorescence spectroscopy, surface tension analysis - and molecular dynamics (MD) modelling simulations provided further information on the macromolecular characteristics of these single chain complexes. Finally, we show that these nanocarriers can be utilised to deliver a hydrophobic guest molecule, Nile red, to both soluble and surface-immobilised concanavalin A (Con A) and peanut agglutinin (PNA) model lectins with high specificity, showing the potential of non-covalent complexation with specific glycopolymers in targeted guest-molecule delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental Colitis.</a></h2><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing , presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither  nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661334>A narrative review of adjuvants in  fertilisation: evidence for good clinical practice.</a></h2><p>A review of studies published between January 1, 1984 and January 31, 2019 was performed with the aim of analysing the efficacy and adverse effects of commonly used adjuvants to in vitro fertilisation. The authors preferentially selected recent systematic reviews and randomised control trials (where available) from an electronic literature search. The review showed that low molecular  heparin, corticosteroids and embryo glue may be of use in selected patient groups. Other adjuncts (such as growth hormone, assisted hatching, endometrial disruption and dehydroepiandrosterone) cannot currently be recommended as collated results showed no overall benefit to clinical pregnancy rates or live birth rates. There is a significant lack of robust evidence in this field, and areas in particular need of further research have been highlighted. In conclusion, caution should be exercised in prescribing adjuvants in in vitro fertilisation, either individually or in combination as further research is needed to ascertain their efficacy. Many adjuvants carry the risk of adverse effects which should also be considered. Patients should be clearly informed of the evidence, and where it is lacking, for these treatments. There is a need for further good quality trials to address the questions regarding best practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659708>Glycyrrhizic acid modulates the atrazine-induced apoptosis in rabbit spleen.</a></h2><p>Atrazine (ATR) is a common herbicide used worldwide. It is a potent endocrine disruptor that causes hormonal imbalance. We investigated the modulatory role predisposed by glycyrrhizic acid (GA) against the hazardous effects caused by the ATR in the rabbit spleen. Sixty rabbits were assigned into 4 groups. The first group is the negative control; the ATR group received 1/10 of the oral LD  ATR; the GA group received 50 mg/kg  daily intraproteinally; and group 4 received both ATR and GA concurrently. ATR and GA administrations were done for 60 days. ATR-induced humoral immunotoxicity was illustrated by decreased serum total protein, albumin, and globulin levels and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus antibody titer, 4 weeks after vaccination. Moreover, upregulation of spleen Fas and caspase-III genes was recorded in ATR-exposed rabbits. Clear splenocyte apoptosis was observed in the immunohistochemical examination by the caspase-III technique. GA diminished the ATR-induced splenocyte apoptosis through downregulation of Fas and caspase-III expressions. In conclusion, our findings bounced a new perspective into the mechanism by which ATR induces immunotoxicity and assumed the potential modulatory role of GA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665032>A systematic review and meta-analysis of postpartum contraceptive use among women in low- and middle-income countries.</a></h2><p>Short birth intervals increase risk for adverse maternal and infant outcomes including preterm birth, low birth  (LBW), and infant mortality. Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC.PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period.Among 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.5%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.5% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP.PPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high. Tailored counseling approaches may help overcome misconceptions and meet heterogeneous needs for PPFP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663641>Eccentric contraction-induced muscle damage in human Flexor Pollicis Brevis is accompanied by impairment of motor nerve.</a></h2><p>Eccentric contractions (ECCs) cause muscle damage. In addition, we showed that ECCs induce nerve dysfunction and damage with rats and human.We aimed to evaluate motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) for flexor pollicis brevis muscle (FPBM) after ECCs.Twelve men (years, 19.8 ± 1.7 y; height, 172.4 ± 7.0 cm; , 64.0 ± 8.6 kg) performed maximal 100 ECCs on their FPBM of non-dominant hands with torque dynamometer. The dominant hands were control (CON). Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), range of motion (ROM), DOMS and MCV were assessed before, immediately post, and 1, 2 and 5 days after ECCs. MCV was calculated as the distance by stimulation divided by the latencies of the waveforms generated. Values were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA and the significance level was set at p < 0.05.Decreases in MVC immediately (-32.9%) to 5 days after ECCs were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than for the CON group. ROM showed a significant decrease immediately (-21.6%) after ECCs compared with before ECCs and CON group (p<0.05). DOMS after ECCs increased at 1 and 2 days (5.0 cm) after ECCs compared with before ECCs and CON (p < 0.05). Also, MCV after ECCs delayed significantly from immediately (-36.4%), 1, 2, 5 days after ECCs compared with CON (p < 0.05), while no significant change in M-wave amplitude was observed over time for both ECCs and CON.The present study showed that ECCs of the FPBM cause a significant delay in MCV of median nerve.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We assessed resolution of NAFLD in a general population cohort of urban Sri Lankans adults.Participants were selected by age-stratified random sampling from electoral lists. They were initially screened in 2007 and re-evaluated in 2014. On both occasions structured interview, anthropometric-measurements, liver ultrasonography, and biochemical/serological tests were performed. NAFLD was diagnosed on ultrasound criteria for fatty liver, safe-alcohol consumption (<14-units/week for men, <7-units/week for women) and absence of hepatitis B/C markers. Non-NAFLD was diagnosed on absence of any ultrasound criteria for fatty liver and safe-alcohol consumption. Resolution of NAFLD was defined as absence of ultrasound criteria for fatty liver. Changes in anthropometric indices [, -Mass-Index (BMI), waist-circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR)], clinical [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] and biochemical measurements [Triglycerides (TG), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Total Cholesterol (TC), HbA1c%] at baseline and follow-up were compared.Of the 2985 original study participants, 2148 (71.9%) attended follow-up after 7 years. This included 705 who had NAFLD in 2007 and 834 who did not have NAFLD in 2007. Out of 705 who had NAFLD in 2007, 11(1.6%) changed their NAFLD status due to excess alcohol consumption. After controlling for baseline values, NAFLD patients showed significant reduction in BMI, , WHR, HDL and TC levels and increase in HbA1c levels compared to non-NAFLD people. Despite this, none of them had complete resolution of NAFLD.We did not find resolution of NAFLD in this general population cohort. The observed improvements in anthropometric, clinical and biochemical measurements were inadequate for resolution of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663455>Evolution of the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefit: A Decade of Change.</a></h2><p>TRICARE is the military's health plan that provides coverage to 9.4 million active duty and retired uniformed services personnel and their family members. The TRICARE pharmacy benefit has undergone many changes in the last decade. These changes include assigning newly approved drugs to nonformulary status after regulatory approval, the addition of  loss medications to the benefit, channel management point-of-service requirements for some medications, and copay increases. Several initiatives have resulted in significant cost avoidance to the Department of Defense (DoD). The purpose of this article is to discuss the changes to the TRICARE pharmacy benefit, describe the continual challenges, and estimate cost savings associated with implementation of these changes. DoD implemented its 3-tier Uniform Formulary in 2005. Since then, many changes have been enacted, including more extensive use of prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits; coverage of over-the-counter medications; the retail refund program; coverage of vaccines and smoking cessation agents; mandatory mail/military treatment facility requirements; rapid review and initial nonformulary status for newly approved innovator drugs; revisions to the compounded drug benefit; initial deployment of a new medical record system; coverage of  loss medications; and the ability to exclude medications from the Uniform Formulary. Although the TRICARE pharmacy benefit has evolved significantly, the focus remains on the beneficiaries, with an overall goal of providing integrated, affordable, and high quality health services for the Military Health System. Challenges for the future include maximizing clinical effectiveness in the face of rising pharmaceutical costs and cost avoidance, while supporting the needs of TRICARE beneficiaries.

The ODTs containing the modified OGS as a disintegrant were prepared by the wet granulation method. Furthermore, an evaluation to assess parameters of tablets such as  variation, hardness, friability, wetting time, disintegration time, drug content, dissolution studies was performed.The modification of OGS using the swelling/ milling process resulted in a completion of OGS modification, leading to an ideal wetting time, disintegrating time and dissolution rate. The OGS concentrations also affected the wetting and disintegrating time with the optimal range of ODTs from 15% to 20%. On the other hand, the modification with the incubation processes varied by temperature and time increased the wetting time and disintegrating time.The modified OGS demonstrated that it is a potential material with the advantages of cost-effectiveness, non-toxicity and easy manufacture in the preparation of ODTs.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662165>Promoting Cooking, Nutrition, and Physical Activity in Afterschool Settings.</a></h2><p> In this study, we evaluated the afterschool PAWS (Peer-education About  Steadiness) Club program delivered by peer or adult educators to improve food choices, physical activity, and psychosocial variables related to healthy eating.  We had 109 adolescents (53 in adult-led group; 56 in peer-led group) participate in a cluster randomized controlled intervention. The 12-session curriculum framed within Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and Stages of Change addressed mediators of behavior change related to cooking skills, food intake, and physical activity. Anthropometric, dietary intake, physical activity, and SCT mediators were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-months post-intervention.  Adolescents in the peer-led group significantly improved whole grain intake at post-intervention (p = .017) and 6-months post-intervention (p = .014). Both peer-led and adult-led groups had significant reductions in caloric intake at 6-months post-intervention (p = .047). Only the adult-led group improved self-efficacy (SE) and social/family support (SS) for healthy eating at post-intervention [p = .019 (SE); p = .048 (SS)] and 6-months post-intervention [p = .036 (SE); p = .022 (SS)].  The PAWS Club program promoted lower caloric intake by adolescents. Peer educators were effective at increasing whole grains in adolescents, and adult educators contributed to positive changes in SE and SS related to healthy eating.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660941>CoQ10 ameliorates monosodium glutamate-induced alteration in detrusor activity and responsiveness in rats via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and channel inhibiting mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Competent detrusor muscles with coordinated contraction and relaxation are crucial for normal urinary bladder storage and emptying functions. Hence, detrusor instability, and subsequently bladder overactivity, may lead to undesirable outcomes including incontinence. Multiple mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of detrusor overactivity including inflammation and oxidative stress. Herein, we tested the possibility that CoQ10 may have a potential therapeutic role in detrusor overactivity.Forty adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 100-150 g were used in the present study. Rats were divided (10/group) into control (receiving vehicles), monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated (receiving 5 mg/kg MSG daily for 15 consecutive days), MSG + OO-treated (receiving concomitantly 5 mg/kg MSG and olive oil for 15 consecutive days), MSG + CoQ10-treated (receiving concomitantly 5 mg/kg MSG and 100 mg/kg CoQ10 daily for 15 consecutive days) groups.MSG resulted in significant increase in bladder  and sensitised the bladder smooth muscles to acetylcholine. MSG has also resulted in significant increase in bladder TNF-α, IL-6, malondialdehyde, nerve growth factor and connexion 43, with significant decrease in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. Olive oil had no effect on MSG induced alterations of different parameters. Treatment with CoQ10 has resulted in a significant restoration of all the altered parameters.Taken together, our results suggest that CoQ10 antagonizes the deleterious effects of MSG on detrusor activity. We propose that CoQ10 could be a therapeutic strategy targeting urinary bladder dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661493>Sustained activity of novel THIOMAB antibody-antibiotic conjugate against Staphylococcus aureus in a mouse model: Longitudinal pharmacodynamic assessment by bioluminescence imaging.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections are a leading cause of death by an infectious agent. Survival within host phagocytic cells is one mechanism by which S. aureus evades antibiotic treatment. A novel THIOMAB™ antibody-antibiotic conjugate (TAC) strategy was developed to kill S. aureus intracellularly and mitigate the spread of infection. In this report, we used a longitudinal whole- bioluminescence imaging method to study the antibacterial dynamics of TAC alone or in combination with vancomycin in a mouse infection model. Injections of stably luminescent S. aureus bacteria into mice resulted in exponential increases in whole  bioluminescence with a reduction in  and survival rate. Vancomycin, a standard-of-care antibiotic, suppressed bacterial growth in mice. However, bacterial growth rebounded in these animals once treatment was discontinued. In contrast, single dose of TAC showed rapid reduction of bioluminescence intensity, which persisted for up to 19 days. The combination of TAC and vancomycin achieved a more sustained and significantly greater reduction of bioluminescence compared with vancomycin alone. In summary, the present study showed an imaging method to longitudinally assess antibacterial drug dynamics in mice and demonstrated that TAC monotherapy or in combination with vancomycin had superior and sustained activity compared to vancomycin alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664931>Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection mimicking malignancy in a patient with anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies: a case report.</a></h2><p>Disseminated nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections occur mostly in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, it is difficult to diagnose disseminated NTM infections in patients without history of immunocompromised diseases or using immunosuppressant. Patients with anti-interferon-γ (IFN-γ) autoantibodies are vulnerable to intracellular infections, such as disseminated NTM. Currently, there is no widely used and efficient technique for the detection of anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies. Herein, we report a case of an apparently healthy patient with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection who tested positive for anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies.A 64-year-old non-immunocompromised and apparently healthy Asian male presented to the emergency department with complaints of progressive chest pain for about 6 months and  loss. A bulging tumour was found in the anterior chest wall. Chest computed tomography showed a lung mass over the right lower lobe and an osteolytic lesion with a soft tissue component at the sternum. Sonography-guided biopsies for the osteolytic lesion and sputum culture confirmed the presence of disseminated MAC infection. In addition, positive test result of anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies was noted. The patient was prescribed antibiotics. The lesions over the right lower lobe and sternum attenuated following the antibiotic treatment.Detection of anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies is important among previously healthy people with disseminated NTM infection. Presence of anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies may suggest a high risk of severe intracellular infection, such as disseminated NTM infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665421>Lack of association between modifiable exposures and glioma risk: A Mendelian randomisation analysis.</a></h2><p>The etiological basis of glioma is poorly understood. We have used genetic markers in a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) framework to examine if lifestyle, cardiometabolic and inflammatory factors influence the risk of glioma. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation.We identified genetic instruments for 37 potentially modifiable risk factors and evaluated their association with glioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. We used the estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined traits to infer evidence for a causal relationship with the following exposures: lifestyle and dietary factors (height, plasma IGF-1, blood carnitine, blood methionine, blood selenium, blood zinc, circulating adiponectin, circulating carotenoids, iron status, serum calcium, vitamin [A1, B12, B6, E and 25-hydroxyvitamin D], fatty acids levels [mono-unsaturated, omega-3 and omega-6] and circulating fetuin-A); cardiometabolic factors (birth , HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, basal metabolic rate,  fat percentage,  mass index, fasting glucose, fasting proinsulin, HbA1C levels, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) were included; inflammatory factors (C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma IL-6 sRa and serum IgE).After correction for the testing of multiple potential risk factors and excluding associations driven by one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) no significant association with glioma risk was observed (i.e. PCorrected > 0.05).This study did not provide evidence supporting any of the 37 factors examined as having a significant influence on glioma risk.© The Author(s) 2019.

We sought to investigate the possible role of the pro-inflammatory state on such alteration, considering the effect of the expression of markers, such as leptin and IL6, which are notably high in obesity. The performance of 15 male individuals affected by obesity and 15 normal- males was compared using two audiovisual temporal tasks, namely simultaneity judgment and temporal order judgment. Analyses of serum levels of inflammatory markers of leptin and IL6, and of neurotrophic factors of BDNF and S100SB were quantified. At the behavioral level we confirmed previous evidence showing poorer temporal sensitivity in obesity compared to normal- participants. Furthermore, leptin, that is a cytokine overexpressed in obesity, represented the best predictor of behavioral differences between groups in both tasks. The hypothesis we put forward is that the immune system, rather than overall cerebral dysfunction, might contribute to explain the altered temporal sensitivity in obesity. The present finding is discussed within the context of the role of cytokines on the brain mechanisms supporting temporal sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662825>Evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants and low molecular  heparin in gastrointestinal cancer-associated venous thromboembolism.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal cancer (GICA) is associated with a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to other solid tumors, moreover, recurrent VTE and major bleeding (MB) complications during anticoagulation treatment have an associated increase rate. GICA-VTE remains a challenging clinical scenario with MB concerns for utilization of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), especially with active cancer therapies.To evaluate patient risk factors, effectiveness (VTE) and safety (MB) of DOACs and low molecular  heparin (LMWH) in patients with active GICA-VTE.A retrospective chart review of patients receiving DOACs and LMWH with GICA and symptomatic or incidental VTE treated at comprehensive cancer center from November 2013 to February 2017 was performed. Inclusion criteria included active GI cancer diagnosed at any stage or treatment +/- 6 mo of VTE diagnosis, whom were prescribed 6 mo or more of DOACs or LMWH. The Chi-squared test was used for overall and the Fisher exact test for pairwise comparisons of the proportions of patients experiencing recurrent VTE and MB events. Odds ratios were used to compare the relative odds of the occurrence of the outcome given exposure to the risk factor.A total of 144 patients were prescribed anticoagulation, in which 106 fulfilled inclusion criteria apixaban (27.3%), rivaroxaban (34.9%) and enoxaparin (37.7%), and 38 were excluded. Patients median age was 66.5 years at GICA diagnosis and 67 years at CAVTE event, with 62% males, 80% Caucasian, 70% stage IV, pancreatic cancer (40.5%), 30% Khorana Score (≥ 3 points), and 43.5% on active chemotherapy. Sixty-four percent of patients completed anticoagulation therapy (range 1 to 43 mo). Recurrent VTE at 6 mo was noted in 7.5% ( = 3), 6.8% ( = 2) and 2.7% ( = 1) of patients on enoxaparin, apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively (all  = NS). MB at 6 mo were 5% ( = 2) for enoxaparin, 6.8% ( = 2) for apixaban and 21.6% ( = 8) for rivaroxaban (overall  = 0.048;  LMWH  = 0.0423; all other  = NS). Significant predictors of a primary or secondary outcome for all anticoagulation therapies included: Active systemic treatment (OR = 5.1, 95%CI: 1.3-19.3), high Khorana Score [≥ 3 points] (OR = 5.5, 95%CI: 1.7-17.1), active smoker (OR = 6.7, 95%CI: 2.1-21.0), pancreatic cancer (OR = 6.8, 95%CI: 1.9-23.2), and stage IV disease (OR = 9.9, 95%CI: 1.2-79.1).Rivaroxaban compared to apixaban and enoxaparin had a significantly higher risk of MB on GICA-VTE patients with equivocal efficacy.©The Author(s) 2019.

Thirty-two resistance-trained individuals participated in this study. Both modalities involved performing acute RE and a control. Blood pressure and  of pulse wave reflection were assessed using pulse wave analysis. Aortic stiffness was assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). A repeated  analysis of variance was used to determine the effects of modality (FW and WM) and condition (acute RE and control) across time (rest and 10-20 min after exercise) on  of pulse wave reflection and aortic stiffness. Significance was set a priori at p ≤ 0.05. There were no modality by condition by time interactions for any variable, such that the FW and WM modalities responded similarly across time after acute RE (p > 0.05). There were significant (p ≤ 0.05) increases in heart rate, aortic systolic blood pressure, aortic pulse pressure, augmentation index normalized at 75bpm, and decreases in subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) after acute RE, compared to rest. There was also a significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase in cf-PWV after acute RE, compared to rest. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that acute free- and -machine RE are associated with transient increases in  of pulse wave reflection and aortic stiffness, with reductions in myocardial perfusion. These data demonstrate that both modalities result in significant stress on the myocardium during recovery, while simultaneously increasing pressure on the aorta for at least 10-20 min.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661531>Transcript profile of skeletal muscle lipid metabolism genes affected by diet in a piglet model of low birth .</a></h2><p>Dysregulated skeletal muscle metabolism (DSMM) is associated with increased inter- and intramuscular fat deposition in low birth  (L) individuals. The mechanisms behind DSMM in L individuals are not completely understood but decreased muscle mass and shifts in lipid and carbohydrate utilisation may contribute. Previously, we observed lower fat oxidation in a porcine model of low birth . To elucidate the biological activities underpinning this difference microfluidic arrays were used to assess mRNA associated with lipid metabolism in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) skeletal muscle samples from thirty-six female L and normal birth  (N) pigs. Plasma samples were collected from a sub-population to measure metabolite concentrations. Following overnight fasting, skeletal muscle and plasma samples were collected and the association with birth , diet and age was assessed. Reduced dietary fat was associated with decreased LD intermuscular fat deposition and beta-oxidation associated mRNA, in both birth  groups. Lipid uptake and intramuscular fat deposition associated mRNA was reduced in only L pigs. Abundance of ST mRNA associated with lipolysis, lipid synthesis and transport increased in both birth  groups. Lipid uptake associated mRNA reduced in only L pigs. These changes were associated with decreased plasma L glucose and N triacylglycerol. Post-dietary fat reduction, LD mRNA associated with lipid synthesis and inter- and intramuscular fat deposition increased in L, whilst beta-oxidation associated mRNA remains elevated for longer in N. In the ST, mRNA associated with lipolysis and intramuscular fat deposition increased in both birth  groups, however this increase was more significant in L pigs and associated with reduced beta-oxidation. Analysis of muscle lipid metabolism associated mRNA revealed that profile shifts are a consequence of birth . Whilst, many of the adaptions to diet and age appear to be similar in birth  groups, the magnitude of response and individual changes underpin the previously observed lower fat oxidation in L pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663652>Effects of over-load iron on nutrient digestibility, haemato-biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.</a></h2><p>There is a risk of iron overload in grazing livestock. However, the effects on nutrient absorption and rumen function induced by excessive iron have not been well understood. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate the impact of over-load iron on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep. Twenty-four German Mutton Merino cross-bred sheep with  (42.66 ± 2.34 kg BW) were randomly divided into 4 groups, each with 6 replicates and 1 sheep per replicate. The basal diet consisted of 60% Leymus chinensis hay and 40% concentrate. The sheep in 4 groups were fed the basal diets supplemented with 50 (Control), 500 (T1), 1,000 (T2) and 1,500 (T3) mg Fe/kg as ferrous sulphate monohydrate (FeSO ·H O) respectively. And the actual contents of iron in the diet were determined to be 457.68 (control), 816.42 (T1), 1,256.78 (T2) and 1,725.63 (T3) mg/kg respectively. The experiment lasted 62 days including a 7-day metabolism trial. During the whole experiment, the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre showed a quadratic increase with increasing over-load iron levels (p < .05), and maximum responses were found with 500 mg/kg supplementation. However, the response of total VFA concentration showed a quadratic decrease, as did the concentrations of propionate, butyrate and valerate (p < .05). Serum total iron-binding capacity on day 30 showed a quadratic decrease with the increase in high-dose iron, while the serum iron content increased linearly at day 60 (p < .05). Excessive iron resulted in the change in bacterial communities. An increase in over-load iron linearly decreased the abundance of bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes (p < .05), but linearly increased the Firmicutes (p = .037) and Proteobacteria (p = .018). In addition, there was a quadratic effect (p = .003) on the Fibrobacteres, which was higher in the 500 and 1,000 mg/kg Fe-supplemented groups. At the genus level, there were quadratic effects on the abundances of Selenomonas_1 (p = .023) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (p = .016). Furthermore, feeding of iron linearly increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 (p < .05). These results indicate that increasing ferrous sulphate monohydrate in diets had no negative impact on the growth performance, but it changed nutrient digestibility, blood iron parameters, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659243>Continuous feeding versus intermittent bolus feeding for premature infants with low birth : a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Clinical risks and advantages of both continuous feeding and intermittent feeding for preterm infants have been presented in previous studies. To determine the most appropriate feeding method for low-birth- infants, a meta-analysis was conducted.Articles related to this topic were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library electronic database from the onset to May 2019. Heterogeneity analysis was performed with Chi-square and I test. Pooled analysis was based on fixed effects model, if heterogeneity between the eligible studies was negligible (I < 50%, P > 0.05). In contrast, a random effects model was carried out. The quality of including studies were evaluated by Cochrane assessment tool.A total of 1030 articles identified. Altogether, eight articles including 707 infants were included in final analysis based on eligibility criteria. In continuous feeding infants, time to achieving full feeds was longer ( mean difference 0.98 (95% CI 0.26-1.71, P = 0.008) days) compared with intermittent feeding infants. Pooled analysis indicated there were no significant difference in other variables such as feeding intolerance, duration of hospitalization, days to regain birth , days to first successful oral feeding, duration of parenteral feeding,  growth, length increment, head circumference growth, proven necrotizing enterocolitis, and probable necrotizing enterocolitis. In subgroup analysis for birth  (<1000 g and >1000 g), we did not identify significant difference in time to full feeds, time to regain birth , and duration of hospitalization.Intermittent feeding may be more beneficial for low-birth  infants, However, well-designed studies and evidenced-based clinical practice are required to determine the most appropriate feeding method for premature infants with low birth .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663322>Peritoneal and upper genital tract tuberculosis.</a></h2><p>Aim To present diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities for genital and peritoneal tuberculosis, mimicking to other pathological conditions, mainly, ovarian cancer. Methods Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound, computerized tomography, Ca125 and HE 4, ROMA- index (Risk of Ovarian Maligancy Algorithm index) and diagnostic laparoscopy were performed in order to diagnose genital tuberculosis in a female patient. Results: A 23-year-old woman from Morocco presented with intermitting abdominal pain, unintentional  loss and primary infertility. There was no positive family history for breast or ovarian cancer and no history of previous tuberculosis (TB). Elevated CA-125 level, HE 4 normal, ROMA-Index of 13.2 % suggested high risk for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Ultrasound revealed free fluid, dilated fallopian tubes and a cystic mass near the right ovary. Suspecting fallopian tube or ovarian cancer, we performed exploratory laparoscopy, revealing adhesions, multiple miliary nodes and dilated fallopian tubes. Histological investigation revealed granulomatous abscessing salpingitis with suspicion of genital TB, so antituberculous therapy was administered with success. Conclusion Female genital tuberculosis is very rare but important in differential diagnosis and should be kept in mind regarding suspected fallopian tube or ovarian carcinoma to prevent women from extensive surgery. An algorithm for possible differentiation between peritoneal/female genital TB and EOC may be helpful in clinical setting.Copyright© by the Medical Assotiation of Zenica-Doboj Canton.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662982>Chlorogenic Acid Attenuates Kidney Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury via Reducing Inflammation, Tubular Injury, and Myofibroblast Formation.</a></h2><p>Kidney ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) involving renal function deterioration, renal architecture damage, and inflammation. This condition may lead to kidney fibrosis with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation. Inhibition of chronic effects of kidney I/R injury may provide effective strategies for treating AKI and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is recognized as a powerful antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in many conditions. However, the effect of CGA on kidney I/R injury has not been elucidated yet. Kidney I/R injury was performed on male Swiss background mice (I/R group,  = 5, 3-4 months, 30-40 g) which underwent bilateral renal pedicles clamping for 30 minutes and then were euthanized on day three after operation. Three groups of I/R were treated with 3 different doses of CGA intraperitoneally for 2 days: 3.5 (I/R + CGA1 group), 7 (I/R + CGA2 group), and 14 (I/R + CGA3 group) mg/kg of . Tubular injury was quantified based on Periodic Acid-Schiff staining, while reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of TGF-1, vimentin, SOD-1, TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB and MCP-1. Immunohistochemical staining was done to quantify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myofibroblast (-SMA), SOD-1 and macrophage (CD68) number. Kidney I/R demonstrated tubular injury and increased inflammatory mediator expression, macrophage number, and myofibroblast expansion. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed lower tubular injury with higher epithelial cell proliferation in CGA-treated groups compared to the I/R group. RT-PCR also revealed significantly lower TGF-1 and vimentin mRNA expressions with higher SOD-1 mRNA expression. CGA-treated groups also demonstrated a significantly lower macrophage and myofibroblast number compared to the I/R group. These findings associated with lower mRNA expression of TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MCP-1 as inflammatory mediators in CGA groups. I/R + CGA3 represented the highest amelioration effect among other CGA-treated groups. CGA treatment attenuates kidney I/R injury through reducing inflammation, decreasing myofibroblast expansion, and inducing epithelial cells proliferation.Copyright © 2019 Nur Arfian et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665169>Maize leaves drought-responsive genes revealed by comparative transcriptome of two cultivars during the filling stage.</a></h2><p>Like other important cereal crop in modern agricultural production, maize is also threatened by drought. And the drought stress during maize filling stage will directly affect the quality (protein or oil concentration) and also the  of grain. Therefore, different from previous studies focusing on inbred lines and pot experiment at seedling stage, current study selected filling stage of the adult plant and planting maize in the experimental field. Two hybrids cultivars with different drought tolerant were used for drought and water treatment respectively. We performed transcriptome sequencing analysis of 4 groups, 12 samples, and obtained 651.08 million raw reads. Then the data were further processed by mapping to a reference genome, GO annotation, enrichment analysis and so on. Among them we focus on the different change trends of water treatment and drought treatment, and the different responses of two drought-tolerant cultivars to drought treatment. Through the analysis, several transcripts which encode nitrogen metabolic, protein phosphorylation, MYB,AP2/ERF, HB transcriptional factor, O-glycosyl hydrolases and organic acid metabolic process were implicated with maize drought stress. Our data will offer insights of the identification of genes involved in maize drought stress tolerance, which provides a theoretical basis for maize drought resistance breeding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659860>Standard medical nutrition therapy of 25kcal/kg ideal /day often does not reach even resting energy expenditure in patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In Japan, an ideal  (IBW) calculated by 22 × height (m) has commonly been used in the planning of medical nutrition therapy (MNT). However, there have been concerns regarding calorie deficits in fulfilling resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing MNT as defined by 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.To measure REE in patients with type 2 diabetes and verify the validity of MNT with 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in 52 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age was 65.9 ± 7.3 years,  65.0 ± 11.3 kg,  mass index 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/m ). REE was measured by indirect calorimetry.Mean REE was 1601.0 ± 253.1 kcal/day. Assuming that all patients strictly observed daily energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW/day, 41 of 52 patients (78.9%) did not reach their REE. The greater the , the greater the difference between assumed energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW and REE.We call attention to the potential risk of total dietary energy intake set to 25 kcal/kg IBW/day. Clinicians should carefully plan MNT to not fall below patient's REE to prevent sarcopenia and ensure MNT continuity.© 2019 The Authors.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated  gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662389>Assessing cardiovascular remodelling in fetuses and infants conceived by assisted reproductive technologies: a prospective observational cohort study protocol.</a></h2><p>Assisted reproductive technologies (ART), namely in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, have become widely used to treat infertility. Although the use of ART is generally considered favourable, there are ongoing concerns about the prenatal and perinatal risks as well as long-term risks for the child. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between pathological events during fetal development and future cardiovascular risk, raising concerns about cardiovascular remodelling in fetuses conceived by ART. The authors hypothesise fetuses conceived by ART present signs of cardioventricular dysfunction, which can be detected by deformation analysis. To address these issues, we will assess comprehensive cardiovascular structure and function in ART offspring and explore the role of speckle-tracking in myocardial deformation.This prospective observational cohort study will include 100 singleton pregnancies conceived by ART and 100 controls identified in fetal life and followed up to 6 months old. At inclusion, a baseline assessment of the mothers and ART characteristics will be recorded by interview and review of medical records. Between 28 and 32 weeks gestation, a detailed fetal echography will be performed, including an assessment of estimated fetal , fetoplacental Doppler, fetal echocardiography and fetal abdominal artery ultrasound. On delivery, maternal and neonatal characteristics will be assessed. Within 60 days of birth, the first postnatal cardiovascular assessment will be conducted which will include echocardiography and abdominal artery ultrasound. At 6 months of age, the second infants' follow-up evaluation will include the  and length of the infant, echocardiography and abdominal artery ultrasound.

Furthermore, obesity-related adipokines have been shown to be closely related to the incidence of CRC, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines on the development of CRC in vitro and in vivo. For the in-vivo assays, we divided 2-week-old C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J male mice into three groups: normal-fat diet (ND), high-fat and high-sugar feed (HFHS), and high-fat and low-sugar feed (HFLS). After 1 week, all mice were injected with 20 mg/kg 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine once weekly for 10 consecutive weeks. , liver , epididymal fat , and blood glucose level were greatly increased in HFHS and HFLS groups compared with the ND group, and the expression levels of some adipokines and cytokines were obviously higher in HFHS or HFLS mice compared to ND mice. For the in-vitro assays, HCT116 CRC cells were treated with sera of ND, HFHS, or HFLS groups, or serum-free media (SFM) as a negative control. We observed that sera derived from HFHS or HFLS mice that contain excess adipokines and cytokines promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 cells compared with ND-sera-conditioned medium or SFM group. Therefore, high-fat diet-induced adipokines and cytokines may promote the progression of CRC in vivo and in vitro.© 2019 The Authors.

In turn, dietary fatty acids can enhance resistance under cold stress. The present study reports the nutritional effect on suboptimal temperature tolerance based on histopathological alterations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish (initial : 34.02 ± 0.79) were exposed to two different temperatures (20 °C and 30 °C) for 30 days. Under both conditions, fish were fed two different diets based on the linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3 = 12.02 and n6/n3 = 3.85). The most important alterations in liver caused by temperature included high cellular hyperplasia in fish at 30 °C (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature also caused gills aneurysm, lamellar lifting and low hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic vacuolization decreased and nuclear displacement increased in the fish fed n6/n3 = 3.85 (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature provided high gills aneurysm, epithelial lamellae lifting and low lamellar hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Conversely, the fatty acid content (n6/n3 = 3.85) in the diet provided low lamellar lifting and fusions (P < 0.05). Finally, tilapia showed an increased glycogen storage trend in gills and muscle at low temperature (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that when feeding tilapia a high dietary n3 content, this fish is able to respond to suboptimal temperature in subtropical aquaculture facilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

First, four types of parameters were calculated, namely, the geometric parameters (7), electronic parameters (5), physical and chemical parameters (8), and spectral parameters (7), but the physical and chemical parameters heat of formation (HF) and critical volume (CV) were excluded after the establishment of the 2D-QSAR model. Then, after PCA, it was found that the first principal component represented the main driving factors affecting the molecular genetic toxicity of FQs. In addition, after comprehensive analysis of the factor loading of the first, second, and third principal components, seven parameters affecting the genotoxicity of the FQs were screened out, namely, total energy (TE), critical temperature (CT), and molecular  (Mol Wt) (increased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs) and steric parameter (MR), quadrupole moment Q (Q), quadrupole moment Q (Q), and boiling point (BP) (decreased with increasing genotoxicity of the FQs); the above key parameters were also verified by sensitivity analysis. The obtained rules could be used to determine the substitution sites and the substitution groups associated with higher genotoxicity in the process of FQ modification, and these rules agreed well with the hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR) model. Finally, it was also found through SPSS analysis that the parameters screened in this paper were significantly correlated with FQ derivatives' genetic toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660372>Changes in  Mass Index and Atherosclerotic Disease Risk Score After Switching From Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate to Tenofovir Alafenamide.</a></h2><p>Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) can improve renal function and bone mineral density in people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH).

Four of these genes (CSMD1, CREB3, PTPRD and GAB1) belong to a same signaling pathway involving neuron differentiation and dopamine pathway.This study provides a list of interesting genes such as CSDM1 and CREB3 that are candidates to be involved in the etiology of anorexia nervosa.basic research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658823>Chronotype, social jetlag, and time perspective.</a></h2><p>The phase of entrainment (chronotype) is known to be associated with time perspective (TP), suggesting that the state of circadian system is involved in the long-term planning of human life. However, little is known regarding the influence of circadian misalignment on long-term planning ability. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between social jetlag (SJL) and TP. A total of 1064 schoolchildren and university students (mean age ± standard deviation, 19.2 ± 2.9 years; range, 15-25 years; females, 71.7%) from four cities in the Russian Federation located between 56.9 and 61.7 degrees North completed the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire, and Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory. Study participants also indicated personal data (age, sex, height , place of residence, and achievements). A multiple regression analysis with stepwise inclusion of predictors in the model was performed to evaluate associations between time perspective characteristics (dependent variables) and predictor variables. The change in  was used as the measure of effect size. Chronotype was found to be a moderate predictor of future TP ( = 0.034; Δ = 0.037). In addition, sleep quality was found to be a moderate predictor of past negative ( = 0.043; Δ = 0.074), present fatalistic ( = 0.021; Δ = 0.035), and deviation from balanced TP ( = 0.034; Δ = 0.066). Mood seasonality was a moderate predictor of present hedonistic TP ( = 0.016; Δ = 0.038), and social jetlag was a weak predictor of present fatalistic ( = 0.052; Δ = 0.019), future ( = -0.033; Δ = 0.004), and deviation from balanced TP ( = 0.047; Δ = 0.012). In conclusion, this study found a weak but significant association between social jetlag and TP in adolescents and young adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664670>Assessing the influence of land use on groundwater pollution based on coefficient of variation  method: a case study of Shuangliao City.</a></h2><p>In this study, the quality of groundwater was tested in 95 sampling wells in Shuangliao City. Based on the results, the coefficient of variation method was used to calculate the comprehensively evaluated value F, and the grade of groundwater quality, in accordance with the actual scenario in the study area, was classified according to the results of the evaluation. The spatial distribution of groundwater quality types in the study area was classified. In addition, the influence of human activity on each groundwater subsystem was assessed. Combined with the land use types in the study area, the Circle model was used to extract the land use types in the circular buffer zone with a radius of 500 m, and the Kendall rank correlation test was used to analyze the influence of the land use types on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution. Based on the coefficient of variation, the groundwater quality standard was divided into four sections considering the actual scenario: ≤ 0.92 (I), 0.92~≤ 1.75 (II), 1.75~≤ 2.40 (III), and > 2.40 (IV). Water from class II was considered the main type for groundwater quality. NO, TFe, and Mn were deemed the main indexes of groundwater pollution. Further, land use type was found to have a great influence on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution; specifically, dry land, paddy field, areas with dense traffic, and residential areas are the main land types that affect the groundwater environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658638>The Synergistic Effect of Zinc Ferrite Nanoparticles Uniformly Deposited on Silver Nanowires for the Biofilm Inhibition of .</a></h2><p>Near-monodisperse zinc ferrite nanoparticles (ZnFeO NPs) are synthesized by a co-precipitation method and deposited on the surface of silver nanowires (AgNWs), employing a stepwise solution method. The resulting hybrid nanostructures (ZnFeO@AgNWs) show a thin and uniform layer of ZnFeO NPs at an optimum  ratio of 1:6 between the two component nanostructures. The hybrid nanostructures retain the high crystal quality and phase purity of their constituents. It is demonstrated that the ZnFeO@AgNWs hybrid nanostructures are effective at inhibiting the biofilm formation of  cells. The biofilm inhibition activity of the hybrid nanostructures is estimated to be more than 50% at a low concentration of 100 µg/mL from both crystal violet assay and XTT assay, which are more than 8-fold higher than those of pure AgNWs and ZnFeO NPs. This greatly enhanced biofilm inhibition activity is attributed to the ZnFeO NPs-carrying membrane penetration by AgNWs and the subsequent interaction between  cells and ZnFeO NPs. These results indicate that the ZnFeO@AgNWs hybrid nanostructures have great potential as a new type of novel antibiofilm agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663862>A Vendor-Independent Mobile Health Monitoring Platform for Digital Health Studies: Development and Usability Study.</a></h2><p>Medical smartphone apps and mobile health devices are rapidly entering mainstream use because of the rising number of smartphone users. Consequently, a large amount of consumer-generated data is being collected. Technological advances in innovative sensory systems have enabled data connectivity and aggregation to become cornerstones in developing workable solutions for remote monitoring systems in clinical practice. However, few systems are currently available to handle such data, especially for clinical use.The aim of this study was to develop and implement the digital health research platform for mobile health (DHARMA) that combines data saved in different formats from a variety of sources into a single integrated digital platform suitable for mobile remote monitoring studies.DHARMA comprises a smartphone app, a Web-based platform, and custom middleware and has been developed to collect, store, process, and visualize data from different vendor-specific sensors. The middleware is a component-based system with independent building blocks for user authentication, study and patient administration, data handling, questionnaire management, patient files, and reporting.A prototype version of the research platform has been tested and deployed in multiple clinical studies. In this study, we used the platform for the follow-up of pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. The patients' blood pressure, , and activity were semi-automatically captured at home using different devices. DHARMA automatically collected and stored data from each source and enabled data processing for the end users in terms of study-specific parameters, thresholds, and visualization.The increasing use of mobile health apps and connected medical devices is leading to a large amount of data for collection. There has been limited investment in handling and aggregating data from different sources for use in academic and clinical research focusing on remote monitoring studies. In this study, we created a modular mobile health research platform to collect and integrate data from a variety of third-party devices in several patient populations. The functionality of the platform was demonstrated in a real-life setting among women with high-risk pregnancies.©Thijs Vandenberk, Valerie Storms, Dorien Lanssens, Hélène De Cannière, Christophe JP Smeets, Inge M Thijs, Tooba Batool, Yves Vanrompay, Pieter M Vandervoort, Lars Grieten.

Twenty-eight mature male Liaoning Cashmere goats were divided into four groups based on  (56.2 ± 2.45 kg) and semen characteristics; these goats were fed with basal diet supplemented with 0, 20, 40, or 80 mg Zn/kg DM (zinc sulfate) for 3 months. Results showed that the Zn-supplemented diets linearly increased the semen volume (0.98, 1.04, 1.27, and 1.17 ml for the 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation, respectively) (P < 0.05) and the total sperm output (3.87, 4.52, 5.73, and 5.33 × 10/ml for the 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation, respectively) (P < 0.05); by contrast, Zn supplementation exerted no effect on sperm concentration, motility, and abnormal sperms rate. The activities of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) (linear P < 0.05) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (linear P < 0.05; quadratic P < 0.01) were highest in the intermediate supplementation (40 mg Zn/kg DM). Moreover, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of spermatozoa decreased linearly (P < 0.01) with the increase in Zn supplementation. In seminal plasma, the highest GSH-Px activity was observed in 20 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation (P < 0.05). Catalase (CAT) activities both in the spermatozoa and seminal plasma showed no difference in all treatments. Seminal plasma Zn level was highest in 40 mg Zn/kg DM (linear P = 0.068), and K increased linearly (P = 0.001) with increasing Zn level. Furthermore, blood plasma Zn (linear P < 0.01; quadratic P < 0.05), Fe (linear P < 0.05; quadratic P < 0.05), and Mg (linear P < 0.05) increased with increasing Zn supplementation. These results indicated that dietary Zn supplementation in Cashmere goats during the breeding season improved the semen quality and quantity, elevated the antioxidative indices and Zn concentration, and decreased the MDA content both in spermatozoa and seminal plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663283>Prediction of Collapse Using Patient-Specific Finite Element Analysis of Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head.</a></h2><p>To develop a prediction method for femoral head collapse by using patient-specific finite element analysis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).The retrospective study recruited 40 patients with ARCO stage-II ONFH (40 pre-collapse hips). Patients were divided into two groups according to the 1-year follow-up outcomes: patient group without femoral head collapse (noncollapse group, n = 20) and patient group with collapse (collapse group, n = 20). CT scans of the hip were performed for all patients once they joined the study. Patient-specific finite element models were generated based on these original CT images following the same procedures: segmenting the necrotic lesion and viable proximal femur, meshing the computational models, assigning different material properties according to the Hounsfield unit distribution, simulating the stress loading of the slow walking gait, and measuring the distribution of the von Mises stress. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the maximum level of the von Mises stress. The optimal cut-off value was selected based on the Youden index and the corresponding predictive accuracy was reported as well.The mean level of the maximum von Mises stress in the collapse group was 2.955 ± 0.539 MPa, whereas the mean stress level in the noncollapse group was 1.923 ± 0.793 MPa (P < 0.01). ROC analysis of the maximum von Mises stress found that the area under the ROC curve was 0.842 (95% CI: 0.717-0.968, P < 0.01). The maximum Youden index was 0.60, which corresponded to two optimal cut-off values: 2.7801 MPa (sensitivity: 0.70; specificity: 0.90; predictive accuracy: 80.00%; LR+: 7), and 2.7027 MPa (sensitivity: 0.75; specificity: 0.85; predictive accuracy: 77.50%; LR+: 5).Finite element analysis is a potential method for femoral head collapse prediction among pre-collapse ONFH patients. The maximum level of the von Mises stress on the -bearing surface of the femoral head could be a good biomechanical marker to classify the collapse risk. The collapse prediction method based on patient-specific finite element analysis is, thus, suitable to apply to clinical practice, but further testing on a larger dataset is desirable.© 2019 The Authors.

Exposure to 4000 µg BPA/kg bw/day (BPA HIGH) reduced sperm motility and altered the straight-line velocity (VSL) and linearity (LIN). Effects on steroidogenesis were evident, with testosterone (T) being up-regulated by both treatments and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) down-regulated by BPA HIGH. Plasma levels of 17β-estradiol (E) were not affected. The Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) increased in the BPA HIGH group. Interestingly, the levels of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like compounds were significantly reduced after both treatments. Unpredictably, a few changes were noticed in the expression of genes coding for ECS enzymes, while the receptors were up-regulated depending on the BPA dose. Reproductive markers in testis (leptin receptor (), estrogen receptors (, ), progesterone receptors () and the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor ()) were up-regulated. BPA induced the up-regulation of the hepatic genes involved in oogenesis (vitellogenin () and zona pellucida 1 ()).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657867>Population Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Dobutamine in Neonates on the First Days of Life.</a></h2><p>To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and concentration-related effects of dobutamine in critically ill neonates in the first days of life, using nonlinear mixed effects modelling.Dosing, plasma concentration and haemodynamic monitoring data from a dose-escalation study were analysed with a simultaneous population PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) model. Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine 5-20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral regional oxygen saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth  (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included. PK data was adequately described by one-compartmental linear structural model. Dobutamine clearance (CL) was described by allometric scaling on BW with sigmoidal maturation function of postmenstrual age (PMA). The final population PK model parameter mean typical value (standard error) estimates, standardised to median BW of 1618 g, were 41.2 (44.5) l h for CL and 5.29 (0.821) l for volume of distribution, which shared a common between subject variability of 29(17.2) %. The relationship between dobutamine concentration and RVO/LVEF was described by linear model, between concentration and LVO/HR/MAP/cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction by sigmoidal E model.In postnatal transitional period PK of dobutamine was described by one-compartmental linear model, CL related to BW and PMA.

This species was previously controlled by imazamox, but the continuous use of this herbicide has selected for resistant biotypes. Two biotypes of E. heterophylla from southern Brazil, one resistant (R) and one susceptible (S) to imazamox, were compared. The resistance of the R biotype was confirmed by dose-response assays since it required 1250.2 g ai ha to reduce the fresh  by 50% versus 7.4 g ai ha for the S biotype. The acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme activity was studied using ALS-inhibiting herbicides from five different chemical families. The R biotype required the highest concentrations to reduce this enzyme activity by 50%. A Ser653Asn mutation was found in the ALS gene of the R biotype. The experiments carried out showed that imazamox absorption and metabolism were not involved in resistance. However, greater C-imazamox root exudation was found in the R biotype (~70% of the total absorbed imazamox). Target site mutation in the ALS gene is the principal mechanism that explains the imazamox resistance of the R biotype, but root exudation seems to also contribute to the resistance of this biotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662529>Functional Outcomes of Billroth I Gastroduodenostomy Using Linear Staplers in Totally Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy.</a></h2><p>This study examined whether functional outcomes of linear-stapled Billroth I (LS-BI) in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) are comparable to those of circular-stapled Billroth I (CS-BI) in laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG).This was a retrospective study of patients with gastric cancer undergoing TLDG with LS-BI (n=50) or LADG with CS-BI (n=50).

We evaluated the relation of self-reported severe  loss with fatigue and the predictors for fatigue in old patients at hospital discharge. Severe  loss was defined according to involuntary  loss ≥5% in the last three months. We determined fatigue with the validated  questionnaire. The regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbidities, medications/day, and BMI. Of 424 patients aged between 61 and 98 y, 34.1% had severe  loss. Fatigue was higher in patients with severe  loss (3.7 ± 2.3 vs. 3.2 ± 2.3 points,  = 0.021). In a multinomial regression model,  loss was independently associated with higher risk for moderate fatigue (OR:1.172, CI:1.026-1.338,  = 0.019) and with increased risk for severe fatigue (OR:1.209, CI:1.047-1.395,  = 0.010) together with the number of medications/day (OR:1.220, CI:1.023-1.455,  = 0.027). In a binary regression model, severe  loss predicted moderate-to-severe fatigue in the study population (OR:1.651, CI:1.052-2.590,  = 0.029). In summary, patients with self-reported severe  loss at hospital discharge exhibited higher fatigue levels and severe  loss was an independent predictor of moderate and severe fatigue, placing these patients at risk for impaired outcome in the post-hospital period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664428>Association of Bariatric Surgery With Skin Cancer Incidence in Adults With Obesity: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a cancer risk factor, and bariatric surgery in patients with obesity is associated with reduced cancer risk.

However, the welfare of cattle accommodated on them has been questioned. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of floor and diet on hoof health and lying behaviours of housed dairy-origin bulls, from a mean age of 8 months to slaughter at 15.5 months old. Forty-eight bulls, which had a mean initial live  of 212 (SD = 23.7) kg, were allocated to one of four treatments, which consisted of two floors and two diets arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The floors evaluated were a fully slatted concrete floor and a fully slatted concrete floor overlaid with rubber, while the diets offered were either a high concentrate diet or a grass-silage-based diet supplemented with concentrates. The mean total duration of the study was 216 days. Floor had no significant effect on claw measurements measured on day 62 or 139. However, bulls accommodated on slats overlaid with rubber had a tendency to have a higher front toe length measured pre-slaughter than those accommodated on concrete slats (P = 0.063). Floor had no significant effect on the net growth of toes or heels during the duration of the study. The number of bruises (P < 0.01) and the bruising score (P < 0.05) were significantly higher on day 62 in bulls accommodated on fully slatted concrete floors than on concrete slats overlaid with rubber, but there was no significant effect of floor on these parameters on day 139 or at the measurement taken pre-slaughter. There was a tendency for bulls accommodated on concrete slats to have a higher probability of having sole bruising at the end of the experiment than those accommodated on slats overlaid with rubber (P = 0.052). Diet had no significant effect on toe length or heel height, number of bruises, or overall bruising score at any time point of the study. There was little evidence in the current study to suggest that bulls lying on fully slatted concrete floors could not express lying postures similar to those on concrete slats overlaid with rubber.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658716>Comparison of Reconstituted, Acidified Reconstituted Milk or Acidified Fresh Milk on Growth Performance, Diarrhea Rate, and Hematological Parameters in Preweaning Dairy Calves.</a></h2><p>The present experiment was carried out to assess the effects of reconstituted milk (RM), acidified reconstituted milk (ARM), and acidified fresh milk (AFM) on growth performance, diarrhea rate, and hematological parameters of preweaning dairy calves.

Calves were housed individually, and starter was offered ad libitum to each calf. The dietary treatments were RM, ARM, and AFM. The highest milk intake was observed in calves receiving AFM as compared to other treatments ( < 0.01). Calves fed AFM had more feed intake than those fed ARM and RM ( < 0.01). Feed efficiency was significantly lower for calves offered ARM than those offered RM and AFM ( < 0.01). A lower withers height growth was found for calves fed RM than those fed ARM and AFM ( <0.05). Diarrhea rate and white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocytes (LYM) counts were greater for calves fed RM than those fed ARM and AFM ( < 0.05).

The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to evaluate the association between  mass index (BMI) and survival in patients receiving venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for acute hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure.All of the patients admitted to a dedicated VV ECMO unit were included. Patients <18 years of age, listed for lung transplant, or underweight were excluded. ECMO outcomes, including hospital length of stay and survival to discharge, were analyzed after stratification according to BMI. Multivariate logistic and linear regression techniques were used to assess variables associated with the outcomes of death and length of stay, respectively.One hundred ninety-four patients with a median BMI of 35.7 kg/m (33-42 kg/m) were included. Obese patients were older, had higher creatinine levels, and required higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and mean airway pressure at time of cannulation. Survival to discharge in any group did not differ when stratified by BMI classification (P = .36). Multivariable regression did not reveal any association with greater odds of death or longer length of stay when controlling for BMI and other variables.We did not detect an association between obesity and increased mortality in patients requiring VV ECMO for acute hypoxic or hypercarbic respiratory failure. These data suggest that obesity alone should not exclude candidacy for VV ECMO. Evidence for the "obesity paradox" in this population of VV ECMO patients may be supported by these data.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659353>The awareness and knowledge about heart failure in Poland - lessons from the Heart Failure Awareness Day and internet surveys.</a></h2><p>Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening condition which affects up to 2% of contemporary populations.

As predicted, MS achieved the highest score (22.5 [20.0-24.0]), compared to HFDP (20.0 [17.0-22.0], P <0.001) and OP (19.0[16.0-21.0], P <0.001). Knowledge on typical HF symptoms was alarmingly low in the analyzed groups - dyspnea (MS - 96.0%, HFDP - 78.4%, OP - 74.6%), ankle edema (MS - 79.8%, HFDP - 50.6%, OP - 32.2%),  gain (MS - 14.1%, HFDP - 17.2%, OP - 4.5%). By multivariate model medical education (β 3.372, 95% CI 2.738-4.005) and own illness or having relatives or friends with HF (β 0.654, 95% CI 0.066-1.242) independently affected the score of awareness questionnaire.The basic knowledge on HF in Poland is not sufficient. It is moderately better among MS. Further campaigns improving HF awareness are necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665455>GLP-1 Analog Modulates Appetite, Taste Preference, Gut Hormones and Regional  Fat Stores in Adults with Obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with alterations in appetite, gastrointestinal (GI) hormone levels and excessive fat mass. We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once daily GLP-1 analog, liraglutide on , satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers. The aim of this sub-study was to compare to placebo the effects of liraglutide on appetite, taste preference, regional  fat stores and anthropometric measurements.Forty obese adults received standard instruction for  management, monthly behavioral intervention utilizing motivational interviews, and 16-week treatment of once daily liraglutide (escalated to 3mg SQ daily). At baseline and 16 weeks, the following were measured: appetite and taste preferences rated every 30 minutes for 5 hours after ingesting 300mL Ensure®; maximal tolerated volume (MTV) with a nutrient drink test; fasting and postprandial bioactive GLP-1 (7-36) and PYY levels; total and regional  fat with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and waist and hip circumference.Thirty-five participants (17 liraglutide; 18 placebo) completed the trial. Compared to placebo group, liraglutide group had significant reductions in MTV, prospective food consumption score, desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory or fatty, and an increase in perceived fullness. Postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 decreased and PYY levels increased with liraglutide relative to baseline. Significant reductions in total , trunk, upper and lower  fat without reduction in lean  mass were observed.Liraglutide 3mg SQ modulates appetite, taste preference, gut hormones and regional  fat stores in adults with obesity without reduction in lean  mass.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Zhangjiakou and Beijing will jointly host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022, which will likely increase local PFASs pollution and their associated risks over the coming period. In this study, we identified ecological process of PFASs, including sources, environmental fate, and risks, from the Yongding Watershed to the Guanting Reservoir. The concentrations of total 12 PFASs in water of the Guanting Reservoir were higher than that from the Yongding Watershed, with mean of 48.9 and 33.7 ng/L, respectively. The concentrations of PFASs in sediment of the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir were similar, with mean of 1.01 and 0.827 ng/g dry , respectively. Detected levels of PFASs in the Guanting Reservoir significantly increased during the past eight years, possibly due to an improving economy and a rapidly developed service industry. Moderate PFASs levels in fish of the Guanting Reservoir were detected relative to other lakes and reservoirs. The daily intake of PFASs via fish and water ranged from 4.96 to 15.0 ng/kg bw/day, with higher levels found in children relative to adults. In total, approximately 9.06 kg of PFASs from riverine flow and atmospheric deposition annually entered the Guanting Reservoir. PFASs from the Yongding River significantly contributed to the pollution of Guanting Reservoir, with predominance of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) in water, and long-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in sediment in both the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir. Most of the PFASs (23.5 kg) were stored in water of the Guanting Reservoir, while the annual storage of PFASs in sediment and fish was only 4.68 × 10 kg and 4.36 × 10 kg via deposition and accumulation, respectively. The results suggest that water quality management of the Yongding Watershed is necessary for effective control on PFASs pollution in the Guanting Reservoir.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Characteristic for anorexia nervosa are a reduced food intake and thus significant underweight, as well as the fear of gaining . Often sufferers also have a distorted self-perception, the urge to move and amenorrhea. AN is difficult to treat and often has a chronic course, and is associated with an increased mortality risk. The endocrinological changes occur in several endocrine axes, their extent is related to the degree of malnutrition. Low leptin levels, due to the underweight, signal a potentially dangerous lack of energy to the brain. There is a cascade of neuroendocrine adaptive responses to help the organism to survive. The effects of starvation are extensive, affecting the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, as well as the adrenal glands, gonads and bones.

Obesity increases the risk of heart disease three- to four-fold and has been associated with AR. Aspirin is used as a tool for both primary and secondary prevention, but recent studies suggest that its lack of efficacy for primary prevention is partly attributable to obesity. Several mechanisms have been described that contribute to AR in obese patients using pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. AR may be attenuated through  loss, alternative dosing regimens, and different drug formulations. With the global rise of obesity, it is imperative to find preventive therapies that adequately address atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in this population.2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher oxygen radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg ) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino acid sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high oxygen radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660498>A case report of  prosthetic valve endocarditis: an extremely rare presentation with characteristic findings.</a></h2><p> is an extremely rare cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and can present with non-specific symptoms leading to a delay in diagnosis with unfavourable outcomes.A 65-year-old male patient with a history of a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and non-obstructive coronary artery disease was admitted for altered mentation, failure to thrive, and a 20-pound unintentional  loss over the past 4 months.

The aim of this experiment was to investigate the effects of ajwain () and dill () essential oils (AEO and DEO, respectively), probiotic (PRO) and mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) on the growth performance, serum metabolites, meat quality, intestinal morphology and microbial populations of Japanese quail.2. A total of 375 one-day-old Japanese quail were randomly allocated into five treatment groups with five replicates of 15 birds each for a 42 d feeding experiment. The dietary treatments were a basal diet (control) or the same diet supplemented with PRO (0.15 g/kg feed), MOS (2 g/kg feed), AEO (0.25 g/kg feed) or DEO (0.25 g/kg feed).3. AEO, MOS, and PRO supplementation increased  gain, while diets supplemented with AEO decreased FI, and improved feed conversion ratio from d 1 to 21 (P<0.05). The relative  of the gizzard was higher in birds supplemented with AEO compared to control group, while the birds fed MOS diet had the longest intestine (P<.05). Ceca length was greater in control, MOS and PRO groups (P<.05). Both essential oils decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration of breast meat and percentage of cooking loss in quail (P<.05).

This prospective study quantifies vancomycin pharmacokinetics in morbidly obese and non-obese individuals, in order to guide vancomycin dosing in the obese.Morbidly obese individuals (n=20) undergoing bariatric surgery and non-obese healthy volunteers (n=8) (total  (TBW) 60.0-234.6 kg) received a single vancomycin dose (obese: 12.5 mg kg , maximum 2500 mg; non-obese: 1000 mg) with plasma concentrations measured over 48 hours (11-13 samples per individual). Modelling, internal validation, external validation using previously published data and simulations (n=9950 individuals, TBW 60-230 kg) were performed using NONMEM.In a three-compartment model, peripheral volume and clearance increased with TBW (both p<0.001), which was confirmed in the external validation. A dose of 35 mg kg per day (maximum 5500 mg/day) resulted in a >90% target attainment (AUC>400 mg*h L ) in individuals up to 200 kg, with corresponding trough concentrations of 5.7-14.6 mg L (twice daily dosing). For continuous infusion, a loading dose of 1500 mg is required for steady state on day 1.In this prospective, rich sampling pharmacokinetic study, vancomycin clearance was well predicted using TBW. We recommend that in obese individuals without renal impairment, vancomycin should be dosed as 35 mg kg per day (maximized at 5500 mg/day). When given over two daily doses, trough concentrations between 5.7-14.6 mg L correspond to the target exposure in obese individuals.This article is protected by copyright.

Within an hour of the last administration, the sciatic nerve motor conduction velocity (MNCV) of each group was measured, and the morphological changes of rat sciatic nerve were observed by HE, Weil's staining and electron microscopy. The expression of TRPV-1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn of rats was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of CGRP protein in the spinal cord was analyzed by Western blot. Results Compared with the nondiabetic control group, elevated blood glucose, decreased  and reduced average mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), additionally, the sciatic nerves showed significantly slowed conduction velocity (both p&lt;0.001) and damaged pathological structure, the expression of TRPV1 and CGRP were decreased (both p&lt;0.001) in the diabetic groups.

Conclusion Ropivacaine can significantly block sciatic nerve conduction velocity in DPN rats in a concentration-dependent manner, which may be related to the expression of the TRPV1-CGRP pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660665>The effects of early life adversity on growth, maturation, and steroid hormones in male and female rats.</a></h2><p>Early life adversity is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders, yet the mechanisms by which adversity increases this risk are still being delineated. Here we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) manipulation in rats that models a low resource environment to examine effects on growth, developmental milestones, and endocrine endpoints. In LBN, dams and pups, from pups' postnatal days 2-9, are exposed to a limited resource environment where dams lack proper materials to build a nest. This manipulation is compared to control housing conditions, where rat dams have access to ample nesting materials and enrichment throughout pups' development. We found that the LBN condition altered maternal care, increasing pup-directed behaviors while reducing self-care. This, perhaps compensatory, increase in nursing and attention to pups did not mitigate against changes in metabolism, as LBN reduced  gain in both sexes and this effect persisted into adulthood. Although adult stress hormone levels in both sexes and vaginal opening and estrous cycle length in females were not disrupted, there was other evidence of endocrine dysregulation. Compared to controls, LBN rats of both sexes had shorted anogenital distances, indicating reduced androgen exposure. LBN males also had higher plasma estradiol levels in adulthood. This combination of results suggests that LBN causes a demasculinizing effect in males that could contribute to lasting changes in the brain and behavior. Importantly, alterations in metabolic and endocrine systems due to early life adversity could be one mechanism by which stress early in life increases risk for later disease.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661341>Thinness, overweight, and obesity in indigenous school children and youth in Mexico.</a></h2><p> The prevalence of overweight (OWT) and obesity (OB), defined by the  mass index (BMI, kg/m) among children and youth has increased worldwide in the last 30-40 years.

Recent study have been showed that glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and GLP-2 has protective in chemotherapy-induced AM. While the DPP-4 enzyme degrades this GLP-1, the DPP-4 inhibitor blocks the degradation process and raises the concentration of GLP-1. This study aimed to assess the role of DPP-4 inhibitor, a well-known hypoglycemic agent, on chemotherapy-induced AM.Twenty-four 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: control, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), DPP-4 inhibitor, and saline (DPP-4i), and DPP-4 inhibitor and 5-FU (DPP-4i + 5-FU). Mucositis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU (400 mg/kg). DPP-4 inhibitor (50 mg/kg) was administered orally for four days starting the day before 5-FU administration. Post 72 h of 5-FU injection, mice were sacrificed and  change, diarrhea score, villus height, villus/crypt ratio, histologic characteristics including goblet cell count, and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, were assessed.Daily  change was not statistically significant between the 5-FU and the DPP-4i + 5-FU group (P = 0.571). Diarrhea score was significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.033). In the 5-FU group, the villus height was not maintained well, the epithelial lining was irregular, and inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Goblet cell count in the DPP-4i + 5-FU group was significantly higher than in the 5-FU group (P = 0.007). However, in the DPP-4i + 5-FU group, the villus height, epithelial lining, and crypt structure were better maintained than in the 5-FU group. Compared with the control group, mRNA expression of TNF-α was significantly up-regulated in the 5-FU group. Moreover, mRNA expression of TNF-α in the DPP-4i + 5-FU group was down-regulated compared to the 5-FU group.

Together with the vision based measurements, to verify the soundness of our proposed method, we also harvested the plants at specific time periods to take manual measurements, collecting a great amount of data. In particular, we manually collected 2592 data points related to the plant phenotype and 1728 images of the plants.

Gestational exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) can negatively affect birth size and disrupt maternal and neonatal thyroid function, although the interrelationship is unclear.We aimed to quantify the associations between maternal serum-PFAS concentrations and birth , birth length, and cranial circumference. We also aimed to estimate associations between PFAS and thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations, thereby elucidating whether THs potentially mediate the associations between PFAS concentrations and birth size.We studied a population-based prospective cohort of 172 mother-singleton pairs from the Faroe Islands. Twelve PFAS were measured in maternal serum obtained at 34 weeks of gestation. THs were measured in maternal and cord serum. Associations between PFAS concentrations and birth size and TH concentrations were estimated using multivariable linear regressions. Sex-stratified analyses along with a mediation analysis were performed to estimate potential mediating effects of THs in the association between PFAS and birth outcomes.Several PFASs were negatively associated with birth , length, and head circumference, and a general positive association between maternal serum-PFASs and cord serum-thyroid stimulating hormone was found. For instance, a doubling in perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was associated with a 53% (95% CI: 18%, 99%) and 40% (95% CI: 8%, 81%) increases in thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, respectively. There was little evidence of sexually dimorphic associations. Overall, THs were not found to mediate associations between PFASs and birth size.In this study, several PFASs were negatively associated with birth size and increased THs, which however did not explain lower birth  among children exposed to PFAS.© Endocrine Society 2019.

We observed a statistically significant positive association between DBP and RCC that persisted after adjustment for history of diabetes, history of hypertension, family history of renal cancer,  mass index (BMI), and smoking status (mv-adj Q4 vs. Q1 OR=4.1, 95% CI=2.2-7.8; p-trend <0.0001). These findings were similar when we restricted to cases with at least two years of follow-up and no major  loss, suggesting that our findings are not due to reverse causality. In the present study, those with higher serum concentrations of DBP were at increased risk of RCC, in contrast to previously published findings. Further research is necessary to determine the true association between DBP and risk of RCC, and whether different DBP phenotypes may have different associations with risk of RCC.

It is a key player in some types of hereditary angioedema and is involved in septic shock, traumatic injury, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke, among others. Activation of the plasma contact system leads to elevated levels of plasma kallikrein, which cleaves high molecular  kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Drug development for bradykinin-meditated pathologies has focused on designing inhibitors to the enzymes that cleave HK (to prevent bradykinin release) or antagonists of endothelial bradykinin receptors (to prevent downstream bradykinin action). Here we show a strategy to block bradykinin generation by using an HK antibody that binds to HK, preventing its cleavage and subsequent bradykinin release. We show that this antibody blocks dextran sodium sulfate-induced HK cleavage and bradykinin production. Moreover, while the pathogenic AD peptide β-amyloid (Aβ)42 cleaves HK and induces a dramatic increase in bradykinin production, our HK antibody blocked these events from occurring. These results may provide strategies for developing treatments for bradykinin-driven pathologies.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

To address the high cost of current piezoelectric sensors in installation and maintenance, a study on developing a low-cost piezoceramic sensing system is presented in this paper. The proposed system features distributed monitoring and integrated packaging, for calculating vehicle's dynamic load and its wheel position. Results from the laboratory tests show that the total output of the sensing system increases linearly with the increase of the peak load when the loading amplitude is 5-25 kN (equivalent to the half-axis load of 20-100 kN); when the loading frequency is between 15 Hz and 19 Hz (equivalent to a speed of 17.8-23.2 km/h), the total output of the system fluctuates around a value of 1.305 V. Combined with finite-element simulation, the system can locate load lateral position with a resolution of 120 mm. Due to the protection packaging, the peak load transferred to the sensing units is approximately 4.36% of the applied peak load. The study indicates the proposed system can provide a promising low-cost, reliable and practical alternative for current WIM systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661768>Protective Effect of Resveratrol Improves Systemic Inflammation Responses in LPS-Injected Lambs.</a></h2><p>Highly intensive livestock production often causes immune stress to animals, which makes them more susceptible to infections. The aim of this study was to examine whether resveratrol (Res) alleviates inflammation in lambs. In Experiment 1, 16 male lambs were injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) at an initial dose of 0.25, 1.25, and 2.5 μg/kg  (BW) for 9 days. Average daily gain and blood parameters were measured and clinical symptoms were recorded. In Experiment 2, 20 male lambs were injected intravenously with LPS (0 mg/kg) + Res (0 mg), LPS (2.5 μg /kg) + Res (0 mg, 82.5 mg, 165 mg, 330 mg), 4 h after LPS injection. Jugular blood was collected from each lamb to determine white blood cell (WBC) counts and the expression of inflammatory genes. In Experiment 1, all LPS-treated lambs showed clinical signs of sickness including rhinorrhea, lethargy, and shivering, and systemic inflammatory responses of increased inflammatory genes levels and cortisol concentration. The lambs had increased respiratory and heart rates and rectal temperature and decreased average daily gain and feed intake. In Experiment 2, resveratrol significantly reduced WBCs and the expression levels of several genes associated with inflammation response (, , ) and inhibited the signaling cascades of  and MAPKs by down-regulating the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (, , , , ) induced by LPS. Resveratrol attenuated the LPS-evoked inflammatory responses in lambs by suppressing expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, and blocking  and MAPK signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661754>Correlation between anterior thigh pain and morphometric mismatch of femoral stem.</a></h2><p>Postoperative pain occurring after hip arthroplasty has become common since the expanded use of cementless femoral stems. The characteristic pain develop in the anterolateral thigh area. This study aimed to predict anterior thigh pain based on the measurements of postoperative anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (Lat) radiographs of the hip joint.The present study included 26 patients (29 hips) who underwent total hip replacement or bipolar hemiarthroplasty between March 2010 and May 2016, whose complete clinical information was available. AP and Lat radiographs of the affected hip were taken on the day of surgery and 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Patients with improper radiographs were excluded. The distance from the femoral stem to the nearest cortical bone in the distal region of the stem was measured. The patient group with a visual analog scale (VAS) score of ≥6 points was designated as patients with anterior thigh pain.Sex, age, , height,  mass index, and bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and femur did not have a significant effect on postoperative VAS scores (p>0.05). Presence of contact between the femoral stem and cortical bone was associated with postoperative anterior thigh pain.Hip AP and Lat radiographs are usually taken to confirm fixation and alignment of the femoral stem after hip arthroplasty. The measurement method introduced in this study can be utilized for predicting anterior thigh pain after hip arthroplasty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662063>How moles walk; it's all thumbs.</a></h2><p>A recurring theme in the evolution of tetrapods is the shift from sprawling posture with laterally orientated limbs to erect posture with the limbs extending below the . However, in order to invade particular locomotor niches, some tetrapods secondarily evolved a sprawled posture. This includes moles, some of the most specialized digging tetrapods. Although their forelimb anatomy and posture facilitates burrowing, moles also walk long distances to forage for and transport food. Here, we use X-ray Reconstruction Of Moving Morphology (XROMM) to determine if the mole humerus rotates around its long axis during walking, as it does when moles burrow and echidnas walk, or alternatively protracts and retracts at the shoulder in the horizontal plane as seen in sprawling reptiles. Our results reject both hypotheses and demonstrate that forelimb kinematics during mole walking are unusual among those described for tetrapods. The humerus is retracted and protracted in the parasagittal plane above, rather than below the shoulder joint and the 'false thumb', a sesamoid bone (os falciforme), supports  during the stance phase, which is relatively short. Our findings broaden our understanding of the diversity of tetrapod limb posture and locomotor evolution, demonstrate the importance of X-ray-based techniques for revealing hidden kinematics and highlight the importance of examining locomotor function at the level of individual joint mobility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663369>Efficacy of preoperative progressive resistance training in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty: 12-month follow-up data from a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adding four weeks preoperative progressive resistance training (PRT) to four weeks postoperative PRT on patient function, muscle strength, and other outcomes 12 months after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).Twelve-month follow-up data from a previously published randomized controlled trial.Aarhus University Hospital, Silkeborg Regional Hospital, and Aarhus University.A total of 59 patients scheduled for TKA were enrolled in a single-blinded, clinical randomized controlled trial.Participants were randomized to preoperative PRT (intervention group) or to a control group who "lived as usual" the last four weeks before TKA. The intervention group completed four weeks preoperative and four weeks postoperative PRT, whereas the control group only completed four weeks postoperative PRT. Main follow-up  were as follows: the 30-second Chair Stand Test (primary outcome), Timed Up and Go Test, walk tests, knee extensor, and knee flexor muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.No significant group differences were observed for the primary outcome 30-second Chair Stand Test (4.0 repetitions versus 2.4 repetitions,  = 0.067) or for other functional performance outcomes. The intervention group had significantly higher -normalized knee extensor muscle strength (0.5 Nm/kg versus 0.2 Nm/kg,  = 0.002) and knee flexor muscle strength (0.3 Nm/kg versus 0.2 Nm/kg,  = 0.042) in the operated leg when compared to the control group. No significant group differences for patient-reported outcomes.The study supports the use of short-term high-intensity resistance training before TKA as it induces a long-lasting effect on muscle strength, while it may have no discernible effect on functional performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664348>Nutritional intervention may improve migraine severity: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Although some studies have investigated the role of nutritional intervention on migraine, they had focused on triggers or on  change and, to the best of our knowledge, none studied diet quality.To investigate whether nutritional intervention focused on improving diet quality and healthy  can promote improvement in clinical parameters of women with migraine.Non-controlled and non-randomized intervention study conducted for 90 days. Women received an individualized diet meal plan and nutritional orientation according to their nutritional diagnosis. Anthropometric, clinical and nutritional data were measured once a month. Diet energy content and macronutrients were evaluated using 24-hour dietary recall. Diet quality was assessed through the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index-Revised (BHEI-R). The Migraine Disability Assessment and Headache Impact Test version 6 were used to assess the severity of migraine, and the Beck Depression Inventory evaluated depressive symptoms.Fifty-two women aged 44.0 ± 13.0 years were enrolled. Anthropometric characteristics, energy, macronutrients and fiber intake did not change after intervention. However, the BHEI-R scores improved after 60 and 90 days of intervention. Concurrent to this, the Beck Depression Inventory scores and Headache Impact Test scores decreased after 60 and 90 days, respectively. The change in the BHEI-R score was negatively correlated with the migraine severity as assessed by the Headache Impact Test at the end of the intervention.We concluded that the management of diet quality may be a good strategy for improving migraine severity, regardless of the nutritional status and  change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664980>Diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism as a first presentation of silent adenocarcinoma of lung: a case report and literature review.</a></h2><p>Pituitary metastasis is a rare condition with a poor prognosis. Very few patients with pituitary metastasis are symptomatic. It is often associated with presence of co-existing metastases to other organs. Isolated pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary malignancy is uncommon.A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of polyuria, increasing thirst and unexplained  loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was scheduled as part of the investigation. She was kept nil per os for 10 h prior to EGD, after which she developed alteration of consciousness. Further investigation revealed hypernatremia with sodium level of 161 mmol/L and low urine osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg. Her urine output was 300 mL per hour. Diabetes insipidus (DI) was diagnosed based on evidence of polyuria, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality. Her urine output decreased and urine osmolality increased to 570 mOsm/kg in response to subcutaneous desmopressin acetate, confirming central DI. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous gadolinium enhancing lesion at the sellar and suprasellar regions, measuring 2.4 × 2.6 × 3.9 cm compressing both the hypothalamus bilaterally and the inferior aspect of optic chiasm as well as displacing the residual pituitary gland anteriorly. The posterior pituitary bright spot was absent. These MRI findings suggested pituitary macroadenoma. There were also multiple small gadolinium-enhancing lesions up to 0.7 cm in size with adjacent vasogenic brain edema at the subcortical and subpial regions of the left frontal and parietal areas, raising the concern of brain metastases. Pituitary hormonal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the pituitary tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma, originating from the lung. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was subsequently performed, showing a 2.2-cm soft tissue mass at the proximal part of right bronchus. There was no evidence of distant metastases elsewhere. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung with pituitary metastasis manifesting as panhypopituitarism and central DI. Palliative care along with hormonal replacement therapy was offered to the patient. She died 4 months after diagnosis.Diagnosis of pituitary metastasis is challenging, especially in patients with previously undiagnosed primary cancer. It should be considered in the elderly patients presenting with new-onset central DI with or without anterior pituitary dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659427>Aggregated aluminium exposure: risk assessment for the general population.</a></h2><p>Aluminium is one of the most abundant elements in earth's crust and its manifold uses result in an exposure of the population from many sources. Developmental toxicity, effects on the urinary tract and neurotoxicity are known effects of aluminium and its compounds. Here, we assessed the health risks resulting from total consumer exposure towards aluminium and various aluminium compounds, including contributions from foodstuffs, food additives, food contact materials (FCM), and cosmetic products. For the estimation of aluminium contents in foodstuff, data from the German "Pilot-Total-Diet-Study" were used, which was conducted as part of the European TDS-Exposure project. These were combined with consumption data from the German National Consumption Survey II to yield aluminium exposure via food for adults. It was found that the average weekly aluminium exposure resulting from food intake amounts to approx. 50% of the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg/kg  (bw)/week, derived by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). For children, data from the French "Infant Total Diet Study" and the "Second French Total Diet Study" were used to estimate aluminium exposure via food. As a result, the TWI can be exhausted or slightly exceeded-particularly for infants who are not exclusively breastfed and young children relying on specially adapted diets (e.g. soy-based, lactose free, hypoallergenic). When taking into account the overall aluminium exposure from foods, cosmetic products (cosmetics), pharmaceuticals and FCM from uncoated aluminium, a significant exceedance of the EFSA-derived TWI and even the PTWI of 2 mg/kg bw/week, derived by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, may occur. Specifically, high exposure levels were found for adolescents aged 11-14 years. Although exposure data were collected with special regard to the German population, it is also representative for European and comparable to international consumers. From a toxicological point of view, regular exceedance of the lifetime tolerable aluminium intake (TWI/PTWI) is undesirable, since this results in an increased risk for health impairments. Consequently, recommendations on how to reduce overall aluminium exposure are given.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663036>Gendered  Mass Index Percentile Charts and Transgender Youth: Making the Case to Change Charts.</a></h2><p> mass index (BMI) is defined as  (kg)/height (m).

Diffusion tensor imaging showed significantly higher FA in the cooled than the non-cooled infants in left PLIC and several white matter tracts. After adjusting for sex, birth  and gestational age, the mean difference in PLIC FA between groups was 0.026 (95% CI 0.004 to 0.048, p=0.023). Conventional MRI was available for 46 infants and demonstrated significantly less moderate/severe abnormalities in the cooled (n=2, 9%) than in the non-cooled (n=10, 43%) infants. There was no difference in adverse events between groups.This study confirmed that TH induced by PCM reduced brain injury detected on MRI in infants with moderate HIE in a neonatal intensive care unit in India.

Combining information from multiple biological systems, allostatic load (AL) provides such a quantitative measure of overall physiological health. We used longitudinal data from the Birth to Twenty Plus cohort in South Africa to calculate an AL score at age 22 years and examined associations with birth  and linear growth and  gain from age 0 to 2 years and 2 to 5 years, as attenuated by trajectories of  mass index and pubertal development in later childhood and adolescence. Differences in total AL score between males and females were small, though levels of individual biological factors contributing to AL differed by sex. Increased  gain from age 2 to 5 years among males was associated with an increased risk of high AL, but no other early-life  were associated with AL. Increased adiposity through childhood and adolescence in females was associated with higher AL in early adulthood. These results illustrate that patterns of early-life growth are not consistently associated with higher AL. While more research is needed to link AL in young adulthood to later health outcomes, these results also suggest increased adiposity during childhood and adolescence represents a potential early sign of later physiological risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663546>Fabrication of nor-seco-cucurbit[10]uril based supramolecular polymers via self-sorting.</a></h2><p>A nor-seco-CB[10] (ns-CB[10]) based linear supramolecular polymer is firstly fabricated via self-sorting strategy.

Restoring salt and water homeostasis in hemodialysis patients has been a permanent quest by nephrologists summarized by the 'dry ' probing approach. Although this clinical approach has been associated with benefits on cardiovascular outcome, it is now challenged by recent studies showing that intensity or aggressiveness to remove fluid during intermittent dialysis is associated with cardiovascular stress and potential organ damage. A more precise approach is required to improve cardiovascular outcome in this high-risk population. Fluid status assessment and monitoring rely on four components: clinical assessment, non-invasive instrumental tools (e.g., US, bioimpedance, blood volume monitoring), cardiac biomarkers (e.g. natriuretic peptides), and algorithm and sodium modeling to estimate mass transfer. Optimal management of fluid and sodium imbalance in dialysis patients consist in adjusting salt and fluid removal by dialysis (ultrafiltration, dialysate sodium) and by restricting salt intake and fluid gain between dialysis sessions. Modern technology using biosensors and feedback control tools embarked on dialysis machine, with sophisticated analytics will provide direct handling of sodium and water in a more precise and personalized way.

The present study was undertaken for purification, characterization, and structural elucidation of serratiopeptidase produced from Streptomyces hydrogenans var. MGS13.The crude enzyme was purified by precipitating with ammonium sulfate, dialysis, and Sephadex gel filtration, resulting in 34% recovery with a 12% purification fold. The purified enzyme S.AMP13 was spotted as a single clear hydrolytic band on casein zymogram and whose molecular  was found to be 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The inhibitor and stability studies revealed that this enzyme is metalloprotease, thermostable, and alkaline in nature. The maximum serratiopeptidase activity was observed at 37 °C and pH 9.0. The partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme S.AMP13 by LC-MS/MS analysis shows the closest sequence similarities with previously reported alkaline metalloendopeptidases. The amino acid sequence alignment of S.AMP13 shared a conserved C-terminus region with peptidase-M10 serralysin superfamily at amino acid positions 128-147, i.e., ANLSTRATDTVYGFNSTAGR revealed that this enzyme is a serralysin-like protease. The kinetic studies of the purified enzyme revealed a K of 1 mg/mL for its substrate casein and V of 319 U/mL/min. The 3D structure of the purified enzyme was modeled by using SWISS-MODEL, and the quality of the structure was authenticated by assessing the Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK server, which suggested that the enzyme was stable with good quality.Inhibitor, stability, electrophoretic, and bioinformatic studies suggested that the purified enzyme obtained from S. hydrogenans var.

However, the identities of peptide-derived products composed of a large number of diverse molecules is challenging since most analytical techniques cannot analyze multiple molecules simultaneously. Here, we proposed the determination of the -average molecular  () and polydispersity index (PDI) by mass spectrometry for control quality for the batch release of complex products, namely, glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), collagen hydrolysate (Colagenart), and a human dialyzable leucocyte extract (Transferon). The  and PDI values were orthogonally determined by PFG-STE-HO(presaturation)-DOSY-NMR analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that MS and NMR spectra have been combined to determine the PDI of complex products derived from protein hydrolysis that are not monodisperse. The performance of each method was evaluated by comparing the obtained results to those reported for glatiramer acetate using MALLS, the technique commonly employed to determine PDI. This combined approach demonstrates the ability of these techniques to separate peptide populations from complex mixtures to establish their identity through their mass distribution profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664363>Positive self-perception of diet: a population-based study in the far south of Brazil.</a></h2><p>to analyze prevalence of positive self-perception of diet and association with sociodemographic and behavioral factors, morbidity, self-perception of health and , and  care, in the city of Rio Grande, RS, Brazil, in 2016.this was a cross-sectional study conducted with adults and elderly people resident in the city of Rio Grande using 13 indicators of healthy eating and positive self-perception of diet (outcome); Poisson regression was used.the sample consisted of 1,243 individuals, 72.4% of whom reported positive self-perception of diet; indicators such as weekly consumption of greens or vegetables (PR=133 - 95%CI 1.22;1.45) and fruit (PR=1.35 - 95%CI 1.22;1.48) were positively associated with the outcome; no significant difference was found between sexes.positive self-perception of diet is associated with healthy eating indicators among adults and the elderly and can be useful in epidemiological surveys.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660893>Effect of interpregnancy  change on perinatal outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Although obesity is a well-known risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes, evidence is sparse about the effects of interpregnancy  change on the risk of adverse perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. The current study aims to assess the effect of interpregnancy  change on the risk of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension, preterm birth, or delivering a large- or small-for-gestational age neonate.Pubmed, Ovid Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and the Cochrane library were systematically searched up until July 24th, 2019. Interpregnancy  change was defined as the difference between pre-pregnancy  of an index pregnancy and a consecutive pregnancy. Inclusion criteria included full text original articles reporting quantitative data about interpregnancy  change in multiparous women with any time interval between consecutive births and the risk of any perinatal complication of interest. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios and a reference group of - 1 to + 1 BMI unit change between pregnancies were harmonised by meta-analysis.Twenty-three cohort studies identified a total of 671,906 women with two or more consecutive pregnancies. Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy  gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy  loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy  gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m.These findings confirm that interpregnancy  change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum  loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy  before conceiving again.

The gastrointestinal tract is predominantly responsive to heat stress and compromised intestinal functions can contribute to multi-organ injury under heat environment. Resveratrol (RSV) has significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of RSV on intestinal function (digestion and barrier), oxidative stress and inflammation in heat-stressed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally fed with 100 mg RSV/kg /day prior to daily heat stress (40 °C per day for 1.5 h) exposure for 3 consecutive days. The results showed that RSV reversed the increased serum cortisol level and diamine oxidase activity, the altered jejunal morphology, the decreased jejunal disaccharidase activities, the elevated malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities in the jejunum, as well as the increased jejunal mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and tight junction proteins in heat-stressed rats, to various degrees. In conclusion, RSV could alleviate intestinal injury and dysfunctions by improving oxidative status and suppressing inflammation in heat-stressed rats.Copyright © 2019.

Whether disease-modifying therapies affect the lipoprotein profile in PwMS has scarcely been studied.The study aims to assess whether fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) affect lipoproteins in PwMS.We compared retrospectively the blood lipoprotein levels of 29 fingolimod-treated and 41 DMF-treated patients before and after 3 and 12 months of therapy. Patients treated with cholesterol-reducing medications were not included. Data on  change and disease activity during 1-year follow-up were obtained.HDL level, HDL/LDL ratio and HDL/total cholesterol ratio were increased in both treatment groups after 3 months' therapy and sustained, with no change in LDL or triglycerides. While at baseline only 26% of patients met the recommended minimum of HDL 60 mg/dl, after 3 months' therapy, 43% of fingolimod-treated and 47% of DMF-treated patients reached the recommended level. The majority of patients had no  reduction.Fingolimod and DMF therapies are associated with a specific increase in HDL in PwMS. Further studies are required to validate these findings and their potential implication as biomarker of reduced inflammatory state and/or reduced risk of neurodegeneration or cardiovascular comorbidity.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662128>Effect of early shearing during gestation on the productive and reproductive behavior of female sheep offspring in their first 18 months of age.</a></h2><p>The research has shown the interesting contributions of shearing in mid-gestation on the performance of lambs from birth to weaning. Other studies have reported that shearing at early pregnancy influences the development of the placenta and lamb live  at birth. However, there was a lack of information on the effect of early-prepartum shearing on the behavior of the offspring from weaning onward. This study evaluated the effect of shearing ewes at 50 days of gestation on the growth, reproductive behavior and response to a gastrointestinal parasite challenge in the female offspring from weaning to 18 months old. Fifty-seven Polwarth female lambs were used, 22 being singles and 35 twins born to ewes either shorn at 50 days of pregnancy (PS, n = 23) or shorn at 62 days postpartum (U, control, n = 34) resulting in four subgroups: single lambs born to PS ewes (n = 8), born to U ewes (n = 14), twin lambs born to PS ewes (n = 15) or born to U ewes (n = 20). All progeny were managed together under improved pasture with a minimum forage allowance of 6% live  on dry basis. ,  condition score and fecal eggs count were recorded every 14 days from weaning to 18 months of age. Concentrations of progesterone were measured weekly (from 4 to 10 months of age and from 14 to 18 months of age) to establish the onset of puberty. Ovulation rate at an induced and a natural heat (545 ± 1.0 and 562 ± 1.0 day old) was recorded. Prepartum shearing did not affect the age at puberty or the ovulation rate of female offspring, but those born as singles were more precocious ( P = 0.03) and heavier ( P = 0.02) at puberty than twin born lambs. Both the average value of parasite egg count ( P = 0.0 7) and the Famacha index ( P = 0.02) for the entire study period were lower in lambs born to prepartum shorn ewes than those born to postpartum shorn ewes. In conclusion, shearing at 50 days of gestation did not affect the growth or the reproductive behavior of female offspring. However, female lambs born from ewe shorn during gestation showed a better response to the parasitic challenge, and further research is required to confirm this.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664941>Prenatal maternal stress and birth outcomes in rural Ghana: sex-specific associations.</a></h2><p>In developed countries, prenatal maternal stress has been associated with poor fetal growth, however this has not been evaluated in rural sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated the effect of prenatal maternal stress on fetal growth and birth outcomes in rural Ghana.Leveraging a prospective, rural Ghanaian birth cohort, we ascertained prenatal maternal negative life events, categorized scores as 0-2 (low stress; referent), 3-5 (moderate), and > 5 (high) among 353 pregnant women in the Kintampo North Municipality and Kintampo South District located within the middle belt of Ghana. We employed linear regression to determine associations between prenatal maternal stress and infant birth , head circumference, and length. We additionally examined associations between prenatal maternal stress and adverse birth outcome, including low birth , small for gestational age, or stillbirth. Effect modification by infant sex was examined.In all children, high prenatal maternal stress was associated with reduced birth length (β = - 0.91, p = 0.04; p-value for trend = 0.04). Among girls, moderate and high prenatal maternal stress was associated with reduced birth  (β = - 0.16, p = 0.02; β = - 0.18, p = 0.04 respectively; p-value for trend = 0.04) and head circumference (β = - 0.66, p = 0.05; β = - 1.02, p = 0.01 respectively; p-value for trend = 0.01). In girls, high prenatal stress increased odds of any adverse birth outcome (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.01-5.75; p for interaction = 0.04). Sex-specific analyses did not demonstrate significant effects in boys.All infants, but especially girls, were vulnerable to effects of prenatal maternal stress on birth outcomes.

However, CF is a multi-organ disease and therefore an evidence base is emerging on the systemic effects of CFTR modulators beyond the pulmonary system. This is of great clinical importance as many of these studies provide proof-of-concept that CFTR modulators might be used one day to prevent or treat extra-pulmonary manifestations stemming from CFTR dysfunction. In this concise review of the literature, we summarize the results of key publications that have evaluated the effects of CFTR modulators on  and growth, pancreatic function, the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems, sinus disease, bone disease, exercise tolerance, fertility, mental health, and immunity. While many of these studies have reported beneficial extra-pulmonary effects related to the use of ivacaftor (IVA) in CF patients with at least one gating mutation, most of the evidence is low or very low quality given the limited number of patients evaluated and the lack of a control group. Based on an even smaller number of studies evaluating the extra-pulmonary effects of lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM-IVA), the benefits are less clear. While limited, these studies may provide the basis for future clinical trials to evaluate CFTR modulators on the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665040>A systematic review and meta-analysis of the overall effects of school-based obesity prevention interventions and effect differences by intervention components.</a></h2><p>Childhood obesity is a serious public health concern. School-based interventions hold great promise to combat the rising trend of childhood obesity. This systematic review aimed to assess the overall effects of school-based obesity prevention interventions, and to investigate characteristics of intervention components that are potentially effective for preventing childhood obesity.We systematically searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Embase databases to identify randomized- or cluster randomized- controlled trials of school-based obesity interventions published between 1990 and 2019. We conducted meta-analyses and subgroup analyses to determine the overall effects of obesity prevention programs and effect differences by various characteristics of intervention components on  mass index (BMI) or BMI Z-score of children.This systematic review included a total of 50 trials (reported by 56 publications). Significant differences were found between groups on BMI (- 0.14 kg/m (95% confidence interval: - 0.21, - 0.06)) and BMI Z-score (- 0.05 (- 0.10, - 0.01)) for single-component interventions; significant differences were also found between groups on BMI (- 0.32 (- 0.54, - 0.09) kg/m) and BMI Z-score (- 0.07 (- 0.14, - 0.001)) for multi-component interventions. Subgroup analyses consistently demonstrated that effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions including curricular sessions (- 0.30 (- 0.51, - 0.10) kg/m in BMI) were stronger than those without curricular sessions (- 0.04 (- 0.17, 0.09) kg/m in BMI); effects of single-component (physical activity) interventions were also strengthened if physical activity sessions emphasized participants' enjoyment (- 0.19 (- 0.33, - 0.05) kg/m in BMI for those emphasizing participants' enjoyment; - 0.004 (- 0.10, 0.09) kg/m in BMI for those not emphasizing participants' enjoyment). The current  of evidence did not find specific characteristics of intervention components that were consistently associated with improved efficacy for multi-component interventions (P > 0.05).School-based interventions are generally effective in reducing excessive  gain of children. Our findings contribute to increased understandings of potentially effective intervention characteristics for single-component (physical activity) interventions. The impact of combined components on effectiveness of multi-component interventions should be the topic of further research. More high-quality studies are also needed to confirm findings of this review.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658128>Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty in 109 Consecutive Children and Adolescents With Obesity: Two-Year Outcomes of a New Modality.</a></h2><p>Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) uses full-thickness sutures that restrict the stomach to a sleeve-like configuration. There is no published evidence on endoscopic tissue apposition techniques in pediatric patients. In this article, we report our ESG experience with the first 109 pediatric patients with obesity who underwent ESG under our care.ESG was offered as a day-case procedure under a standardized protocol and clinical pathway that included surgical, medical, and endoscopic modalities for the treatment of pediatric and adult obesity. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .The 109 patients in this study had a baseline  mass index and age of 33.0 ± 4.7 and 17.6 ± 2.2 (range: 10-21) years, respectively. Ninety-nine (90.8%) were females. The mean procedure time was 61 ± 19 minutes. The mean % total  loss at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 14.4% ± 6.5%, 16.2% ± 8.3%, 15.4% ± 9.2%, and 13.7% ± 8.0%, respectively. Fourteen adolescents visited the ambulatory clinic for analgesia. One patient (aged 19.8 years) requested removal of endoscopic stitches due to abdominal pain, and another underwent Redo-ESG for insufficient  loss. There were no blood transfusions, emergency admissions, mortality, or significant morbidity.In this first study to date on ESG in pediatric patients, we observed that the procedure is safe and effective in children and adolescents with obesity.

Despite being well studied as a toxic element, the effects of Al on date palm have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the toxic effects of different Al concentrations on the development and growth of date palm callus and evaluate the biochemical and molecular response of date palm cells under Al stress.Our study revealed the phytotoxicity of Al concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l) on date palm callus. The fresh and dry  and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino acids were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino acid in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression. These data showed that the tissue culture technique can be used as a valuable approach in heavy metal toxicity studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663633>Delayed adverse events in male plateletpheresis donors: Initial insights on donor safety.</a></h2><p>Minimal information is available regarding delayed adverse donor events (D-ADEs) in plateletpheresis donors. Proactive follow up of donors for D-ADEs is not done routinely by BTS. The aim of this study was to analyze frequency and type of D-ADEs and its correlation with contributory factors if any.In this prospective observational study all eligible donors were contacted by telephone twice and asked about general wellbeing and questions specific to adverse donor events (ADEs). Donors were called at 24 hours and 2 weeks after donation. The ADEs were categorized in accordance with the International Society of Blood Transfusion standard guidelines.A total of 531 donors were analyzed in the study. D-ADEs were more common as compared to immediate ADEs (I-ADEs) (19.21% vs 5.46%, P < .0001). The most common D-ADEs were bruises (7.34%) and sore arms (3.58%). Localized D-ADEs in form of bruise and hematomas were more frequent as compared to systemic D-ADEs like fatigue and vaso-vagal reactions (16.01% vs 3.20% P < .0001). Repeat donors had a lower incidence of systemic D-ADEs (1.61% vs 6.96%, P = .001). Donors with  ≤75 kg and platelet count ≤230 × 10  μL were more prone to systemic D-ADEs (P < .05). Citrate toxicity was more common in donors with  ≤ 75 kg (P = .002).Plateletpheresis procedures are relatively safer without any sequelae. D-ADEs are more common than I-ADEs. Localized D-ADEs are more frequent than systemic D-ADEs. First-time donors are more prone to D-ADEs than repeat donors.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662511>Sinus Floor Augmentation by Intraoral Endoscopic Approach for Biomaterial Study in a Rabbit Model.</a></h2><p>To develop a new surgical model for sinus floor augmentation (SFA) in rabbit for experimental purposes.Eight adult rabbits were used, two for a surgical design using the anatomical dissection study, and the other six for an endoscopically assisted intraoral approach of SFA unilaterally, creating a subantral space where an allograft biomaterial was deposited. SFA was verified through cone-beam computerized tomography. Healing, , food, feces, and behavior were evaluated for 4 weeks post-operatively.All animals survived. There was no bleeding or infection; inflammation was mild. No changes were observed in terms of feeding, , feces, or behavior. Tissue healing was normal.This model is a refinement of the experimental technique and is a real option for SFA, without compromising animal morbidity because of its conservative design. The minimally invasive approach with endoscopic assistance reduces bias and improves surgical predictability.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

The effect of antioxidant treatment was examined.Diabetes was induced in adult male Wistar rats with a single dose of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg; i.p.). Diabetic animals were then randomly separated into three groups: No treatment (DM), resveratrol treatment, and taurine treatment, and fed with a high-fat diet. Age-matched non-diabetic animals were used and fed with normal diet (control). Two weeks later, animals were sacrificed and bladders were processed for histological evaluation, and further analysis for oxidative stress markers.The  of all diabetic animals was significantly lower compared to the controls. The DM group demonstrated a significantly higher bladder  to  ratio compared to the control. The bladder in the DM group demonstrated abruption of the mucosa from the muscularis and edema in the transitional epithelium. Bladders from the resveratrol-, and taurine-treated groups did not demonstrate these histological alterations. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the bladder was significantly higher in the DM group compared to all other groups. Immunohistochemistry showed that diabetes induced a moderate to strong expression of oxidative stress markers MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal, and DNA oxidative stress marker 8-deoxyguanosine in the DM group compared to the other groups.Prompt diagnosis and treatment of diabetes is crucial in regard to disease progression. Specifically, in the bladder it appears that both mild damage at the structural level, as well as oxidative damage at the molecular level may be prevented by antioxidant treatment.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

The link between psoriatic condition and obesity is based on shared pathophysiological pathways where local and systemic inflammation promote each other; PsO is an inflammatory, immune-mediated disease, and the adipose tissue is the source of proinflammatory adipokines. Moreover, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an important comorbidity of PsO that reduces quality of life and makes difficult the patient's management. Treatment of obese subjects with moderate to severe PsO, even more if PsA is present, is challenging because of reduced efficacy of several systemic drugs and increased risk of adverse events. Secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes interleukin 17A, shows efficacy on PsO in all  groups, even in the highest, whose response has a slight downward trend. Clinical features of two obese subjects, affected by PsO and PsA, successfully treated with secukinumab, are described.Copyright © 2019 by S.

The feather shaft is an important connective unit, made of a lightweight material, which also contributes to aiding flight. The shaft can withstand loads from different directions and has outstanding compression resistance. In this study, the microstructure and composition of the A. fabalis feather shaft were observed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and its compression resistance was studied by compression testing. The results indicated that the mechanical property of the shaft is related to its microstructure. Compression testing verified that the primary feathers had the strongest mechanical properties, followed by the secondaries, and finally the alulae. Under the same conditions, the specific energy absorption of the three feather types was 5.96, 5.02, and 3.17 J/g, respectively. With increasing moisture content, the rachis was softened and the energy absorption was reduced. At low moisture content, the specific energy absorption of the primaries was reduced to 1.03 J/g, that of the secondaries was reduced to 1.72 J/g, and that of the alulae to 0.39 J/g. The feather shafts have the advantage of light  while maintaining the required mechanical properties.

The incidence of lung cancer is increasing rapidly, in parallel with an increased incidence of smoking. Effective chemoprevention may be an alternative strategy to control the incidence of lung cancer. Thus, the objective of current work was to ascertain the possible preventive and therapeutic efficacies of  extract in a mouse model of lung tumorigenesis and its cytotoxicity toward the A549 human lung cancer cell line. Lung tumorigenesis was induced by the oral administration of benzo(a)pyrene (50 mg/kg b.w.) twice per week to Swiss albino mice for 4 weeks. Benzo(a)pyrene-treated mice were orally administered  (300 mg/kg , 5 days/week) for 2 weeks before or 9 weeks after the first benzo(a)pyrene dose, for a total of 21 weeks. At the end of the administration period, various parameters were measured in the serum and lung tissues. The results revealed that the oral administration of benzo(a)pyrene resulted in increases in relative lung , serum levels of tumor markers (ADA, AHH, and LDH), and the inflammatory marker NF-κB, and a decreased total antioxidant capacity compared with the control. In addition, decreased levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, with a concomitant increase in lipid peroxidation, metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-12), and the angiogenic marker VEGF were detected in lung tissues. Moreover, benzo(a)pyrene administration induced the upregulation of PKCα, COX-2, and Bcl-2 expression, with the downregulation of BAX and caspase-3 expression.  treatment alleviated all alterations in these parameters, which was further confirmed by the histopathological analysis of lung tissues.

Expression of miRNAs previously associated with maternal obesity, leptin or adiponectin function were assessed and their impact on infant  analyzed. Milk samples were collected (at month 1, 2, and 3) from a cohort of 59 healthy lactating mothers (38 normal- and 21 overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25)), and infant growth was followed up to 2 years of age. Thirteen miRNAs, leptin and adiponectin were determined in milk. Leptin, adiponectin and miRNA showed a decrease over time of lactation in normal- mothers that was altered in overweight/obesity. Furthermore, negative correlations were observed in normal- mothers between the expression of miRNAs in milk and the concentration of leptin or adiponectin, but were absent in overweight/obesity. Moreover, miRNAs negatively correlated with infant BMI only in normal- mothers (miR-103, miR-17, miR-181a, miR-222, miR-let7c and miR-146b). Interestingly, target genes of milk miRNAs differently regulated in overweight/obesity could be related to neurodevelopmental processes. In conclusion, a set of miRNAs present in breast milk, in close conjunction with leptin and adiponectin, are natural bioactive compounds with the potential to modulate infant growth and brain development, an interplay that is disturbed in the case of maternal overweight/obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658911>Prevalence of undernutrition in Bangladeshi children.</a></h2><p>Child undernutrition is a major public health problem throughout the world, particularly in developing countries.

Previous research using food recalls suggests that the total energy intake of food-insecure women is not elevated, though macronutrient composition may differ from that of food-secure women. There is limited evidence on temporal patterns of food consumption. Here, we used food recalls from women in the 2013-4 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES,  = 2798) to characterise temporal patterns of food consumption in relation to food insecurity. Compared to the food-secure, food-insecure women had more variable time gaps between eating; ate a smaller and less variable number of distinct foods at a time; were more variable from day to day in their time of first consumption; were more variable from day to day in the number of times they ate; and consumed relatively more carbohydrate, less protein, and less fibre. However, their overall energy intake was no higher. Food-insecure women had higher BMIs (2.25 kg/m), and around 15% of the BMI difference between food-insecure and food-secure women was accounted for by their more variable time gaps between eating, their lower diversity of foods, and their lower fibre consumption.

Gestational age (P < 0.001) and birth  (  = 0.001) were significantly associated with ROP in infants from MG pregnancies in multivariate analysis.ROP remains a commonly encountered disease, especially in ELBW and EP infants. The history of transfusion may have a role in stratifying the risk for ROP and guiding future screening guidelines.Copyright © 2019 Zarei et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660493>Traumatic aorto-pulmonary artery fistula: a case report.</a></h2><p>Aorta-pulmonary (A-P) artery fistula following a stab wound to the chest with superimposed infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare, often unrecognized presentation. Herein, we report a case of A-P fistula due to stab chest assessed by two- and three-dimensional (3D) imaging.A 30-year-old man presented with a history of being stabbed in the chest with a screwdriver. The chest wall laceration was sutured, an intercostal drain inserted for a haemopneumothorax, and he was subsequently discharged. He presented 3 weeks later with exertional dyspnoea, fever, rigours, and loss of . On examination, he had a wide pulse pressure and a harsh continuous murmur in the 2nd left intercostal space associated with a palpable thrill. Blood tests revealed raised infective markers and anaemia. All blood cultures were sterile. On echocardiography, the aortic and pulmonary valve was severely damaged, with suspicion of superimposed vegetations secondary to IE. There was severe aortic and pulmonary valve regurgitation. A fistulous connection was noted between the aorta and main pulmonary artery, just below the commissure adjoining the right and left coronary sinus of the aortic valve. On 3D imaging, the defect was quantified. The patient was subsequently referred for aortic and pulmonary valve replacement and closure of the A-P fistula. The presence of multiple vegetations was confirmed intraoperatively. He also received a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics.We have described a rare case of an A-P fistula due to a stab wound to the chest complicated by IE. In a patient with stab wound to the chest, a high index of suspicion of cardiac involvement must be maintained, and a careful search for intracardiac shunts must be made on echocardiography, prior to discharge. Furthermore, in addition to two-dimensional imaging, 3D imaging proved useful in providing a comprehensive assessment of the morphology of the lesion prior to surgery.© The Author(s) 2019.

The concentration, distribution, source, and health risk of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed. The 16 USEPA priority PAHs were detected in all soil samples. The total concentrations of PAHs ranged from 283 to 21,821 ng/g dry  (dw), with a mean value of 2370 ng/g and median value of 1427 ng/g. The benzo[a]pyrene toxicity equivalent (BaP) concentrations ranged from 6.03 to 2403 ng/g dw, with a mean value of 308 ng/g and median value of 185 ng/g. High molecular  PAHs were the predominant components. The spatial distribution revealed that soil PAH concentrations within the Two Ring Road were high, but low in the south of Hun River. Compared with other urban soils, the pollution of PAHs in urban soils of Shenyang was at a moderate level, but increased rapidly compared with previous years, especially fluoranthene. Diagnostic ratios of PAHs and positive matrix factorization model all suggested that PAHs in urban soils of Shenyang were dominantly from pyrogenic origins. The health risk assessment indicated that children had the highest total carcinogenic risk, followed by adolescents and adults. The differences between gender groups for the same age group were insignificant. Ingestion was the dominant exposure pathway, followed by dermal contact and inhalation. The total lifetime carcinogenic risks at all sampling sites were lower than the highest acceptable risk (10), and those of Eastern, Central, and Western Shenyang were higher than those of Northern and Southern Shenyang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660452>Adverse Effect of Nonylphenol on the Reproductive System in F2 Male Mice : A Qualitative Change?</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported negative effects of low-dose nonylphenol (NP) exposure on the reproductive organs of F1 male mice. In the present study was further investigated the endocrine disrupting effect of NP exposure to F2 generation male mice. Mice were divided into 2 groups; (1) CON, control animals and (2) NP-50 (50 μg/L), animals were treated with NP via drinking water. NP exposures were continuously conducted from parental pre-mating period until the postnatal day (PND) 55 of F2 offsprings. Mice were sacrificed on PND 55 and the reproductive tissue  were measured. The initial (at PND 21) and terminal (PND 55)   of the NP-50 group animals were not significantly different from those of control group animals. NP exposure fail to induce a significant  change of the testes, seminal vesicle and prostate except absolute epididymal  (<0.05). However, pathohistological studies revealed that NP-treated F2 animals showed evident decrease in seminiferous tubule diameters, reduced luminal area and number of germ cells. Also, sloughing morphologies in the tubules were notable. In the caudal epididymis, fewer mature sperms and swollen epithelial cells were found in the NP-treated group. The present study demonstrated that the subchronic low-dose NP exposure induced pathohistological abnormalities in testis and epididymis of F2 mice, and we assumed that these 'qualitative' changes in reproductive tissues could be derived from the epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, altered DNA accessibility and chromatin structure. Further studies are needed to achieve a better understanding on the multi- or trans-generational effects of NP on the reproductive health and a human application.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663832>Relationships between -scores at the hip and bone mineral density at the distal femur and proximal tibia in persons with spinal cord injury.</a></h2><p> To identify -score values at the total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN) that correspond to the cutoff value of <0.60 g/cm for heightened risk of fracture at the distal femur (DF) and proximal tibia (PT Retrospective analysis of data in a research center's database.

The liver is the main site of galactose metabolism, but the direct effects of this dietary intervention on the liver in the post-weaning period are not known. The aim of this study was to elucidate this. Weanling female mice (C57BL/6JRccHsd) were fed a starch containing diet with glucose (32 en%) monosaccharide (GLU), or a diet with glucose and galactose (1:1 both 16 en%) (GLU+GAL). ,  composition, and food intake were determined weekly. After 3 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and serum and liver tissues were collected. Global hepatic mRNA expression was analyzed and hepatic triglyceride (TG) and glycogen contents were determined by enzymatic assays.  and  composition were similar in both groups, despite higher food intake in mice on GLU+GAL diet. Hepatic TG content was lower in GLU+GAL-fed than GLU-fed females, while glycogen levels were unaffected. Analysis of global expression patterns of hepatic mRNA showed that mainly inflammation-related pathways were affected by the diet, which were predominantly downregulated in GLU+GAL-fed females compared to GLU-fed females. This reduction in inflammation in GLU+GAL-fed females was also reflected by decreased serum concentrations of acute phase protein Serum amyloid A 3. In conclusion, replacing part of glucose with galactose in the post-weaning diet reduces hepatic TG content and hepatic inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A 21-year-old female presented with abdominal distention, diarrhea, nausea, fever,  loss, and night sweats. Serum CA-125 level was 563 U/L (normal range: <35 U/L) and other tumor markers were within normal range. Radiologic studies showed massive ascites, smooth minimal thickening and increased contrast enhancement of peritoneum, omental nodularities, hepatomegaly, and right pleural effusion. No underlying malignancy that could cause this condition was detected clinically and radiologically. Ultrasound-guided omental tru-cut biopsy was performed to exclude carcinomatosis peritonei. Histopathologic examination showed small-medium-sized granulomas with caseous necrosis. Molecular microbiology tests of biopsy specimens confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis.

To this end, thiolated chitosan-hyaluronic acid composite polymeric complex next-generation of the periodontal membrane was manufactured by solvent casting method. FTIR spectroscopic analysis displayed successful immobilization of thiol groups on the manufactured thiolated periodontal membrane. Moreover, XRD, DSC, AFM and TGA of the membrane confirmed the compatibility of ingredients and modifications in surface chemistry. The thiolated periodontal film was also investigated in terms of thickness,  uniformity, water-uptake capacity, drug content, pH, entrapment efficiency, lysozymal degradation and release patterns. Also, mucoadhesion profile was explored on gingival mucosa. The immobilized thiol groups on thiolated chitosan and thiolated hyaluronate were found to be 168 ± 11 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) and 189 ± 8 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) respectively. Swelling capacity of the thiolated periodontal membrane was significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. The obtained thiolated membrane depicted 3 -old higher mucoadhesive features as compared to the un-modified membrane. In vitro release kinetics indicated approximately more than 80% prolonged release within 7 days. Mechanical strength of the Thiolated bandage was also significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. Ex-vivo retention study revealed enhanced retention of thiolated membrane as compared to unmodified membrane. In-vitro antimicrobial studies demonstrated that thiolated membrane could efficiently kill Porphyromonas gingivalis cells as compared to the native membrane. Moreover, ex-vivo biodegradation results indicated that 90% of the thiolated membrane was biodegradable in 28 days. Based on these findings, thiolated next-generation of the periodontal membrane seems to be promising for periodontitis therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660321>The renal resistive index as a new complementary tool to predict microvascular diabetic complications in children and adolescents: a groundbreaking finding.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) has made it necessary to have new markers for early detection of diabetic nephropathy. Renal resistive index (RI) by using renal Doppler can be a helpful tool in detecting functional alterations in renal hemodynamics. This study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents with type 1 DM. They were further subdivided into two equal subgroups: group 1 with type 1 DM and normo-albuminuria [urinary albumin excretion (UAE) <30 mg/24 hours], and group 2 with type 1 DM and hyper-albuminuria (increased UAE >30 mg/24 hours). There were 37 males (37%) and 63 females (63%); their mean ages were 13.6±2.53 (range, 10-19) years and mean disease duration was 8.867±2.260 (range, 5-13) years. Progressive increase in RI was significantly associated with increased disease duration more than 10 years, elevated serum HbA1c more than 7.5% and early pubertal stages. While not significantly related to sex, , height, blood pressure or serum lipid profile, diabetic micro-vascular complications (nephropathy and sensory neuropathy) were more prevalent among patients with RI more than 0.58. Renal RI could be a useful complementary test for the evaluation of functional alterations in renal hemodynamics in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes status, and VA regional network and were closest in age,  mass index (calculated as  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe obesity, 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52.5 (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at 5 years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged 5 to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe obesity, total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659017>Dendritic Cells Control Regulatory T Cell Function Required for Maintenance of Intestinal Tissue Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) together with regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential mediators of immune homeostasis. Disruption of function or frequency of either cell type can lead to fatal autoimmunity. We previously described that mice constitutively lacking DCs (∆DC) develop autoimmunity characterized by reduced , autoantibodies, and pronounced intestinal inflammation. In this study, we show that lack of DCs leads to an altered gene expression profile in peripheral but not thymic Tregs with increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The suppressive function of Tregs from ΔDC mice was impaired in T cell cocultures. In a model of transfer colitis, Tregs from ∆DC mice were only functional in the presence of DCs in recipient mice. Lack of MHC class II on DCs also resulted in upregulation of inhibitory receptors on Tregs, reduced , and elevated serum IgA levels. Further analysis of the IgA response revealed an expansion of IgA germinal center B cells and plasma cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and more IgA-coated commensal bacteria in feces of ∆DC mice. Thus, we show a critical role for DCs to establish intestinal homeostasis by regulating Treg function for prevention of spontaneous inflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662081>The genetics of morphological and behavioural island traits in deer mice.</a></h2><p>Animals on islands often exhibit dramatic differences in morphology and behaviour compared with mainland individuals, a phenomenon known as the 'island syndrome'. These differences are thought to be adaptations to island environments, but the extent to which they have a genetic basis or instead represent plastic responses to environmental extremes is often unknown. Here, we revisit a classic case of island syndrome in deer mice () from British Columbia. We first show that Saturna Island mice and those from neighbouring islands are approximately 35% (approx. 5 g) heavier than mainland mice and diverged approximately 10 000 years ago. We then establish laboratory colonies and find that Saturna Island mice are heavier both because they are longer and have disproportionately more lean mass. These trait differences are maintained in second-generation captive-born mice raised in a common environment. In addition, island-mainland hybrids reveal a maternal genetic effect on . Using behavioural testing in the laboratory, we also find that wild-caught island mice are less aggressive than mainland mice; however, laboratory-raised mice born to these founders do not differ in aggression. Together, our results reveal that these mice have different responses to the environmental conditions on islands-a heritable change in a morphological trait and a plastic response in a behavioural trait.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660682>Early clinical experience with varian halcyon V2 linear accelerator: Dual-isocenter IMRT planning and delivery with portal dosimetry for gynecological cancer treatments.</a></h2><p>Varian Halcyon linear accelerator version 2 (The Halcyon 2.0) was recently released with new upgraded features. The aim of this study was to report our clinical experience with Halcyon 2.0 for a dual-isocenter intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning and delivery for gynecological cancer patients and examine the feasibility of in vivo portal dosimetry.Twelve gynecological cancer patients were treated with extended-field IMRT technique using two isocenters on Halcyon 2.0 to treat pelvis and pelvic/or para-aortic nodes region. The prescription dose was 45 Gy in 25 fractions (fxs) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose of 55 or 57.5 Gy in 25 fxs to involved nodes. All treatment plans, pretreatment patient-specific QA and treatment delivery records including daily in vivo portal dosimetry were retrospectively reviewed. For in vivo daily portal dosimetry analysis, each fraction was compared to the reference baseline (1st fraction) using gamma analysis criteria of 4 %/4 mm with 90% of total pixels in the portal image planar dose.All 12 extended-field IMRT plans met the planning criteria and delivered as planned (a total of 300 fractions). Conformity Index (CI) for the primary target was achieved with the range of 0.99-1.14. For organs at risks, most were well within the dose volume criteria. Treatment delivery time was from 5.0 to 6.5 min. Interfractional in vivo dose variation exceeded gamma analysis threshold for 8 fractions out of total 300 (2.7%). These eight fractions were found to have a relatively large difference in small bowel filling and SSD change at the isocenter compared to the baseline.Halcyon 2.0 is effective to create complex extended-field IMRT plans using two isocenters with efficient delivery. Also Halcyon in vivo dosimetry is feasible for daily treatment monitoring for organ motion, internal or external anatomy, and  which could further lead to adaptive radiation therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection.

Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; the control, TQ-treated at the dose 400 mg∕kg b.w., untreated hypothyroidism and TQ-treated hypothyroid groups. Serum levels of thyroid hormones and antioxidant profile were measured. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess gene expression of catalase (CAT). Liver was histopathologically examined using routine and immunohistochemical techniques.Livers of rats with hypothyroidism displayed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the form of steatosis as well as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Moreover, there was an intralobular inflammatory reaction associated with significant (p<0.05) increases in the density of resident hepatic macrophages [cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)+ cells], as well as in activated hepatic stellate cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) index in livers with hypothyroidism. Resolution of hypothyroid NAFLD was observed in livers after treatment with TQ. The significantly increased (p<0.05) steatosis, lobular inflammation, NAFLD activity scores, α-SMA index as well as CD68+ cells induced by hypothyroidism were corrected after TQ administration.

Individual-level, serial cross-sectional data from the 2009-2013 College Student Health Survey, which includes 2- and 4-year college students (n = 29,118) attending 46 Minnesota colleges, were used. College-level data on LGB context were primarily collected through college websites. Multinomial logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between LGB college climate scores (including non-discrimination policies, presence of LGB or diversity-related student groups, LGB courses offered, LGB housing accommodations, and prevalence of LGB students) and students'  status (underweight, healthy , overweight, and obese), based on self-reported height and . Higher LGB climate scores (i.e., more supportive environments) were associated with lower risk of overweight and obesity among all students. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among female students suggested that the association between LGB climate scores and  status was similar to the overall female sample. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among male students showed a more complex relationship between LGB climate scores and  status.

Using accelerometry to develop a better understanding of the complex gait of these agile canines may help to eliminate injury contributing factors. This study used a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer to characterise the galloping of thirty-one greyhounds on five different race tracks. The dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior accelerations were analysed in both the time and frequency domains. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Morlet wavelet transform were applied to signals. The time-domain signals were synced with the corresponding high frame rate videos of the race. It was observed that the acceleration peaks in the dorsal-ventral accelerations correspond to the hind-leg strikes which were noted to be fifteen times the greyhound's . The FFT analysis showed that the stride frequencies in all tracks were around 3.5 Hz. The Morlet wavelet analysis also showed a reduction in both the frequency and magnitude of signals, which suggests a speed reduction throughout the race. Also, by detecting abrupt changes along the track, the wavelet analysis highlighted potentially hazardous locations on the track. In conclusion, the methods applied in this research contribute to animal safety and welfare by eliminating the factors leading to injuries through optimising the track design and surface type.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658724>Valorization of Red Grape Pomace Waste Using Polyethylene Glycol and Fibrolytic Enzymes: Physiological and Meat Quality Responses in Broilers.</a></h2><p>The amount of grape pomace (GP) waste that can be included as a functional feed in broiler diets is limited by anti-nutritional compounds such as fiber and condensed tannins. This study evaluated the effect of pre-treating GP with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a cellulolytic enzyme mixture on physiological and meat quality parameters of broilers. Cobb 500 broilers (249.2 ± 20.31 g live-) were reared on five isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets: 1. Commercial chicken diet (CON); 2. CON containing untreated GP at 100 g/kg (dGP); 3.

The meat of birds reared on dPEG, ENZ, dGP and CON had a similar water-holding capacity, which was lower than in PENZ chickens. Diets influenced the size of duodenum, ileum, jejunum and caeca. Polyethylene glycol treatment promoted similar  gains and hot carcass  as the commercial control diet, suggesting that the anti-nutritional effects of condensed tannins were successfully ameliorated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658268>Male long-distance migrant turned sedentary; The West European pond bat (Myotis dasycneme) alters their migration and hibernation behaviour.</a></h2><p>During autumn in the temperate zone, insectivorous male bats face a profound energetic challenge, as in the same period they have to make energy choices related to hibernation, mating and migration. To investigate these energetic trade-offs, we compared the  mass of male and female pond bats (Myotis dasycneme) through the summer season, characterized the known hibernacula in terms of male or female bias, and subsequently compared their population trend during two study periods, between 1930-1980 and 1980-2015. Towards the end of summer, males began losing  whilst females were simultaneously accumulating fat, suggesting that males were pre-occupied with mating. We also found evidence for a recent adaptation to this energetic trade-off, males have colonised winter roosts in formerly unoccupied areas, which has consequently led to a change in the migration patterns for the male population of this species. As male bats do not assist in raising offspring, males have ample time to restore their energy balance after hibernation. Our results suggest that choosing a hibernacula closer to the summer range not only decreases energy cost needed for migration, it also lengthens the mating season of the individual male. Our findings have important conservation implications, as male and female biased hibernation assemblages may differ critically in terms of microclimate preferences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662123> Toxicity in Cattle.</a></h2><p>Toxicity related to consumption of  has been described in ruminants in some countries. This report describes the clinical and pathological findings of  toxicosis in 3 beef cattle herds located in 2 different areas of Sicily, Italy. Outbreaks were observed after grazing in poor winter pasture where  was abundant. Mean morbidity and mortality were 29% and 21%, respectively. Most of the affected animals (6 to 36 months old) showed anorexia,  loss, and pollakiuria culminating in recumbency and death. Occasionally, abortion and neurological signs were observed. In animals with acute signs, there was a moderate decrease of sodium and chloride concentrations in serum. Animals with chronic signs showed an increase of serum urea, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and phosphorus and a decrease in total serum protein, calcium, chloride, and magnesium concentrations. Moderate anemia and slight neutropenia, lymphocytosis, and eosinophilia were detected in all groups. At necropsy, the main lesion was severe distention of the urinary bladder with turbid hemorrhagic urine and crystalluria. Histologically, chronic cystitis, interstitial nephritis, eosinophilic enteritis, and nonsuppurative necrotizing hepatitis were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of  toxicosis in cattle in Italy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661358>Antibiotics can cause  loss by impairing gut microbiota in mice and the potent benefits of lactobacilli.</a></h2><p>This study assessed whether antibiotics could alter gut microbiota to affect host growth and the possibility of alleviation by lactobacilli. We divided four-week-old BABL/c mice into control (Ctrl), antibiotic exposure (Abx), Lactobacillus plantarum PC-170 (PC), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) group and the Abx, LGG, and PC group received an one-week antibiotic/antibiotic + probiotic treatment. The fecal microbiota and the expression of splenic cytokines were determined. Following the ceftriaxone treatment, the  gain of Abx was delayed compared with others. The ceftriaxone treatment significantly decreased the alpha-diversity of the fecal microbiota and altered the fecal microbiota but LGG and PC can partly alleviate the effect. At the end of the study, the microbial community of LGG and PC group were more similar to Ctrl compared with Abx group. The results indicated that ceftriaxone could significantly alter intestinal microbiota. Lactobacilli might alleviate the side effects of antibiotics by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660867>Changes in waist circumference and risk of all-cause and CVD mortality: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk) cohort study.</a></h2><p> of abdominal adiposity are strongly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, data are limited and conflicting regarding the consequences of changes in  fat distribution. The main aims of this paper are to investigate the association between changes in waist circumference (WC) and all-cause and CVD mortality and to examine these changes in relation to concurrent changes in .The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Norfolk) study recruited 25,639 participants between 1993 and 1997, aged 39-79, a number of whom also attended a second examination (1998-2000), and were followed up to 2016 for mortality. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they had WC,  and height measurements at both time-points; those with a self-reported history of CVD or cancer,  mass index < 18.5 kg/m2 or missing data on covariates were excluded, leaving 12,337 participants for analyses. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 16.4 (15.7, 17.2) years. Hazard Ratios (HRs) for all-cause (2866 deaths) and CVD mortality (822 deaths), by categories of WC change, were determined using Cox proportional hazards analyses.After multivariable adjustment, the HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality for men and women with a WC gain (WCG) >  5 cm were 1.51 (1.29-1.75) and 1.25 (1.06-1.46) respectively. For CVD mortality in men and women with a WCG >  5 cm, the HRs were 1.84 (1.39-2.43) and 1.15 (0.85-1.55) respectively. In analyses of concurrent changes in WC and , the greatest risk (HRs) (95% CIs) in men occurred with  loss and WCG: 1.80 (1.13-2.86) for all-cause and 2.22 (1.03-4.82) for CVD mortality. In women, the greatest risk for both all-cause (HR 1.50 (1.16-1.95)) and CVD mortality (HR 1.81 (1.15-2.85)) was observed in those with  loss and maintenance of WC (WCM).Objectively measured WCG > 5 cm, was associated with subsequent higher total mortality risk and higher CVD mortality risk in men.

At 28 days of age, sixty broilers were randomly divided into the control group (25 ± 2 °C; 24 h/day) and the heat stress group (36 ± 2 °C; 8 h/day lasted for 1 week or 2 weeks). Fifteen broilers per group were respectively euthanized, and some samples were respectively collected from the control and the heat stress groups at the end of the 1st week or the 2nd week of heat stress. A typical heat stress response has been observed at this temperature. Compared with the control group, the birds subjected to heat stress at the end of the 1st week reduced (P ＜ 0.05)  (BW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), the activity of serum antioxidant enzyme and content of glutathione (GSH), while increased (P ＜ 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum corticosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, when the heat stress lasted for the end of the 2nd week, there was no significant difference (P ＞ 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, FCR and serum contents of corticosterone, MDA and GSH. Regardless of duration of thermal stress, the localization of ABCG2 protein had no change. Moreover, heat stress also did not affect (P ＞ 0.05) the IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in the pectorales, crureus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and spleen, while significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05) the corresponding tissues ROS production at the end of the 1st week of heat stress. In contrast, at the end of the 2nd week of heat stress, IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in heat stress group significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05), while the corresponding tissues ROS production had no difference (P ＞ 0.05) compared to the control group. Collectively, duration of thermal stress affects growth performance, serum oxidative stress indices, and the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production of broiler tissues in a time-dependent manner. There is a negative correlation between the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production in the corresponding tissues under heat stress.Copyright © 2019.

Previous studies have suggested that there is an increased risk of fracture in gastric cancer survivors. However, these studies were performed without proper control groups. Therefore, we used Korean national health insurance data to compare the fracture risk in gastric cancer survivors who received gastrectomy to that of the general population.A total of 133,179 gastric cancer survivors were included and matched to noncancer controls using 1:1 propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the relative risk of fracture between the gastric cancer survivors and matched controls. We also examined the factors associated with fracture in gastric cancer survivors.Compared with the matched controls, gastric cancer survivors had an elevated risk of osteoporotic fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-1.70), which was most prominent in patients who underwent total gastrectomy (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.96-2.44) and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.81-2.23). In multivariate analysis, anemia was significantly associated with increased fracture risk (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13-1.59), while decrease in  >5% was not (aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89-1.25).Gastric cancer survivors who underwent gastrectomy had an increased osteoporotic fracture risk than did matched controls. Total gastrectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and anemia were associated with an even higher risk in these patients. Additional studies are needed to establish optimal strategies, such as screening for osteoporosis and preventive interventions, that will reduce fracture risk in this population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658487>Do We Know How to Avoid OASIs in Non-Supine Birth Positions?

Multiple regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of the supine and upright positions on the incidence of OASIs after adjusting for risk factors and obstetric interventions. In total, 239 (13.8%) births occurred in upright positions, and 1,489 (86.2%) in supine positions. Grade-III lacerations occurred in 43 (2.5%) patients, and grade-IV lacerations occurred in 3 (0.2%) women. Supine positions had a significant protective effect against severe lacerations, odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0,47 [0.22-0.99], adjusted for the use of forceps 4.80 [2.15-10.70], nulliparity 2.86 [1.44-5.69], and birth  3.30 [1.56-7.00]. Anesthesia ( < 0.070), oxytocin augmentation ( < 0.228), shoulder dystocia ( < 0.670), and episiotomy ( < 0.559) were not associated with the incidence of severe lacerations. Upright birth positions were not associated with a lower rate of perineal tears. The interpretation of the findings regarding these positions raised doubts about perineal protection that are still unanswered.Thieme Revinter Publicações Ltda Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664418>Changes in the intestinal microbiota of superobese patients after bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota is associated with obesity and  loss after bariatric surgery and has been related to its changing pattern. Exactly how the bacterial population affects  loss and the results of surgery remain controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the intestinal microbiota of superobese patients before and after gastric bypass surgery (RYGB).DNA fragments for the microbiota obtained from stool samples collected from nine superobese patients before and after bariatric surgery were sequenced using Ion Torrent.We observed that with a mean follow-up of 15 months, patients achieved 55.9% excess  loss (EWL). A significant population reduction in the Proteobacteria phylum (11 to 2%, p=0.0025) was observed after surgery, while no difference was seen in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Further analyses performed with two specific individuals with divergent clinical outcomes showed a change in the pattern between them, with a significant increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes in the patient with less  loss (%EWL 50.79 vs. 61.85).RYGB affects the microbiota of superobese patients, with a significant reduction in Proteobacteria in patients with different  loss, showing that different bacteria may contribute to the process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662109>[Integrated Complex Treatment for Extreme Anorexia Nervosa; An Interdisciplinary Treatment Concept of the University Hospital Zurich].</a></h2><p>Integrated Complex Treatment for Extreme Anorexia Nervosa; An Interdisciplinary Treatment Concept of the University Hospital Zurich  The serious physical mental and psychosocial morbidity due to anorexia nervosa is often perceived by sufferers as less serious than from their environment.

Dengue infection is associated with maternal as well as fetal morbidities, like stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birth .We report a case of dengue fever occurring during early pregnancy and subsequent congenital neurologic malformation in the neonate as a result of vertical transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first case of confirmed congenital dengue in Saudi Arabia.Dengue infection is not commonly associated with congenital anomalies and no biologic mechanism has yet been established for its teratogenicity. Congenital dengue in neonates can be confirmed by identification of the dengue virus in cord blood samples. The positive dengue serology within the first week of life, together with the confirmed maternal dengue infection during pregnancy, supports the diagnosis of vertical transmission in the presence of clinical manifestations.

A fluorescent label is incorporated into the polymer chains for in vivo imaging. Upon dialysis against aqueous solution, polymers form 15 nm spherical micelles. Subsequent exposure to MMP-9 elicits a morphological change to yield immunostimulatory microscale assemblies. The intravenous (IV) administration of the formulation to mice bearing 4T1 breast cancer tumors results in nanoparticle accumulation in tumors, reduction in primary tumor growth, and inhibition of lung metastases, as compared to saline-treated animals. Mice administered the parent immunotherapeutic small molecule (1V209) experience significantly increased plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IP-10, and MCP-1 at 2 h following IV administration, whereas the nanomaterial shows no increase over saline-treated controls. These data suggest that covalently packaging low molecular  immunotherapeutics at high  percent loadings in enzyme-responsive nanoparticles maintains drug efficacy while decreasing immunotoxicity, providing a platform for cancer immunotherapeutic delivery.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The affected individuals represent a notable reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, which leads to malfunction of the components of the respiratory chain. MDS is classified according to the type of affected tissue; the most common type is hepatocerebral form, which is attributed to mutations in nuclear genes such as DGUOK and MPV17. These two genes encode mitochondrial proteins and play major roles in mtDNA synthesis.In this investigation patients in three families affected by hepatocerebral form of MDS who were initially diagnosed with tyrosinemia underwent full clinical evaluation. Furthermore, the causative mutations were identified using next generation sequencing and were subsequently validated using sanger sequencing. The effect of the mutations on the gene expression was also studied using real-time PCR. A pathogenic heterozygous frameshift deletion mutation in DGUOK gene was identified in parents of two affected patients (c.706-707 + 2 del: p.k236 fs) presenting with jaundice, impaired fetal growth, low-birth , and failure to thrive who died at the age of 3 and 6 months in family I. Moreover, a novel splice site mutation in MPV17 gene (c.461 + 1G > C) was identified in a patient with jaundice, muscle weakness, and failure to thrive who died due to hepatic failure at the age of 4 months. A 5-month-old infant presenting with jaundice, dark urine, poor sucking, and feeding problems was also identified to have another novel mutation in MPV17 gene leading to stop gain mutation (c.277C > T: p.(Gln93*)).These patients had overlapping clinical features with tyrosinemia.

Data collected included demographics, ventilatory modes, extubation data, and presence of complications. Infants extubated to either CPAP or NIV were compared using Wilcoxon rank- sum and Chi-square tests, and data were corrected using logistic regression models. Data are presented as medians.A total of 120 infants were included, of whom 62% were extubated to NIV. The incidence of BPD was significantly lower in the CPAP group vs NIV (57% vs. 78%, p = 0.011). Infants in the CPAP group were heavier (birth  (BWT) of 833 vs 724 grams, p = 0.005), more mature (gestation age (GA) 27 vs 25 weeks, p <  0.001) and were extubated significantly earlier (2 vs 8 days, p <  0.001). After adjusting for BWT and GA, NIV continued to be significantly associated with higher incidence of BPD among those extubated on the first day of life (odds ratio 5.9; 95% CI: 1.2-29.1, p = 0.029).This study concludes that, as compared to CPAP, early use of NIV is associated with higher risk of BPD in ELBW infants.

Obesity aggravates symptoms of SLE; however, these symptoms can be improved by  loss through diet therapy and bariatric surgery. However, there are only a few reports regarding the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients with SLE. Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed diabetes mellitus (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in . Her  mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her obesity and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her  decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her  was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial . Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through  loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial  loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659983>The Obesity Paradox Revisited:  Mass Index and Long-Term Outcomes After PCI From a Large Pooled Patient-Level Database.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the relationship between  mass index (BMI) and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous revascularization.In 13 randomized trials 22,922 patients were stratified (in kg/m2) as underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal  (18.5≤BMI&lt;25, used as reference), overweight (25≤BMI&lt;30), and obese (Class I [30≤BMI&lt;35], Class II [35≤BMI&lt;40], or Class III [BMI≥40]). The primary endpoint was all-cause death at 5 years. Secondary endpoints were cardiac and non-cardiac death, target (TLR) and non-target lesion revascularization (NTLR), myocardial infarction (MI), and definite/probable stent thrombosis. Despite adjustment for multiple confounders, overweight and Class I obesity were associated with lower all-cause mortality vs normal  (HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.71-0.96 and HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.69-0.96 respectively); however, non-cardiac death was the major contributor to this effect (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94 for overweight). Conversely, cardiac mortality was higher in severely obese individuals (HR 1.62; 95%CI 1.05-2.51 for Class III obesity). Obesity was associated with higher rates of NTLR (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.04-1.58 for Class II obesity) but not with TLR, MI and stent thrombosis.Moderately increased BMI is associated with improved survival post-PCI, mostly due to lower non-cardiac but not cardiac mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661561>Extensions of the probabilistic ranking metrics of competing treatments in network meta-analysis to reflect clinically important relative differences on many outcomes.</a></h2><p>One of the key features of network meta-analysis is ranking of interventions according to outcomes of interest. Ranking metrics are prone to misinterpretation because of two limitations associated with the current ranking methods. First, differences in relative treatment effects might not be clinically important and this is not reflected in the ranking metrics. Second, there are no established methods to include several health outcomes in the ranking assessments. To address these two issues, we extended the P-score method to allow for multiple outcomes and modified it to measure the mean extent of certainty that a treatment is better than the competing treatments by a certain amount, for example, the minimum clinical important difference. We suggest to present the tradeoff between beneficial and harmful outcomes allowing stakeholders to consider how much adverse effect they are willing to tolerate for specific gains in efficacy. We used a published network of 212 trials comparing 15 antipsychotics and placebo using a random effects network meta-analysis model, focusing on three outcomes; reduction in symptoms of schizophrenia in a standardized scale, all-cause discontinuation, and  gain.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Hen movement in the multi-tier aviary system and on the range was individually monitored using radio frequency identification (RFID). All hens had access to the range from 18 to 22 weeks of age and were exposed to the same management conditions.Whilst only one flock significantly changed its flock uniformity with time, they differed from each other in uniformity and  (P=0.001).Hens spent most of their available time on the lower aviary tier (7.29±0.029 hours/hen/day) and on the upper aviary tier (4.29±0.024 hours/hen/day) while the least amount of time was spent on the range and in the nest boxes, (0.93±0.005 hours/hen/day and 1.48±0.007 hours) respectively (P=0.001).Range use was negatively correlated (r=-0.30) to the time spent on the upper aviary tier and positively correlated (r=0.46) to the time spent on the lower aviary tier (P=0.001). Bivariate analysis revealed that range, upper aviary and lower aviary tier usage had a significant curvilinear association.In conclusion, the study showed that range use was associated to the time hens spent on the different tiers of the aviary system.

We investigated the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and the risk of SGA infants in a Chinese population. We performed a cohort study among 12029 mothers with a pregnancy. This cohort consisted of pregnant women that were: normal- (62.02%), underweight (17.09%), overweight (17.77%) and obese (3.12%). Birth sizes were reduced in the underweight and obese groups compared with the normal- group. Linear regression analysis indicated that birth size was positively associated with BMI in both the underweight and normal- groups.

These results suggest that pre-pregnancy underweight increases the risk of SGA infants, whereas obesity increases the risks of not only LGA infants, but also SGA infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662782>Acute and Subchronic Oral Toxicity of Fermented Green Tea with Aquilariae Lignum in Rodents.</a></h2><p>Green tea is generally considered safe, but there have been concerns regarding side effects relating to the main component, catechins, especially hepatotoxicities. We have previously shown beneficial effects of fermented green tea with Aquilariae Lignum (fGT) via an oral route in diabetic and obese models. Thus, the toxicological safety of fGT was assessed at limited oral doses for a rodent. Mice or rats of both genders were orally administered distilled water as a control and fGT at 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 g/kg. There were no mortalities or gross abnormalities in the fGT groups for 2 weeks following the single oral dose in mice. No fGT-relevant abnormalities were found in postmortem and histopathological examinations, suggesting LD of fGT at more than 2.0 g/kg with no specific target organs. There were also no fGT-relevant mortalities or abnormal signs in the repeated oral dose for 13 weeks in rats. In the fGT groups, no  changes or daily metabolic changes were found, and hematological and serum biochemical ranges were normal. The postmortem and histopathological examinations revealed few fGT-related abnormalities in most of the organs including the liver, although slight lymphoid cell hyperplasia in the lymph node was observed in a few rats with fGT at 2.0 g/kg. This may be secondary to increased immune response to the highest dose because there were no histopathological lesions or organ  changes. It suggests nontoxic safety of fGT at up to 2.0 g/kg, which provides useful information for clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Sol Lee et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658595>Quality of Work Life and Organizational Performance: Workers' Feelings of Contributing, or Not, to the Organization's Productivity.</a></h2><p>This is a pioneering study on the relationship between quality of work life and the employee's perception of their contribution to organizational performance. It unveils the importance of subjective and behavioral components of quality of work life and their influence on the formation of the collaborator's individual desire to contribute to strengthening the organization's productivity. The results obtained indicate that for workers: feeling their supervisors' support through listening to their concerns and by sensing they take them on board; being integrated in a good work environment; and feeling respected both as professionals and as people; positively influence their feeling of contributing to organizational performance. The results are particularly relevant given the increased  of services in the labor market, together with intensified automation and digitalization of collaborators' functions. The findings also contribute to the ongoing debate about the need for more work on the subjective and behavioral components of so-called smart and learning organizations, rather than focusing exclusively on remuneration as the factor stimulating organizational productivity based on the collaborator's contribution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664287>Template-oriented synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanoplates for 3D bone printing.</a></h2><p>The design of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoarchitecture is critical for fabricating artificial bone tissues as it dictates the biochemical and the mechanical properties of the final product. Herein, we incorporated a simple hard-template approach to synthesise single crystal nanoplates of HA. We used the 2D graphitic nitride (g-C3N4) material to prepare an HA sol-gel under hydrothermal conditions. A new HA nanostructure was then formed during the calcination and removal of g-C3N4 at a higher temperature, which finally led to the production of nanoplates (thickness of ∼100 nm) while in lateral dimension the average size was in the micrometre scale. We characterised the synthesised HA nanoplates with XRD, TEM, and HRTEM. The theoretically predicted nanostructure construction based on Wulff's method is in full agreement with the experimental observations. We then prepared different  ratios of HA and polylactic acid (PLA) composites for artificial 3D bone fabrication. The strong interaction between PLA and HA's (110) facet, which was the second most prevalent, resulted in the composite's mechanical robustness. After mechanical testing, an optimum ratio was selected for biological studies and 3D printing. Biological experiments demonstrated that the synthesised composite had excellent viability in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660546>Effects of dietary apple polyphenol supplementation on carcass traits, meat quality, muscle amino acid and fatty acid composition in finishing pigs.</a></h2><p>As health awareness is increasing, consumers have changed their focus with a desire to purchase safer, healthier, and higher quality and nutritional value meat. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dietary apple polyphenol (APP) supplementation in finishing pigs could provide pork with high quality and nutritional value. In the present study, 36 castrated Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire pigs with an average  of 71.25 ± 2.40 kg were randomly divided into three treatments and fed with a basal diet supplemented with 0, 400, or 800 mg kg-1 APPs for 7 weeks. The results showed that dietary 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation not only decreased backfat thickness and abdominal adipose tissue index but also decreased L* (lightness) and b* (yellowness) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. The LD muscle crude protein content, the proportions of essential amino acids, flavor amino acids, and total amino acids, as well as the amino acid transporter (SLC7A1, SLC7A2, SLC7A7, SLC1A2) mRNA levels were increased by 800 mg kg-1 APPs. The proportions of docosahexaenoic acid and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty acid in LD muscle were increased by 400 mg kg-1 APPs. Meanwhile, dietary 400 mg kg-1 and 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation decreased the contents of blood urea nitrogen and total cholesterol, as well as increased the content of inosinic acid in LD muscle. In conclusion, these results suggested that dietary 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation improved the carcass traits, meat color, and meat flavor in finishing pigs. These results also suggested that dietary 400 mg kg-1 and 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation improved the meat nutritional value in finishing pigs. The present study provides effective evidence for the application of APP supplementation for healthy high-quality and nutritional value pork production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663072>Evaluation of balance in young adults with idiopathic scoliosis.</a></h2><p>This study aims to evaluate the relation of scoliosis with coronal and sagittal balance parameters and the effect of postural balancing in young adults with idiopathic scoliosis.Between April 2017 and June 2017, a total of 24 patients (7 males, 24 females; mean age 20.3±2 years; range 17 to 24) who were diagnosed with scoliosis and 65 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (20 males, 45 females; mean age 20.3±1.6 years; range 19 to 25) were included in the study. The Cobb angle, sagittal balance, coronal balance, and truncal shift were measured with radiographs in the patient group. The Biodex Balance System (BBS) was used to assess the general stability index, anterior- posterior and medial-lateral stability index, and fall risk.All balance parameters were significantly worse in the patient group than in the control group (p<0.05). The static balance was mostly associated with sagittal balance, followed by coronal balance. In the patients with left scoliosis, sagittal balance was 93% negative and 67% of the patients gave their  to the back. Coronal balance was negative in 60% of the patients and 93.3% of the patients were weighted to the right side. In 89% of the patients with right scoliosis, sagittal balance was negative and 89% of the patients gave their  to the back. Coronal balance was 44% neutral and 78% of the patients gave their  to the right side.In patients with scoliosis, the static balance is worse than healthy individuals. Static balance is mostly related to sagittal balance and also to coronal balance. While the coronal balance tends to be in the direction of the curve, both right and left scoliosis give more  to the right.Copyright © 2019, Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661671>Leptin and insulin in young adulthood are associated with  in infancy.</a></h2><p>Low  in early infancy is a known risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome in adult life. However, little is known either about developmental programming in subjects of normal birthweight, or about events between the ages which separate early programming and the occurrence of disease at late adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and insulin in young, healthy adults, born with a birth size within the normal range, are influenced by early life growth patterns. In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of metabolic function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their  composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome, was associated with low  at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult  = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial insulin and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) insulin resistance. Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and insulin correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (p<0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low  at age two years and insulin resistance. We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low  in early infancy and increased cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood in heathy subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658379>Population pharmacokinetics of a triple-secured fibrinogen concentrate administered to afibrinogenaemic patients: observed age- and - related differences and consequences for dose adjustment in children.</a></h2><p>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of a triple-secured fibrinogen concentrate (FC) was assessed in patients ≥40 kg by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) over a period of 14 days with multiple blood samples. Limited PK time point assessments in children lead to consideration of using Bayesian estimation for paediatric data. The objectives were (i) to define the population PK of FC in patients with afibrinogenaemia; (ii) to detect age- and -related differences and consequences for dose adjustment.A population PK model was built using plasma fibrinogen activity data collected in 31 patients aged 1 to 48 years who had participated in a single-dose PK study with FC 0.06 g kg .A one-compartment model with allometric scaling accounting for  was found to best describe the kinetics of FC. Addition of age and gender as covariates did not improve the model. Incremental in vivo recovery assessed at the end of infusion with the predicted maximal concentrations was lower, -adjusted clearance was higher, and fibrinogen elimination half-life was shorter in patients <40 kg than patients ≥40 kg. Interpatient variability was similar in both groups.Dosing in patients ≥40 kg based on the previous empirical finding using NCA where FC 1 g kg raises the plasma fibrinogen activity by 23 g L was confirmed. In patients <40 kg, (covering the age range from birth up to about 12 years old) FC 1 g kg raises the plasma fibrinogen by 19 g L . Dosing should be adapted accordingly unless therapy is individualized.This article is protected by copyright.

The presence of a notch significantly increased the prevalence of severe preeclampsia, HELLP-syndrome and oligohydramnios. Also, patients with a bilateral uterine notching had a higher c-section rate along with higher prevalence of SGA and IUGR at screening time.Uterine artery Doppler waveform analysis as well as the assessment of the presence of a notch in the second trimester can be used as a screening method to identify women who will thereafter develop a severe adverse outcome.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

The potential relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and ultrasound-measured renal characteristics has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that exposure to tobacco smoke would be associated with reduced kidney dimensions.This was a cross-sectional study that included all individuals over age 18 at a single site in Mojokerto, Indonesia. A questionnaire was used to assess prior history and environmental exposure, and blinded evaluators performed ultrasound assessments. Six kidney parameters (length, width, and parenchymal thickness of each kidney) were considered as dependent variables, and statistical relationships were assessed using multivariate analysis. Echogenicity was evaluated using a 5-point grading scale described previously.Of the 445 participants assessed, a total of 138 male and 269 female subjects were included in the final analysis. There was a statistically significant association between kidney  and the following independent variables: pack years smoking (p < 0.001), height (p < 0.001),  (p < 0.001), and beginning to smoke at the age of 25 or younger (p < 0.001). There was not a statistically significant association between kidney  and hypertension (p > 0.05) or diabetes (p > 0.05). Echogenicity was similar among all smoking groups.Kidney dimensions were decreased in individuals with increased smoking history. This association is notable, particularly given that statistically significant associations were not observed between renal dimensions and hypertension or diabetes. The null findings using echogenicity are consistent with previous studies. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661511>Histological chorioamnionitis, antenatal steroids, and neonatal outcomes in very low birth  infants: A nationwide study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether some associations between histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) and favorable neonatal outcomes might be linked to those of antenatal steroids (AS) by determining the separate as well as the combined associations of HCA and AS with neonatal outcomes in very low birth  infants (VLBWIs).This was a population-based study of VLBWIs born at 20-33 weeks' gestation between January 2013 and December 2015 from the Korean Neonatal Network. A total of 4652 VLBWIs were enrolled for prevalence study. Of these, 2900 singleton VLBWIs were used for outcome analyses to evaluate individual associations of HCA and AS simultaneously with correction for potential perinatal factors and an interaction term of HCA and AS.The overall prevalence of HCA was 34.9% (1623 VLBWIs). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that HCA was associated with decreased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.91; P = 0.022), AS were associated with reduction in mortality (aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.90; P = 0.014) and neonatal seizure (aOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.86; P = 0.008), and a combination of HCA and AS was associated with remarkably lowered severe intraventricular hemorrhage by interacting with each other (aOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25-0.88; P = 0.019).We suggest that in VLBWIs HCA and AS may be favorable independent factors for neonatal outcome and may also work in synergy for neuroprotection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665763>Risk factors for development of aminoglycoside resistance among gram-negative rods.</a></h2><p>Development of scoring systems to predict the risk of aminoglycoside resistance and to guide therapy is described.Infections due to aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative rods (AR-GNRs) are increasingly common and associated with adverse outcomes; selection of effective initial antibiotic therapy is necessary to reduce adverse consequences and shorten length of stay. To determine risk factors for AR-GNR recovery from culture, cases of GNR infection among patients admitted to 2 institutions in a major academic hospital system during the period 2011-2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Gentamicin and tobramycin resistance (GTR-GNR) and amikacin resistance (AmR-GNR) patterns were analyzed separately. A total of 26,154 GNR isolates from 12,516 patients were analyzed, 6,699 of which were GTR, and 2,467 of which were AmR.In multivariate analysis, risk factors for GTR-GNR were presence of  loss, admission from another medical or long-term care facility, a hemoglobin level of <11 g/dL, receipt of any carbapenem in the prior 30 days, and receipt of any fluoroquinolone in the prior 30 days (C statistic, 0.63). Risk factors for AmR-GNR were diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, male gender, admission from another medical or long-term care facility, ventilation at any point prior to culture during the index hospitalization, receipt of any carbapenem in the prior 30 days, and receipt of any anti-MRSA agent in the prior 30 days (C statistic, 0.74). Multinomial and ordinal models demonstrated that the risk factors for the 2 resistance patterns differed significantly.A scoring system derived from the developed risk prediction models can be applied by providers to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy for treatment of GNR infections.© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on  composition.To compare the long-term effects of  loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of  composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum Metabolic Health and  Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with  mass index (calculated as  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual  per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole- lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were , thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] , 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD]  mass index, 34.4 [2.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more  (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -5.1 kg), lost more whole- lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole- lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total  loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole- fat mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole- lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater  and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe energy restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659893>Flexible Multifunctional Porous Nanofibrous Membranes for High-Efficiency Air Filtration.</a></h2><p>Particulate matters (PMs) discharged along with the rapid industrialization and urbanization hazardously threaten ecosystems and human health. Membrane-based filtration technology has been proved to be an effective approach to capture PMs from the polluted air. However, the fabrication of filtration membranes with excellent reusability and antibacterial activity has rarely been reported. Herein, the flexible multifunctional porous nanofibrous membranes were fabricated by embedding Ag nanoparticles into the electrospun porous SiO2-TiO2 nanofibers via an impregnation method, which integrated the abilities of PM filtration and antibacterial performance. Compared with the reported air filters, the resultant membrane (Ag@STPNM) with high surface polarity and the porous structure possessed the low density, high removal efficiency, and small pressure drop. For instance, the removal efficiency and the pressure drop of Ag@STPNM with basis  of only 3.9 g·m-2 for PM2.5 reached to 98.84% and 59 Pa, respectively. In terms of the excellent thermal stability of Ag@STPNM, the adsorbed PMs could be removed simply by a calcination process. The filtration performance of Ag@STPNM kept stable during five purification-regeneration cycles, and the long-time filtration for 12 h, exhibiting excellent recyclability and durability. Furthermore, the embedded Ag nanoparticles could achieve the effective resistance to the breeding of bacteria on Ag@STPNM, giving the bacteriostatic rate of 95.8%. Therefore, Ag@STPNM holds promising potentials as a highly efficient, reusable, and antibacterial air filter in the practical purification of indoor environment or personal air.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659677>Disseminated Emergomyces pasteurianus Infection in India: A Case Report and a Review.</a></h2><p>We report here a case of disseminated Emergomyces pasteurianus infection from India in a patient with AIDS.

For a quantitative trait, an extreme case-control study design may improve the power and reduce the cost of variant calling. We investigated the performance of extreme study design when various proportions of samples are selected from the tails of phenotype distribution. Using simulations, we show that when risk genotypes become rare in the population and effect size is relatively small, it is beneficial to carry out an extreme sampling study. In particular, the number of selected cases and controls can even be unbalanced such that power is further increased, compared with a balanced selection. Our application to two data sets: methadone dose data and yearling  data, demonstrated that similar results for full data analysis can be obtained using extreme sampling with only a fraction of the data. Using power analysis with simulated data and an experimental data application, we conclude that when full data is unavailable due to restricted budget, it is rewarding to employ an extreme sampling design in the sense that there can be immense cost reductions and qualitatively similar power as in the full data analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661672>Elucidating the role of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in metabolic PCOS models.</a></h2><p>PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women; associated with obesity and insulin resistance (IR). IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more , had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with insulin/AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic inflammation, which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663298>Dietary intake of people with dementia on acute hospital wards.</a></h2><p>The aim of this service evaluation was to understand the factors affecting meal provision on a dementia ward and assess whether meals-based dietary intake met estimated mean energy requirement and reference nutrient intake (RNI). A mixed-methods approach was adopted: 1. Mapping the dietary intake for a cohort ( n =6) of inpatients with advanced dementia over a period of four consecutive days. 2. Semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of the professionals ( n =5) involved. Two of the participants' four-day mean intakes did not meet their estimated energy requirement based on meal provision. All participants apart from one met the target of 0.75g of protein per kg  per day for the general population. Several of the nutrients consumed were at or exceeded the RNI for adults of this age, although participants' mean dietary vitamin D intake was substantially below the RNI for the general population. The themes included communication, time pressure and the continuity of service provision. The meals provided were nutritionally sound. Individuals' nutritional status was improved through staff supporting them with eating. The contribution of drinks and snacks to nutrient intake warrants further exploration. Effective communication between food providers and ward areas is important. Mealtimes should reflect patient need - for example, having the main meal in the evening and a lighter option at lunch. This does not clash with the benefits of a flexible breakfast time.© 2019 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

The compositional analysis of heavy oil products has become a key step in conversion processes, but the complexity of these oil matrices tends to increase with their boiling point. In this study, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LCxLC) coupled to inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) is considered with a view to meet new requirements and to bring additional information regarding the species present in these matrices. In search for a high degree of orthogonality, two separation techniques involving two different retention mechanisms were evaluated: Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC). In SEC, the analytes are separated according to their molecular  while according to their hydrophobicity in RPLC. The separation power of both individual separation techniques was first evaluated. Off-line and on-line LCxLC were compared on the basis of an optimization approach. It is shown that off-line SECxRPLC can provide, for the same analysis time of 150 min, a higher peak capacity (2600 vs 1700) than on-line RPLCxSEC while a similar dilution factor (close to 30) but also requires far fewer fractions to be analyzed (12 vs 400). Asphaltenes which constitute the heaviest fraction of crude oils (obtained from petroleum industry) were analyzed by the developed off-line SECxRPLC method.

Their physicochemical properties were studied in detail by standard techniques like low angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption studies, and thermogravimetric-differential thermal (TG-DTA) analysis and spectral studies like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis (UV-Visible-DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD patterns prove that the material's phase identity is the same irrespective of metal incorporation. SEM displayed the uniform shape and size of the nanoparticles. The presence of elements such as Ti, V, Pd, Si and O in respective materials is revealed using the EDXS analysis. Around 30%  loss arose upon calcination from room temperature to 800 °C. BET surface area analysis presented that the parent materials have a high surface area (1024 m2 g-1) which was reduced upon metal incorporation. FT-IR analysis exhibited the framework vibrations of the synthesised materials. UV-Visible-DRS analysis indicated the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions. The multivalent-metal-ion-functionalized mesoporous materials showed significant enhancement in potent antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The antimicrobial activity is because of its low lipophilicity, which no longer allows the materials to enter via the lipid membrane. Thus, the new materials neither obstruct the metal-binding sites nor inhibit the growth of microbe enzymes. Further, the results show that the transition metal ion-containing mesoporous materials possessing good anticancer activity arising from their excessive surface area to volume ratio provided appropriate association with a tumour cell due to the direct penetration of mesoporous materials into the cell wall, causing membrane damage and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661458>Modelling PAHs removal in activated sludge process: effect of disintegration.</a></h2><p>The removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in activated sludge was evaluated using two laboratory-scale bioreactors, coupled or not with a disintegration system (sonication). Mass balances performed on each system underlined that PAHs removal was significantly improved after sludge disintegration, especially for the higher molecular  PAHs studied, which tended to adsorb to suspended matter. A model was developed in order to study the effect of sludge disintegration on the content of dissolved and colloidal matter (DCM), and to predict the potential impacts on PAHs availability and degradation. Results showed that this new model was efficient for capturing apparent degradation improvement trends and for discriminating between the involved mechanisms. This study showed that DCM content increased after sludge disintegration, and proved to be the main driver for improving PAHs apparent degradation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664440>Very Low-Energy Diets-Opportunity for Greater  Loss, but Risk of Bone Loss.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660381>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Conventional-Dose vs Triple-Dose Oseltamivir in Severely Immunocompromised Children With Influenza.</a></h2><p>This randomized phase 1b study evaluated the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of conventional-dose (30-75 mg twice daily [BID]) vs triple-dose (90-225 mg BID; -adjusted) oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in severely immunocompromised children <13 years.

We aimed to assess the potential association between SO and reduced resting energy expenditure (REE). composition and REE were measured using a bioimpedance analyser (Tanita BC-418) and Indirect Calorimeter (Vmax Encore 229) respectively in 89 adults with overweight or obesity of both genders, referred to the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at Beirut Arab University (Lebanon). Participants were then categorized as having SO or not.Thirty-nine of the 89 participants met the criteria for SO (43.8%), and these participants displayed a significantly lower REE per unit  than those in the group without SO (19.02 ± 2.26 vs 20.87 ± 2.77; p = 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that the presence of SO decreases REE by 1.557 kcal/day for each kg of  (β = -1.557; CI = -0.261 ¬- (-0.503); p = 0.004), after adjusting for age and gender.SO appears to be present in a high proportion of treatment-seeking adults with overweight or obesity of both genders, and it seems to be associated with a reduced REE, compared with those without SO.

In many cases, the relationship between the chemical structure of the gelator and the emergent hydrogel properties is poorly understood. As a result, empirical screening strategies instead of rational design approaches are often relied upon to tune the emergent properties of the gels. Herein, we describe a novel strategy to identify improved phenylalanine (Phe) derived gelators using a focused empirical approach. Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protected Phe derivatives are a privileged class of gelators that spontaneously self-assemble into fibrils that entangle to form a hydrogel network upon dissolution into water. However, the Fmoc group has been shown to have toxicity drawbacks for potential biological applications, requiring the identification of new N-terminal modifications that promote efficient self-assembly but lack the shortcomings of the Fmoc group. We previously discovered that fibrils in Fmoc-p-nitrophenylalanine (Fmoc-4-NO-Phe) hydrogels transition to crystalline microtubes after several hours by a mechanism that involves the hierarchical assembly and fusion of the hydrogel fibrils. We hypothesized that this hierarchical crystallization behavior could form the basis of a screening approach to identify alternative N-terminal functional groups to replace Fmoc in Phe-derived LMW gelators. Specifically, screening N-terminal modifying groups for 4-NO-Phe that stabilize the hydrogel state by preventing subsequent hierarchical crystallization would facilitate empirical identification of functional Fmoc replacements. To test this approach, we screened a small series of 4-NO-Phe derivatives with various N-terminal modifying groups to determine if any provided stable LMW supramolecular hydrogels. All but one of the 4-NO-Phe derivatives assembled into crystalline forms. Only the 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (1-Nap) 4-NO-Phe derivative self-assembled into a stable hydrogel network. Additional Phe derivatives were modified by N-terminal 1-Nap-Phe groups to confirm the general potential of 1-Nap as a suitable replacement for Fmoc, and all derivatives formed stable hydrogels under similar conditions to their Fmoc-Phe counterparts. These results illustrate the potential of this approach to identify next-generation Phe-derived LMW gelators with improved emergent properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660636>Evaluation of the inflammatory response to two intra-articular hyaluronic acid formulations in normal equine joints.</a></h2><p>Intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) is commonly used to treat equine arthritis. Inflammatory response or "joint flare" is a recognized potential side effect. However, the incidence and severity of inflammation following IA HA injection in horses is not well documented. This study compared the effects of two IA HA formulations of different molecular  (MW) and a saline control on clinical signs and synovial fluid markers of inflammation in normal equine joints. Eight adult horses each had three healthy fetlock joints randomly assigned to treatment with either 1.4 mega Dalton HA, 0.8 mega Dalton HA or saline control once weekly for three weeks. Clinical evaluation and synovial fluid analysis were performed by blinded assessors. Outcomes of interest were lameness score, joint effusion score and synovial fluid white cell count and differential, total protein, viscosity and serum amyloid A. Joints injected with HA developed significant mild-to-moderate inflammatory responses often associated with lameness and joint effusion compared with saline control joints. The higher MW HA formulation elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response than the lower MW HA after the first injection. In HA injected joints, viscosity remained poor for the entire study. Both IA HA formulations in this study induced an inflammatory response in healthy equine joints. This may have implications for the use of HA in equine joints. The findings in this study are limited to the two HA formulations used. Further investigation of different HA formulations and the use of HA in normal and arthritic equine joints is warranted.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659712>Using Chou's General Pseudo Amino Acid Composition to Classify Laccases from Bacterial and Fungal Sources via Chou's Five-Step Rule.</a></h2><p>Laccases are a group of enzymes with a critical activity in the degradation process of both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. These enzymes present in a diverse array of species, including fungi and bacteria. Since this enzyme is in the market for different usages from industry to medicine, having a better knowledge of its structures and properties from diverse sources will be useful to select the most appropriate candidate for different purposes. In the current study, sequence- and structure-based characteristics of these enzymes from fungi and bacteria, including pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), physicochemical characteristics, and their secondary structures, are being compared and classified. Autodock 4 software was used for docking analysis between these laccases and some phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. The results indicated that features including molecular , aliphatic, extinction coefficient, and random coil percentage of these protein groups present high degrees of diversity in most cases. Categorization of these enzymes by the notion of PseAAC, showed over 96% accuracy. The binding free energy between fungal laccases and their substrates showed to be considerably higher than those of bacterial ones. According to the outcomes of the current study, data mining methods by using different machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks, could provide valuable information for a fair comparison between fungal and bacterial laccases. These results also suggested an association between efficacy and physicochemical features of laccase enzymes from different sources.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658593>The Influence of Post Weld Heat Treatment Precipitation on Duplex Stainless Steels Weld Overlay towards Pitting Corrosion.</a></h2><p>Duplex stainless steels (DSSs) are complex materials and they have been widely used in the marine environment and gas industries, primarily offering a better resistance of pitting corrosion and good mechanical properties. In the present work, the effects of heat treatment on duplex stainless steel (DSS) weld overlay samples that were heat treated at three different temperatures, namely 350 °C, 650 °C, and 1050 °C, and followed by air cooling and water quenching were studied. Stress relief temperature at 650 °C had induced sigma phase precipitation in between delta ferrite and austenite (δ/γ) grain boundaries, resulting in the loss of corrosion resistance in the weld metal. Interestingly, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) test samples that were reheated to solution annealing temperature had shown no  loss. The ferrite count determination in the region of weld metal overlay increased at hydrogen relief and decreased at stress relief temperatures due to slow cooling, which is more favorable to austenite formation. The amount of ferrite in the weld metals was significantly reduced with the increment of solution anneal temperature to 1050 °C because of sufficient time for the formation of austenite and giving optimum equilibrium fraction in the welds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660971>Down-regulation of long non-coding RNA SNHG14 protects against acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide through microRNA-34c-3p-dependent inhibition of WISP1.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has shown the important roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate the potential role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI.Expression of SNHG14, microRNA-34c-3p (miR-34c-3p) and Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) in LPS-exposed mouse alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and lung tissues from mice with LPS-induced ALI was determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The interactions among SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1 were analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Using gain-of-function or loss-of-function approaches, the contents of proinflammatory proteins were determined and MH-S cell viability was assessed to evaluate the in vitro functions of SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1, and wet/dry  ratio and proinflammatory proteins in lung tissues were determined to assess their in vivo effects.SNHG14 and WISP1 expression was increased, while miR-34c-3p was decreased in ALI models. SNHG14 bound to miR-34c-3p, resulting in impaired miR-34c-3p-dependent down-regulation of WISP1. Both SNHG14 silencing and miR-34c-3p over-expression reduced the levels of proinflammatory proteins IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 and inhibited MH-S cell viability. SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression decreased the wet/dry  ratio in lung tissues from ALI mice. The reductions induced by SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression were rescued by WISP1 over-expression.This study demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG14 silencing alleviated inflammation in LPS-induced ALI through miR-34c-3p-mediated inhibition of WISP1. Our findings suggest that lncRNA SNHG14 may serve as a therapeutic target for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664915>'Weighty issues' in GP-led antenatal care: a qualitative study.</a></h2><p>Approximately 50% of women gain  in excess of gestational  gain (GWG) recommendations during pregnancy leading to adverse maternal and foetal outcomes and the perpetuation of the cycle of obesity. Antenatal care provided by a general practitioner (GP) in the primary care setting is an important model of care, particularly for women in regional areas where rates of overweight and obesity are highest. The aim of this study is to explore GPs' perceptions and experiences of implementing GWG recommendations in GP-led antenatal care.A qualitative exploratory approach recorded GPs' experiences and insights regarding the application of GWG recommendations in practice. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews informed by the revised Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Deductive thematic analysis grouped coded text into TDF domains from which main themes were generated.Twenty GPs (13 female, 7 male) from metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia participated. Codes related to at least one of 11 TDF domains. Five main themes were apparent: 1) Despite low awareness of guidelines, GWG advice is provided; 2) 'I should do this more'; 3) Lack of everyday resources; 4) Working 'against the odds' at times; and 5) Optimism and reality. GPs were aware of the importance of optimal GWG however, other pregnancy-related issues are given precedence during consultations. Enablers for the implementation of GWG guidelines were practitioner-based and included GPs' strong sense of their professional role to provide advice, and ongoing and trusting relationships with women throughout pregnancy. Barriers were mostly health system-based with limited time, remuneration, and restrictive referral pathways being limiting factors.There is a need to support GPs to provide GWG advice in accordance with current national guidelines. Solutions potentially lie in strategies that promote the effective dissemination and uptake of guidelines, and changes to policy and funding within the health-system so that longer GP-led antenatal care consultations are remunerated and referrals to allied health are accessible to women who require additional support to optimise GWG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664055>Late-Onset Sepsis as a Risk Factor for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Extremely Low Birth  Infants: A Nationwide Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to determine the effect of late-onset sepsis (LOS) on the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely low birth  (ELBW) infants. A prospective cohort study was performed using data collected from 64 centres registered in the Korean national registry. LOS was defined as a positive blood culture and antibiotics treatment after 72 hours of life and prior to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Data on the causative organisms were collected and analysed for respiratory outcomes. Among the 1,434 ELBW infants who survived to 36 weeks PMA, 481 (34%) developed LOS caused by bacteria (n = 405), fungi (n = 28), or both (n = 48). The incidence of BPD was significantly associated with LOS in both the entire cohort and the propensity score-matched cohort. Two or more LOS episodes were a risk factor for BPD. The impact of multiple episodes of LOS on BPD was prominent in infants who received mechanical ventilation for two weeks or less. The estimated odds ratios for BPD and severe BPD were greater with fungal LOS than with bacterial LOS. In conclusion, LOS, particularly complicated by multiple episodes and/or fungi, was a risk factor for BPD in ELBW infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h2><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), , feces  and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress.

Data are drawn from the Growing Up in Ireland suites of studies. Parents rated their child's personality at age 13, and trained staff measured  and height at ages 13 and 17 ( = 4962). Logistic regression was used to predict risk of incident obesity and obesity remission between ages 13 and 17.  Among children who were not in the obesity category at age 13, higher Conscientiousness was associated with lower risk of moving into the obesity category by age 17, and, among children with obesity at age 13, Conscientiousness was associated with greater likelihood of moving to the nonobesity category by age 17. These associations were independent of sociodemographic characteristics, parent  mass index, and were similar across gender. The other five-factor model personality traits were unrelated to  outcomes.

Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in  loss and in long term  maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid  loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity.

A marked decrease in blood glucose levels occurs before  loss; however, key molecules that improve glycemic profile remain largely unknown. Using a murine RYGB surgery model, we performed multi-organ proteomics and bioinformatics to monitor the proteins and molecular pathways that change in this early glycemic response. Multiplexed proteomic kinetics data analysis revealed that the Roux limb, biliopancreatic limb, liver and pancreas each exhibited unique temporal and molecular responses to the RYGB surgery. In addition, protein-protein network analysis indicated that the changes to the microbial environment in the intestine may play a crucial role in the beneficial effects of RYGB surgery. Furthermore, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (Igfbp7) was identified as an early induced protein in the Roux limb. Known secretory properties of Igfbp7 prompted us to further investigate its role as a remote organ regulator of glucose metabolism. Igfbp7 overexpression decreased blood glucose levels in diet-induced obese mice, and attenuated gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver. Secreted Igfbp7 appeared to mediate these beneficial effects. These results demonstrate that organs responded differentially to RYGB surgery, and indicate Igfbp7 may play an important role in improving blood glucose levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658816>Racial/Ethnic Differences in Diet Quality and Eating Habits Among WIC Pregnant Women: Implications for Policy and Practice.</a></h2><p>One of the major federal food assistance programs, the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), serves approximately 1.5 million low-income pregnant women per year; however, limited information is available on their dietary habits. This is critical because low-income women are at higher risk of gaining excess  during pregnancy. Thus, the study objectives were to (1) determine the overall diet quality of WIC pregnant women and (2) examine diet quality and eating behaviors by race/ethnicity and other sociodemographics.This was a cross-sectional study.One of the 3 WIC offices in a north-central county in North Carolina, USA.Pregnant women (n = 198) in the second trimester.Interviews included sociodemographics, food security, diet, and eating behaviors.

The bacterial microbiome inside the host is vital to host health and growth performance. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible associations of the intestinal microbiome with the pre-weaned  gain in intensive pig production. In this study, several anatomical sites (jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) were examined for bacterial microbiome structure using 16S rRNA V4-V5 region sequencing with Illumina Miseq. The results showed that the microbial richness (estimated by Chao1 index) in jejunum was positively correlated with the pre-weaned  gain. This study also revealed that the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in colon were the  gaining-related phyla; while the Selenomonas and Moraxella in ileum and the Lactobacillus in both cecum and colon were the  gaining-related genera for the pre-weaned piglets in intensive pig prodution. Several intra-microbial interactions within commensal microbiome correlated with the pre-weaned  gain were excavated, as well.

We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multi-site learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions.The MSL model attains an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0:690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0:914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and 5% statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0:646 and average correlation of 0:871.We show that a neural network can be efficiently trained on data from two physically remote sites without consolidating patient data to a single location. The resulting network improves model generalization and achieves higher average DSCs on external datasets than neural networks trained on data from a single source.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659705>Outcomes of mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children.</a></h2><p>We examined the outcomes following mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children and identified the predictors for mortality and reoperation.Medical records from 49 children who underwent mitral valve replacement between 1982 and 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Median age and  at initial mitral valve replacement were 2.4 years and 9.7 kg, respectively. The median follow-up was 13 years. Surgical results and predictors for mortality and reoperation were investigated.There was no operative mortality; eight late deaths occurred. The actuarial survival rates were 89.5%, 84.2%, and 80.7% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, after initial mitral valve replacement. The actuarial freedom rates from related complications were 89.5%, 78.3%, and 70.7% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Nineteen patients required 1st re-mitral valve replacement at a median of 5.9 years; six of these 19 required 2nd re-mitral valve replacement at a median of 8.9 years after 1st re-MVR. The actuarial freedom rates from re-mitral valve replacement were 86.0%, 56.8%, and 44.2% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. No predictor for death was determined; however, the predictor for re-mitral valve replacement was initial valve diameter less than 19 mm.Survival outcomes among children after mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in biventricular heart were satisfactory. However, complications, including re-mitral valve replacement, were frequent and the predictor was of a small prosthesis size.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659077>Indirect Evidence of Circulating Parasite Hapten Immune Complexes in Visceral Leishmaniasis.</a></h2><p>Hypergammaglobulinemia is present in visceral leishmaniasis (VL), inducing the formation of immune complexes (ICs), which interferes in conventional serology. Parasitic haptens block antibodies, making it difficult to identify and detect them. ICs could be determined indirectly by acid dissociative ELISA (DE) seroconversion in natural and experimental VL.We determined the frequency of samples that seroconverted in DE or presented a 10% increase in DE (ΔDE) in 3 types of VLs-hamster, canine, and human samples-with larger antigen determination by direct antigen capture in experimental samples.The ΔDE frequency is increased in all VL models: human (34%), canine (27%), and hamster (25%) samples. Seroconversion was present in hamster (14%), dog (1%), and human (6%) samples. During experimental infection, higher frequencies (28%) of circulating antigens were observed at the 30th day, associated with higher ΔDE (47%) and seroconversion (22%), with lower frequencies in other periods.The frequency of ΔED and seroconversion samples found in natural and experimental infection suggests that specific antibodies can be blocked by low molecular  antigens that interfere qualitatively (seroconversion) or quantitatively (ΔDE) in serology. Several antigen types may be involved, as high molecular  proteins and low molecular  glycoconjugates. The higher frequency of those indirect demonstrations of antibody-blocking antigen or haptens that could be acid-removed in VL has implications for the development of assays for detection of circulating or antibody-bound 1- to 3-kDa antigens, which could interfere in diagnosis and also in the immune response of the host.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661891>Molecular Links between Central Obesity and Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p> Worldwide, breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women, in regard to incidence and mortality. In recent years, the negative role of obesity during BC development and progression has been made abundantly clear in several studies. However, the distribution of  fat may be more important to analyze than the overall . In our review of literature, we reported some key findings regarding the role of obesity in BC development, but focused more on central adiposity. Firstly, the adipose microenvironment in obese people bears many similarities with the tumor microenvironment, in respect to associated cellular composition, chronic low-grade inflammation, and high ratio of reactive oxygen species to antioxidants. Secondly, the adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ, which in obese people produces a high level of tumor-promoting hormones, such as leptin and estrogen, and a low level of the tumor suppressor hormone, adiponectin. As follows, in BC this leads to the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways: NFκB, JAK, STAT3, AKT. Moreover, overall obesity, but especially central obesity, promotes a systemic and local low grade chronic inflammation that further stimulates the increase of tumor-promoting oxidative stress. Lastly, there is a constant exchange of information between BC cells and adipocytes, mediated especially by extracellular vesicles, and which changes the transcription profile of both cell types to an oncogenic one with the help of regulatory non-coding RNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664725>Influence of administration of antimicrobial medications after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy on surgical site infections: A retrospective study of 308 dogs.</a></h2><p>To determine the influence of prophylactic administration of oral antimicrobial medications after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) on surgical site infections (SSI) and antimicrobial-resistant infections.Retrospective study.Dogs treated with unilateral TPLO (n = 308) between January 2013 and December 2015.Medical records were reviewed for signalment, surgically treated limb, duration of surgery and anesthesia, postoperative administration of antimicrobial medications, antibiotic agent, surgeon, and development of SSI. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, simple linear regression, analysis of variance, Fisher's protected least significant difference, and χ testing.Data were collected from records of 31 dogs that did not receive antimicrobial medications and 277 dogs that did receive oral antimicrobial medications for 14 days after TPLO. Superficial incisional SSI was detected in two of 31 dogs that did not receive antimicrobial medications and in 48 of 277 dogs that did receive antimicrobial medications (P = .1194). Deep incisional SSI occurred in two of 31 dogs that did not receive antimicrobial medications and in 27 of 277 dogs that did receive antimicrobial medications (P = .5513). Antibiotic-resistant deep incisional SSI occurred in two of 31 dogs that did not receive antimicrobial medications and in 18 of 277 dogs that did receive antimicrobial medications (P = .9920).  correlated with deep incisional SSI and resistant infections. Prolonged duration of surgery and anesthesia were associated with superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and antibiotic resistance. Surgeons influenced deep incisional SSI.Previously reported predisposing factors for infection were confirmed, but postoperative administration of antimicrobial medications was not protective against SSI nor did it predispose to antibiotic resistance in our clinical setting.This study does not provide evidence to support administration of prophylactic oral antimicrobial medications after unilateral TPLO.© 2019 The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664902>Analysis of the fecal microbiota of fast- and slow-growing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Diverse microbial communities colonizing the intestine of fish contribute to their growth, digestion, nutrition, and immune function. We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut microbiota of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiota can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut microbiota is associated with fish growth rate (). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. Microbiota diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the microbiota profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut microbiota. Although the microbiota was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659466>Trends in age- and sex-adjusted  mass index and the prevalence of malnutrition in children with cancer over 42 months after diagnosis: a single-center cohort study.</a></h2><p>The adequate nutritional status of pediatric cancer patients is particularly important to enable them to cope with the demands of the disease and its treatment and to maintain normal growth. Malnutrition and obesity have both been associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity. We investigated trends in the age- and sex-adjusted  mass index (ISO-BMI) and the prevalence of malnutrition in a Finnish cohort of 139 consecutive children receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with a follow-up period of 42 months after diagnosis. In total, 28% (39/139) of the patients experienced malnutrition (ISO-BMI < 17 or > 10%  loss), and 12% (16/139) had a nasogastric tube or underwent gastrostomy. Patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (5/10), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (5/13), or solid tumors (13/31) most frequently suffered from malnutrition. There was a significant increase in the ISO-BMI of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (+ 2.1 kg/m) and lymphomas (+ 2.4 kg/m) during the first 6 months, and the ISO-BMI of patients with ALL remained higher at 42 months compared to baseline (+ 1.9 kg/m).Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of malnutrition in Finnish pediatric cancer patients is comparable to that reported in other populations. The nutritional status of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, CNS tumors, or solid tumors should be monitored with extra care to facilitate early intervention in the case of impending malnutrition. What is known: • Both malnutrition and obesity are associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity in pediatric cancer patients. What is new: • Overall, 28 % of Finnish children receiving chemotherapy for cancer suffer from malnutrition during the first 42 months following the initial cancer diagnosis. • ISO-BMI curves from initial diagnosis to 42 months after diagnosis are provided for patients with different types of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662816>Maternal Diet-Induced Obesity Compromises Oxidative Stress Status and Angiogenesis in the Porcine Placenta by Upregulating Nox2 Expression.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity is associated with placental oxidative stress. However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt obesity model was developed by exposure to different energy diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low-energy group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium-energy group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high-energy group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal  and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher  and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth  compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). Our findings suggest that maternal high-energy diet-induced obesity increases placental oxidative stress and decreases placental angiogenesis possibly through the upregulation of Nox2.Copyright © 2019 Chengjun Hu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659843>Fungal isolate and crop cultivar influence the beneficial effects of root inoculation with entomopathogenic fungi in strawberry.</a></h2><p>Root inoculations of crop plants with beneficial fungi constitute a promising strategy for growth promotion and control of above-ground pests and diseases. Here, strawberry roots (cultivar 'Albion' and 'Pircinque') were inoculated with 25 different Brazilian entomopathogenic fungal isolates of three genera and the effects on Tetranychus urticae oviposition and plant growth were evaluated in greenhouse experiments.Reductions in the number of T. urticae eggs compared to control treatments were observed on both cultivars inoculated with almost all isolates. For the cultivar 'Albion', Metarhizium anisopliae (ESALQ 1604, ESALQ 1669), M. robertsii (ESALQ 1622, ESALQ 1635), Metarhizium sp. Indet. (ESALQ 1684), and Beauveria bassiana (ESALQ 3323) increased dry  of roots and leaves, and fruit yield, while M. robertsii (ESALQ 1634), and Metarhizium sp. Indet. (ESALQ 1637) and (ESALQ 1636) enhanced fruit yield and dry  of leaves, respectively. For the cultivar 'Pircinque', M. anisopliae (ESALQ 1669) was the only isolate observed to increase dry  of roots.The results suggest that inoculation of strawberry roots with entomopathogenic fungi may be an innovative strategy for pest management aboveground. Further, these inoculations may also stimulate plant growth and strawberry production, but the effects depend on fungal strains and crop cultivar. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this study was to determine the association with disease activity and intestinal permeability.Uc.261 level in colon mucosa and Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) were evaluated in 20 active CD patients. Uc.261 expression and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were determined in Caco2 and T84 cells treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. , disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological index (HI), intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran, uc.261, and tight junction proteins (TJPs) levels were evaluated in BALB/C mice treated with saline enema, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)/ethanol enema, and anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody injection, respectively.Uc.261 expression was overexpressed in CD patients, TNF-α treated cells, and colitis mice. Uc.261 expression was positively correlated with HBI ( = 0.582,  = 0.007) in CD patients, and positively correlated with TNF-α concentration and negatively correlated TEER in Caco2 and T84 cells (all  < 0.05). Furthermore, uc.261 was positively correlated with DAI ( = 0.824,  = 0.008), HI ( = 0.672,  = 0.021), and intestinal permeability ( = 0.636,  = 0.012), while negatively correlated with  ( = -0.574,  = 0.035), colon length ( = -0.866,  = 0.017), and TJP expression (all  < 0.05) in colitis mice.Uc.261 expression was closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in CD.
