<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27532319>Characterizing the Size and Composition of Saposin A Lipoprotein Picodiscs.</a></h1><p>Saposin A (SapA) lipoprotein discs, also known as picodiscs (PDs), represent an attractive method to solubilize glycolipids for protein interaction studies in aqueous solution. Recent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data suggest that the size and composition of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)-containing PDs at neutral pH differs from those of N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide determined by X-ray crystallography. Using high-resolution ESI-MS, multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the composition, heterogeneity, and structure of POPC-PDs in aqueous ammonium acetate solutions at pH 4.8 and 6.8 were investigated. The ESI-MS and MALLS data revealed that POPC-PDs consist predominantly of (SapA dimer + iPOPC) complexes, with i = 23-29, and have an average molecular weight (MW) of 38.2 ± 3.3 kDa at pH 4.8. In contrast, in freshly prepared solutions at pH 6.8, POPC-PDs are composed predominantly of (SapA tetramer + iPOPC) complexes, with i = 37-60, with an average MW of 68.0 ± 2.7 kDa. However, the (SapA tetramer + iPOPC) complexes are unstable at neutral pH and convert, over a period of hours, to (SapA trimer + iPOPC) complexes, with i = 29-36, with an average MW of 51.1 ± 2.9 kDa. The results of molecular modeling suggest spheroidal structures for the (SapA dimer + iPOPC), (SapA trimer + iPOPC), and (SapA tetramer + iPOPC) complexes in solution. Comparison of measured collision cross sections (Ω) with values calculated for gaseous (SapA dimer + 26POPC), (SapA trimer + 33POPC), and (SapA tetramer + 42POPC) ions produced from modeling suggests that the solution structures are largely preserved in the gas phase, although the lipids do not maintain regular bilayer orientations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25990616>Selective Oxidation of 1,6-Hexanediol to 6-Hydroxycaproic Acid over Reusable Hydrotalcite-Supported Au-Pd Bimetallic Catalysts.</a></h1><p>Selective oxidation of 1,6-hexanediol into 6-hydroxycaproic acid was achieved over hydrotalcite-supported Au-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles as heterogeneous catalyst using aqueous H2 O2 . N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (DDAO) was used as an efficient capping agent. Spectroscopic analyses by UV/Vis, TEM, XPS, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggested that interactions between gold and palladium atoms are responsible for the high activity of the reusable Au40 Pd60 -DDAO/HT catalyst.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Regardless of the presence of oil, all C(12)E(10)- and C(12)AO-containing systems were toxic at concentrations around or below their critical aggregation concentrations (as determined by surface tension measurements), suggesting that surfactant toxicity was due to the disruption caused by the partitioning of monomeric surfactant into the cell membrane. Systems prepared from C(18:1)E(10) alone or in combination with a low-molecular-weight oil, such as ethyl butyrate or tributyrin, were toxic above their critical aggregation concentration. In contrast, systems prepared from C(18:1)E(10) in combination with a high-molecular-volume oil (e.g., ethyl oleate, Miglyol 812, or soybean oil) were toxic only at concentrations significantly greater than their critical aggregation concentration, suggesting that in these cases surfactant toxicity was mediated by the aggregated form of the surfactant solubilizing components of the cell membrane. In the C(18:1)E(10)-stabilized system, it is proposed that toxicity was significantly reduced on incorporation of high-molecular-volume oils because these oils cause formation of a distinct oil core in the aggregates that leads to a reduction in the ability of the system to solubilize components of the cell membrane.Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 92:859-868, 2003</p></html>
