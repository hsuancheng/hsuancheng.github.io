Namely, same-day isolated murine DNA was compared to samples stored for 1 month in air at ambient temperature, with or without preservative buffers (i.e. EDTA and lysis buffer), different temperatures (i.e. 4 °C, - 20 °C, and - 80 °C), and hypoxic conditions.Only storage in lysis buffer significantly reduced DNA content, yet without integrity loss. Storage in EDTA affected alpha diversity the most, which was also reflected in cluster separation. Distinct changes were also seen in the phyla and bacterial species abundance per storage strategy. Metabolic function analysis showed 22 pathways not significantly affected by storage conditions, whereas the  metabolism pathway was significantly changed in all strategies except by EDTA.Each long-term storage strategy introduced a unique post-collection bias, which is important to take into account when interpreting data.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176994>Two-Week Aflibercept or Erlotinib Administration Does Not Induce Changes in Intestinal Morphology in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats But Aflibercept Affects Serum and Urine Metabolic Profiles.</a></h1><p>Gastrointestinal toxicity is a frequently observed adverse event during cancer treatment with traditional chemotherapeutics. Currently, traditional chemotherapeutics are often combined with targeted biologic agents. These biologics, however, possess a distinct toxicity profile, and they may also exacerbate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutics. In this study, we aimed to characterize the gastrointestinal and metabolic changes after a 2-week treatment period with aflibercept, an antiangiogenic VEGFR decoy, and with erlotinib, a -kinase inhibitor. Male rats were treated either with aflibercept or erlotinib for 2 weeks. During the 2-week treatment period, the animals in the aflibercept group received two subcutaneous doses of 25 mg/kg aflibercept. The erlotinib group got 10 mg/kg of erlotinib by oral gavage every other day. The control groups were treated similarly but received either saline injections or oral gavage of water. Intestinal toxicity was assessed by measuring intestinal permeability and by histological analyses of intestinal tissues. Metabolic changes were measured with H nuclear magnetic resonance in serum and urine. Neither aflibercept nor erlotinib induced changes in intestinal permeability or intestinal tissue morphology. However, aflibercept treatment resulted in stunted body weight gain and altered choline, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Two-week treatment with aflibercept or erlotinib alone does not induce observable changes in gastrointestinal morphology and function. However, observed aflibercept-treatment related metabolic changes suggest alterations in intestinal , nutrient intake, and adipose tissue function. The metabolic changes are also interesting in respect to the systemic effects of aflibercept and their possible associations with adverse events caused by aflibercept administration.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Disruption of the commensal , such as through treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, is a critical precursor for colonisation by C. difficile and subsequent disease. Furthermore, failure of the gut  to recover colonisation resistance can result in recurrence of infection. An unusual characteristic of C. difficile among gut bacteria is its ability to produce the bacteriostatic compound para-cresol (p-cresol) through fermentation of . Here, we demonstrate that the ability of C. difficile to produce p-cresol in vitro provides a competitive advantage over gut bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Metabolic profiling of competitive co-cultures revealed that acetate, alanine, butyrate, isobutyrate, p-cresol and p-hydroxyphenylacetate were the main metabolites responsible for differentiating the parent strain C. difficile (630Δerm) from a defined mutant deficient in p-cresol production. Moreover, we show that the p-cresol mutant displays a fitness defect in a mouse relapse model of C. difficile infection (CDI). Analysis of the microbiome from this mouse model of CDI demonstrates that colonisation by the p-cresol mutant results in a distinctly altered intestinal , and metabolic profile, with a greater representation of Gammaproteobacteria, including the Pseudomonales and Enterobacteriales. We demonstrate that Gammaproteobacteria are susceptible to exogenous p-cresol in vitro and that there is a clear divide between bacterial Phyla and their susceptibility to p-cresol. In general, Gram-negative species were relatively sensitive to p-cresol, whereas Gram-positive species were more tolerant. This study demonstrates that production of p-cresol by C. difficile has an effect on the viability of intestinal bacteria as well as the major metabolites produced in vitro. These observations are upheld in a mouse model of CDI, in which p-cresol production affects the biodiversity of gut  and faecal metabolite profiles, suggesting that p-cresol production contributes to C. difficile survival and pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21147106>IgA-producing plasma cells originate from germinal centers that are induced by B-cell receptor engagement in humans.</a></h1><p>IgA contributes to homeostatic balance between host and intestinal . Mechanisms that initiate the IgA response are unclear and likely to differ between humans and animal models. We used multiple experimental approaches to investigate the origin of human intestinal plasma cells that produce IgA in the gastrointestinal tract.Complexity of IgA-producing plasma cell populations in human gastrointestinal mucosa and bone marrow and the specific response to oral cholera vaccine were compared by analysis of immunoglobulin genes. Flow cytometry, gene expression analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze signaling pathways induced by B-cell receptor engagement in human gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and involvement of innate immunity in B-cell activation in GALT compared with nonintestinal sites.Human intestinal IgA-producing plasma cells appeared to be of germinal center origin; there was no evidence for the population complexity that accompanies multiple pathways of derivation observed in bone marrow. In germinal center B cells of human GALT, Btk and Erk are phosphorylated, CD22 is down-regulated, Lyn is translocated to the cell membrane, and Fos and Jun are up-regulated; these features indicate B-cell receptor ligation during germinal center evolution. No differences in innate activation of B cells were observed in GALT, compared with peripheral immune compartments.IgA-producing plasma cells appear to be derived from GALT germinal centers in humans. B-cell receptor engagement promotes formation of germinal centers of GALT, with no more evidence for innate immune receptor activation in the mucosa than nonintestinal immune compartments. Germinal centers in GALT should be targets of mucosal vaccinations because they are the source of human intestinal IgA response.Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the key metabolic functions of these bacteria remain unclear. We performed a prospective observational study in patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer without mechanical bowel preparation (n = 18). Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing we demonstrated that  ecology appears to be cancer stage-specific and strongly associated with histological features of poor prognosis. Fusobacteria (p < 0.007) and ε- Proteobacteria (p < 0.01) were enriched on tumour when compared to adjacent normal mucosal tissue, and fusobacteria and β-Proteobacteria levels increased with advancing cancer stage (p = 0.014 and 0.002 respecitvely). Metabonomic analysis using 1H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonsance  (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy, demonstrated increased abundance of taurine, isoglutamine, choline, lactate, phenylalanine and  and decreased levels of lipids and triglycerides in tumour relative to adjacent healthy tissue. Network analysis revealed that bacteria associated with poor prognostic features were not responsible for the modification of the cancer mucosal metabonome. Thus the colon cancer mucosal microbiome evolves with cancer stage to meet the demands of cancer metabolism. Passenger  may play a role in the maintenance of cancer mucosal metabolic homeostasis but these metabolic functions may not be stage specific.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28049839>GAS6 is a key homeostatic immunological regulator of host-commensal interactions in the oral mucosa.</a></h1><p>The oral epithelium contributes to innate immunity and oral mucosal homeostasis, which is critical for preventing local inflammation and the associated adverse systemic conditions. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which the oral epithelium maintains homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we studied the role of growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6), a ligand of the TYRO3-AXL-MERTK (TAM) receptor family, in regulating oral mucosal homeostasis. Expression of GAS6 was restricted to the outer layers of the oral epithelium. In contrast to protein S, the other TAM ligand, which was constitutively expressed postnatally, expression of GAS6 initiated only 3-4 wk after birth. Further analysis revealed that GAS6 expression was induced by the oral  in a myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent fashion. Mice lacking GAS6 presented higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, elevated frequencies of neutrophils, and up-regulated activity of enzymes, generating reactive nitrogen species. We also found an imbalance in Th17/Treg ratio known to control tissue homeostasis, as Gas6-deficient dendritic cells preferentially secreted IL-6 and induced Th17 cells. As a result of this immunological shift, a significant microbial dysbiosis was observed in Gas6 mice, because anaerobic bacteria largely expanded by using inflammatory byproducts for anaerobic respiration. Using chimeric mice, we found a critical role for GAS6 in epithelial cells in maintaining oral homeostasis, whereas its absence in hematopoietic cells synergized the level of dysbiosis. We thus propose GAS6 as a key immunological regulator of host-commensal interactions in the oral epithelium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988476>Novel gut-based pharmacology of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Metformin, a biguanide derivate, has pleiotropic effects beyond glucose reduction, including improvement of lipid profiles and lowering microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These effects have been ascribed to adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in the liver and skeletal muscle. However, metformin effects are not attenuated when AMPK is knocked out and intravenous metformin is less effective than oral medication, raising the possibility of important gut pharmacology. We hypothesized that the pharmacology of metformin includes alteration of bile acid recirculation and gut  resulting in enhanced enteroendocrine hormone secretion. In this study we evaluated T2DM subjects on and off metformin monotherapy to characterize the gut-based mechanisms of metformin. Subjects were studied at 4 time points: (i) at baseline on metformin, (ii) 7 days after stopping metformin, (iii) when fasting blood glucose (FBG) had risen by 25% after stopping metformin, and (iv) when FBG returned to baseline levels after restarting the metformin. At these timepoints we profiled glucose, insulin, gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide - (PYY) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and bile acids in blood, as well as duodenal and faecal bile acids and gut . We found that metformin withdrawal was associated with a reduction of active and total GLP-1 and elevation of serum bile acids, especially cholic acid and its conjugates. These effects reversed when metformin was restarted. Effects on circulating PYY were more modest, while GIP changes were negligible.  abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was positively correlated with changes in cholic acid and conjugates, while Bacteroidetes abundance was negatively correlated. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes representation were also correlated with levels of serum PYY. Our study suggests that metformin has complex effects due to gut-based pharmacology which might provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches to treat T2DM and associated metabolic diseases.www.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881551>The deleterious metabolic and genotoxic effects of the bacterial metabolite p-cresol on colonic epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>p-Cresol that is produced by the intestinal  from the amino acid  is found at millimolar concentrations in the human feces. The effects of this metabolite on colonic epithelial cells were tested in this study. Using the human colonic epithelial HT-29 Glc(-/+) cell line, we found that 0.8mM p-cresol inhibits cell proliferation, an effect concomitant with an accumulation of the cells in the S phase and with a slight increase of cell detachment without necrotic effect. At this concentration, p-cresol inhibited oxygen consumption in HT-29 Glc(-/+) cells. In rat normal colonocytes, p-cresol also inhibited respiration. Pretreatment of HT-29 Glc(-/+) cells with 0.8mM p-cresol for 1 day resulted in an increase of the state 3 oxygen consumption and of the cell maximal respiratory capacity with concomitant increased anion superoxide production. At higher concentrations (1.6 and 3.2mM), p-cresol showed similar effects but additionally increased after 1 day the proton leak through the inner mitochondrial membrane, decreasing the mitochondrial bioenergetic activity. At these concentrations, p-cresol was found to be genotoxic toward HT-29 Glc(-/+) and also LS-174T intestinal cells. Lastly, a decreased ATP intracellular content was observed after 3 days treatment. p-Cresol at 0.8mM concentration inhibits colonocyte respiration and proliferation. In response, cells can mobilize their "respiratory reserve." At higher concentrations, p-cresol pretreatment uncouples cell respiration and ATP synthesis, increases DNA damage, and finally decreases the ATP cell content. Thus, we have identified p-cresol as a metabolic troublemaker and as a genotoxic agent toward colonocytes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the Young Finn's Study, BCAA and, to a lesser extent, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and  were associated with insulin resistance (IR) in men but not in women, whereas the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glutamine, or glycine, and several other amino acids (i.e. histidine, arginine, and tryptophan) did not show an association with IR. Obesity may track more strongly than metabolic syndrome and diabetes with elevated BCAA. In a study of 1302 people aged 40-79; higher levels of BCAA tracked with older age, male sex, and metabolic syndrome, as well as with obesity, cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and uric acid. Medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines, by-products of mitochondrial catabolism of BCAAs, as well as branched-chain keto acids and the BCAA themselves distinguished obese people having versus not having features of IR, and in a study of 898 patients with essential hypertension, the BCAA and  and phenylalanine were associated with metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose. In a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, elevations in BCAA and, to a lesser extent, in alanine tracked with IR, whereas higher levels of glutamine and glycine were associated with lesser likelihood of IR. Given these associations with IR, it is not surprising that a number of studies have shown higher BCAA levels in people with and prior to development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has particularly been shown in Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups while not appearing to occur in African Americans. Similarly, higher BCAA levels track with cardiovascular disease. [Figure: see text] The metabolism of BCAA involves two processes: (i) a reversible process catalysed by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), either cytosolic or mitochondrial, requiring pyridoxal to function as an amino group carrier, by which the BCAA with 2-ketoglutarate produce a branched-chain keto acid plus glutamate; and (ii) the irreversible mitochondrial process catalysed by branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) leading to formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA from leucine, valine, and isoleucine, respectively, which enter the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle as acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively, leading to ATP formation. The BCAA stimulate secretion of both insulin and glucagon and, when given orally, of both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), with oral administration leading to greater and more prolonged insulin and glucagon secretion. Insulin may particularly reduce BCAA turnover to a greater extent than that of other amino acids, and decreases the appearance and increases the uptake of amino acids. However, older studies of the effect of glucose or insulin on BCAA concentrations and rates of leucine appearance and oxidation showed no reduction in T2D, although the higher baseline levels of BCAA in obesity have long been recognized. Impaired function of BCAT and BCKDH has been posited, either as a primary genetic abnormality or due to effects of elevated fatty acids, proinflammatory cytokines, or insulin levels with consequent accumulation of branched-chain keto acids and metabolites such as diacylglycerol and ceramide, potentially contributing to the development of further insulin resistance, and decreased skeletal muscle BCAT and BCKDH expression has been shown in people with diabetes, supporting this concept. A Mendelian randomization study used measured variation in genes involved in BCAA metabolism to test the hypothesis of a causal effect of modifiable exposure on IR, showing that variants in protein phosphatase, Mg /Mn dependent 1K (PPM1K), a gene encoding the mitochondrial phosphatase activating the BCKDH complex, are associated with T2D, but another such study suggested that genetic variations associated with IR are causally related to higher BCAA levels. Another hypothesis involves the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is activated by BCAA, as well as by insulin and glucose via cellular ATP availability. If this is the relevant pathway, BCAA overload may cause insulin resistance by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as by leading to increases in acylcarnitines, with mTOR seen in this scenario as a central signal of cross-talk between the BCAA and insulin. At this point, whether whole-body or tissue-specific BCAA metabolism is increased or decreased in states of insulin-resistant obesity and T2D is uncertain. Insulin action in the hypothalamus induces but overfeeding decreases hepatic BCKDH, leading to the concept that hypothalamic insulin resistance impairs BCAA metabolism in obesity and diabetes, so that plasma BCAAs may be markers of hypothalamic insulin action rather than direct mediators of changes in IR. A way to address this may be to understand the effects of changes in diet and other interventions on BCAA, as well as on IR and T2D. In an animal model, lowering dietary BCAA increased energy expenditure and improved insulin sensitivity. Two large human population studies showed an association of estimated dietary BCAA intake with T2D risk, although another population study showed higher dietary BCAA to be associated with lower T2D risk. Ethnic differences, reflecting underlying differences in genetic variants, may be responsible for such differences. In the study of Asghari et al. in the current issue of the Journal of Diabetes, BCAA intake was associated with the development of subsequent IR. Studies of bariatric surgery suggest lower basal and post-insulin infusion BCAA levels are associated with greater insulin sensitivity, with reductions in BCAA not seen with weight loss per se with gastric band procedures, but occurring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, an intervention that may have metabolic benefits over and above those from reduction in body weight. The gut  may be important for the supply of the BCAA to mammalian hosts, either by de novo biosynthesis or by modifying nutrient absorption. A final fascinating preliminary set of observations is that of the effects of empagliflozin on metabolomics; evidence of increased Krebs cycle activation and of higher levels of BCAA metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition may, to some extent, involve BCAA metabolism. Certainly, we do not yet have a full understanding of these complex associations. However, the suggestion of multiple roles of BCAA in the development of IR promises to be important and to lead to the development of novel effective T2D therapies.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28195358>Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease medications have distinct signatures of the gut microbiome.</a></h1><p>There is mounting evidence for a connection between the gut and Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysbiosis of gut  could explain several features of PD.The objective of this study was to determine if PD involves dysbiosis of gut microbiome, disentangle effects of confounders, and identify candidate taxa and functional pathways to guide research.A total of 197 PD cases and 130 controls were studied. Microbial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from stool. Metadata were collected on 39 potential confounders including medications, diet, gastrointestinal symptoms, and demographics. Statistical analyses were conducted while controlling for potential confounders and correcting for multiple testing. We tested differences in the overall microbial composition, taxa abundance, and functional pathways.Independent microbial signatures were detected for PD (P = 4E-5), participants' region of residence within the United States (P = 3E-3), age (P = 0.03), sex (P = 1E-3), and dietary fruits/vegetables (P = 0.01). Among patients, independent signals were detected for catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitors (P = 4E-4), anticholinergics (P = 5E-3), and possibly carbidopa/levodopa (P = 0.05). We found significantly altered abundances of the Bifidobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, [Tissierellaceae], Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae families. Functional predictions revealed changes in numerous pathways, including the metabolism of plant-derived compounds and xenobiotics degradation.PD is accompanied by dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Results coalesce divergent findings of prior studies, reveal altered abundance of several taxa, nominate functional pathways, and demonstrate independent effects of PD medications on the microbiome. The findings provide new leads and testable hypotheses on the pathophysiology and treatment of PD. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.© 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714515>Human splanchnic amino-acid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Plasma levels of several amino acids are correlated with metabolic dysregulation in obesity and type 2 diabetes. To increase our understanding of human amino-acid metabolism, we aimed to determine splanchnic interorgan amino-acid handling. Twenty patients planned to undergo a pylorus preserving pancreatico-duodenectomy were included in this study. Blood was sampled from the portal vein, hepatic vein, superior mesenteric vein, inferior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, renal vein, and the radial artery during surgery. The difference between arterial and venous concentrations of 21 amino acids was determined using liquid chromatography as a measure of amino-acid metabolism across a given organ. Whereas glutamine was significantly taken up by the small intestine (121.0 ± 23.8 µmol/L; P < 0.0001), citrulline was released (-36.1 ± 4.6 µmol/L; P < 0.0001). This, however, was not seen for the colon. Interestingly, the liver showed a small, but a significant uptake of citrulline from the circulation (4.8 ± 1.6 µmol/L; P = 0.0138) next to many other amino acids. The kidneys showed a marked release of serine and alanine into the circulation (-58.0 ± 4.4 µmol/L and -61.8 ± 5.2 µmol/L, P < 0.0001), and a smaller, but statistically significant release of  (-12.0 ± 1.3 µmol/L, P < 0.0001).

Simultaneous blood sampling in different veins provides unique qualitative and quantitative information on integrative amino-acid physiology, and reveals that the well-known intestinal glutamine-citrulline pathway appears to be functional in the small intestine but not in the colon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27568472>Effects of various gastrointestinal procedures on β-cell function in obesity and type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>Bariatric surgery is a gastrointestinal procedure that has emerged as the most effective treatment for weight loss. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are the main procedures currently performed. However, the benefits of bariatric surgery extend beyond weight loss. In fact, improvements in β-cell function occur before clinically meaningful weight loss and contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) remission. Herein, we discuss evidence supporting the efficacy of bariatric surgery for weight loss and improved insulin secretion in patients with and without T2D. The exact mechanism by which bariatric surgery elicits a favorable change in β-cell function remains unclear, but a leading hypothesis is that rerouted nutrient flow to the gut alters enteroendocrine hormone production (e.g., glucagon-like polypeptide 1, polypeptide -, ghrelin), gut microbiome metabolites (e.g., lipopolysaccharides, short-chain fatty acids), and circulating bile acid changes that favor appetite suppression, metabolic rate, and insulin action. We also highlight the role of adipose-derived factors (e.g., pancreatic fat content, adiponectin) that may have an effect on β-cell function, as well as discuss the clinical determinants of diabetes remission (e.g., age and T2D duration). Taken together, the acute improvements seen with bariatric surgery are weight-independent and likely related to incretin-mediated effects on postprandial glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Over longer periods of time, increases in bile acids, reductions in pancreatic lipid content, and elevated adiponectin levels may also contribute to reduced disease risk. As a result, the gut appears to be a novel target for favorably preventing and treating obesity-related metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Specific peptidoglycan motifs promote metabolic tissue inflammation, lipolysis and insulin resistance via Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (Nod1). Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (Ripk2) mediates Nod1-induced immunity, but the role of Ripk2 in metabolism is ill-defined. We hypothesized that Ripk2 was required for Nod1-mediated inflammation, lipolysis and dysglycemia. This is relevant because certain  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) inhibit Ripk2 and there is clinical evidence of TKIs lowering inflammation and blood glucose. Here, we showed that only a subset of TKIs known to inhibit Ripk2 attenuated Nod1 ligand-mediated adipocyte lipolysis. TKIs that inhibit Ripk2 decreased cytokine responses induced by Nod1-activating peptidoglycan, but not endotoxin in both metabolic and immune cells. Pre-treatment of adipocytes or macrophages with the TKI gefitinib inhibited Nod1-induced Cxcl1 and Il-6 secretion. Furthermore, treatment of mice with gefitinib prevented Nod1-induced glucose intolerance in vivo. Ripk2 was required for these effects on inflammation and metabolism, since Nod1-mediated cytokine and blood glucose changes were absent in Ripk2 mice.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the alteration of gut  between children with newly diagnosed T1DM and healthy controls and to determine if gut  could partly explain the etiology of this disease.A case-control study was carried out with 15 children with T1DM and 15 healthy children. The fecal bacteria composition was investigated by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene and analyzed by the estimators of community richness (Chao) indexes.There was a notable lower richness of fecal bacteria in T1DM group than controls (156.53 ± 36.96 vs. 130.0 ± 32.85, P = 0.047). At the genus level, the composition of Blautia was increased in T1DM group than control group whereas the composition of Haemophilus, Lachnospira, Dialister, and Acidaminococcus was decreased.

Although precise mechanisms for this connection have not been elucidated, we have proposed mechanisms by which orally administered periodontopathic bacteria might induce changes in gut  composition, barrier function, and immune system, resulting in an increased risk of diseases characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. Accumulating evidence suggests a profound effect of altered gut metabolite profiles on overall host health. Therefore, it is possible that  can affect these metabolites. To test this, C57BL/6 mice were administered with  W83 orally twice a week for 5 weeks and compared with sham-inoculated mice. The gut microbial communities were analyzed by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA genes. Inferred metagenomic analysis was used to determine the relative abundance of KEGG pathways encoded in the gut . Serum metabolites were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics coupled with multivariate statistical analyses. Oral administration of  induced a change in gut  composition. The distributions of metabolic pathways differed between the two groups, including those related to amino acid metabolism and, in particular, the genes for phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis. Also, alanine, glutamine, histidine, , and phenylalanine were significantly increased in the serum of -administered mice. In addition to altering immune modulation and gut barrier function, oral administration of  affects the host's metabolic profile. This supports our hypothesis regarding a gut-mediated systemic pathology resulting from periodontal disease. Increasing evidence suggest that alterations of the gut microbiome underlie metabolic disease pathology by modulating gut metabolite profiles. We have shown that orally administered , a representative periodontopathic bacterium, alters the gut microbiome; that may be a novel mechanism by which periodontitis increases the risk of various diseases. Given the association between periodontal disease and metabolic diseases, it is possible that  can affect the metabolites. Metabolite profiling analysis demonstrated that several amino acids related to a risk of developing diabetes and obesity were elevated in -administered mice. Our results revealed that the increased risk of various diseases by  might be mediated at least in part by alteration of metabolic profiles. The findings should add new insights into potential links between periodontal disease and systemic disease for investigators in periodontal disease and also for investigators in the field of other diseases, such as metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018 Kato et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634731>Gut  and cancer: How gut  modulates activity, efficacy and toxicity of antitumoral therapy.</a></h1><p>Gut  is involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.

Cortisol seems the main biological factor from stress towards central adiposity; and diet, physical activity and sleep are the main behavioural pathways. Within stress-diet, the concepts of comfort food and emotional eating are highlighted, as cortisol affects reward pathways and appetite brain centres with a role for insulin, leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), endocannabinoids, orexin and gastrointestinal hormones. More recently researched biological underpinnings are , epigenetic modifications and metabolites. First, the gut  reaches the stress-regulating and appetite-regulating brain centres via the gut-brain axis. Second, epigenetic analyses are recommended as diet, obesity, stress and gut  can change gene expression which then affects appetite, energy homeostasis and stress reactivity. Finally, metabolomics would be a good technique to disentangle stress-diet-obesity interactions as multiple biological pathways are involved. Saliva might be an ideal biological matrix as it allows metagenomic (oral ), epigenomic and metabolomic analyses. In conclusion, stress and diet/obesity research should be combined in interdisciplinary collaborations with implementation of several -omics analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28673241>Effects of melanin from Sepiella Maindroni ink (MSMI) on the intestinal Microbiome of mice.</a></h1><p>By the search for new natural compounds with beneficial health effects, cephalopod ink has been considered as an attempt to develop new drugs and functional foods, which is an especially active field in Asia, where cephalopods are a major fishery catch, for which ink sacs are a bi-product and where homeopathic medicine has deep roots. There is a demand to evaluate the safety and influence to the organism. The specific composition and relative abundance of the gut , which is potentially a major modulator of host metabolism, drives the interaction between functional foods and host health. We explore the effects of melanin from Sepiella Maindroni, most common cuttlefish in China, on the intestinal microbiome of mice.ICR mice were randomly divided four groups, which were normal group (S), low melanin dose group (D; 120 mg/kg), medium melanin dose group (Z; 240 mg/kg), and high melanin dose group (G; 480 mg/kg). Melanin was delivered for 28 consecutive days. Fecal samples were used to generate 7715 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) via high-throughput sequencing. There were significant shifts in relative abundance of the dominant taxa at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels following melanin treatment.MSMI had no significant effect on the structure of intestinal flora in mice. The main effect was in the proportion of dominant bacterial communities. The effect positively correlated with the dose. From a health point of view, the use of melanin does not cause intestinal flora disorder. Our results may have important implications for MSMI as functional food component and potential therapeutic for manipulating gut .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761691>Normal level of sepsis-associated phenylcarboxylic acids in human serum.</a></h1><p>Previous studies showed that large amounts of phenylcarboxylic acids (PhCAs) are accumulated in a septic patient's blood due to increased endogenous and microbial phenylalanine and  biotransformation. Frequently, biochemical aromatic amino acid transformation into PhCAs is considered functionally insignificant for people without monogenetic hereditary diseases. The blood of healthy people contains the same PhCAs that are typical for septic patients as shown in this paper. The overall serum PhCAs level was 6 µM on average as measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. This level is a stable biochemical parameter indicating the normal metabolism of aromatic amino acids. The concentrations of PhCAs in the metabolic profile of healthy people are distributed as follows: phenylacetic ≈ p-hydroxyphenyllactic > p-hydroxyphenylacetic > phenyllactic ≈ phenylpropionic > benzoic. We conclude that maintaining of stable PhCAs level in the serum is provided as the result of integration of human endogenous metabolic pathways and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200007>Disruption of the gut-liver axis in the pathogenesis of acute-on-chronic liver failure.</a></h1><p>Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by organ failure mediated by acute decompensation of cirrhosis. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the gut-liver axis (GLS) and its association with ACLF pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms related to the alteration of the GLA and their involvement in ACLF pathogenesis and suggest some possible therapeutic options that could modulate the GLA dysfunction. This knowledge may provide information useful for the design of therapeutic strategies for gut dysbiosis and its complications in ACLF.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30143740>Characterization and induction of prophages in human gut-associated Bifidobacterium hosts.</a></h1><p>In the current report, we describe the identification of three genetically distinct groups of prophages integrated into three different chromosomal sites of human gut-associated Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum strains. These bifidobacterial prophages are distantly related to temperate actinobacteriophages of several hosts. Some prophages, integrated within the dnaJ gene, are competent for induction, excision, replication, assembly and lysis, suggesting that they are fully functional and can generate infectious particles, even though permissive hosts have not yet been identified. Interestingly, several of these phages harbor a putative phase variation shufflon (the Rin system) that generates variation of the tail-associated receptor binding protein (RBP). Unlike the analogous coliphage-associated shufflon Min, or simpler Cin and Gin inversion systems, Rin is predicted to use a  recombinase to promote inversion, the first reported phage-encoded -family DNA invertase. The identification of bifidobacterial prophages with RBP diversification systems that are competent for assembly and lysis, yet fail to propagate lytically under laboratory conditions, suggests dynamic evolution of bifidobacteria and their phages in the human gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31006109>Increasing carbohydrate availability in the hindgut promotes hypothalamic neurotransmitter synthesis: aromatic amino acids linking the -brain axis.</a></h1><p>The gut  is increasingly recognized to modulate brain function by recent studies demonstrating the central effects of various gut microbial manipulation strategies. Our previous study demonstrated that antibiotic-induced alterations of hindgut  are associated with changes in aromatic amino acid (AAA) metabolism and hypothalamic neurochemistry, while the underlying mechanistic insight is limited. Given that the microbial AAA metabolism can be affected by luminal carbohydrate availability, here we hypothesize that increasing hindgut carbohydrate availability affects the expression of neurotransmitters in the porcine hypothalamus. A hindgut -targeted strategy was adopted by increasing hindgut carbohydrate availability in a cecal-cannulated piglet model. Mechanistic involvement of AAAs along the gut -brain axis was further investigated in mice and neuronal cells. Increasing carbohydrate availability by cecal starch infusion led to a decrease in hindgut AAA metabolism, and an increase in systemic AAA availability, central AAA-derived neurotransmitters (5-HT, dopamine), and neurotrophin BDNF in piglets, indicating that hindgut  affect hypothalamic neurochemistry in an AAA-dependent manner. Single AAA i.p. injection in mice revealed that an increase in circulating tryptophan and  elevated their concentrations in brain and finally promoted the expressions of 5-HT, dopamine, and BDNF in a time-dependent manner. Neuronal cells treated with single AAAs in vitro further demonstrated that tryptophan and  enhanced 5-HT and dopamine synthesis, respectively, and promoted BDNF expression partly through the 5-HT1A/DRD1-CREB pathway. Our study reveals that increasing hindgut carbohydrate availability promotes hypothalamic neurotransmitter synthesis and that AAAs act as potential mediators between hindgut  and brain neurochemistry.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24192910>Redox signaling regulates commensal-mediated mucosal homeostasis and restitution and requires formyl peptide receptor 1.</a></h1><p>The mammalian gut  is essential for normal intestinal development, renewal, and repair. Injury to the intestinal mucosa can occur with infection, surgical trauma, and in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Repair of mucosal injury, termed restitution, as well as restoration of intestinal homeostasis involves induced and coordinated proliferation and migration of intestinal epithelial cells. N-formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are widely expressed pattern recognition receptors that can specifically bind and induce responses to host-derived and bacterial peptides and small molecules. Here we report that specific members of the gut  stimulate FPR1 on intestinal epithelial cells to generate reactive oxygen species via enterocyte NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), causing rapid phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase. These events stimulate migration and proliferation of enterocytes adjacent to colonic wounds. Taken together, these findings identify a novel role of FPR1 as pattern recognition receptors for perceiving the enteric  that promotes repair of mucosal wounds via generation of reactive oxygen species from the enterocyte NOX1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22975930>An investigation of the antidepressant action of xiaoyaosan in rats using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with metabonomics.</a></h1><p>A rapid, highly sensitive, and selective method was applied in a non-invasive way to investigate the antidepressant action of Xiaoyaosan (XYS) using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and chemometrics. Many significantly altered metabolites were used to explain the mechanism. Venlafaxine HCl and fluoxetine HCl were used as chemical positive control drugs with a relatively clear mechanism of action to evaluate the efficiency and to predict the mechanism of action of XYS. Urine obtained from rats subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was analyzed by UPLC-MS. Distinct changes in the pattern of metabolites in the rat urine after CUMS production and drug intervention were observed using partial least squares-discriminant analysis. The results of behavioral tests and multivariate analysis showed that CUMS was successfully reproduced, and a moderate-dose XYS produced significant therapeutic effects in the rodent model, equivalent to those of the positive control drugs, venlafaxine HCl and fluoxetine HCl. Metabolites with significant changes induced by CUMS were identified, and 17 biomarker candidates for stress and drug intervention were identified. The therapeutic effect of XYS on depression may involve regulation of the dysfunctions of energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut microflora changes. Metabonomic methods are valuable tools for measuring efficacy and mechanisms of action in the study of traditional Chinese medicines.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30539636>Metabolic Signature of Primary Biliary Cholangitis and Its Comparison with Celiac Disease.</a></h1><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by ongoing inflammatory destruction of the interlobular bile ducts, eventually leading to chronic cholestasis and biliary cirrhosis. This study primarily aims to define the metabolomic signature of PBC after comparison with healthy controls (HC). Second, it aims to evaluate the possible metabolic association between PBC and celiac disease (CD), an immune-mediated disorder frequently associated with PBC. Serum and urine samples from 20 PBC, 21 CD, and 19 sex-matched HC subjects were collected. H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for all samples were acquired, and multivariate statistics were used to evaluate the differences among the three groups and to provide information about the involved metabolites. The classification accuracies to discriminate PBC and HC groups were 78.9-84.6% for serum and 76.9% for urine. In comparison to HC, PBC patient sera were characterized by altered levels ( p value <0.05) of pyruvate, citrate, glutamate, glutamine, serine, , phenylalanine, and lactate. PBC patient urine showed lower levels ( p value <0.05) of trigonelline and hippurate with respect to HC. Furthermore, the NMR metabolomic fingerprint was able to cluster PBC with respect to CD patients, and the classification accuracies in the discriminations between these groups were 81.9-91.7% for serum and 77.7% for urine. Our results show that PBC displays a unique metabolomic fingerprint, which led to speculation about an impaired energy metabolism, probably associated with an altered gut . PBC and CD showed two distinct metabolic fingerprints. These data could provide clues for the comprehension of the PBC pathogenetic mechanisms and the detection of novel therapeutic targets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349065>Major phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in the human gut can arise from microbial fermentation of protein.</a></h1><p>Plant secondary metabolites, such as phenolic acids are commonly associated with benefits for human health. Two of the most abundant phenylpropanoid-derived compounds detected in human faecal samples are phenylacetic acid (PAA) and 4-hydroxylphenylacetic acid (4-hydroxyPAA). Although they have the potential to be derived from diets rich in plant-based foods, evidence suggests that these compounds can be derived from the microbial fermentation of aromatic amino acids (AAAs) in the colon.To identify the bacteria responsible, 26 strains representing 25 of the dominant human colonic species were screened for phenyl metabolite formation. Seven strains produced significant amounts of both PAA and 4-hydroxyPAA. These included five out of seven Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides eggerthii, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Parabacteroides distasonis), and two out of 17 Firmicutes (Eubacterium hallii and Clostridium bartlettii). These species also produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the corresponding tryptophan metabolite, but C. bartlettii showed 100 times higher IAA production than the other six strains. Four strains were further tested and PAA formation was substantially increased by phenylalanine, 4-hydroxyPAA by  and IAA by tryptophan.This study demonstrates that certain microbial species have the ability to ferment all three AAAs and that protein fermentation is the likely source of major phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in the colon.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Betacyanins possess free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities, suggesting its potential beneficial effects on metabolic diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic effect of red pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) fruit betacyanins (HPBN) on high-fat diet-fed mice and determine whether the beneficial effects of HPBN are associated with the modulation of gut .Thirty-six male C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups and fed low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), or high-fat diet plus HPBN of 200 mg/kg for 14 weeks. Sixteen seconds rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the composition of gut .Our results indicated that administration of HPBN reduced HFD-induced body weight gain and visceral obesity and improved hepatic steatosis, adipose hypertrophy, and insulin resistance in mice. Sixteen seconds rRNA sequencing performed on the MiSeq Illumina platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) showed that HPBN supplement not only decreased the proportion of Firmicutes and increased the proportion of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level but also induced a dramatic increase in the relative abundance of Akkermansia at the genus level.Red pitaya betacyanins protect from diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic disorders, which is associated with improved inflammatory status and modulation of gut , especially its ability to decrease the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and increase the relative abundance of Akkermansia. The study suggested a clinical implication of HPBN in the management of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes.© 2015 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659181>Gut bacterial  decarboxylases restrict levels of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Human gut  senses its environment and responds by releasing metabolites, some of which are key regulators of human health and disease. In this study, we characterize gut-associated bacteria in their ability to decarboxylate levodopa to dopamine via  decarboxylases. Bacterial  decarboxylases efficiently convert levodopa to dopamine, even in the presence of , a competitive substrate, or inhibitors of human decarboxylase. In situ levels of levodopa are compromised by high abundance of gut bacterial  decarboxylase in patients with Parkinson's disease. Finally, the higher relative abundance of bacterial  decarboxylases at the site of levodopa absorption, proximal small intestine, had a significant impact on levels of levodopa in the plasma of rats. Our results highlight the role of microbial metabolism in drug availability, and specifically, that abundance of bacterial  decarboxylase in the proximal small intestine can explain the increased dosage regimen of levodopa treatment in Parkinson's disease patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889427>EFFECT OF CARBOXYLIC ACIDS OF GUT MICROBIAL ORIGIN ON HOST CELL PROLIFERATION IN ORGANOTYPIC TISSUE CULTURES.</a></h1><p>Intestinal  produces many carboxylic acids, especially short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as a result of carbohydrates, fats and proteins fermentation and which are intermediates in the interaction of the  and the host. SCFA (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and  involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152743>Stool Bacteriomic Profiling in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Receiving Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor- Kinase Inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Diarrhea occurs in approximately half of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) receiving vascular endothelial growth factor- kinase inhibitors (VEGF-TKI). We evaluated the relationship between VEGF-TKI-related diarrhea and stool .Stool samples were collected from 20 mRCC patients receiving VEGF-TKIs. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to characterize the stool bacteriomic profiling of patients. Assay validation with Salmonella typhimurium spike-in experiments suggested greatest speciation with use of the V5 region.Higher levels of Bacteroides spp. and lower levels of Prevotella spp. were found in patients with diarrhea. In addition, patients receiving VEGF-TKIs with mRCC appeared to have less relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. as compared with previous reports based on healthy subjects.We have thus demonstrated interplay between  and VEGF-TKI-induced diarrhea.

In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and nontargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the microbiome-metabolome responses to dietary copper levels in the hindgut of suckling piglets. The results showed that the dietary copper level affected the abundance of several Clostridia genera and that the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Acidaminococcus, was reduced in the 300 mg kg (high) Cu group. Metabolomic analysis revealed that dietary copper levels affected protein and carbohydrate metabolites, protein biosynthesis, the urea cycle, galactose metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism (including the metabolism of arginine, proline, β-alanine, phenylalanine, , and methionine). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance levels of Coprococcus (family Lachnospiraceae) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 18 (family Ruminococcaceae) were positively correlated with energy metabolism pathways (gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway). The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways (protein biosynthesis, glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, and  metabolism), and OTU583 and OTU1067 (family Rikenellaceae) were positively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the copper levels consumed by LC (low-copper group) versus HC (high-copper group) animals alter the composition of the gut  and modulate microbial metabolic pathways, which may further affect the health of suckling piglets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22360484>Reactive oxygen production induced by the gut : pharmacotherapeutic implications.</a></h1><p>The resident prokaryotic  of the mammalian intestine influences diverse homeostatic functions, including regulation of cellular growth, maintenance of barrier function, and modulation of immune responses. However, it is unknown how commensal prokaryotic organisms mechanistically influence eukaryotic signaling networks. Recent data has demonstrated that gut epithelia contacted by enteric commensal bacteria rapidly generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). While the induced generation of ROS via stimulation of formyl peptide receptors is a cardinal feature of the cellular response of phagocytes to pathogenic or commensal bacteria, evidence is accumulating that ROS are also similarly elicited in other cell types, including intestinal epithelia, in response to microbial signals. Additionally, ROS have been shown to serve as critical second messengers in multiple signal transduction pathways stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors. This physiologically-generated ROS is known to participate in cellular signaling via the rapid and transient oxidative inactivation of a defined class of sensor proteins bearing oxidant-sensitive thiol groups. These proteins include  phosphatases that serve as regulators of MAP kinase pathways, cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as components involved in control of ubiquitination-mediated NF-κB activation. Consistently, microbial-elicited ROS has been shown to mediate increased cellular proliferation and motility and to modulate innate immune signaling. These results demonstrate how enteric  influence regulatory networks of the mammalian intestinal epithelia. We hypothesize that many of the known effects of the normal  on intestinal physiology, and potential beneficial effects of candidate probiotic bacteria, may be at least partially mediated by this ROS-dependent mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321245> Genotypic Variant  and Increased  Phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-23 Responsive Innate Lymphoid Cells during Pathogenesis of Crohn's Disease.</a></h1><p>Crohn's disease (CD) results from dysregulated immune responses to gut  in genetically susceptible individuals, affecting multiple areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident innate effector lymphocytes which play crucial roles in mucosal immune defense, tissue repair, and maintenance of homeostasis. The accumulation of IFN--producing ILC1s and increased level of proinflammatory cytokines produced by ILCs has been observed in the inflamed terminal ileum of CD patients. To date, the precise mechanisms of ILC plasticity and gene regulatory pathways in ILCs remain unclear. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) regulates gene expression in a cell-specific, cytokine-dependent manner, involving multiple immune responses. This study proposes the positive correlation between the prevalence of  risky allele "A" with the severity of disease in a cohort of 94 CD patients. In addition, the results suggest an increased STAT3 activity in the inflamed ileum of CD patients, compared to unaffected ileum sections. Notably, IL-23 triggers the differentiation of CD117NKp44 ILC3s and induces the activation of STAT3 in both CD117NKp44 and CD117NKp44 ILC subsets, implying the involvement of STAT3 in the initiation of ILC plasticity. Moreover, carriage of  "A" risk allele exhibited a higher basal level of STAT3  phosphorylation, and an increased IL-23 triggered the pSTAT3 level. We also demonstrated that there was no delayed dephosphorylation of STAT3 in ILCs of both A/A and G/G donors. Overall, the results of this study suggest that IL-23-induced activation of STAT3 in the CD117NKp44 ILC1s involves in ILC1-to-ILC3 plasticity and a potential regulatory role of ILC1 function. Those genetically susceptible individuals carried  risky allele appear to have higher basal and cytokine-stimulated activation of STAT3 signal, leading to prolonged inflammation and chronic relapse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28223257>The fecal microbiome of dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.</a></h1><p>Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in dogs is a syndrome of inadequate synthesis and secretion of pancreatic enzymes. Small intestinal bacterial dysbiosis occurs in dogs with EPI, and is reversed with pancreatic enzyme therapy. However, there are no studies evaluating the fecal microbiome of dogs with EPI. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fecal microbiome of dogs with EPI. Three day pooled fecal samples were collected from healthy dogs (n = 18), untreated (n = 7) dogs with EPI, and dogs with EPI treated with enzyme replacement therapy (n = 19). Extracted DNA from fecal samples was used for Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and PICRUSt was used to predict the functional gene content of the microbiome. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) revealed significant differences in bacterial groups and functional genes between the healthy dogs and dogs with EPI. There was a significant difference in fecal microbial communities when healthy dogs were compared to treated and untreated dogs with EPI (unweighted UniFrac distance, ANOSIM P = 0.001, and 0.001 respectively). Alpha diversity was significantly decreased in untreated and treated EPI dogs when compared to the healthy dogs with respect to Chao1, Observed OTU, and Shannon diversity (P = 0.008, 0.003, and 0.002 respectively). The families Bifidobacteriaceae (P = 0.005), Enterococcaceae (P = 0.018), and Lactobacillaceae (P = 0.001) were significantly increased in the untreated and treated dogs with EPI when compared to healthy dogs. In contrast, Lachnospiraceae (P < 0.001), and Ruminococcaceae (P < 0.01) were significantly decreased in dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI (before treatment) had significant increases in functional genes associated with secretion system, fatty acid metabolism, and phosphotransferase system. In contrast, healthy dogs had a significant increase in genes related to phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, transcription machinery and sporulation. In conclusion, this study shows that the fecal microbiome of dogs with EPI (both treated and untreated) is different to that of healthy dogs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the mammalian systems responses to aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1) exposure, we analyzed the AFB1-induced metabonomic changes in multiple biological matrices (plasma, urine, and liver) of rats using (1)H NMR spectroscopy together with clinical biochemistry and histopathologic assessments. We found that AFB1 exposure caused significant elevation of glucose, amino acids, and choline metabolites (choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine) in plasma but reduction of plasma lipids. AFB1 also induced elevation of liver lipids, amino acids (, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine), choline, and nucleic acid metabolites (inosine, adenosine, and uridine) together with reduction of hepatic glycogen and glucose. AFB1 further caused decreases in urinary TCA cycle intermediates (2-oxoglutarate and citrate) and elevation of gut  cometabolites (phenylacetylglycine and hippurate). These indicated that AFB1 exposure caused hepatic steatosis accompanied with widespread metabolic changes including lipid and cell membrane metabolisms, protein biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and gut  functions. This implied that AFB1 exposure probably caused oxidative-stress-mediated impairments of mitochondria functions. These findings provide an overview of biochemical consequences of AFB1 exposure and comprehensive insights into the metabolic aspects of AFB1-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608347>Metabolomics for improved treatment monitoring of phenylketonuria: urinary biomarkers for non-invasive assessment of dietary adherence and nutritional deficiencies.</a></h1><p>Management of phenylketonuria (PKU) requires lifelong restriction of phenylalanine (Phe) intake using specialized medical foods to prevent neurocognitive impairment in affected patients. However, dietary adherence is challenging to maintain while ensuring adequate nutrition, which can lead to sub-optimal clinical outcomes. Metabolomics offers a systematic approach to identify new biomarkers of disease progression in PKU when using urine as a surrogate for blood specimens that is more accurate than self-reported diet records. Herein, the plasma and urine metabolome of a cohort of classic PKU patients (median age = 11 years; n = 22) mainly prescribed (78%) a Phe-restricted diet were characterized using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Overall, there was good mutual agreement between plasma Phe and  (Tyr) concentrations measured from PKU patients when using an amino acid analyzer based on UPLC-UV as compared to MSI-CE-MS with a mean bias of 12% (n = 82). Longitudinal measurements of recently diagnosed PKU infants (n = 3) revealed good long-term regulation of blood Phe with dietary management, and only occasional episodes exceeding the recommended therapeutic range (>360 μM) unlike older PKU patients. Plasma metabolomic studies demonstrated that non-adherent PKU patients had lower circulating concentrations of Tyr, arginine, 2-aminobutyric acid, and propionylcarnitine (q < 0.05, FDR) that were inversely correlated to Phe (r ≈ -0.600 to -0.830). Nontargeted metabolite profiling also revealed urinary biomarkers associated with poor dietary adherence among PKU patients, including elevated concentrations of catabolites indicative of Phe intoxication (e.g., phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, hydroxyphenylacetic acid). Additionally, PKU patients with poor blood Phe control had lower excretion of urinary compounds derived from co-metabolism of Tyr due to  activity (e.g., cresol sulfate, phenylsulfate), as well as several metabolites associated with inadequate nutrient intake, including low carnitine and B vitamin status (e.g., folic acid, vitamin B12). Interestingly, an unknown urinary metabolite was strongly correlated with Phe excretion in PKU patients (r = 0.861), which was subsequently identified as imidazole lactic acid when using high resolution MS/MS. Overall, urine profiling offers a non-invasive approach for better treatment monitoring of individual PKU patients, which can also guide the design of novel therapies that improve adherence to Phe-restricted diets without acquired nutritional deficiencies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27100271>SHP-2 Phosphatase Prevents Colonic Inflammation by Controlling Secretory Cell Differentiation and Maintaining Host- Homeostasis.</a></h1><p>Polymorphisms in the PTPN11 gene encoding for the  phosphatase SHP-2 were described in patients with ulcerative colitis.

However, the mechanisms by which SHP-2 deletion induces colonic inflammation remain to be elucidated. We generated SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice lacking Myd88 exclusively in the intestinal epithelium. The colonic phenotype was histologically analyzed and cell differentiation was determined by electron microscopy and lysozyme or Alcian blue staining.  composition was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Results show that innate defense genes including those specific to Paneth cells were strongly up-regulated in SHP-2-deficient colons. Expansion of intermediate cells (common progenitors of the Goblet and Paneth cell lineages) was found in the colon of SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice whereas Goblet cell number was clearly diminished. These alterations in Goblet/intermediate cell ratio were noticed 2 weeks after birth, before the onset of inflammation and were associated with significant alterations in  composition. Indeed, an increase in Enterobacteriaceae and a decrease in Firmicutes were observed in the colon of these mice, indicating that dysbiosis also occurred prior to inflammation. Importantly, loss of epithelial Myd88 expression inhibited colitis development in SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice, rescued Goblet/intermediate cell ratio, and prevented NFκB hyperactivation and inflammation. These data indicate that SHP-2 is functionally important for the maintenance of appropriate barrier function and host- homeostasis in the large intestine. J. Cell.

Arginine and N-carbamylglutamate can alleviate the effects of oxidative stress. However, the systematic changes in metabolic biochemistry linked to oxidative stress and arginine and N-carbamylglutamate treatment remain largely unknown. This study aims to examine the effects of arginine and N-carbamylglutamate on rat metabolism under oxidative stress. Thirty rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups (n = 10 each). The rats were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 1% arginine, or 0.1% N-carbamylglutamate for 30 days. On day 28, the rats in each treatment were intraperitoneally injected with diquat at 12 mg per kg body weight or sterile solution. Urine and plasma samples were analyzed by metabolomics. Compared with the diquat group, the arginine + diquat group had significantly lower levels of acetamide, alanine, lysine, pyruvate, , α-glucose, and β-glucose in plasma; N-carbamylglutamate + diquat had higher levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate, 3-methylhistidine, acetone, allantoin, asparagine, citrate, phenylalanine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and , and lower levels of low density lipoprotein, lipid, lysine, threonine, unsaturated lipid, urea, and very low density lipoprotein (P < 0.05) in plasma. Compared with the diquat group, the arginine + diquat group had significantly higher levels of citrate, creatinine, homogentisate, and α-ketoglutarate while lower levels of acetamide, citrulline, ethanol, glycine, isobutyrate, lactate, malonate, methymalonate, N-acetylglutamate, N-methylnicotinamide, propionate, and β-glucose (P < 0.05) in urine. Compared with the diquat group, the N-carbamylglutamate + diquat group had significantly higher levels of allantoin, citrate, homogentisate, phenylacetylglycine, α-ketoglutarate, and β-glucose while lower levels of acetamide, acetate, acetone, benzoate, citrulline, ethanol, hippurate, lactate, N-acetylglutamate, nicotinamide, ornithine, and trigonelline (P < 0.05) in urine. Overall, these results suggest that arginine and N-carbamylglutamate can alter the metabolome associated with energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut  metabolism under oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889418>METABOLIC DYSBIOSIS OF THE GUT  AND ITS BIOMARKERS.</a></h1><p>Existing methods of clustering of gut  (enterotypes, clusters, gradients), as well as the term 'phylogenetic core' do not reflect its functional activity. The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active . Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and  derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and -relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28557822>Gut  and the Gut-Brain Axis: New Insights in the Pathophysiology of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Emerging preclinical evidence has shown that the bidirectional signaling between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the brain, the so-called gut-brain axis, plays an important role in both host metabolism and behavior. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of the brain-gut axis in relation to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome.A selective literature review was conducted to evaluate GI and brain interactions.Evidence suggests reduced microbial diversity in obesity and metabolic dysregulation. However, findings of  composition in obese individuals are inconsistent, and the investigation of causality between gut  and energy homeostasis is complex because multiple variables contribute to the gut  composition. The microbial metabolites short chain fatty acids are found to exert numerous physiologic effects, including energy homeostasis through the regulation of GI hormones such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide -, and leptin. Preclinical studies show that modifying rodents'  through fecal transplantation results in alterations of these GI hormones and subsequently an altered metabolism and behavior. However, whether and to what extent preclinical findings translate to human metabolism is unclear.One of the major limitations and challenges in this field of research is interindividual variability of the microbiome. Future research needs to combine recent insights gained into tracking the dynamics of the microbiome as well as the metabolic responses. Furthermore, advanced mapping of the human microbiome is required to investigate the metabolic implications of the gut-brain axis to develop targeted interventions for obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27966574>Acute increases in serum colonic short-chain fatty acids elicited by inulin do not increase GLP-1 or PYY responses but may reduce ghrelin in lean and overweight humans.</a></h1><p>Colonic fermentation of dietary fibre to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) influences appetite hormone secretion in animals, but SCFA production is excessive in obese animals. This suggests there may be resistance to the effect of SCFA on appetite hormones in obesity.To determine the effects of inulin (IN) and resistant starch (RS) on postprandial SCFA, and gut hormone (glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), peptide-- (PYY) and ghrelin) responses in healthy overweight/obese (OWO) vs lean (LN) humans.Overnight-fasted participants (13 OWO and 12 LN) consumed 300 ml water containing 75 g glucose (GLU) as control or 75 g GLU plus 24 g IN, or 28.2 g RS using a randomised, single-blind, cross-over design. Blood for appetite hormones and SCFA was collected at intervals over 6 h. A standard lunch was served 4 h after the test drink.Relative to GLU, IN, but not RS, significantly increased SCFA areas under the curve (AUC) from 4-6 h (AUC). Neither IN nor RS affected GLP-1 or PYY-AUC. Although neither IN nor RS reduced ghrelin-AUC compared with GLU, ghrelin at 6 h after IN was significantly lower than that after GLU (P<0.05). After IN, relative to GLU, the changes in SCFA-AUC were negatively related to the changes in ghrelin-AUC (P=0.017). SCFA and hormone responses did not differ significantly between LN and OWO.Acute increases in colonic SCFA do not affect GLP-1 or PYY responses in LN or OWO subjects, but may reduce ghrelin. The results do not support the hypothesis that SCFA acutely stimulate PYY and GLP-1 secretion; however, a longer adaptation to increased colonic fermentation or a larger sample size may yield different results.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24936363>The pyrE Gene as a Bidirectional Selection Marker in Bifidobacterium Longum 105-A.</a></h1><p>We constructed a deletion mutant of the pyrE gene in Bifidobacterium longum 105-A. A pyrE knockout cassette was cloned into pKKT427, a Bifidobacterium-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, and then introduced into B. longum 105-A by electroporation. The transformants were propagated and spread onto MRS plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) and uracil. 5-FOA-resistant mutants were obtained at a frequency of 4.7 × 10(-5) integrations per cell. To perform pyrE gene complementation, the pyrE gene was amplified by PCR and used to construct a complementation plasmid (pKKT427-pyrE (+)). B. longum 105-A ∆pyrE harboring this plasmid could not grow on MRS plates containing 5-FOA, uracil and spectinomycin. We also developed a chemically defined medium (bifidobacterial minimal medium; BMM) containing inorganic salts, glucose, vitamins, isoleucine and  for positive selection of pyrE transformants. B. longum 105-A ∆pyrE could not grow on BMM agar, but the same strain harboring pKKT427-pyrE (+) could. Thus, pyrE can be used as a counterselection marker in B. longum 105-A and potentially other Bifidobacterium species as well. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this system by constructing a knockout mutant of the xynF gene in B. longum 105-A by using the pyrE gene as a counterselection marker.

Although these small molecules commonly reach concentrations similar to those achieved by pharmaceutical agents, remarkably little is known about the microbial metabolic pathways that produce them. Here we use a combination of genetics and metabolic profiling to characterize a pathway from the gut symbiont Clostridium sporogenes that generates aromatic amino acid metabolites. Our results reveal that this pathway produces twelve compounds, nine of which are known to accumulate in host serum. All three aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and ) serve as substrates for the pathway, and it involves branching and alternative reductases for specific intermediates. By genetically manipulating C. sporogenes, we modulate serum levels of these metabolites in gnotobiotic mice, and show that in turn this affects intestinal permeability and systemic immunity. This work has the potential to provide the basis of a systematic effort to engineer the molecular output of the gut bacterial community.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991686>Strategies to Improve Cancer Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Efficacy, Other Than Abscopal Effect: A Systematic Review.</a></h1><p>Despite that the impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors on malignancies treatment is unprecedented, a lack of response to these molecules is observed in several cases. Differently from melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors results in a high efficacy, the response rate in other tumors, such as gastrointestinal cancers, breast cancer, sarcomas, and part of genitourinary cancers remains low. The first strategy evaluated to improve the response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors is the use of predictive factors for the response such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and clinical features. In addition to the identification of the patients with a higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules, another approach currently under intensive investigation is the use of therapeutics in a combinatory manner with immune checkpoint inhibitors in order to obtain an enhancement of efficacy through the modification of the tumor immune microenvironment. In addition to the abscopal effect induced by radiotherapy, a lot of studies are evaluating several drugs able to improve the response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including  modifiers, drugs targeting co-inhibitory receptors, anti-angiogenic therapeutics, small molecules, and oncolytic viruses. In view of the rapid and extensive development of this research field, we conducted a systematic review of the literature identifying which of these drugs are closer to achieving validation in the clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197506>Effects of a formula with a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis Supplement on the gut  of low birth weight infants.</a></h1><p>Low birth weight (LBW) infants have a less diverse gut , enriched in potential pathogens, which places them at high risk of systemic inflammation diseases. This study aimed to identify the differences in gut bacterial community structure between LBW infants who received probiotics and LBW infants who did not receive probiotics.Forty-one infants were allocated to the non-probiotic group (N group) and 56 infants to the probiotic group (P group), according to whether the formula they received contained a probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis. Gut bacterial composition was identified with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples collected at 14 days after birth.There was no significant difference between the alpha diversity of the two groups, while the beta diversity was significantly different (p < 0.05). Our results showed that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (both p < 0.05) were enriched in the P group, while Veillonella, Dolosigranulum and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (all p < 0.05) were enriched in the N group. Predicted metagenome function analysis revealed enhancement of fatty acids, peroxisome, starch, alanine,  and peroxisome pathways in the P group, and enhancement of plant pathogen, Salmonella and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways in the N group.Probiotic supplement in formula may affect the composition, stability and function of LBW infants' gut .

Constipation is currently recognized as a risk factor of PD in relation to the number of evacuation per week and its severity. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that constipation may precede the occurrence of motor symptoms underlying an earlier involvement of the enteric nervous system and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the α-synuclein pathology. In PD, constipation is mainly due to slower colonic transit or puborectalis dyssynergia, but the concomitant use of antiparkinsonian, pain, and antidepressant medications may worsen it. An accurate diagnosis and an adequate treatment of constipation it is pivotal to prevent complications such as intestinal occlusion and to ensure an optimal clinical response to levodopa.© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Olives belonging to Nocellara Etnea cv were processed in a 6% NaCl brine and inoculated with six different bacterial cultures, using selected strains belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus pentosus species. The fermentation process was strongly influenced by the added starters and the identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated throughout the process confirms that L. pentosus dominated all fermentations, followed by L. plantarum, whereas L. casei was never detected. Pathogens were never found, while histamine and  were detected in control and in two experimental samples. The samples with the lowest final pH values showed a safer profile and the most appreciated sensory traits. The present study highlights that selected starters promote prevalence of L. pentosus over the autochthonous  throughout the whole process of Nocellara Etnea olives.Copyright © 2018.

Monitoring dynamic changes of cometabolites can provide a more comprehensive understanding of pathophysiology. Here, a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was performed for the analysis of aromatic amino acids and their gut -host cometabolites in rat serum and urine. In the developed method, seven key gut -host cometabolites were chromatographically separated on a Kinetex Phenyl-Hexyl column by gradient elution, and the run time was 6 min. Serum and urine were extracted by protein precipitation. This method was linear between 10.20 and 1000.00 ng/mL for phenylalanine and p-cresyl sulfate; 25.60-2500.00 ng/mL for tryptophan; 51.20-5000.00 ng/mL for , indole, and indoxyl sulfate; and 75.50-7500.00 ng/mL for p-cresol. The linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery of seven analytes were all satisfactory. The method was sufficiently sensitive and robust. It was successfully applied to characterize the alterations of gut -host cometabolites in inflammatory disorders. All of these results suggest that the developed method is able to simultaneously monitor aromatic amino acids and their gut -host cometabolites. This method will be expected to be a valuable tool for clinical researches and comprehensive studies of the pathophysiological roles.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Some uremic toxins result from nutrient processing by gut , yielding precursors of uremic toxins or uremic toxins themselves, such as trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO), p-cresyl sulphate, indoxyl sulphate and indole-3 acetic acid. Increased intake of some nutrients may modify the gut , increasing the number of bacteria that process them to yield uremic toxins. Circulating levels of nutrient-derived uremic toxins are associated to increased risk of CKD progression. This offers the opportunity for therapeutic intervention by either modifying the diet, modifying the , decreasing uremic toxin production by , increasing toxin excretion or targeting specific uremic toxins. We now review the link between nutrients,  and uremic toxin with CKD progression. Specific focus will be placed on the generation specific uremic toxins with nephrotoxic potential, the decreased availability of bacteria-derived metabolites with nephroprotective potential, such as vitamin K and butyrate and the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking these toxins and protective factors to kidney diseases.

However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the action mechanisms underlying the protective effects of UDCA and vitamin E against liver dysfunction using metabolomics and metagenomic analysis. In this study, we analysed blood and urine samples from patients with obesity and liver dysfunction. Nine patients were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (300 mg twice daily), and 10 subjects received vitamin E (400 IU twice daily) for 8 weeks. UDCA significantly improved the liver function scores after 4 weeks of treatment and effectively reduced hepatic deoxycholic acid and serum microRNA-122 levels. To better understand its protective mechanism, a global metabolomics study was conducted, and we found that UDCA regulated uremic toxins (hippuric acid, p-cresol sulphate, and indole-derived metabolites), antioxidants (ascorbate sulphate and N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and the phenylalanine/ pathway. Furthermore, microbiome involvement, particularly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was demonstrated through metagenomic analysis of bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles. Meanwhile, vitamin E treatment did not result in such alterations, except that it reduced uremic toxins and liver dysfunction.

A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an altered intestinal  plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in CD patients. We detected inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD.

Arguably, among the most intriguing and enigmatic of these micronutrients is queuine, an elaborate 7-deazaguanine derivative made exclusively by eubacteria and salvaged by animal, plant and fungal species. In eubacteria and eukaryotes, queuine is found as the sugar nucleotide queuosine within the anticodon loop of transfer RNA isoacceptors for the amino acids , asparagine, aspartic acid and histidine. The physiological requirement for the ancient queuine molecule and queuosine modified transfer RNA has been the subject of varied scientific interrogations for over four decades, establishing relationships to development, proliferation, metabolism, cancer, and  biosynthesis in eukaryotes and to invasion and proliferation in pathogenic bacteria, in addition to ribosomal frameshifting in viruses. These varied effects may be rationalized by an important, if ill-defined, contribution to protein translation or may manifest from other presently unidentified mechanisms.

Here, we investigated the influence of PTPN2 and PTPN22 gene variants on intestinal  composition in IBD patients.Bacterial DNA from mucosa-associated samples of 75 CD and 57 UC patients were sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Microbial analysis, including alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomical analysis by comparing to PTPN2 (rs1893217) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genotypes was performed in QIIME, the phyloseq R package and MaAsLin pipeline.In PTPN2 variant UC patients, we detected an increase in relative abundance of unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae families and reduction of Roseburia when compared to PTPN2 wild-type (WT) patients. Ruminoccocus was increased in PTPN22 variant UC patients. In CD patients with severe disease course, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, unclassified Erysipelotrichaeceae, unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae families were reduced and Bacteroides were increased in PTPN2 WT carriers, while Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, and Erysipelotrichaeceae were reduced in PTPN22 WT patients when compared to patients with mild disease. In UC patients with severe disease, relative abundance of Lachnobacterium was reduced in PTPN2 and PTPN22 WT patients, Dorea was increased in samples from PTPN22 WT carriers and an unassigned genus from Ruminococcaceae gen. was increased in patients with PTPN2 variant genotype.We identified that IBD-associated genetic risk variants, disease severity and the interaction of these factors are related to significant alterations in intestinal  composition of IBD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27087596>Systemic Characterization of an Obese Phenotype in the Zucker Rat Model Defining Metabolic Axes of Energy Metabolism and Host-Microbial Interactions.</a></h1><p>The Zucker (fa/fa) rat is a valuable and extensively utilized model for obesity research. However, the metabolic networks underlying the systemic response in the obese Zucker rats remain to be elucidated. This information is important to further our understanding of the circulation of the microbial or host-microbial metabolites and their impact on host metabolism. (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling was used to probe global metabolic differences in portal vein and peripheral blood plasma, urine and fecal water between obese (fa/fa, n = 12) and lean (fa/+, n = 12) Zucker rats. Urinary concentrations of host-microbial co-metabolites were found to be significantly higher in lean Zucker rats. Higher concentrations of fecal lactate, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 3-hydroxyphenyl propionic acid and glycerol, and lower levels of valine and glycine were observed in obese rats compared with lean animals. Regardless of phenotype, concentrations of SCFAs, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, and choline metabolites were higher in portal vein blood compared to peripheral blood. However, higher levels of succinate, phenylalanine and  were observed in portal vein blood compared with peripheral blood from lean rats but not in obese rats. Our findings indicate that the absorption of propionate, acetate, choline, and trimethylamine is independent of the Zucker rat phenotypes. However, urinary host-microbial co-metabolites were highly associated with phenotypes, suggesting distinct gut microbial metabolic activities in lean and obese Zucker rats.

Despite its widespread use, little is understood of its impact on the gut , an important environmental factor that can mediate metabolism and subsequent obesity and disease risk. Furthermore, given previous reports of dysbiosis with some artificial low-calorie sweeteners, we wanted to understand whether prebiotic consumption could rescue potential stevia-mediated changes in gut . Three-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to consume: (1) Water (CTR); (2) Rebaudioside A (STV); (3) prebiotic (PRE); (4) Rebaudioside A + prebiotic (SP) ( = 8/group) for 9 weeks. Rebaudioside was added to drinking water and prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin added to control diet (10%). Body weight and feces were collected weekly and food and fluid intake biweekly. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests, gut permeability tests, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and tissue harvest were performed at age 12 weeks. Rebaudioside A consumption alone did not alter weight gain or glucose tolerance compared to CTR. Rebaudioside A did, however, alter gut  composition and reduce nucleus accumbens  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels compared to CTR. Prebiotic animals, alone or with Rebaudioside A, had reduced fat mass, food intake, and gut permeability and cecal SCFA concentration. Adding Rebaudioside A did not interfere with the benefits of the prebiotic except for a significant reduction in cecal weight. Long-term low-dose Rebaudioside A consumption had little effect on glucose metabolism and weight gain; however, its impact on gut microbial taxa should be further examined in populations exhibiting dysbiosis such as obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9145444>Investigations of bifidobacterial ecology and oligosaccharide metabolism in a three-stage compound continuous culture system.</a></h1><p>Several different types of in vitro fermentation systems are currently employed to investigate pro- and prebiotic activities in the human large intestinal , ranging from simple batch cultures, with or without stirring and pH control, to more complex models involving pH controlled single and multiple-component continuous culture systems.In this investigation, we used a three-stage continuous culture model to study the activities of colonic bacteria. This fermentation system reproduces several of the nutritional and environmental characteristics of the proximal large intestine (vessel 1) and the distal colon (vessels 2 and 3), and was validated using bacteriological, metabolic and chemical measurements made with intestinal material obtained from different regions of the large bowel. In this paper, we report studies on prospective probiotic effects of Bifidobacterium longum NCFB 2259 in relation to other bacterial populations, production of  and phenylalanine metabolites, and bacterial synthesis of enzymes involved in the formation of putatively genotoxic metabolites, including beta-glucosidase (GS), arylsulphatase (AS), beta-glucuronidase (GN), nitroreductase (NR) and azoreductase (AR).Bacterial activities at two different retention times were studied (31.1 and 68.4 h), which correspond to large intestinal transit times. At R = 31.4 h, significant probiotic effects were observed with respect to reductions in GS and GN, upon adding B. longum. However, despite the fact that this organism does not ferment aromatic amino acids or produce significant amounts of genotoxic enzymes, dysbiotic manifestations occurred in that both NR synthesis and dissimilatory  metabolism were stimulated. In contrast, at R = 68.4 h, GS formation increased between five and 20-fold, while GN and NR activities increased by a factor of two after adding the bifidobacterium. These data are reviewed in relation to potential health hazards that may be encountered with long-term probiotic administration. In the prebiotic experiments, the three-stage fermentation system was operated at R = 65 h. Oligofructose was added to V1 to give an initial concentration of 30 grams per litre, when the system was in steady state, to study its effects on a number of experimental parameters including bifidogenicity, bacterial growth, fermentation product formation and mutagenicity. After addition of the oligosaccharide, a multiplicity of effects were observed in V1, where synthesis of NR and AR, bifidobacterial populations and overall fermentation processes were stimulated, although these influences progressively diminished in V2 and V3.These studies indicate that bacterial metabolism and putative beneficial consequences associated with the breakdown of readily fermentable prebiotics in the large intestine may in some circumstances be spatially and temporally limited to the proximal bowel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034912>In vitro impact of amino acid-derived bacterial metabolites on colonocyte mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress response and DNA integrity.</a></h1><p>4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HO-PAA) is produced by intestinal  from . High concentrations in human fecal water have been associated with cytotoxicity, urging us to test HO-PAA's effects on human colonocytes. We compared these effects with those of phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenol and acetaldehyde, also issued from amino acids fermentation.HT-29 Glc human colonocytes were exposed for 24 h to metabolites at concentrations between 350 and 1000 μM for HO-PAA and PAA, 250-1500 μM for phenol and 25-500 μM for acetaldehyde. We evaluated metabolites'cytotoxicity with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and DNA quantification assays, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production with H2DCF-DA, and DNA damage with the comet assay. We measured cell oxygen consumption and mitochondrial complexes activity by polarography.Although HO-PAA displayed no cytotoxic effect on colonocytes, it decreased mitochondrial complex I activity and oxygen consumption. This was paralleled by an increase in ROS production and DNA alteration. Cells pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, decreased genotoxic effects of HO-PAA, indicating implication of oxidative stress in HO-PAA's genotoxicity. PAA and phenol did not reproduce these effects, but were cytotoxic towards colonocytes. Last, acetaldehyde displayed no effect in terms of cytotoxicity and mitochondrial metabolic activity, but increased DNA damage.Several bacterial metabolites produced from amino acids displayed deleterious effects on human colonocytes, in terms of genotoxicity (HO-PAA and acetaldehyde) or cytotoxicity (PAA and phenol).This study helps understanding the consequences of intestinal 's metabolic activity on the host since amino acids fermentation can lead to the formation of compounds toxic towards colonic epithelial cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We undertook this study to identify HLA-B27-dependent changes in both host and microbial metabolites in the HLA-B27/β -microglobulin (β m)-transgenic rat and to determine whether -derived metabolites could impact disease in this major model of spondyloarthritis.Cecal contents were collected from Fischer 344 33-3 HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats and wild-type controls at 6 weeks (before disease) and 16 weeks (with active bowel inflammation). Metabolomic profiling was performed by high-throughput gas and liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometry. HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats were treated with the microbial metabolites propionate or butyrate in drinking water for 10 weeks, and disease activity was subsequently assessed.Our screen identified 582 metabolites, of which more than half were significantly altered by HLA-B27 expression at 16 weeks. Both microbial and host metabolites were altered, with multiple pathways affected, including those for amino acid, carbohydrate, xenobiotic, and medium-chain fatty acid metabolism. Differences were even observed at 6 weeks, with up-regulation of histidine, , spermidine, N-acetylmuramate, and glycerate in HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats. Administration of the short-chain fatty acid propionate significantly attenuated HLA-B27-associated inflammatory disease, although this was not associated with increased FoxP3+ T cell induction or with altered expression of the immunomodulatory cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) or IL-33 or of the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1. HLA-B27 expression was also associated with altered host expression of messenger RNA for the microbial metabolite receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), FFAR3, and niacin receptor 1.HLA-B27 expression profoundly impacts the intestinal metabolome, with changes evident in rats even at age 6 weeks. Critically, we demonstrate that a microbial metabolite, propionate, attenuates development of HLA-B27-associated inflammatory disease. These and other -derived bioactive mediators may provide novel treatment modalities in HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthritides.© 2017, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107248>Protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 modulates colitis in a -dependent manner.</a></h1><p>The gut  is crucial for our health, and well-balanced interactions between the host's immune system and the  are essential to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation, as observed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A variant in protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is associated with reduced risk of developing IBD, but promotes the onset of autoimmune disorders. While the role of PTPN22 in modulating molecular pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis is well studied, its impact on shaping the intestinal  has not been addressed in depth. Here, we demonstrate that mice carrying the PTPN22 variant (619W mice) were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, but suffered from pronounced inflammation upon chronic DSS treatment. The basal  composition was distinct between genotypes, and DSS-induced dysbiosis was milder in 619W mice than in WT littermates. Transfer of  from 619W mice after the first DSS cycle into treatment-naive 619W mice promoted colitis, indicating that changes in microbial composition enhanced chronic colitis in those animals. This indicates that presence of the PTPN22 variant affects intestinal inflammation by modulating the host's response to the intestinal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696813>Altered gut metabolome contributes to depression-like behaviors in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress.</a></h1><p>The gut  has been increasingly correlated with depressive disorder. It was recently shown that the transplantation of the gut  from depressed patients to animals can produce depressive-like behaviors, suggesting that the gut  plays a causal role in the development of depression. In addition, metabolic disorder, which is strongly associated with depression, is exacerbated by changes in the composition of the gut  and is alleviated by treatment with antidepressants. However, the key players and pathways that link the gut  to the pathogenesis of depression remain largely unknown. To evaluate the relationships between depression and metabolic disorders in feces and plasma, we monitored changes in fecal and plasma metabolomes during the development of depressive-like behaviors in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). In these animals, the fecal metabolome was altered first and subjected to changes in the plasma metabolome. Changes in the abundance of fecal metabolites were associated with depressive-like behaviors and with altered levels of neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the analysis of the fecal metabolome and the fecal  in CUMS rats demonstrated consistent changes in the levels of several amino acids, including L-threonine, isoleucine, alanine, serine, , and oxidized proline. Finally, we observed significant correlations between these amino acids and the altered fecal . The results of this study suggest that changes in amino acid metabolism by the gut  contribute to changes in circulating amino acids and are associated with the behavior indices of depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28449715>Functional implications of microbial and viral gut metagenome changes in early stage L-DOPA-naïve Parkinson's disease patients.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) presently is conceptualized as a protein aggregation disease in which pathology involves both the enteric and the central nervous system, possibly spreading from one to another via the vagus nerves. As gastrointestinal dysfunction often precedes or parallels motor symptoms, the enteric system with its vast diversity of microorganisms may be involved in PD pathogenesis. Alterations in the enteric microbial taxonomic level of L-DOPA-naïve PD patients might also serve as a biomarker.We performed metagenomic shotgun analyses and compared the fecal microbiomes of 31 early stage, L-DOPA-naïve PD patients to 28 age-matched controls.We found increased Verrucomicrobiaceae (Akkermansia muciniphila) and unclassified Firmicutes, whereas Prevotellaceae (Prevotella copri) and Erysipelotrichaceae (Eubacterium biforme) were markedly lowered in PD samples. The observed differences could reliably separate PD from control with a ROC-AUC of 0.84. Functional analyses of the metagenomes revealed differences in  metabolism in PD involving the ẞ-glucuronate and tryptophan metabolism. While the abundances of prophages and plasmids did not differ between PD and controls, total virus abundance was decreased in PD participants. Based on our analyses, the intake of either a MAO inhibitor, amantadine, or a dopamine agonist (which in summary relates to 90% of PD patients) had no overall influence on taxa abundance or microbial functions.Our data revealed differences of colonic  and of  metabolism between PD patients and controls at an unprecedented detail not achievable through 16S sequencing. The findings point to a yet unappreciated aspect of PD, possibly involving the intestinal barrier function and immune function in PD patients.

The microbiome impacts strongly on the metabolic phenotypes of the host, and hence, metabolic readouts can give insights into functional metagenomic activity. We applied an untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) based metabonomics approach to profile normal Wistar rats exposed to a broad spectrum β-lactam antibiotic imipenem/cilastatin sodium, at 50 mg/kg/daily for 4 days followed by a 14-day recovery period. In-depth metabolic phenotyping allowed identification of a panel of 202 urinary and 223 fecal metabolites significantly related to end points of a functional metagenome (p < 0.05 in at least one day), many of which have not been previously reported such as oligopeptides and carbohydrates. This study shows extensive gut  modulation of host systemic metabolism involving short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan,  metabolism, and possibly a compensatory mechanism of indole-melatonin production. Given the integral nature of the mammalian genome and metagenome, this panel of metabolites will provide a new platform for potential therapeutic markers and mechanistic solutions to complex problems commonly encountered in pathology, toxicology, or drug metabolism studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26181352>Fusobacterium nucleatum and T Cells in Colorectal Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Evidence indicates a complex link between gut microbiome, immunity, and intestinal tumorigenesis. To target the  and immunity for colorectal cancer prevention and therapy, a better understanding of the relationship between microorganisms and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is needed. Experimental evidence suggests that Fusobacterium nucleatum may promote colonic neoplasia development by downregulating antitumor T cell-mediated adaptive immunity.To test the hypothesis that a greater amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue is associated with a lower density of T cells in tumor tissue.A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 598 rectal and colon carcinoma cases in 2 US nationwide prospective cohort studies with follow-up through 2006, the Nurses' Health Study (participants enrolled in 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (participants enrolled in 1986). Tissue collection and processing were performed from 2002 through 2008, and immunity assessment, 2008 through 2009. From 2013 through 2014, the amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay; we equally dichotomized positive cases (high vs low). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted in 2014 to assess associations of the amount of F nucleatum with densities (quartiles) of T cells in tumor tissue, controlling for clinical and tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation status. We adjusted the 2-sided α level to .013 for multiple hypothesis testing.Densities of CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO (protein  phosphatase receptor type C [PTPRC])+, and FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissue, determined by means of tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis and computer-assisted image analysis.F nucleatum was detected in colorectal carcinoma tissue in 76 (13%) of 598 cases. Compared with F nucleatum-negative cases, F nucleatum-high cases were inversely associated with the density of CD3+ T cells (for a unit increase in quartile categories of CD3+ T cells as an outcome: multivariable odds ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.26-0.87]; P for trend = .006). The amount of F nucleatum was not significantly associated with the density of CD8+, CD45RO+, or FOXP3+ T cells (P fortrend = .24, .88, and .014, respectively).The amount of tissue F nucleatum is inversely associated with CD3+ T-cell density in colorectal carcinoma tissue.

Among the 54 LAB strains tested, six (five lactobacilli and one oenococci) were biogenic amine producers in both media. Histamine and tyramine were the amines formed by the LAB strains investigated. Lactobacillus diolivorans were the most intensive histamine producers. This species together with Lactobacillus collinoides and Oenococcus oeni also seemed to produce tyramine. No ability to form histamine, tyramine or putrescine by Pediococus parvulus was observed, although it is a known biogenic amine producer in wines and beers.This study demonstrated that LAB  growing in ciders had the ability to produce biogenic amines, particularly histamine and tyramine, and suggests that this capability might be strain-dependent rather than being related to a particular bacterial species.Production of biogenic amines by food micro-organisms has continued to be the focus of intensive study because of their potential toxicity.

The mechanisms whereby BPD/DS exerts its positive metabolic effects have however yet to be fully delineated. The objective of this study was to distinguish the effects of the two components of BPD/DS, namely the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and the DS derivation, on gut , and to appraise whether changes in microbial composition are linked with surgery-induced metabolic benefits.BPD/DS, DS, and SG were performed in Wistar rats fed a standard chow diet. Body weight and energy intake were measured daily during 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide   (PYY), insulin, and glucose were measured. Fecal samples were collected prior to surgery and at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery. Intraluminal contents of the alimentary, biliopancreatic, and common limbs (resulting from BPD/DS) were taken from the proximal portion of each limb. Fecal and small intestinal limb samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.BPD/DS and DS led to lower digestible energy intake (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0002, respectively), reduced weight gain (P < 0.0001) and body fat mass (P < 0.0001), improved glucose metabolism, and increased GLP-1 (P = 0.0437, SHAM versus DS) and PYY levels (P < 0.0001). These effects were associated with major alterations of both the fecal and small intestinal , as revealed by significant decrease in bacterial richness and diversity at 2 (P < 0.0001, Chao1 index; P < 0.0001, Shannon index) and 8 weeks (P = 0.0159, SHAM versus DS, Chao1 index; P = 0.0219, SHAM versus DS, P = 0.0472, SHAM versus BPD/DS, Shannon index) post-surgery in BPD/DS and DS, and increased proportions of Bifidobacteriales (a 60% increase in both groups) but reduced Clostridiales (a 50% decrease and a 90% decrease respectively), which were mostly accounted at the genus level by higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in both the fecal and intestinal limb samples, as well as reduced abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in the small intestine. Those effects were not seen in SG rats.The metabolic benefits following BPD/DS are seemingly due to the DS component of the surgery. Furthermore, BPD/DS causes marked alterations in fecal and small intestinal  resulting in reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Our data further suggest that increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and reduced level of two Clostridiales species in the gut  might contribute to the positive metabolic outcomes of BPD/DS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25162370>Metabolomic strategy for the detection of metabolic effects of spermine supplementation in weaned rats.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of spermine supplementation on weaned rat metabolism. A metabolomic strategy employing high-resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis was used to investigate rat biological responses to spermine ingestion. Rats received intragastric administration of either 0.2 or 0.4 μmol/g body weight of spermine or saline for 3 days. Plasma samples taken 48 h after the last spermine ingestion were analyzed. Spermine supplementation significantly increased the plasma levels of 1-methylhistidine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, glutamate, glycerolphosphocholine, phosphorylcholine, myo-inositol, phenylalanine, lysine, glutamine, trimethylanine, , valine, formate, glucose, and lipids. These results suggest that spermine ingestion can alter common systemic metabolic processes, including cell membrane metabolism, lipid metabolism, glucose-alanine cycle metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut  metabolism. This study also shows the important role of spermine administration in modulating the metabolism of weaned rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579705>Chronic stress-induced gut dysfunction exacerbates Parkinson's disease phenotype and pathology in a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence provides support for involvement of the -gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. We propose that a pro-inflammatory intestinal milieu, due to intestinal hyper-permeability and/or microbial dysbiosis, initiates or exacerbates PD pathogenesis. One factor that can cause intestinal hyper-permeability and dysbiosis is chronic stress which has been shown to accelerate neuronal degeneration and motor deficits in Parkinsonism rodent models. We hypothesized that stress-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis lead to a pro-inflammatory milieu that exacerbates the PD phenotype in the low-dose oral rotenone PD mice model. To test this hypothesis, mice received unpredictable restraint stress (RS) for 12 weeks, and during the last six weeks mice also received a daily administration of low-dose rotenone (10 mg/kg/day) orally. The initial six weeks of RS caused significantly higher urinary cortisol, intestinal hyperpermeability, and decreased abundance of putative "anti-inflammatory" bacteria (Lactobacillus) compared to non-stressed mice. Rotenone alone (i.e., without RS) disrupted the colonic expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1, increased oxidative stress (N-), increased myenteric plexus enteric glial cell GFAP expression and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) protein levels in the colon compared to controls. Restraint stress exacerbated these rotenone-induced changes. Specifically, RS potentiated rotenone-induced effects in the colon including: 1) intestinal hyper-permeability, 2) disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin1), 3) oxidative stress (N-), 4) inflammation in glial cells (GFAP + enteric glia cells), 5) α-syn, 6) increased relative abundance of fecal Akkermansia (mucin-degrading Gram-negative bacteria), and 7) endotoxemia. In addition, RS promoted a number of rotenone-induced effects in the brain including: 1) reduced number of resting microglia and a higher number of dystrophic/phagocytic microglia as well as (FJ-C+) dying cells in the substantia nigra (SN), 2) increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reactivity in the SN, and 3) reduced dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites (DOPAC, HVA) in the striatum compared to control mice. Our findings support a model in which chronic stress-induced, gut-derived, pro-inflammatory milieu exacerbates the PD phenotype via a dysfunctional -gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, research interests usually focus on biologic activities of the in vivo available herb-derived components and their exposure in circulation. In this study, we illustrated the importance of studying the presystemic interplay with gut  for understanding the holistic actions of medicinal herbs by using calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (C7G), the most abundant flavonoid and chemical marker in Astragali Radix, as a model compound. When C7G was orally administrated to rats, calycosin-3'-O-glucuronide (G2) was the major circulating component in the blood together with a minor calycosin but not C7G. Rat gut  hydrolyzed C7G in vitro rapidly and produced its aglycone calycosin. Calycosin exhibited higher permeability than C7G and further underwent extensive glucuronidation to yield 3'-glucuronide as the dominant metabolite. Bioactivity assays revealed that G2 exhibited similar or more potent proangiogenic effects than calycosin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor II-induced blood vessel loss model in zebrafish. More interestingly, the incubation of C7G with gut  from both normal and colitic rats showed a probiotics-like effect through stimulating the growth of the beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, C7G interacts reciprocally with gut  after oral dosing, which makes it not only an angiogenic prodrug but also a modulator of gut .Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321331>An Increased Abundance of Clostridiaceae Characterizes Arthritis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cross-sectional Study.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of heterogeneous inflammatory conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Although there is considerable evidence linking the gut  to intestinal inflammation, there is limited knowledge on its potential role in the development of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD.Four groups of patients were included: IBD-associated arthropathy (IBD-A); IBD without arthropathy (IBD-N); rheumatoid arthritis (RA); and non-IBD, nonarthritis controls. DNA from stool samples was isolated and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Paired-end reads were quality-controlled using SHI7 and processed with SHOGUN. Abundance and diversity analyses were performed using QIIME, and compositional biomarker identification was performed using LEfSe.One hundred eighty patients were included in the analysis. IBD-A was associated with an increased abundance of microbial  degradation pathways when compared with IBD-N (P = 0.02), whereas IBD-A and RA patients both shared an increased abundance of Clostridiaceae when compared with controls (P = 0.045). We found that history of bowel surgery was a significant source of variability (P = 0.001) among all IBD patients and was associated with decreased alpha diversity and increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.004).An increased abundance of gut microbial  degradation pathways was associated with IBD-A. An increased abundance of Clostridiaceae was shared by both IBD-A and RA patients and suggests a potentially common microbial link for inflammatory arthritis. The increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, previously reported in IBD, may be due to the effects of previous bowel surgery and highlights the importance of controlling for this variable in future studies.© 2018 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Catecholamines provide a survival advantage allowing adaptation to common postnatal stressors. We aimed to explore the potential link between gut /gut-derived metabolites and sympathoadrenal stress responsivity.The effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemia was compared in mice with (control, adapted control) and without microbiome (germ-free, GF). Counter-regulatory hormones were analyzed in urine and plasma. Adrenal gene expression levels were evaluated and correlated to cecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA) content.There was a significant association between absent /SCFA and epinephrine levels at baseline and after stress. Corticosterone (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and glucagon release (parasympathetic signaling) were similar in all groups. Hypoglycemia-induced c-Fos (marker of trans-synaptic neuronal activation) in both conditions. Delayed increases in adrenal  hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y messenger RNA were observed in GF mice. Transcriptome analysis provided insight into underlying mechanisms for attenuated epinephrine production and release.Lack of microbiome selectively impaired adrenal catecholamine responses to hypoglycemia. We speculate that absent/delayed acquisition of flora (e.g., after antibiotic exposure) may compromise sympathoadrenal stress responsivity.

We used one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for RNA samples to screen for the KIF5B-MET fusion in 206 lung adenocarcinoma and 28 pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma patients. Genomic breakpoints of KIF5B-MET were determined by targeted next-generation sequencing. Soft agar colony formation assays, proliferation assays, and a xenograft mouse model were used to investigate its oncogenic activity. In addition, specific MET inhibitors were administered to evaluate their anti-tumor activities. A KIF5B-MET fusion variant in a patient with a mixed-type adenocarcinoma and sarcomatoid tumor was identified, and another case was found in a pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma patient. Both cases carried the same chimeric gene, a fusion between exons 1-24 of KIF5B and exons 15-21 of MET. KIF5B-MET-overexpressing cells exhibited significantly increased proliferation and colony-forming ability. Xenograft tumors harboring the fusion gene demonstrated significantly elevated tumor growth. Ectopic expression of the fusion gene stimulated the phosphorylation of KIF5B-MET as well as downstream STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The MET inhibitors significantly repressed cell proliferation; phosphorylation of downstream STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2; and xenograft tumorigenicity. In conclusion, the KIF5B-MET variant was demonstrated to have an oncogenic function in cancer cells. These findings have immediate clinical implications for the targeted therapy of subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Metabolic profiles can provide functional information on host-microbe interactions in the lungs. We investigated the relationship between the respiratory  and metabolic profiles in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected outpatients.Targeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to analyze the bacterial community structure and liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to detect features in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Global integration of all metabolic features with microbial species was done using sparse partial least squares regression. Thirty-nine HIV-infected subjects and 20 HIV-uninfected controls without acute respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Twelve mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) features from C18 analysis were significantly different between HIV-infected individuals and controls (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.2); another 79 features were identified by network analysis. Further metabolite analysis demonstrated that four features were significantly overrepresented in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of HIV-infected individuals compared to HIV-uninfected, including cystine, two complex carbohydrates, and 3,5-dibromo-. There were 231 m/z features significantly associated with peripheral blood CD4 cell counts identified using sparse partial least squares regression (sPLS) at a variable importance on projection (VIP) threshold of 2. Twenty-five percent of these 91 m/z features were associated with various microbial species. Bacteria from families Caulobacteraceae, Staphylococcaceae, Nocardioidaceae, and genus Streptococcus were associated with the greatest number of features. Glycerophospholipid and lineolate pathways correlated with these bacteria.In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, specific metabolic profiles correlated with bacterial organisms known to play a role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia in HIV-infected individuals.

Since antibiotic exposure can adversely affect the microbiome, we hypothesized that antibiotic effects on the gut  and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we examined the effects of antibiotic treatments, including vancomycin (Vanc) and ciprofloxacin-metronidazole (CiMe), on the gut microbiome and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in both male and female mice. We found that the relative abundances and structural composition of  were significantly reduced in female mice after both Vanc and CiMe treatments but in male mice only after treatment with Vanc. However, Vanc exposure considerably altered the relative abundances and structural composition of representatives of the  especially in male mice. The levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; acetate, butyrate, and propionate) in colonic contents and tissues were significantly decreased in female mice after both antibiotic treatments, while these reductions were detected in male mice only after Vanc treatment. However, another SCFA, formate, exhibited the opposite tendency in colonic tissues. Both antibiotic exposures significantly decreased the levels of alanine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs; phenylalanine and ) in colonic contents of female mice but not in male mice. Additionally, female mice had much greater correlations between microbe and metabolite than male mice. These findings suggest that sex-dependent effects should be considered for antibiotic-induced modifications of the gut  and host metabolism. Accumulating evidence shows that the gut  regulates host metabolism by producing a series of metabolites, such as amino acids, bile acids, fatty acids, and others. These metabolites have a positive or negative effect on host health. Antibiotic exposure can disrupt the gut  and thereby affect host metabolism and physiology. However, there are a limited number of studies addressing whether antibiotic effects on the gut  and host metabolism are sex dependent. In this study, we uncovered a sex-dependent difference in antibiotic effects on the gut  and metabolome in colonic contents and tissues in mice. These findings reveal that sex-dependent effects need to be considered for antibiotic use in scientific research or clinical practice. Moreover, this study will also give an important direction for future use of antibiotics to modify the gut microbiome and host metabolism in a sex-specific manner.Copyright © 2019 Gao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25339668>Lyn deficiency leads to increased -dependent intestinal inflammation and susceptibility to enteric pathogens.</a></h1><p>The Lyn  kinase governs the development and function of various immune cells, and its dysregulation has been linked to malignancy and autoimmunity. Using models of chemically induced colitis and enteric infection, we show that Lyn plays a critical role in regulating the intestinal  and inflammatory responses as well as protection from enteric pathogens. Lyn(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, characterized by significant wasting, rectal bleeding, colonic pathology, and enhanced barrier permeability. Increased DSS susceptibility in Lyn(-/-) mice required the presence of T but not B cells and correlated with dysbiosis and increased IFN-γ(+) and/or IL-17(+) colonic T cells. This dysbiosis was characterized by an expansion of segmented filamentous bacteria, associated with altered intestinal production of IL-22 and IgA, and was transmissible to wild-type mice, resulting in increased susceptibility to DSS. Lyn deficiency also resulted in an inability to control infection by the enteric pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium. Lyn(-/-) mice exhibited profound cecal inflammation, bacterial dissemination, and morbidity following S. Typhimurium challenge and greater colonic inflammation throughout the course of C. rodentium infection. These results identify Lyn as a key regulator of the mucosal immune system, governing pathophysiology in multiple models of intestinal disease.Copyright © 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171422>Intestinal Pathology and Gut  Alterations in a Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often have non-motor symptoms related to gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, such as constipation and delayed gastric emptying, which manifest prior to the motor symptoms of PD. Increasing evidence indicates that changes in the composition of the gut  may be related to the pathogenesis of PD. However, it is unclear how GI dysfunction occurs and how gut microbial dysbiosis is caused. We investigated whether a neurotoxin model of PD induced by chronic low doses of MPTP is capable of reproducing the clinical intestinal pathology of PD, as well as whether gut microbial dysbiosis accompanies this pathology. C57BL/6 male mice were administered 18 mg/kg MPTP twice per week for 5 weeks via intraperitoneal injection. GI function was assessed by measuring the 1-h stool frequency and fecal water content; motor function was assessed by pole tests; and  hydroxylase and alpha-synuclein expression were analyzed. Furthermore, the inflammation, intestinal barrier and composition of the gut  were measured. We found that MPTP caused GI dysfunction and intestinal pathology prior to motor dysfunction. The composition of the gut  was changed; in particular, the change in the abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, Clostridiales, Erysipelotrichales and Proteobacteria was significant. These results indicate that a chronic low-dose MPTP model can be used to evaluate the progression of intestinal pathology and gut  dysbiosis in the early stage of PD, which may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574746>Impact of treatments on fecal  and fecal metabolome in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon: a pilot study.</a></h1><p>Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) affects 50% of people having diverticulosis. We performed a pilot study assessing the effect of current treatments on fecal  and metabolome in SUDD. Thirteen consecutive females with SUDD were treated with a 2-week therapeutic trial of 30 g/day fiber supplementation (3 patients), 1.6 g/day of mesalazine (3 patients), 900 billion/day of probiotic mixture VivoMixx® (3 patients), or 800 mg/day of rifaximin (4 patients). Stool samples were collected at entry (T0), at the end of the 2-week therapeutic course (T1), and 30 (T2) and 60 days (T3) after the end of the therapeutic course. Real-time PCR quantified targeted microorganisms. Fecal metabolome patterns were studied by high-resolution proton NMR spectroscopy. At cumulative analysis, symptoms significantly decreased at each time point during follow-up (p less than 0.0001), and only left-lower quadrant pain increased again at T3. The overall bacterial quantity was not altered by the treatments. The amount of  species was significantly reduced at T1 (p=0.017) and at T2 (p=0.026), while at T3 the reduction was not significant in comparison to enrollment (p=0.090). Fecal molecular profile showed significant changes at T1 and T2, while at T3 it became similar to that of T0. Differences were found for 18 of the quantified molecules (tryptophan, phenylalanine, , 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, urocanate, X-6.363, X-5.779, uridylate, galactose, X-4.197, threonine, sarcosine, methionine, 2-oxoisocaproate, 5-aminolevulinate, alanine, leucine, valerate).

It reduces the size of fat stores or the amount of body fat gain. The bariatric surgery procedures currently used include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, which are the most commonly performed procedures. Other procedures are laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and biliopancreatic diversion. The latter represents the most effective surgery for treatment of severe obesity as well as type 2 diabetes. Bariatric surgery reduces energy intake by restricting the size of the stomach reservoir and causing malabsorption, as in the case of biliopancreatic diversion. The present article provides an overview of the literature on the effects of bariatric surgery on energy homeostasis. Accumulated evidence has indicated that the effects of bariatric surgery on energy balance can encompass complex components including effects on the corticolimbic appetitive network, with modulatory effects exerted through changes in gastrointestinal hormones, bile acid production and  composition. The reorganization of the gastrointestinal tract has been shown to reduce the rewarding effects of palatable food and impulsive eating, while elevating anorexigenic hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide   to stimulate the production of bile acids and normalize the obesogenic gut . Bariatric surgery could also increase energy expenditure, which represents, like energy intake, a key component of the energy balance equation.Copyright © 2017 Diabetes Canada.

Urine and serum samples were collected on days 1, 2 and 7 after dosing.Metabolic responses of rats to Gd-DTPA administration were systematic involving changes in lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism and gut  functions. Urinary and serum metabonomic recovery could be observed in both the 2 and 5mmol/kg body weight group, but the metabolic effects of high-dosed (5mmol/kg body weight) Gd-DTPA lasted longer. It is worth noting that hyperlipidemia was observed after Gd-DTPA injection, and nicotinate might play a role in the subsequent self-recovery of lipid metabolism. The disturbance of , glutamate and gut  metabolism might associate with the progression of NSF.These findings offered essential information about the metabolic changes induced by Gd-DTPA, and could be potentially important for investigating the pathogenesis of NSF at the early stage. Moreover, the recovery of rats administrated with Gd-DTPA may have implications in the treatment of early stage NSF.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Some uremic toxins are ingested with the diet, such as phosphate and star fruit-derived caramboxin. Others result from nutrient processing by gut , yielding precursors of uremic toxins or uremic toxins themselves. These nutrients include l-carnitine, choline/phosphatidylcholine, tryptophan and , which are also sold over-the-counter as nutritional supplements. Physicians and patients alike should be aware that, in CKD patients, the use of these supplements may lead to potentially toxic effects. Unfortunately, most patients with CKD are not aware of their condition. Some of the dietary components may modify the gut , increasing the number of bacteria that process them to yield uremic toxins, such as trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO), p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate and indole-3 acetic acid. Circulating levels of nutrient-derived uremic toxins are associated to increased risk of death and cardiovascular disease and there is evidence that this association may be causal.

Insects cannot avoid ingesting pathogens with food that will be specifically detected by the midgut immune system. However, just as in mammals, many pathogens can still escape the insect midgut immune system and arrive in the hindgut, where they are excreted out with the feces. Here we show that the melanization of hindgut content induced by prophenoloxidase, a key enzyme that induces the production of melanin around invaders and at wound sites, is the last line of immune defense to clear bacteria before feces excretion. We used the silkworm Bombyx mori as a model and found that prophenoloxidase produced by hindgut cells is secreted into the hindgut contents. Several experiments were done to clearly demonstrate that the blackening of the insect feces was due to activated phenoloxidase, which served to regulate the number of bacteria in the hindgut. Our analysis of the silkworm hindgut prophenoloxidase discloses the natural secret of why the phytophagous insect feces is black and provides insight into hindgut innate immunity, which is still rather unclear in mammals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23744738>Mammalian colonocytes possess a carrier-mediated mechanism for uptake of vitamin B3 (niacin): studies utilizing human and mouse colonic preparations.</a></h1><p>Niacin (vitamin B3; nicotinic acid) plays an important role in maintaining redox state of cells and is obtained from endogenous and exogenous sources. The latter source has generally been assumed to be the dietary niacin, but another exogenous source that has been ignored is the niacin that is produced by the normal microflora of the large intestine. For this source of niacin to be bioavailable, it needs to be absorbed, but little is known about the ability of the large intestine to absorb niacin and the mechanism involved. Here we addressed these issues using the nontransformed human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, native human colonic apical membrane vesicles (AMV) isolated from organ donors, and mouse colonic loops in vivo as models. Uptake of ³H-nicotinic acid by NCM460 cells was: 1) acidic pH (but not Na⁺) dependent; 2) saturable (apparent Km = 2.5 ± 0.8 μM); 3) inhibited by unlabeled nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and probenecid; 4) neither affected by other bacterially produced monocarboxylates, monocarboxylate transport inhibitor, or by substrates of the human organic anion transporter-10; 5) affected by modulators of the intracellular protein  kinase- and Ca²⁺-calmodulin-regulatory pathways; and 6) adaptively regulated by extracellular nicotinate level. Uptake of nicotinic acid by human colonic AMV in vitro and by mouse colonic loops in vivo was also carrier mediated. These findings report, for the first time, that mammalian colonocytes possess a high-affinity carrier-mediated mechanism for nicotinate uptake and show that the process is affected by intracellular and extracellular factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270816>Arctic berry extracts target the gut-liver axis to alleviate metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>There is growing evidence that fruit polyphenols exert beneficial effects on the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8 weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut .Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 ± 12.3, HFHS 153.9 ± 19.3, BBE 114.4 ± 14.3, CLE 82.5 ± 13.0, CRE 152.3 ± 24.4, ABE 90.6 ± 18.0, LGE 95.4 ± 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM AUC [pmol/l × min]: chow 14.3 ± 1.4, HFHS 31.4 ± 3.1, BBE 27.2 ± 4.0, CLE 17.7 ± 2.2, CRE 32.6 ± 6.3, ABE 22.7 ± 18.0, LGE 23.9 ± 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1  phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25753121>Proteomic profile of the skin mucus of farmed gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata).</a></h1><p>Fish skin mucus is the first line of defense against infections and it discriminates between pathogenic and commensal bacterial strains. Mucus composition varies amongst fish species and is influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors. This study describes the first proteome map of the epidermal mucus of farmed gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). We used an integrative proteomic approach by combining a label-free procedure (LC-MS/MS) with the classical 2-DE-PMF-MS/MS methodology. The identified mucosal proteins were clustered in four groups according to their biological functions. Structural proteins (actins, keratins, tubulins, tropomyosin, cofilin-2 and filamin-A) and metabolic proteins (ribosomal proteins, proteasomal subunits, NACA, VCP, histones, NDPK, transferrin, glycolytic enzymes, ATP synthase components, beta-globin, Apo-A1 and FABP7) were the best represented functional categories. We also found proteins involved in stress response (WAP65, HSPC70, Cu,Zn-SOD, and PRDX1 and PRDX2) and signal transduction (PP2A 65kDa regulatory subunit, 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha,  3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, RhoGDI and PEBP1). Most of the identified proteins address different aspects of the innate immune response. Additionally, we analyzed bacterial peptides identified in the skin mucus of healthy S. aurata. These results revealed that genera belonging to the Lactobacillales order constitute the most abundant microorganism populations in this habitat.This work shows that proteomic methods can be used to characterize fish skin mucus. Using a coupled approach of LC-MS/MS and a 2-DE-PMF-MS/MS, we have obtained the first comprehensive view of the skin mucosal proteome of S. aurata, a fish species that is economically relevant for Mediterranean aquaculture. We identified a panel of proteins involved in a variety of biological functions, particularly in the innate immune response. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first time a proteomic approach has been used to examine the  in the skin mucus of a fish species. Overall, these results support further immunological researches in S. aurata and are relevant for the culture of this important fish species.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Previous evidence has indicated that the dysbiosis of gut  occurs after liver virus infection and is associated with severe liver disease. The aim of this study is to elucidate the compositional and functional characteristics of the gut  in early-stage CHB and to understand their influence on disease progression. We investigated the gut microbial composition of stool samples from 85 CHB patients with low Child-Pugh scores and 22 healthy controls using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Furthermore, the serum metabolome of 40 subjects was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Compared with the controls, significant alteration in the gut  was observed in the CHB patients; 5 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to , unclassified Lachnospiraceae and  were increased, and 27 belonging to , unclassified Bacteria, unclassified Clostridiales, Unclassified Coriobacteriaceae, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, unclassified Lachnospiraceae and unclassified Ruminococcaceae were decreased. The inferred metagenomic information of gut  in CHB showed 21 enriched and 17 depleted KEGG level-2 pathways. Four OTUs, OTU38 (), OTU124 (), OTU224 (), and OTU55 (), had high correlations with hosts' hepatic function indices and 10 serum metabolites, including phenylalanine and , which are aromatic amino acids that play pathogenic roles in liver disease. In particular, these 4 OTUs were significantly higher in patients with higher Child-Pugh scores, who also showed diminished phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolisms in the inferred gut metagenomic functions. These compositional and functional changes in the gut  in early-stage CHB patients suggest the potential contributions of gut  to the progression of CHB, and thus provide new insight into gut -targeted interventions to improve the prognosis of this disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22306194>Metabolic differences underlying two distinct rat urinary phenotypes, a suggested role for gut microbial metabolism of phenylalanine and a possible connection to autism.</a></h1><p>A novel explanation is proposed for the metabolic differences underlying two distinct rat urinary compositional phenotypes i.e. that these may arise from differences in the gut microbially-mediated metabolism of phenylalanine.

Mice with CKD exhibit increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and kidney histopathology. XOS significantly reverses kidney injuries in CKD mice. Analysis of cecum  reveales that adenine-induced CKD does not change alpha diversity, and XOS induces a decrease of alpha diversity in control mice and mice with CKD. Beta diversity analysis shows significant clustering according to experimental groups. Six out of the nine bacterial genera enriched in CKD are significantly reduced with XOS intervention. Furthermore, XOS increases cecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in both control and CKD mice. Cecal SCFAs and blood propionate are negatively correlated with BUN. XOS also decreases blood p-cresol sulfate in CKD mice, likely resulting from altered microbial  metabolism.These results show that XOS intervention improves kidney function in mice with CKD, and is associated with profound changes in microbial composition and metabolism.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the relationship between changes in microbial communities and metabolic disease-phenotypes are still poorly understood. In this study, we used antibiotics with markedly different antibacterial spectra to modulate the gut microbiome in a diet-induced obesity mouse model and then measured relevant biochemical, hormonal and phenotypic biomarkers of obesity and T2DM. Mice fed a high-fat diet were treated with either ceftazidime (a primarily anti-Gram negative bacteria antibiotic) or vancomycin (mainly anti-Gram positive bacteria activity) in an escalating three-dose regimen. We also dosed animals with a well-known prebiotic weight-loss supplement, 10% oligofructose saccharide (10% OFS). Vancomycin treated mice showed little weight change and no improvement in glycemic control while ceftazidime and 10% OFS treatments induced significant weight loss. However, only ceftazidime showed significant, dose dependent improvement in key metabolic variables including glucose, insulin, protein   (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Subsequently, we confirmed the positive hyperglycemic control effects of ceftazidime in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat model. Metagenomic DNA sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene regions V1-V3 showed that the microbiomes of ceftazidime dosed mice and rats were enriched for the phylum Firmicutes while 10% OFS treated mice had a greater abundance of Bacteroidetes. We show that specific changes in microbial community composition are associated with obesity and glycemic control phenotypes. More broadly, our study suggests that in vivo modulation of the microbiome warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27571405>LYN- and AIRE-mediated tolerance checkpoint defects synergize to trigger organ-specific autoimmunity.</a></h1><p>Studies of the genetic factors associated with human autoimmune disease suggest a multigenic origin of susceptibility; however, how these factors interact and through which tolerance pathways they operate generally remain to be defined. One key checkpoint occurs through the activity of the autoimmune regulator AIRE, which promotes central T cell tolerance. Recent reports have described a variety of dominant-negative AIRE mutations that likely contribute to human autoimmunity to a greater extent than previously thought. In families with these mutations, the penetrance of autoimmunity is incomplete, suggesting that other checkpoints play a role in preventing autoimmunity. Here, we tested whether a defect in LYN, an inhibitory protein  kinase that is implicated in systemic autoimmunity, could combine with an Aire mutation to provoke organ-specific autoimmunity. Indeed, mice with a dominant-negative allele of Aire and deficiency in LYN spontaneously developed organ-specific autoimmunity in the eye. We further determined that a small pool of retinal protein-specific T cells escaped thymic deletion as a result of the hypomorphic Aire function and that these cells also escaped peripheral tolerance in the presence of LYN-deficient dendritic cells, leading to highly destructive autoimmune attack. These findings demonstrate how 2 distinct tolerance pathways can synergize to unleash autoimmunity and have implications for the genetic susceptibility of autoimmune disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24045577>Lyn activity protects mice from DSS colitis and regulates the production of IL-22 from innate lymphoid cells.</a></h1><p>Intestinal homeostasis requires a complex balance of interactions between diverse resident microbial communities, the intestinal epithelium, and the underlying immune system. We show that the Lyn  kinase, a critical regulator of immune cell function and pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) responses, has a key role in controlling gastrointestinal inflammation. Lyn⁻/⁻ mice were highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, whereas Lyn gain-of-function (Lyn(up)) mice exhibited attenuated colitis during acute and chronic models of disease. Lyn(up) mice were hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), driving enhanced production of cytokines and factors associated with intestinal barrier function, including interleukin (IL)-22. Oral administration of LPS was sufficient to protect antibiotic-treated Lyn(up) but not wild-type mice from DSS, highlighting how Lyn-dependent changes in the nature/magnitude of PRR responses can impact intestinal health. Furthermore, protection from DSS-induced colitis and increased IL-22 production in response to LPS did not depend on the adaptive immune system, with increased innate lymphoid cell-derived IL-22 correlating with Lyn activity in dendritic cells. These data reveal a key role for Lyn in the regulation of innate immune responses and control of intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24164354>Biological system responses to zearalenone mycotoxin exposure by integrated metabolomic studies.</a></h1><p>This study aims to investigate the effect of zearalenone supplementation on rat metabolism. Rats received biweekly intragastric administration of zearalenone mycotoxin (3 mg/kg body weight) for 2 weeks. Urine and plasma samples after zearalenone administration were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics. Zearalenone exposure significantly elevated the plasma levels of glucose, lactate, N-acetyl glycoprotein, O-acetyl glycoprotein, and propionate but reduced the plasma levels of , branched-chain amino acids, and choline metabolites. Zearalenone supplementation decreased the urine levels of butyrate, lactate, and nicotinate. However, it increased the urine levels of allantoin, choline, and N-methylnicotinamide at 0-8 h after the last zearalenone administration and those of 1-methylhistidine, acetoacetate, acetone, and indoxyl sulfate at 8-24 h after the last zearalenone administration. These results suggest that zearalenone exposure can cause oxidative stress and change common systemic metabolic processes, including cell membrane metabolism, protein biosynthesis, glycolysis, and gut  metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23173670>Potential role of probiotics on colorectal cancer prevention.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer represents the most common malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract. Owing to differences in dietary habits and lifestyle, this neoplasm is more common in industrialized countries than in developing ones. Evidence from a wide range of sources supports the assumption that the link between diet and colorectal cancer may be due to an imbalance of the intestinal microflora.Probiotic bacteria are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a healthy benefit on the host, and they have been investigated for their protective anti-tumor effects. In vivo and molecular studies have displayed encouraging findings that support a role of probiotics in colorectal cancer prevention.Several mechanisms could explain the preventive action of probiotics against colorectal cancer onset. They include: alteration of the intestinal microflora; inactivation of cancerogenic compounds; competition with putrefactive and pathogenic ; improvement of the host's immune response; anti-proliferative effects via regulation of apoptosis and cell differentiation; fermentation of undigested food; inhibition of  kinase signaling pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21555563>Enteric commensal bacteria potentiate epithelial restitution via reactive oxygen species-mediated inactivation of focal adhesion kinase phosphatases.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms by which enteric commensal  influence maturation and repair of the epithelial barrier are relatively unknown. Epithelial restitution requires active cell migration, a process dependent on dynamic turnover of focal cell-matrix adhesions (FAs). Here, we demonstrate that natural, commensal bacteria stimulate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in intestinal epithelia. Bacteria-mediated ROS generation induces oxidation of target cysteines in the redox-sensitive  phosphatases, LMW-PTP and SHP-2, which in turn results in increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key protein regulating the turnover of FAs. Accordingly, phosphorylation of FAK substrate proteins, focal adhesion formation, and cell migration are all significantly enhanced by bacterial contact in both in vitro and in vivo models of wound closure. These results suggest that commensal bacteria regulate cell migration via induced generation of ROS in epithelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17634514>Aggregating phenotype in Lactobacillus crispatus determines intestinal colonization and TLR2 and TLR4 modulation in murine colonic mucosa.</a></h1><p>The colonic  is a major modulator of the mucosal immune system; therefore, its manipulation through supplementation with probiotics may significantly affect the host's immune responses. Since different probiotics seem to exert various effects in vivo, we tested the relevance of the autoaggregation phenotype on the intestinal persistence of lactobacilli and their ability to modulate the host's innate immune responses. After 14 days of diet supplementation, the aggregating strain Lactobacillus crispatus M247 but not aggregation-deficient isogenic mutant MU5 was recovered from the feces and colonic mucosa of mice. This observation was confirmed by strain-specific PCR amplification and by Lactobacillus-specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. Indeed, L. crispatus M247 increased Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA levels, while it reduced TLR4 mRNA and protein levels in the colonic mucosa, whereas MU5 was ineffective. In colonic epithelial cells (CMT-93 cells) L. crispatus M247 but not MU5 induced time-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1)  phosphorylation and TLR modulation, which were abolished in the presence of PD98059 (an ERK1 inhibitor). To assess the functional relevance of probiotic-induced TLR modulation, we determined the consequences of L. crispatus preexposure on TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and TLR2 [Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4] ligand-mediated effects in intestinal epithelial cells. Preexposure to L. crispatus M247 blunted LPS-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) release and inhibition of CMT-93 migration over a wound edge, whereas it enhanced TLR2-mediated IL-10 up-regulation. In summary, the aggregation phenotype is required for L. crispatus persistence in the colon and for modulation of TLR2/TLR4 expression through an ERK-dependent pathway. We speculate that the aggregation phenotype in L. crispatus M247 is required to temper epithelial cell responsiveness to bacterial endotoxins, which thus affects the evolution of intestinal inflammatory processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328972>Altered gut microbiome in a mouse model of Gulf War Illness causes neuroinflammation and intestinal injury via leaky gut and TLR4 activation.</a></h1><p>Many of the symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI) that include neurological abnormalities, neuroinflammation, chronic fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbances have been traced to Gulf War chemical exposure. Though the association and subsequent evidences are strong, the mechanisms that connect exposure to intestinal and neurological abnormalities remain unclear. Using an established rodent model of Gulf War Illness, we show that chemical exposure caused significant dysbiosis in the gut that included increased abundance of phylum Firmicutes and Tenericutes, and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes. Several gram negative bacterial genera were enriched in the GWI-model that included Allobaculum sp. Altered microbiome caused significant decrease in tight junction protein Occludin with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2, a signature of a leaky gut. Resultant leaching of gut caused portal endotoxemia that led to upregulation of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in the small intestine and the brain. TLR4 knock out mice and mice that had gut decontamination showed significant decrease in  nitration and inflammatory mediators IL1β and MCP-1 in both the small intestine and frontal cortex. These events signified that gut dysbiosis with simultaneous leaky gut and systemic endotoxemia-induced TLR4 activation contributes to GW chemical-induced neuroinflammation and gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301059>Effects of Potential Probiotic Strains on the Fecal  and Metabolites of D-Galactose-Induced Aging Rats Fed with High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p>Both aging and diet play an important role in influencing the gut ecosystem. Using premature senescent rats induced by D-galactose and fed with high-fat diet, this study aims to investigate the effects of different potential probiotic strains on the dynamic changes of fecal microbiome and metabolites. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with high-fat diet and injected with D-galactose for 12 weeks to induce aging. The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum DR7, L. fermentum DR9, and L. reuteri 8513d administration on the fecal  profile, short-chain fatty acids, and water-soluble compounds were analyzed. It was found that the administration of the selected strains altered the gut  diversity and composition, even at the phylum level. The fecal short-chain fatty acid content was also higher in groups that were administered with the potential probiotic strains. Analysis of the fecal water-soluble metabolites revealed that administration of L. plantarum DR7 and L. reuteri 8513d led to higher fecal content of compounds related to amino acid metabolism such as tryptophan, leucine, , cysteine, methionine, valine, and lysine; while administration of L. fermentum DR9 led to higher prevalence of compounds related to carbohydrate metabolism such as erythritol, xylitol, and arabitol. In conclusion, it was observed that different strains of lactobacilli can cause difference alteration in the gut  and the metabolites, suggesting the urgency to explore the specific metabolic impact of specific strains on the host.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923728>Intestinal Microbial and Metabolic Profiling of Mice Fed with High-Glucose and High-Fructose Diets.</a></h1><p>Increased sugar intake is implicated in Type-2 diabetes and fatty liver disease; however, the mechanisms through which glucose and fructose promote these conditions are unclear. We hypothesize that alterations in intestinal metabolite and  profiles specific to each monosaccharide are involved. Two groups of six adult C57BL/6 mice were fed for 10-weeks with diets with glucose (G) or fructose (F) as sole carbohydrates, and a third group was fed with a normal chow carbohydrate mixture (N). Fecal metabolites were profiled by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and microbial composition by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Although N, G and F mice exhibited similar weight gains (with slight slower gains for F) and glucose tolerance, multivariate analysis of NMR data indicated that F mice were separated from N and G, with decreased butyrate and glutamate and increased fructose, succinate, taurine, , and xylose. The different sugar diets also resulted in distinct intestinal  profiles. That associated with fructose seemed to hold more potential to induce host metabolic disturbances compared to glucose, mainly by promoting bile acid deconjugation and taurine release and compromising intestinal barrier integrity. This may reflect the noted nonquantitative intestinal fructose absorption hence increasing its availability for microbial metabolism, a subject for further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24376661>Intestinal upregulation of melanin-concentrating hormone in TNBS-induced enterocolitis in adult zebrafish.</a></h1><p>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), an evolutionarily conserved appetite-regulating neuropeptide, has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Expression of MCH is upregulated in inflamed intestinal mucosa in humans with colitis and MCH-deficient mice treated with trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) develop an attenuated form of colitis compared to wild type animals. Zebrafish have emerged as a new animal model of IBD, although the majority of the reported studies concern zebrafish larvae. Regulation MCH expression in the adult zebrafish intestine remains unknown.In the present study we induced enterocolitis in adult zebrafish by intrarectal administration of TNBS. Follow-up included survival analysis, histological assessment of changes in intestinal architecture, and assessment of intestinal infiltration by myeloperoxidase positive cells and cytokine transcript levels.Treatment with TNBS dose-dependently reduced fish survival. This response required the presence of an intact microbiome, since fish pre-treated with vancomycin developed less severe enterocolitis. At 6 hours post-challenge, we detected a significant influx of myeloperoxidase positive cells in the intestine and upregulation of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, and in analogy to human IBD and TNBS-induced mouse experimental colitis, we found increased intestinal expression of MCH and its receptor in TNBS-treated zebrafish.Taken together these findings not only establish a model of chemically-induced experimental enterocolitis in adult zebrafish, but point to effects of MCH in intestinal inflammation that are conserved across species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30997311>Exploring the  and metabolites of traditional rice beer varieties of Assam and their functionalities.</a></h1><p>Rice beer is traditionally prepared and consumed by various ethnic populations in the Southeast Asian countries. To understand the probable effects of rice beer on human health, present research was aimed to study biochemical parameters, microbial diversity and metabolites of major rice beer varieties of Assam, namely  ( and ),  and  Alcoholic content of rice beer varieties varied from 9.41 to 19.33% (v/v). Free radical scavenging activity against DPPH· and ABTS were 1.94-4.14 and 1.69-3.91 mg of ascorbic acid/ml of rice beer, respectively. In relation to antioxidant activities, phenolic content varied from 2.07 to 5.40 mg gallic acid/ml of rice beer. Next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA showed that 18 genera of bacteria were present irrespective of rice beer varieties in which lactic acid bacteria were the dominant group (90% abundance). Functional predictions based on the bacterial profiles indicated pathways, such as metabolisms of carbohydrate, amino acid, vitamins and cofactors, and xenobiotic biodegradation, to be active in the rice beer varieties. Out of 18 core bacterial genera, 7 had correlations with the predicted functions. Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy-based metabolite analysis revealed that the metabolite profiles of the rice beer varieties consisted of 18 saccharides, 18 organic acids, 11 sugar alcohols, 8 amino acids, 1 vitamin and nutraceutical compounds thiocoumarine, carotene, oxazolidine-2-one and acetyl .

Ineffective pharmacotherapy in the management of cognitive deficits and weight gain are known to be significant contributors; therefore interventions that may mitigate one, or both, of these parameters would be highly beneficial. Manipulation of the gut microbiome using dietary supplements such as prebiotics may be one such intervention. Preclinical studies have shown that a 2-4 week dietary supplementation with a prebiotic has beneficial effects on learning and memory, and prevents pro-inflammatory signals that are detrimental to cognitive processes. Furthermore, prebiotics influence metabolism, and in obesity they increase the expression of anorexigenic gut hormones such as peptide  , glucagon-like peptide 1 and leptin, as well as decrease levels of orexigenic hormones such as ghrelin. Despite compelling evidence for the pro-cognitive and neuroprotective effects of prebiotics in rodents, their ability to alleviate cognitive deficits or enhance cognition needs to be evaluated in humans. Here we suggest that important symptoms associated with schizophrenia, such as cognitive impairment and weight gain, may benefit from concurrent prebiotic therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Bacterial dysbiosis might be involved in the activation of nociceptive sensory pathways, but there have been few studies of the role of the mycobiome (the fungal microbiome) in the development of IBS. We analyzed intestinal mycobiomes of patients with IBS and a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity.We used internal transcribed spacer 1-based metabarcoding to compare fecal mycobiomes of 18 healthy volunteers with those of 39 patients with IBS (with visceral hypersensitivity or normal levels of sensitivity). We also compared the mycobiomes of Long-Evans rats separated from their mothers (hypersensitive) with non-handled (normally sensitive) rats. We investigated whether fungi can cause visceral hypersensitivity using rats exposed to fungicide (fluconazole and nystatin). The functional relevance of the gut mycobiome was confirmed in fecal transplantation experiments: adult maternally separated rats were subjected to water avoidance stress (to induce visceral hypersensitivity), then given fungicide and donor cecum content via oral gavage. Other rats subjected to water avoidance stress were given soluble β-glucans, which antagonize C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A or DECTIN1) signaling via spleen-associated  kinase (SYK), a SYK inhibitor to reduce visceral hypersensitivity, or vehicle (control). The sensitivity of mast cells to fungi was tested with mesenteric windows (ex vivo) and the human mast cell line HMC-1.α diversity (Shannon index) and mycobiome signature (stability selection) of both groups of IBS patients differed from healthy volunteers, and the mycobiome signature of hypersensitive patients differed from that of normally sensitive patients. We observed mycobiome dysbiosis in rats that had been separated from their mothers compared with non-handled rats. Administration of fungicide to hypersensitive rats reduced their visceral hypersensitivity to normal levels of sensitivity. Administration of cecal mycobiomes from rats that had been separated from their mothers (but not non-handled mycobiome) restored hypersensitivity to distension. Administration of soluble β-glucans or a SYK inhibitor reduced visceral hypersensitivity, compared with controls. Particulate β-glucan (a DECTIN-1 agonist) induced mast cell degranulation in mesenteric windows and HMC-1 cells responded to fungal antigens by release of histamine.In an analysis of patients with IBS and controls, we associated fungal dysbiosis with IBS. In studies of rats, we found fungi to promote visceral hypersensitivity, which could be reduced by administration of fungicides, soluble β-glucans, or a SYK inhibitor. The intestinal fungi might therefore be manipulated for treatment of IBS-related visceral hypersensitivity.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We determined whether low molecular weight metabolites derived from intestinal  and transported to the systemic circulation are linked to severity of myocardial infarction. Plasma from rats treated for seven days with the non-absorbed antibiotic vancomycin or a mixture of streptomycin, neomycin, polymyxin B and bacitracin was analyzed using mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling platforms. Antibiotic-induced changes in the abundance of individual groups of intestinal  dramatically altered the host's metabolism. Hierarchical clustering of dissimilarities separated the levels of 284 identified metabolites from treated vs. untreated rats; 193 were altered by the antibiotic treatments with a tendency towards decreased metabolite levels. Catabolism of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan and  was the most affected pathway comprising 33 affected metabolites. Both antibiotic treatments decreased the severity of an induced myocardial infarction in vivo by 27% and 29%, respectively. We then determined whether microbial metabolites of the amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan and  were linked to decreased severity of myocardial infarction. Vancomycin-treated rats were administered amino acid metabolites prior to ischemia/reperfusion studies. Oral or intravenous pretreatment of rats with these amino acid metabolites abolished the decrease in infarct size conferred by vancomycin. Inhibition of JAK-2 (AG-490, 10 μM), Src kinase (PP1, 20 μM), Akt/PI3 kinase (Wortmannin, 100 nM), p44/42 MAPK (PD98059, 10 μM), p38 MAPK (SB203580, 10 μM), or KATP channels (glibenclamide, 3 μM) abolished cardioprotection by vancomycin, indicating microbial metabolites are interacting with cell surface receptors to transduce their signals through Src kinase, cell survival pathways and KATP channels. These inhibitors have no effect on myocardial infarct size in untreated rats. This study links gut  metabolites to severity of myocardial infarction and may provide future opportunities for novel diagnostic tests and interventions for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777991>Co-evolutionary associations between root-associated microbiomes and root transcriptomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties.</a></h1><p>The plants and root-associated microbiomes are closely related. Plant metabolic substances can serve as a nutrient source for the microbiome, and in return, the microbiome can regulate the production of plant metabolic substances. Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), as the ancestor of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), has changed several metabolic pathways and root-associated microbiome during evolution. Thus, the study of the different associations between metabolic pathways and root-associated microbiomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties is important for rice breeding. In this article, the co-evolutionary association between metabolic pathways, which are based on transcriptome data, and root-associated microbiomes, which are based on 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon data, in wild and cultivated rice was studied. The results showed that the enriched pathways were differentially correlated with the enriched microbiomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties. Pathways for 'Glutathione metabolism', 'Plant-pathogen interaction', 'Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum' and ' metabolism' were positively associated with the improved relative abundance of bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in wild rice. On the other hand, 'Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis', 'Brassinosteroid biosynthesis', 'Carbon metabolism', 'Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis' and 'Caffeine metabolism' were positively correlated with the improved relative abundance of bacterial and fungal OTUs in cultivated rice. Redundancy analysis showed that certain bacterial and fungal species could positively and significantly affect plant gene expression; for instance, Streptomyces, with 8.7% relative abundance in bacterial community, significantly affected plant gene expression in wild rice. This study can provide the theoretical basis for recognizing the associations between root-associated microbiomes and root transcriptomes in wild and cultivated rice varieties, and can provide practical significance for developing useful bacterial and fungal resources in wild rice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The requirement for efficient glycan degrading systems exerts a major selection pressure on this microbial community. Thus, we propose that this microbial ecosystem represents a substantial resource for discovering novel carbohydrate active enzymes. To test this hypothesis we screened the potential enzymatic functions of hypothetical proteins encoded by genes of  that were up-regulated by arabinogalactan proteins or AGPs. Although AGPs are ubiquitous in plants, there is a paucity of information on their detailed structure, the function of these glycans , and the mechanisms by which they are depolymerized in microbial ecosystems. Here we have discovered a new polysaccharide lyase family that is specific for the l-rhamnose-α1,4-d-glucuronic acid linkage that caps the side chains of complex AGPs. The reaction product generated by the lyase, Δ4,5-unsaturated uronic acid, is removed from AGP by a glycoside hydrolase located in family GH105, producing the final product 4-deoxy-β-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyl-uronic acid. The crystal structure of a member of the novel lyase family revealed a catalytic domain that displays an (α/α) barrel-fold. In the center of the barrel is a deep pocket, which, based on mutagenesis data and amino acid conservation, comprises the active site of the lyase. A  is the proposed catalytic base in the β-elimination reaction. This study illustrates how highly complex glycans can be used as a scaffold to discover new enzyme families within microbial ecosystems where carbohydrate metabolism is a major evolutionary driver.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27039931>Deleterious Effect of p-Cresol on Human Colonic Epithelial Cells Prevented by Proanthocyanidin-Containing Polyphenol Extracts from Fruits and Proanthocyanidin Bacterial Metabolites.</a></h1><p>The protective effect of proanthocyanidin-containing polyphenol extracts from apples, avocados, cranberries, grapes, or proanthocyanidin microbial metabolites was evaluated in colonic epithelial cells exposed to p-cresol, a deleterious compound produced by the colonic  from . In HT29 Glc(-/+) cells, p-cresol significantly increased LDH leakage and decreased ATP contents, whereas in Caco-2 cell monolayers, it significantly decreased the transepithelial electrical resistance and increased the paracellular transport of FITC-dextran. The alterations induced by p-cresol in HT29 Glc(-/+) cells were prevented by the extracts from cranberries and avocados, whereas they became worse by extracts from apples and grapes. The proanthocyanidin bacterial metabolites decreased LDH leakage, ameliorating cell viability without improving intracellular ATP. All of the polyphenol extracts and proanthocyanidin bacterial metabolites prevented the p-cresol-induced alterations of barrier function.

The changes of body weight and the scores of neurological function were recorded. The mRNA expression of the receptor  kinase subfamily (AXL) was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ in blood samples were examined by ELISA. The intestinal microbial composition of mice at different time points during the EAE induction was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing.

Advancements in metagenome sequencing technologies such as 16S rRNAs have made it possible to explore cecum microbial population. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of cecum  of crossbred Korean native pigs at two different growth stages (stage L = 10 weeks, and stage LD = 26 weeks) using 16S rRNA sequencing technology. Our results revealed remarkable differences in microbial composition, α and β diversity, and differential abundance between the two stages. Phylum composition analysis with respect to SILVA132 database showed  to be present at 51.87% and 48.76% in stages L and LD, respectively. Similarly,  were present at 37.28% and 45.98% in L and LD, respectively. The genera , , ,  were differentially enriched in stage L, whereas , ,  were enriched in stage LD. Functional annotation of microbiome by level-three KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that glycine, serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine arginine, proline, and tryptophan metabolism were differentially enriched in stage L, whereas alanine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis metabolism were differentially enriched in stage LD. Through machine-learning approaches such as LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size), random forest, and Pearson's correlation, we found pathways such as amino acid metabolism, transport systems, and genetic regulation of metabolism are commonly enriched in both stages. Our findings suggest that the bacterial compositions in cecum content of pigs are heavily involved in their nutrient digestion process.

We implemented our general design through the cross-feeding of tryptophan and  by two E. coli auxotrophs. By regulating the expression of genes related to the export or production of these amino acids, we were able to tune the metabolite exchanges and achieve a wide range of growth rates and strain ratios. In addition, by inverting the relationship of growth/ratio vs. inducer concentrations, we were able to "program" the co-culture for pre-specified attributes with the proper addition of inducing chemicals.

Our objective was to utilize metabolomics analysis to assess monoamine metabolites in subjects with PKU consuming amino acid medical foods (AA-MF) and glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MF).Subjects with PKU consumed a low-Phe diet combined with AA-MF or GMP-MF for 3weeks each in a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Metabolomic analysis was conducted by Metabolon, Inc. on plasma (n=18) and urine (n=9) samples. Catecholamines and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were measured in 24-h urine samples.Intake of Tyr and Trp was ~50% higher with AA-MF, and AA-MF were consumed in larger quantities, less frequently during the day compared with GMP-MF. Performance on neuropsychological tests and concentrations of neurotransmitters derived from Tyr and Trp were not significantly different with AA-MF or GMP-MF. Plasma serotonin levels of gut origin were higher in subjects with variant compared with classical PKU, and with GMP-MF compared with AA-MF in subjects with variant PKU. Metabolomics analysis identified higher levels of microbiome-derived compounds synthesized from Tyr, such as phenol sulfate, and higher levels of compounds synthesized from Trp in the kynurenine pathway, such as quinolinic acid, with ingestion of AA-MF compared with GMP-MF.The Tyr from AA-MF is less bioavailable due, in part, to greater degradation by intestinal microbes compared with the Tyr from prebiotic GMP-MF.

At the end of the study, pigs were euthanized for analysis of the serum metabonome and determination of body composition. Obese pigs had higher fat mass (42.3±8.8% vs. 21.9±4.5%) and lower muscle mass (35.4±4.5% vs. 58.9±2.5%) than lean pigs (P<.01). Serum concentrations of insulin and glucagon were higher (P<.02) in obese than in lean pigs. With the use of an NMR-based metabonomic technology, orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis showed that serum HDL, VLDL, lipids, unsaturated lipids, glycoprotein, myo-inositol, pyruvate, threonine,  and creatine were higher in obese than in lean pigs (P<.05), while serum glucose and urea were lower in obese pigs (P<.05). In addition, changes in gut -related metabolites, including trimethylamine-N-oxide and choline, were observed in sera of obese pigs relatively to lean pigs (P<.05). These novel findings indicate that obese pigs have distinct metabolism, including lipogenesis, lipid oxidation, energy utilization and partition, protein and amino acid metabolism, and fermentation of gastrointestinal microbes, compared with lean pigs. The obese Ningxiang pig may be a useful model for childhood obesity research.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The metabolomic profile of infant urine at 4 weeks of age was also examined by LC-MS.Full-term (FT), spontaneous vaginally delivered (SVD) infants'  remained stable at both phylum and genus levels during the 24-week period examined. FT Caesarean section (CS) infants displayed an increased faecal abundance of Firmicutes (p < 0.01) and lower abundance of Actinobacteria (p < 0.001) after the first week of life compared to FT-SVD infants. FT-CS infants gradually progressed to harbouring a  closely resembling FT-SVD (which remained stable) by week 8 of life, which was maintained at week 24. The gut  of preterm (PT) infants displayed a significantly greater abundance of Proteobacteria compared to FT infants (p < 0.001) at week 1. Metabolomic analysis of urine at week 4 indicated PT-CS infants have a functionally different metabolite profile than FT (both CS and SVD) infants. Co-inertia analysis showed co-variation between the urine metabolome and the faecal  of the infants. Tryptophan and  metabolic pathways, as well as fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, were found to be affected by delivery mode and gestational age.These findings confirm that mode of delivery and gestational age both have significant effects on early neonatal  composition. There is also a significant difference between the metabolite profile of FT and PT infants. Prolonged breastfeeding was shown to have a significant effect on the  composition of FT-CS infants at 24 weeks of age, but interestingly not on that of FT-SVD infants.

To better understand obesity and obesity-related dysfunction, a high-fat diet (HFD) induced obese model was developed on Sprague-Dawley rats. Metabolomics based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was untilized to identify and analyze obesity related metabolites in rat urine samples. Multivariate analyses were applied to differentiate metabolite patterns between HFD group and normal group. The study successfully identified 20 altered urine metabolites that correlated with obesity. These metabolites are mainly involved in tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine and  metabolism, gut  metabolism and insulin resistance related metabolism. They could serve as potential biomarkers to diagnose the development of obesity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, whether these changes are an early event in the development of NAFLD or are primarily associated with later stages of the disease, has not yet been clarified. Using a pair-feeding model, we determined the effects of a short-term intake of a fat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (FFC) on the development of early hepatic steatosis and markers of intestinal barrier function in mice treated with and without non-resorbable antibiotics (AB). For four days, C57BL/6J mice were either pair-fed a control diet or a FFC diet ± AB (92 mg/kg body weight (BW) polymyxin B and 216 mg/kg BW neomycin). Hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation, lipidperoxidation and intestinal barrier function were assessed. Lipid accumulation and early signs of inflammation found in the livers of FFC-fed mice were markedly attenuated in FFC + AB-fed animals. In FFC-fed mice the development of NAFLD was associated with a significant loss of tight junction proteins and an induction of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in the upper parts of the small intestine as well as significantly higher portal endotoxin levels and an induction of dependent signaling cascades in the liver. As expected, portal endotoxin levels and the expression of dependent signaling cascades in liver tissue were almost at the level of controls in FFC + AB-fed mice. However, FFC + AB-fed mice were also protected from the loss of zonula occludens-1 and partially of occludin protein in small intestine. Our data suggest that the development of early diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice at least in part results from alterations of intestinal barrier function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479418>Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion protects against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the brain.</a></h1><p>Although the brain-gut axis appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, the precise mechanisms underlying the actions of gut  in this disease are unknown. This study was undertaken to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion affects dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the mouse brain after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). MPTP significantly decreased dopamine transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity in the striatum and  hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra of water-treated mice. However, MPTP did not decrease DAT or TH immunoreactivity in the brains of mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment significantly decreased the diversity and altered the composition of the host gut  at the genus and species levels. Interestingly, MPTP also altered microbiome composition in antibiotic-treated mice. These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion might protect against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the brain via the brain-gut axis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29487229>The fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily of enzymes: multifunctional enzymes from microbes to mitochondria.</a></h1><p>Prokaryotic and eukaryotic fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily members, sharing conserved regions that form the so-called FAH-domain, catalyze a remarkable variety of reactions. These enzymes are essential in the metabolic pathways to degrade aromatic compounds in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It appears that prokaryotic FAH superfamily members evolved mainly to allow microbes to generate energy and useful metabolites from complex carbon sources. We review recent findings, indicating that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of the FAH superfamily also display oxaloacetate decarboxylase (ODx) activity. The identification of human FAH domain-containing protein 1 as mitochondrial ODx regulating mitochondrial function supports the new concept that, during evolution, eukaryotic FAH superfamily members have acquired important regulatory functions beyond catabolism of complex carbon sources. Molecular studies on the evolution and function of FAH superfamily members are expected to provide new mechanistic insights in their physiological roles.© 2018 The Author(s).

On study day 31, intestinal samples, ileal and colonic contents, and feces were collected. Intestinal histomorphology, disaccharidase activity, serotonin (5'HT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and  hydroxylase (TH) were measured. Gut  composition was assessed by pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 regions of 16S rRNA and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Body weight of piglets on TEST was greater (P ≤ 0.05) than CONT on days 17 to 30. Both groups displayed growth patterns within the range observed for sow-reared pigs. TEST piglets had greater jejunal lactase (P = 0.03) and higher (P = 0.003) ileal VIP expression. TEST piglets tended to have greater (P = 0.09) sucrase activity, longer (P = 0.08) ileal villi, and greater (P = 0.06) duodenal TH expression. Microbial communities of TEST piglets differed from CONT in ascending colon (AC, P = 0.001) and feces (P ≤ 0.05). CONT piglets had greater relative abundances of Mogibacterium, Collinsella, Klebsiella, Escherichia/Shigella, Eubacterium, and Roseburia compared with TEST piglets in AC. In feces, CONT piglets harbored lower (P ≤ 0.05) proportions of Parabacteroides, Clostridium IV, Lutispora, and Sutterella than TEST piglets.A mixture of bioactive ingredients improved weight gain and gut maturation, modulated colonic and fecal microbial composition, and reduced the proportions of opportunistic pathogens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26595282>(1)H NMR based metabolomic profiling revealed doxorubicin-induced systematic alterations in a rat model.</a></h1><p>Doxorubicin (DOX) is used as a chemotherapy drug with severe carditoxicity.

Echocardiographic results showed that impaired left ventricular contractility and degenerative pathology lesions in DOX group, which were in consistent with pathology. The endogenous metabolites in the urine, serum, heart and kidney was identified by comparison with the data from the literature and databases. Multivariate analysis, including PCA and OPLS, revealed 8 metabolites in urine, including succinate, 2-ketoglutarate, citrate, hippurate, methylamine, benzoate, allantion, and acetate were the potential changed biomarkers. In serum, perturbed metabolites include elevation of leucine, β-glucose, O-acetyl-glycoprotein, creatine, lysine, glycerin, dimethylglycine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, myo-inositol, and N-acetyl-glycoprotein, together with level decreases of acetone, lipid, lactate, glutamate, phosphocholine, acetoacetate and pyruvate. For heart, DOX exposure caused decline of lipid, lactate, leucine, alanine, glutamate, choline, xanthine, glycerin, carnitine, and fumarate, together with elevation of glutamine, creatine, inosine, taurine and malate. Metabolic changes of kidney were mainly involved in the accumulation of α-glucose, lactate, phosphocholine, betaine, threonine, choline, taurine, glycine, urea, hypoxanthine, glutamate, and nicotinamide, coupled with reduction of asparagine, valine, methionine, , lysine, alanine, leucine, ornithine, creatine, lipid, and acetate. In addition, alterations of urinary metabolites exhibited a time-dependent manner. Complementary evidences by multiple matrices revealed disturbed pathways concerning energy metabolism, fatty acids oxidation, amino acids and purine metabolism, choline metabolism, and gut -related metabolism. In addition, the change of endogenous metabolites in rats urine, serum, heart and kidney were correlated with the echocardiography parameters.

The authors performed the analysis of the main chemical classes of low molecular weight compounds (amino acids, polyols, fatty acids, hydroxy acids, amines, nucleotides and their derivatives) that quantitatively distinguish patients with sepsis from healthy ones. The following keywords were used to find papers published in the Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2008 to 2015: (marker OR biomarker) AND (sepsis OR critical ill OR pneumonia OR hypoxia). Key words for the search were the following: metabolomics, metabolic profiling, sepsis, metabolism, biomarkers, critically ill patients, multiple organ failure. Several metabolomic findings in sepsis are still waiting for an explanation. When assessing metabolomic analysis results in patients with sepsis we should take into account the intervention of microbial metabolism. Among the low molecular weight compounds detected in septic patient blood, a special attention should be paid to the molecules which could be attributed to "common metabolites" of man and bacteria. The genomic region overlap and the production of enzymes which are similar in function and final products could be a possible reason for this phenomenon. For example, microbial biodegradation products of aromatic compounds are increased many times in blood of patients with sepsis. On the one hand, it shows a high metabolic activity of the bacteria. On the other hand, these molecules are intermediates in the metabolism of aromatic amino acids such as  and phenylalanine in human body. It is important that there are many clinical studies, which confirmed the diagnostic and prognostic significance of series of aromatic metabolites, including those with intrinsic biological activity. We can't exclude the presence of signaling pathways, cell receptors, transmembrane transporters and others which are common for a human and bacteria and their direct participation in mechanisms of organ dysfunction and hypotension in sepsis. Thus, today, we should not limit ourselves studying eukaryotic cells while searching for new molecular mechanisms of sepsis-associated organ failure and septic shock. We should take into account and simulate in the experiments the changes of a human internal environment, which occur during the radical microbiome "restructuring" in critically ill patients. This approach opens up new prospects for an objective monitoring of diseases, carrying out an assessment of the integral metabolic profile in a given time on common metabolites (particularly aromatic), and in future will provide new targets for therapeutic effects.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Oxidative stress-responsive apoptosis-inducing protein (ORAIP; a -sulfated secreted form of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A [eIF5A]) is a recently discovered pro-apoptotic ligand that is secreted from cells in response to oxidative stress and induces apoptosis in an autocrine fashion. This study aimed to determine if ORAIP plays a role in DR.To investigate the role of ORAIP in DR, we analyzed the levels of ORAIP in the vitreous body and their relationship with the extent of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify the levels of ORAIP, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8 in the vitreous body of 40 eyes from 28 patients with PDR and 11 patients with non-PDR (NPDR). We also analyzed the expression of ORAIP in insoluble proliferative tissues from vitreous body samples by immunofluorescent staining.The vitreous body concentration of ORAIP was significantly (P = 0.0433) higher in the PDR group (52.26 ± 8.68 [mean ± SE] ng/mL, n = 29) than in the NPDR group (28.21 ± 7.30 ng/mL, n = 11). However, there were no significant correlations between the concentration of ORAIP and those of VEGF, IL-6, CCL2, or IL-8. ORAIP expression was observed in the insoluble proliferative tissues in vitreous body samples of most patients in the PDR group, whereas almost no expression of ORAIP was observed in patients in the NPDR group.Our findings strongly suggest that ORAIP plays a role in oxidative stress-induced retinal injury and may be a sensitive diagnostic marker and a promising therapeutic target for oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31196984>Discovery and inhibition of an interspecies gut bacterial pathway for Levodopa metabolism.</a></h1><p>The human gut  metabolizes the Parkinson's disease medication Levodopa (l-dopa), potentially reducing drug availability and causing side effects.

In the present study, the effects of chlorogenic acid (ChA) and caffeic acid (CaA) on HCC induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) were evaluated. ChA or CaA could reduce the histopathological changes and liver injury markers, such as alanine transarninase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bile acid, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. The underlying mechanisms were investigated by a data integration strategy based on correlation analyses of metabonomics data and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing data. ChA or CaA could inhibit the increase of Rumincoccaceae UCG-004 and reduction of Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, and Prevotella 9 in HCC rats. The principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis were applied to reveal the metabolic differences among these groups. 28 different metabolites showed a trend to return to normal in both CaA and ChA treatment.

However, the kinds of bacteria producing UTs are rarely discussed.We analyzed UT production and the composition of gut  in CKD rats and cecectomized rats. AST-120, a spherical carbon adsorbent, was administrated to evaluate how the precursors of UT affect gut . Serum and urine levels of UTs were quantified by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Gut  were analyzed using 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering and UniFrac analysis were performed to compare gut  among the groups.Serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate and phenyl sulfate were higher in CKD versus control rats (p < 0.05). AST-120 administration decreased UT production (p < 0.01) and changed overall gut  composition in CKD rats. UT urinary excretion and gut  composition changed in cecectomized rats, with the relative abundance of Clostridia- and Bacteroidia-affiliated species being significantly reduced (p < 0.01). We identified candidate indole- and phenol-producing intestinal , 3 Clostridia, and 2 Bacteroidia. These OTUs have a tryptophanase/ phenol-lyase gene in the closest sequenced genome out of the OTUs declined following cecectomy.Our data suggest that UT production is correlated with a subset of indigenous gut .

The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in the gut  alter gut-brain interactions inducing changes in blood pressure (BP). Recipient normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were orally gavaged with donor fecal contents from SHR and WKY. We divided the animals into four groups: WKY transplanted with WKY  (W-W), SHR with SHR (S-S), WKY with SHR (W-S) and SHR with WKY (S-W). Basal systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were reduced with no change in heart rate as a result of fecal  transplantation (FMT) from WKY rats to SHR. Similarly, FMT from SHR to WKY increased basal SBP and DBP. Increases in both NADPH oxidase-driven reactive oxygen species production and proinflammatory cytokines in brain paraventricular nucleus linked to higher BP drop with pentolinium and plasmatic noradrenaline (NA) levels were found in the S-S group as compared to the W-W group. These parameters were reduced by FMT from WKY to SHR. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,  hydroxylase mRNA levels and NA content in the proximal colon, whereas reduced mRNA levels of gap junction proteins, were found in the S-S group as compared to the W-W group. These changes were inhibited by FMT from WKY to SHR. According to our correlation analyses, the abundance of  and  showed a negative correlation with high SBP. In conclusion, in SHR gut  is an important factor involved in BP control, at least in part, as consequence of its effect on neuroinflammation and the sympathetic nervous system activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19810704>Metabolic effects of dark chocolate consumption on energy, gut , and stress-related metabolism in free-living subjects.</a></h1><p>Dietary preferences influence basal human metabolism and gut microbiome activity that in turn may have long-term health consequences. The present study reports the metabolic responses of free living subjects to a daily consumption of 40 g of dark chocolate for up to 14 days. A clinical trial was performed on a population of 30 human subjects, who were classified in low and high anxiety traits using validated psychological questionnaires. Biological fluids (urine and blood plasma) were collected during 3 test days at the beginning, midtime and at the end of a 2 week study. NMR and MS-based metabonomics were employed to study global changes in metabolism due to the chocolate consumption. Human subjects with higher anxiety trait showed a distinct metabolic profile indicative of a different energy homeostasis (lactate, citrate, succinate, trans-aconitate, urea, proline), hormonal metabolism (adrenaline, DOPA, 3-methoxy-) and gut microbial activity (methylamines, p-cresol sulfate, hippurate). Dark chocolate reduced the urinary excretion of the stress hormone cortisol and catecholamines and partially normalized stress-related differences in energy metabolism (glycine, citrate, trans-aconitate, proline, beta-alanine) and gut microbial activities (hippurate and p-cresol sulfate). The study provides strong evidence that a daily consumption of 40 g of dark chocolate during a period of 2 weeks is sufficient to modify the metabolism of free living and healthy human subjects, as per variation of both host and gut microbial metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889832>Paulownia Leaves as A New Feed Resource: Chemical Composition and Effects on Growth, Carcasses, Digestibility, Blood Biochemistry, and Intestinal Bacterial Populations of Growing Rabbits.</a></h1><p>This experiment was conducted to study the effects of paulownia leaf meal (PLM) as a nontraditional feed on the growth, carcasses, digestibility, blood chemistry, and intestinal  of growing rabbits. Sixty rabbits (5-weeks old) were randomly allotted to three dietary treatments containing three amounts of PLM (0%, 15%, and 30%). The results showed that PLM has a higher content of ether extract, organic matter, methionine, , histidine, manganese, and zinc than alfalfa hay. Body weight gain decreased when 30% PLM was provided. The best feed conversion ratio was recorded in the rabbits fed 15% PLM. A notable increase in high-density lipoprotein levels with a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein was noted in the rabbits fed the PLM diets. Total fungi and Enterobacteriaceae and total bacterial count in the feed were significantly reduced because of PLM. In the cecum, coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae species, and total bacterial count declined in the rabbits fed the PLM diets. Conclusively, up to 15% PLM can be used in rabbit diets without any deleterious effects on the performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood constituents.

However, in the absence of a surrogate animal host, understanding of the interactions between coral pathogens and their hosts remains relatively limited, compared to other pathosystems of similar global importance. A tropical sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida, has been investigated as a surrogate model to study certain aspects of coral biology. Therefore, to test whether the utility of this surrogate model can be extended to study coral diseases, in the present study, we tested its susceptibility to common coral pathogens (Vibrio coralliilyticus and Vibrio shiloi) as well as polymicrobial consortia recovered from the Caribbean Yellow Band Disease (CYBD) lesions. A. pallida was susceptible to each of the tested pathogens. A. pallida responded to the pathogens with darkening of the tissues (associated with an increased melanization) and retraction of tentacles, followed by complete disintegration of polyp tissues. Loss of zooxanthellae was not observed; however, the disease progression pattern is consistent with the behavior of necrotizing pathogens.

Many strains carry large, integrated elements including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). One such ICE is CTnDOT, which is 65 kb in size and encodes resistances to tetracycline and erythromycin. CTnDOT has been increasing in prevalence in Bacteroides spp., and is now found in greater than 80% of natural isolates. In recent years, CTnDOT has been implicated in the spread of antibiotic resistance among gut . Interestingly, the excision and transfer of CTnDOT is stimulated in the presence of tetracycline. The  recombinase IntDOT catalyzes the integration and excision reactions of CTnDOT. Unlike the well-characterized lambda Int, IntDOT tolerates heterology in the overlap region between the sites of cleavage and strand exchange. IntDOT also appears to have a different arrangement of active site catalytic residues. It is missing one of the arginine residues that is conserved in other  recombinases. The excision reaction of CTnDOT is complex, involving excision proteins Xis2c, Xis2d, and Exc, as well as IntDOT and a Bacteroides host factor. Xis2c and Xis2d are small, basic proteins like other recombination directionality factors (RDFs). Exc is a topoisomerase; however, the topoisomerase function is not required for the excision reaction. Exc has been shown to stimulate excision frequencies when there are mismatches in the overlap regions, suggesting that it may play a role in resolving Holliday junctions (HJs) containing heterology. Work is currently under way to elucidate the complex interactions involved with the formation of the CTnDOT excisive intasomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28379433>Microbiome perturbation by oral vancomycin reduces plasma concentration of two gut-derived uremic solutes, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, in end-stage renal disease.</a></h1><p>Observational studies have suggested a relationship between the plasma concentration of indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), small gut-derived 'uremic solutes', and the high incidence of uremic cardiomyopathy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). IS and PCS are derived from the metabolism of dietary components (tryptophan and ) by gut bacteria. This pilot study was designed to examine the effects of a poorly absorbable antibiotic (vancomycin) on the plasma concentration of two gut-derived 'uremic solutes', IS and PCS, and on the composition of the gut microbiome.Plasma concentrations of IS and PCS were measured by MS-HPLC. The gut microbiome was assessed in stool specimens sequenced for the 16S rRNA gene targeting the V4 region.The pre-dialysis mean plasma concentrations of both IS and PCS were markedly elevated. Following the administration of vancomycin (Day 0), the IS and PCS concentrations decreased at Day 2 or Day 5 and returned to baseline by Day 28. Following vancomycin administration, several changes in the gut microbiome were observed. Most striking was the decrease in diversity, a finding that was evident on Day 7 and was still evident at Day 28. There was little change at the phylum level but at the genus level, broad population changes were noted. Changes in the abundance of several genera appeared to parallel the concentration of IS and PCS.These findings suggest that alteration of the gut microbiome, by an antibiotic, might provide an important strategy in reducing the levels of IS and PCS in ESRD.© The Author 2017.

The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of fecal  using an oral rotenone model of PD from a longitudinal study over a period of 4 weeks. Gastrointestinal function was assessed by measuring fecal pellet output, motor functions was assessed by open-field and pole tests every week. α-synuclein pathology, inflammation and  hydroxylase (TH) neuron loss from the middle brain were also analyzed. Fecal samples were collected every week followed by 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We reported that chronically oral administered rotenone caused gastrointestinal dysfunction and microbiome dysbiosis prior to motor dysfunction and central nervous system (CNS) pathology. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiome showed rotenone-treated mice exhibited fecal  dysbiosis characterized by an overall decrease in bacterial diversity and a significant change of  composition, notably members of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with an increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio after 3 weeks of rotenone treatment. Moreover, rotenone-induced gastrointestinal and motor dysfunctions were observed to be robustly correlated with changes in the composition of fecal . Our results demonstrated that gut microbiome perturbation might contribute to rotenone toxicity in the initiation of PD and brought a new insight in the pathogenesis of PD. Novel therapeutic options aimed at modifying the gut  composition might postpone the onset and following cascade of neurodegeneration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29982420>Identification of phenol- and p-cresol-producing intestinal bacteria by using media supplemented with  and its metabolites.</a></h1><p>To identify intestinal bacteria that produce phenols (phenol and p-cresol), we screened 153 strains within 152 species in 44 genera by culture-based assay using broth media supplemented with 200 µM each of  and its predicted microbial metabolic intermediates (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, DL-4-hydroxyphenyllactate, 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and 4-hydroxybenzoate). Phenol-producing activity was found in 36 strains and p-cresol-producing activity in 55 strains. Sixteen strains had both types of activity. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains that produced 100 µM or more of phenols revealed that 16 phenol producers belonged to the Coriobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae and Clostridium clusters I and XIVa; four p-cresol-producing bacteria belonged to the Coriobacteriaceae and Clostridium clusters XI and XIVa; and one strain producing both belonged to the Coriobacteriaceae. A genomic search for protein homologs of enzymes involved in the metabolism of  to phenols in 10 phenol producers and four p-cresol producers, the draft genomes of which were available in public databases, predicted that phenol producers harbored  phenol-lyase or hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase, or both, and p-cresol producers harbored p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase or  lyase, or both. These results provide important information about the bacterial strains that contribute to production of phenols in the intestine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20688235>Quantitative detection and identification of tyramine-producing enterococci and lactobacilli in cheese by multiplex qPCR.</a></h1><p>Tyramine is the most abundant biogenic amine in fermented dairy products, in which it is produced through the microbial enzymatic decarboxylation of . This activity has been detected in a variety of lactic acid bacteria mainly belonging to the genera Enterococcus and Lactobacillus. This paper describes a culture-independent qPCR method, based on the specific amplification of the tdc gene, for the detection, quantification and identification of bacteria with the ability to produce tyramine. This method was found to be specific and to show a wide dynamic range, thus allowing the quantification of these tdc+ bacterial groups among the complex  of cheese. tdc qPCR was used to follow the development of tdc+  during the manufacture of a blue-veined cheese (Cabrales) made from raw milk. In this type of cheese, tdc+ enterococci seem to be responsible for the high concentrations of tyramine detected. The method was also used to identify and quantify tdc+ enterococci and lactobacilli in 18 commercially available cheeses. Different types and numbers of these microorganisms were found. Their relationships with the concentration of tyramine and technological factors are discussed.2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study determined the effects of dietary supplementation with an amino acid blend (AAB; glutamate:glutamine:glycine:arginine:N-acetylcysteine = 5:2:2:1:0.5) on piglet growth performance and intestinal functions. Sixteen piglets (24-day-old) were randomly assigned to a corn and soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0.99% alanine (isonitrogenous control) or 1% AAB. On day 20 of the trial, blood and intestinal tissue samples were obtained from piglets. Compared with the control, AAB supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) diarrhoea incidence; plasma alanine aminotransferase and diamine oxidase activities; intestinal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, and heat shock protein-70, and intestinal mRNA levels for interleukin-1β, interferon-γ, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-9; and the numbers of Enterobacterium family, Enterococcus genus and Clostridium coccoides in the colon digesta. Furthermore, AAB supplementation enhanced (P < 0.05): the plasma concentrations of serine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, , phenylalanine, tryptophan, lysine, arginine, citrulline, ornithine, taurine, and γ-aminobutyric acid; intestinal villus height and surface area, villus height/crypt depth ratio, antioxidative enzyme activities, and mRNA levels for porcine β-defensin-1, sodium-independent amino acid transporters (bAT and yLAT1), aquaporin (AQP) 3, AQP8, AQP10, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and glutathione S-transferase omega-2, and protein abundances of AQP3, AQP4, claudin-1, occludin and myxovirus resistance 1; and the numbers of Bifidobacterium genus and Lactobacillus genus in the colon digesta.

Recent studies suggest that several of these metabolites that derive from microbial transformation of dietary components have significant effects on physiological processes such as gut and immune homeostasis, energy metabolism, vascular function, and neurological behavior. Here, we review several of the most intriguing diet-dependent metabolites that may impact host physiology and may therefore be appropriate targets for therapeutic interventions, such as short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, tryptophan and  derivatives, and oxidized fatty acids. Such interventions will require modulating either bacterial species or the bacterial biosynthetic enzymes required to produce these metabolites, so we briefly describe the current understanding of the bacterial and enzymatic pathways involved in their biosynthesis and summarize their molecular mechanisms of action. We then discuss in more detail the impact of these metabolites on health and disease, and review current strategies to modulate levels of these metabolites to promote human health. We also suggest future studies that are needed to realize the full therapeutic potential of targeting the gut .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29790946>A microbial endocrinology-based simulated small intestinal medium for the evaluation of neurochemical production by gut .</a></h1><p>Microbial endocrinology represents the union of microbiology and neurobiology and is concerned with the ability of neurochemicals to serve as an evolutionary-based language between host and  in health and disease. The recognition that microorganisms produce, modify and respond to the same neurochemicals utilized in the various signaling pathways of their mammalian hosts is increasingly being recognized as a mechanism by which the host and  may interact to influence the progression of infectious disease as well as influence behavior through the -gut-brain axis. While the capacity for bacteria to produce neurochemicals has been recognized for decades, the degree to which this occurs in the environment of the gastrointestinal tract is still poorly understood. By combining techniques used in analytic chemistry, food science and environmental microbiology, a novel culture-based method was developed which generates a medium utilizing animal feed which resembles the contents of the small intestine. The usage of this medium allows for the in vitro growth of bacteria native to the gastrointestinal tract in an environment that is reflective of the small-intestinal host-based milieu. We describe a detailed protocol for the preparation of this medium and the quantification of neurochemicals by microorganisms grown therein. Catecholamines including dopamine and its precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenalanine (L-DOPA) as well as biogenic amines including tyramine and its precursor , serve as prototypical examples of neurochemicals that are quantifiable with the methods described herein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21105667>Global metabolic phenotyping in an experimental laparotomy model of surgical trauma.</a></h1><p>Surgical trauma initiates a complex series of metabolic host responses designed to maintain homeostasis and ensure survival. (1)H NMR spectroscopy was applied to intraoperative urine and plasma samples as part of a strategy to analyze the metabolic response of Wistar rats to a laparotomy model. Spectral data were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that surgical injury is responsible for the majority of the metabolic variability demonstrated between animals (R² Urine = 81.2% R² plasma = 80%). Further statistical analysis by orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) allowed the identification of novel urinary metabolic markers of surgical trauma. Urinary levels of taurine, glucose, urea, creatine, allantoin, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were significantly increased after surgery whereas citrate and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) negatively correlated with the intraoperative state as did plasma levels of betaine and . Plasma levels of lipoproteins such as VLDL and LDL also rose with the duration of surgery. Moreover, the microbial cometabolites 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate, phenylacetylglycine, and hippurate correlated with the surgical insult, indicating that the gut  are highly sensitive to the global homeostatic state of the host. Metabonomic profiling provides a global overview of surgical trauma that has the potential to provide novel biomarkers for personalized surgical optimization and outcome prediction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29577618>Flavan-3-ol/Procyanidin Metabolomics in Rat Urine Using HPLC-Quadrupole TOF/MS.</a></h1><p>Several studies have demonstrated that flavan-3-ol/procyanidins are associated with biological functions in the prevention of various chronic diseases, including obesity and diabetes. Knowledge of their mechanisms, including bioavailability, has significantly progressed in the last decade. However, the differences of the metabolic signatures among flavan-3-ol/procyanidins remain ambiguous.The metabolites in urine over time after acute administration of three typical flavan-3-ol/procyanidins ((epi)catechin [EPC], epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG], and procyanidin dimer [PC]) in view of the chemical structure were analyzed by HPLC-quadrupole TOF/MS. Several bile acid and amino acid derivatives including tryptophan and , as well as flavan-3-ol/procyanidin conjugates and phenolic acid degradation products generated by the gut  were observed in rat urine.Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that the exogenous and endogenous metabolites of flavan-3-ol/procyanidins greatly differ, although the chemical structures of three typical flavan-3-ol/procyanidins-EPC, EGCG, and PC-are similar. Thus, metabolomic differences likely affect their biological functions and health benefits.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, newly weaned (3 week) and adult (8 week) male rats fed a normal- or high- fat diet were chronically exposed to 0.3 mg chlorpyrifos/kg bodyweight/day. The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut  were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide   (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood. Furthermore, a decrease in epinephrine induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, regardless of their diet. Chlorpyrifos-induced disturbances in the microbiome community structure were more apparent in rats fed a high-fat diet and exposed beginning at newly weaned. The affected bacteria included short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, norank_f_Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibaculum, Parasutterella and norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae), testosterone-related genus (Turicibacter, Brevibacterium), pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus), and inflammation-related bacteria (unclassified_f__Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, Parasutterella, Oscillibacter), which regulated the endocrine system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as the immune response and gut barrier. Early exposure accelerated the endocrine-disturbing effect and immune responses of chlorpyrifos, although these effects can be eased or recovered by a high-fat diet. This study helped clarify the relationship between disrupted endocrine function and gut  dysbiosis induced by food contaminants such as pesticides.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A total of 300 lactic acid bacteria and 300 staphylococcal strains have been isolated and identified by their physiological characteristics. Lactobacillus plantarum strains were found to dominate the lactic acid bacteria  in most of the cases with L. sakei strains prevailing in some of them and L. rhamnosus strains occasionally accompanying the dominant lactic acid bacteria . On the other hand, S. saprophyticus strains were found to dominate the staphylococcal  in all spontaneously fermented sausages with of S. simulans, S. xylosus, S. gallinarum and S. cohnii cohnii strains being sporadically present. Following the identification, an evaluation of their technological properties, namely proteolytic and lipolytic capacities as well as production of biogenic amines and antimicrobial compounds, took place. None of the lactic acid bacteria and staphylococci was found to possess lipolytic activity whereas a total of 6 lactic acid bacteria and 51 staphylococci strains were found to be able to hydrolyse either the sarcoplasic, myofibrillar or both protein fractions. Furthermore, only one L. sakei strain and 185 staphylococci strains were found to possess decarboxylase activity against lysine, , ornithine or histidine.

Mice received daily intragastric administration of either O-Tyr (320 μg/kg body weight), dityrosine (Dityr, 320 μg/kg body weight), or saline for consecutive 6 weeks. Urine and plasma samples were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics strategies. Body weight, clinical chemistry, oxidative damage indexes, and histopathological data were obtained as complementary information. O-Tyr and Dityr exposure changed many systemic metabolic processes, including reduced choline bioavailability, led to fat accumulation in liver, induced hepatic injury, and renal dysfunction, resulted in changes in gut  functions, elevated risk factor for cardiovascular disease, altered amino acid metabolism, induced oxidative stress responses, and inhibited energy metabolism.

While the mechanisms by which commensal prokaryotes stimulate immune signaling networks are well-characterized, less is known about the mechanistic control over homeostatic pathways within tissues. Recent reports by our research group have demonstrated that contact between the gut epithelia and some groups of enteric commensal bacteria prompts the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within host cells. Whereas the bacterial-induced production of ROS in phagocytes in response to ligand binding to Formyl Peptide Receptors (FPRs) and ensuing activation of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is a well-defined mechanism, ROS generated by other cell types such as intestinal epithelia in response to microbial signals via FPRs and the NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) is less appreciated. Importantly, enzymatically generated ROS have been shown to function as second messengers in many signal transduction pathways via the transient oxidative activity on sensor proteins bearing oxidant-sensitive thiol groups. Examples of redox sensitive proteins include  phosphatases that serve as regulators of MAPK pathways, focal adhesion kinase, as well as components involved NF-kB activation. Here, we review the leading edge discoveries gleaned from investigations that focus on microbial-induced generation of ROS and their functional effects on host physiology. These studies identify the functional molecular elements and mechanistic events that mediate the established effects of the normal  on intestinal physiology.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The colonies were yellow-orange; flexirubin-type pigments were not found. The strain hydrolysed gelatin, hippurate,  and Tweens 20 and 80. Optimal growth was observed with 6-8% (w/v) NaCl, at pH 7-8 and at 27-30 °C. The genomic DNA G+C content was 33.6 mol%. In phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain WCC 4520(T) appeared to be a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae and the closest phylogenetic neighbours were identified as Psychroflexus gondwanensis DSM 5423(T) (94.0% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Psychroflexus salinarum CCUG 56752(T) (94.0%). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(15:0), iso-C(15:1) G and iso-C(17:0) 3-OH. The only detected quinone was MK-6 and the major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified aminolipid and an unidentified polar lipid. Minor polar lipids and traces of polyamines were also detected. On the basis of the data presented, strain WCC 4520(T) represents a novel species of the genus Psychroflexus, for which the name Psychroflexus halocasei sp. nov. is proposed.

Outcome measurements of metabolic responses, inflammatory markers and gut bacterial composition were analysed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period.Both IPE and inulin supplementation improved insulin resistance compared with cellulose supplementation, measured by homeostatic model assessment 2 (mean±SEM 1.23±0.17 IPE vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.001; 1.17±0.15 inulin vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.009), with no differences between IPE and inulin (p=0.272). Fasting insulin was only associated positively with plasma  and negatively with plasma glycine following inulin supplementation. IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on the systemic inflammatory markers studied. Inulin promoted changes in gut bacterial populations at the class level (increased Actinobacteria and decreased Clostridia) and order level (decreased Clostridiales) compared with cellulose, with small differences at the species level observed between IPE and cellulose.These data demonstrate a distinctive physiological impact of raising colonic propionate delivery in humans, as improvements in insulin sensitivity promoted by IPE and inulin were accompanied with different effects on the plasma metabolome, gut bacterial populations and markers of systemic inflammation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

MAT infants also exhibited enhanced susceptibility to a systemic viral infection and altered adaptive immune cell activation phenotype and function. CD8 effector T cells from MAT infants consistently demonstrate an inability to sustain interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production  following vaccinia virus infection and  upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. We hypothesize that T cells developing in infant mice with gastrointestinal  dysbiosis and insufficient toll-like receptor (TLR) exposure alters immune responsiveness associated with intrinsic T cell defects in the TCR signaling pathway and compromised T cell effector function. To evaluate this, splenic T cells from day of life 15 MAT infant mice were stimulated  with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies prior to examining the expression of ZAP-70, phosphorylated ZAP-70, phospho-Erk-1/2, c-Rel, total protein  phosphorylation, and IFN-γ production. We determine that MAT infant CD8 T cells fail to sustain total protein  phosphorylation and Erk1/2 activation.

Recent studies have emphasized the crosstalk between gut and brain, highlighting how gut composition can influence behavior and brain functions. Thus, the present study investigates the relationship between PANS/PANDAS and gut  ecology. The gut composition of a cohort of 30 patients with PANS/PANDAS was analyzed and compared to control subjects using 16S rRNA-based metagenomics. Data were analyzed for their α- and β-diversity; differences in bacterial distribution were detected by Wilcoxon and LEfSe tests, while metabolic profile was predicted via PICRUSt software. These analyses demonstrate the presence of an altered bacterial community structure in PANS/PANDAS patients with respect to controls. In particular, ecological analysis revealed the presence of two main clusters of subjects based on age range. Thus, to avoid age bias, data from patients and controls were split into two groups: 4-8 years old and >9 years old. The younger PANS/PANDAS group was characterized by a strong increase in Bacteroidetes; in particular, , , and  were identified as potential microbial biomarkers of this composition type. Moreover, this group exhibited an increase of several pathways concerning the modulation of the antibody response to inflammation within the gut as well as a decrease in pathways involved in brain function (i.e., SCFA, D-alanine and  metabolism, and the dopamine pathway). The older group of patients displayed a less uniform bacterial profile, thus impairing the identification of distinct biomarkers. Finally, Pearson's analysis between bacteria and anti-streptolysin O titer reveled a negative correlation between genera belonging to Firmicutes phylum and anti-streptolysin O while a positive correlation was observed with . In conclusion, this study suggests that streptococcal infections alter gut bacterial communities leading to a pro-inflammatory status through the selection of specific bacterial strains associated with gut inflammation and immune response activation. These findings highlight the possibility of studying bacterial biomarkers associated with this disorder and might led to novel potential therapeutic strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29315562>HFE Genotype Restricts the Response to Paraquat in a Mouse Model of Neurotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease is marked clinically by motor dysfunction and pathologically by dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. The driver underlying iron accumulation remains unknown and could be genetic or environmental. The HFE protein is critical for the regulation of cellular iron uptake. Mutations within this protein are associated with increased iron accumulation including in the brain. We have focused on the commonly occurring H63D variant of the HFE gene as a disease modifier in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate the role of H63D HFE genotype, we generated a mouse model in which the wild-type (WT) HFE gene is replaced by the H67D gene variant (mouse homolog of the human H63D gene variant). Using paraquat toxicity as the model for Parkinson's disease, we found that WT mice responded as expected with significantly greater motor function, loss of  hydroxylase staining and increase microglial staining in the substantia nigra, and an increase in R relaxation rate within the substantia nigra of the paraquat-treated mice compared to their saline-treated counterparts. In contrast, the H67D mice showed a remarkable resistance to paraquat treatment; specifically differing from the WT mice with no changes in motor function or changes in R relaxation rates following paraquat exposure. At baseline, there were differences between the H67D HFE mice and WT mice in gut microbiome profile and increased L-ferritin staining in the substantia nigra that could account for the resistance to paraquat. Of particular note, the H67D HFE mice regardless of whether or not they were treated with paraquat had significantly less  hydroxylase immunostaining than WT. Our results clearly demonstrate that the HFE genotype impacts the expression of  hydroxylase in the substantia nigra, the gut microbiome and the response to paraquat providing additional support that the HFE genotype is a disease modifier for Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the finding that the HFE mutant mice are resistant to paraquat may provide a model in which to study resistant mechanisms to neurotoxicants.© 2018 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415771>Urinary metabolic disturbance in the olfactory bulbectomized rats and the modulatory effects of fluoxetine.</a></h1><p>The present study aims to investigate the impacts of olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) on urinary metabolic profile and tryptophan metabolites in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats, and to explore the regulation effects of fluoxetine.OBX model was developed by aspiration of olfactory bulbs.

The levels of TRP, 5-HIAA, 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio and DA increased, while kynurenine and 5-HT decreased in PFC of OBX rats. The activities of TPH2 and IDO1were inhibited after OBX. Twenty-six altered metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers in OBX rats involved in tryptophan metabolism, gut  metabolism, energy metabolism, purine metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, and  metabolism. Among them, 15 abnormal metabolites were corrected by fluoxetine to some extent.Our results revealed that urinary metabolic profile changed greatly in OBX rats, and identified biomarkers might be helpful for the diagnosis of agitated depression. The regulation effects of fluoxetine on urinary metabolic profile and tryptophan metabolites in PFC might contribute to its antidepressant action in OBX rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, increased levels of pCS have been associated with worsening outcomes in CKD patients. pCS finds its origin in the intestine where gut bacteria metabolize aromatic amino acids, such as  and phenylalanine, leading to phenolic end products, of which pCS is one of the components. In this review we summarize the biological effects of pCS and its metabolic origin in the intestine. It appears that, according to  studies, the intestinal bacteria generating phenolic compounds mainly belong to the families , and . Since pCS remains difficult to remove by dialysis, the gut  could be a future target to decrease pCS levels and its toxicity, even at earlier stages of CKD, aiming at slowing down the progression of the disease and decreasing the cardiovascular burden.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617199>Causality of small and large intestinal  in weight regulation and insulin resistance.</a></h1><p>The twin pandemics of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are a global challenge for health care systems. Changes in the environment, behavior, diet, and lifestyle during the last decades are considered the major causes. A Western diet, which is rich in saturated fat and simple sugars, may lead to changes in gut microbial composition and physiology, which have recently been linked to the development of metabolic diseases.We will discuss evidence that demonstrates the influence of the small and large intestinal  on weight regulation and the development of insulin resistance, based on literature search.Altered large intestinal microbial composition may promote obesity by increasing energy harvest through specialized gut microbes. In both large and small intestine, microbial alterations may increase gut permeability that facilitates the translocation of whole bacteria or endotoxic bacterial components into metabolic active tissues. Moreover, changed microbial communities may affect the production of satiety-inducing signals. Finally, bacterial metabolic products, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and their relative ratios, may be causal in disturbed immune and metabolic signaling, notably in the small intestine where the surface is large. The function of these organs (adipose tissue, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas) may be disturbed by the induction of low-grade inflammation, contributing to insulin resistance.Interventions aimed to restoring gut microbial homeostasis, such as ingestion of specific fibers or therapeutic microbes, are promising strategies to reduce insulin resistance and the related metabolic abnormalities in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

In this context, the catabolism of amino acid tryptophan via kynurenine may play an important role. The present study examined the effect of a probiotic supplement on the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and the metabolism of aromatic amino acids after exhaustive aerobic exercise in trained athletes during three months of winter training.Thirty-three highly trained individuals were randomly assigned to probiotic (PRO,  = 17) or placebo (PLA,  = 16) groups using double blind procedures, receiving either 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU) of a multi-species probiotic ( W23,  W51,  W54,  W22,  W63, and  W58) or placebo once per day for 12 weeks. The serum concentrations of tryptophan, phenylalanine and their primary catabolites kynurenine and , as well as the concentration of the immune activation marker neopterin were determined at baseline and after 12 weeks, both at rest and immediately after exercise. Participants completed a daily diary to identify any infectious symptoms.After 12 weeks of treatment, post-exercise tryptophan levels were lowered by 11% (a significant change) in the PLA group compared to the concentrations measured before the intervention ( = 0.02), but remained unchanged in the PRO group. The ratio of subjects taking the placebo who experienced one or more URTI symptoms was increased 2.2-fold compared to those on probiotics (PLA 0.79, PRO 0.35;  = 0.02).Data indicate reduced exercise-induced tryptophan degradation rates in the PRO group. Daily supplementation with probiotics limited exercise-induced drops in tryptophan levels and reduced the incidence of URTI, however, did not benefit athletic performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082588>Linking heterotrophic bacterioplankton community composition to the optical dynamics of dissolved organic matter in a large eutrophic Chinese lake.</a></h1><p>Elucidation of the linkages between the bacterial community composition and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lake ecosystems is critical for the understanding of the inland water carbon cycling. Despite substantial research into the relationship between the bacteria community and the bulk DOM pool, knowledge of the specific relationship between the optical dynamics of DOM and the bacterioplankton community in lake ecosystems is still poor. We investigated the linkages between the optical dynamics of DOM and bacteria composition in shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) indicated that besides water temperature and phytoplankton biomass, also CDOM was an important factor determining the composition of the bacterial community. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) showed that terrestrial humic-like C1 and -like C4 were the key factors explaining the abundance of the main bacterial clades. C1 was closely correlated with Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Planctomycetes, and C4 was closely related to the latter two and to Bacteroidetes. At family level, the dominant families - Pelagibacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria) and Gemmataceae (Planctomycetes) - were related to both allochthonous and autochthonous CDOM fluorophores but responded differently to the various CDOM components. Tryptophan-like C2 was significantly and positively correlated with Gemmataceae and Ellin6075 (Acidobacteria). Additionally, we found that the biomasses of Cyanophyta, terrestrial humic-like C1, tryptophan-like C4 and C5 were significantly related to the richness of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Our results provide new insight into the relationship between bacteria and DOM optical dynamics although the mechanisms leading to these relationships need further experimental investigations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The antioxidant tempol was shown to prevent or reduce weight gain and modulate the gut  community in mice; however, the mechanism by which tempol modulates weight gain/loss with respect to the host and gut  has not been clearly established. Here we show that tempol (0, 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg p.o. for 5 days) decreased cecal bacterial fermentation and increased fecal energy excretion in a dose-dependent manner. Liver (1)H NMR-based metabolomics identified a dose-dependent decrease in glycogen and glucose, enhanced glucogenic and ketogenic activity ( and phenylalanine), and increased activation of the glycolysis pathway. Serum (1)H NMR-based metabolomics indicated that tempol promotes enhanced glucose catabolism. Hepatic gene expression was significantly altered as demonstrated by an increase in Pepck and G6pase and a decrease in Hnf4a, ChREBP, Fabp1, and Cd36 mRNAs. No significant change in the liver and serum metabolomic profiles was observed in germ-free mice, thus establishing a significant role for the gut  in mediating the beneficial metabolic effects of tempol. These results demonstrate that tempol modulates the gut microbial community and its function, resulting in reduced host energy availability and a significant shift in liver metabolism toward a more catabolic state.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28393748>Gut  of mice putatively modifies amino acid metabolism in the host brain.</a></h1><p>Recently, it has been found that the gut  influences functions of the host brain by affecting monoamine metabolism. The present study focused on the relationship between the gut  and the brain amino acids. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice were used as experimental models. Plasma and brain regions were sampled from mice at 7 and 16 weeks of age, and analysed for free d- and l-amino acids, which are believed to affect many physiological functions. At 7 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of d-aspartic acid (d-Asp), l-alanine (l-Ala), l-glutamine (l-Gln) and taurine were higher in SPF mice than in GF mice, but no differences were found at 16 weeks of age. Similar patterns were observed for the concentrations of l-Asp in striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and l-arginine (l-Arg), l-Ala and l-valine (l-Val) in striatum. In addition, the concentrations of l-Asp, d-Ala, l-histidine, l-isoleucine (l-Ile), l-leucine (l-Leu), l-phenylalanine and l-Val were significantly higher in plasma of SPF mice when compared with those of GF mice. The concentrations of l-Arg, l-Gln, l-Ile and l-Leu were significantly higher in SPF than in GF mice, but those of d-Asp, d-serine and l-serine were higher in some brain regions of GF mice than in those of SPF mice. In conclusion, the concentration of amino acids in the host brain seems to be dependent on presence of the gut . Amino acid metabolism in the host brain may be modified by manipulating  communities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150283>Nod2 Deficiency Augments Th17 Responses and Exacerbates Autoimmune Arthritis.</a></h1><p>Arthritis in a genetically susceptible SKG strain of mice models a theoretical paradigm wherein autoimmune arthritis arises because of interplay between preexisting autoreactive T cells and environmental stimuli. SKG mice have a point mutation in ZAP-70 that results in attenuated TCR signaling, altered thymic selection, and spontaneous production of autoreactive T cells that cause arthritis following exposure to microbial β-glucans. In this study, we identify Nod2, an innate immune receptor, as a critical suppressor of arthritis in SKG mice. SKG mice deficient in Nod2 (Nod2SKG) developed a dramatically exacerbated form of arthritis, which was independent of sex and , but required the  mutation in T cells. Worsened arthritis in Nod2SKG mice was accompanied by expansion of Th17 cells, which to some measure coproduced TNF, GM-CSF, and IL-22, along with elevated IL-17A levels within joint synovial fluid. Importantly, neutralization of IL-17A mitigated arthritis in Nod2SKG mice, indicating that Nod2-mediated protection occurs through suppression of the Th17 response. Nod2 deficiency did not alter regulatory T cell development or function. Instead, Nod2 deficiency resulted in an enhanced fundamental ability of SKG CD4 T cells (from naive mice) to produce increased levels of IL-17 and to passively transfer arthritis to lymphopenic recipients on a single-cell level. These data reveal a previously unconsidered role for T cell-intrinsic Nod2 as an endogenous negative regulator of Th17 responses and arthritogenic T cells. Based on our findings, future studies aimed at understanding a negative regulatory function of Nod2 within autoreactive T cells could provide novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of patients with arthritis.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23937589>Redox signaling mediated by the gut .</a></h1><p>The  that occupies the mammalian intestine can modulate a range of physiological functions, including control over immune responses, epithelial barrier function, and cellular proliferation. While commensal prokaryotic organisms are well known to stimulate inflammatory signaling networks, less is known about control over homeostatic pathways. Recent work has shown that gut epithelia contacted by enteric commensal bacteria rapidly generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). While the induced production of ROS in professional phagocytes via stimulation of formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) and activation of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is a well-studied process, ROS are also similarly elicited in other cell types, including intestinal epithelia, in response to microbial signals via FPRs and the epithelial NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1). ROS generated by Nox enzymes have been shown to function as critical second messengers in multiple signal transduction pathways via the rapid and transient oxidative inactivation of a distinct class of sensor proteins bearing oxidant-sensitive thiol groups. These redox-sensitive proteins include  phosphatases that serve as regulators of MAP kinase pathways, focal adhesion kinase, as well as components involved in NF-κB activation. As microbe-elicited ROS has been shown to stimulate cellular proliferation and motility, and to modulate innate immune signaling, we hypothesize that many of the established effects of the normal  on intestinal physiology may be at least partially mediated by this ROS-dependent mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015435>Gut microbiome-derived phenyl sulfate contributes to albuminuria in diabetic kidney disease.</a></h1><p>Diabetic kidney disease is a major cause of renal failure that urgently necessitates a breakthrough in disease management. Here we show using untargeted metabolomics that levels of phenyl sulfate, a gut -derived metabolite, increase with the progression of diabetes in rats overexpressing human uremic toxin transporter SLCO4C1 in the kidney, and are decreased in rats with limited proteinuria. In experimental models of diabetes, phenyl sulfate administration induces albuminuria and podocyte damage. In a diabetic patient cohort, phenyl sulfate levels significantly correlate with basal and predicted 2-year progression of albuminuria in patients with microalbuminuria. Inhibition of  phenol-lyase, a bacterial enzyme responsible for the synthesis of phenol from dietary  before it is metabolized into phenyl sulfate in the liver, reduces albuminuria in diabetic mice. Together, our results suggest that phenyl sulfate contributes to albuminuria and could be used as a disease marker and future therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29896452> Immune Responses Against Lyme Disease Pathogens.</a></h1><p>Although  and other related tick species are considered prolific vectors for a number of important human diseases, many aspects of their biology, microbial interactions, and immunity are largely unknown; in particular, how these ancient vectors recognize invading pathogens like  and influence their persistence. The analysis of the  genome and a limited set of transcriptomic data have established that ticks encode many components of classical immune pathways; yet at the same time, they lack many key orthologs of these recognition networks. Therefore, whether a given immune pathway is active in  ticks and how precisely they exert its microbicidal functions are only incompletely delineated. A few recent studies have suggested that classical pathways like the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) as well as immunodeficiency (IMD) pathways are fully functional in , and upon challenge with microbes, generate potent microbicidal responses against diverse tick-borne pathogens including . These studies also highlight novel concepts of vector immunity that include both a direct and an indirect mode of recognition of pathogens, as well as the influence of the gut microbiome, which ultimately dictates the outcome of a robust microbicidal response. Further understanding of how  ticks recognize and suppress invading microbes like  will enrich our fundamental knowledge of vector immunobiology, thereby contributing to the development of future interventions to better control the tick-borne pathogen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26012780>Pilot study on novel skin care method by augmentation with Staphylococcus epidermidis, an autologous skin microbe--A blinded randomized clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Staphylococcus epidermidis is an autologous bacterium that is beneficial to skin health. Our goal was to develop a novel, personalized basic cosmetic that exploits this characteristic.We conducted a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial on augmentation with S. epidermidis as a pilot study, in which S. epidermidis was collected from the subject, cultured for proliferation, and then continuously applied to the subject's own face before sleep twice per week for four weeks in order to increase colonization levels.The results showed that this treatment increased the lipid content of the skin and suppressed water evaporation, thereby markedly improving skin moisture retention. Moreover, augmentation with S. epidermidis maintained a low acidic condition on the skin surface. The low risk of undesirable effects induced by augmentation with S. epidermidis was also confirmed by measuring erythema and melanin levels.These results may serve as a driving force to accelerate the development of novel, personalized basic cosmetics.Copyright © 2015 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment, but their overuse is associated with antibiotic-resistant infections and deleterious effects in the . Therefore, alternative approaches are fully demanded. Sublingual immunization with MV140 (Uromune), a polyvalent bacterial preparation (PBP) of whole heat-inactivated bacteria, demonstrated clinical efficacy for the treatment of RUTIs, but the involved immunological mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that MV140 endorses human dendritic cells (DCs) with the capacity to generate Th1/Th17 and IL-10-producing T cells by mechanisms depending on spleen  kinase (Syk)- and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-mediated pathways. MV140-induced activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and p38 in human DCs is essential for the generated Th1/Th17 and IL-10 immune responses whereas c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) contribute to Th1 and IL-10 responses, respectively. Sublingual immunization of BALB/c mice with MV140 also induces potent systemic Th1/Th17 and IL-10 responses in vivo. We uncover immunological mechanisms underlying the way of action of MV140, which might well also contribute to understand the rational use of specific PBPs in other clinical conditions with potential high risk of recurrent infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26432894>Intestinal Epithelial Cell  Kinase 2 Transduces IL-22 Signals To Protect from Acute Colitis.</a></h1><p>In the intestinal tract, IL-22 activates STAT3 to promote intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) homeostasis and tissue healing. The mechanism has remained obscure, but we demonstrate that IL-22 acts via  kinase 2 (Tyk2), a member of the Jak family. Using a mouse model for colitis, we show that Tyk2 deficiency is associated with an altered composition of the gut  and exacerbates inflammatory bowel disease. Colitic Tyk2(-/-) mice have less p-STAT3 in colon tissue and their IECs proliferate less efficiently. Tyk2-deficient primary IECs show reduced p-STAT3 in response to IL-22 stimulation, and expression of IL-22-STAT3 target genes is reduced in IECs from healthy and colitic Tyk2(-/-) mice. Experiments with conditional Tyk2(-/-) mice reveal that IEC-specific depletion of Tyk2 aggravates colitis. Disease symptoms can be alleviated by administering high doses of rIL-22-Fc, indicating that Tyk2 deficiency can be rescued via the IL-22 receptor complex. The pivotal function of Tyk2 in IL-22-dependent colitis was confirmed in Citrobacter rodentium-induced disease. Thus, Tyk2 protects against acute colitis in part by amplifying inflammation-induced epithelial IL-22 signaling to STAT3.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25680927>Perturbations of  metabolism promote the indolepyruvate pathway via tryptophan in host and microbiome.</a></h1><p>The drug nitisinone (NTBC) is used to treat tyrosinemia type I, and more recently has been also used for the treatment of another disorder of  metabolism, alkaptonuria. While studying the dose effects of NTBC treatment on alkaptonuria, untargeted metabolomics revealed perturbations in a completely separate pathway, that of tryptophan metabolism. Significant elevations in several indolic compounds associated with the indolepyruvate pathway of tryptophan metabolism were present in NTBC-treated patient sera and correlated with elevations of an intermediate of  metabolism. Indolic compounds of this pathway have long been associated with commensal bacterial and plant metabolism. These exogenous sources of indoles have been more recently implicated in affecting mammalian cell function and disease. We studied the correlation of these indolic compounds in other disorders of  metabolism including tyrosinemia types I and II as well as transient tyrosinemia, and demonstrated that 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4-HPP) was directly responsible for the promotion of this pathway. We then investigated the regulation of the indolepyruvate pathway and the role of 4-HPP further in both mammalian cells and intestinal microbial cultures. We demonstrated that several of the indolic products, including indolepyruvate and indolelactate, were in fact generated by human cell metabolism, while the downstream indole metabolite, indolecarboxaldehyde, was produced exclusively by microbial cultures of human gut flora. This study describes a symbiotic perturbation in host and microbiome tryptophan metabolism in response to elevations related to defects of  metabolism and concomitant drug treatment.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The results of the present study show that outer membrane vesicle (OMV) formation in this anaerobe is also controlled by DNA inversions at two distantly localized promoters, IVp-I and IVp-II that are associated with extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis and the expression of outer membrane proteins. These promoter inversions are mediated by a single  recombinase encoded by BF2766 (orthologous to tsr19 in strain NCTC9343) in B. fragilis YCH46, which is located near IVp-I. A series of BF2766 mutants were constructed in which the two promoters were locked in different configurations (IVp-I/IVp-II = ON/ON, OFF/OFF, ON/OFF or OFF/ON). ON/ON B. fragilis mutants exhibited hypervesiculating, whereas the other mutants formed only a trace amount of OMVs. The hypervesiculating ON/ON mutants showed higher resistance to treatment with bile, LL-37, and human β-defensin 2. Incubation of wild-type cells with 5% bile increased the population of cells with the ON/ON genotype. These results indicate that B. fragilis regulates the formation of OMVs through DNA inversions at two distantly related promoter regions in response to membrane stress, although the mechanism underlying the interplay between the two regions controlled by the invertible promoters remains unknown.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118762>LC3-Associated Phagocytosis Is Required for Dendritic Cell Inflammatory Cytokine Response to Gut Commensal Yeast .</a></h1><p>The human fungal  known as mycobiota is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in human gut health and disease. Non-pathogenic commensal yeasts such as  promote homeostasis in the gut, whereas dysbiosis of the gut mycobiota is associated with inflammation. Glycan-binding receptors (lectins) are key host factors in host-mycobiota interaction in the gut. They are expressed on immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and recognize fungal polysaccharides. This interaction is imperative to mount appropriate immune responses for immune homeostasis in the gut as well as clearance of fungal pathogens. Recent studies demonstrate that microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) is involved in lectin-fungi interactions. Yet, the biological impact of LAP on the lectin function remains largely elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that in mouse LAP is linked to dendritic cell-associated lectin 2 (Dectin-2), a C-type lectin specific to fungal α-mannan polysaccharide. We found that mouse Dectin-2 recognizes commensal yeast  and . Mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) produced inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β in response to the yeasts in a Dectin-2 and spleen  kinase (Syk)-dependent manner. We found that  and  induced LAP in mouse BMDCs upon internalization. Furthermore, LC3 was activated by stimulation of BMDCs with the yeasts in a Dectin-2 and Syk-dependent manner. To address the biological impact of LAP on Dectin-2 yeast interaction, we established a knock-in mouse strain (Atg16L1, thereafter called E230), which BMDCs exhibit autophagy-active and LAP-negative phenotypes. When stimulated with yeasts, E230 BMDCs produced significantly less amounts of TNFα and IL-1β.

Metabolomic signatures represent the pathophysiological phenotype of diseases. Recent studies in gut  and metabolomics analysis revealed the dramatic role of microbiome in psychoneurological system diseases, but still, the mechanisms underlying gut microbiome-host interaction remain unclear.Male Wistar rats were s.c. injection of ACTH fragment 1-24 for 14 days to induce treatment-resistant depression. Depression-related behavioral tests, analysis of serum monoamine neurotransmitters and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones were determined for assessment of ACTH-induced depression rat model. A gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometer based urinary metabolomic signatures integrated 16S rRNA sequence analysis based gut microbial profiling was performed, as well as Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis was used to manifest the covariation between the differential urinary metabolites and gut  of genus level.Chronic injection of ACTH-induced depression-like phenotype (increased immobility time in forced swimming test and tail suspension test) was accompanied by peripheral serotonin down-regulation and HPA axis overactivation (ACTH and corticosterone up-regulation). Urinary metabolomics analysis indicated that pyruvic acid, L-threonine, mannitol, D-gluconic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, D-arabitol, myo-inositol and ascorbic acid levels were reduced in ACTH-treated rats' urine, while hippurate level was elevated. In addition, microbial community profiling revealed bacterial enrichment (e.g. Ruminococcus, Klebsiella) and reduction (e.g. Akkermansia, Lactobacillus) in the ACTH-induced depression rat model. Correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were closely relevant to metabolites myo-inositol and hippurate, which were included in host inositol phosphate metabolism, and phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis.Depression rat model induced by ACTH is associated with disturbance of pyruvate metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, as well as changes in microbial community structure. Gut  may participate in the mediation of systemic metabolomic changes in ACTH-induced depression model. Therefore, integrated metabolomic signatures and gut microbial community profiling would provide a basis for further studies on the pathogenesis of depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27466726>Update on enthesitis-related arthritis.</a></h1><p>This review provides a detailed update regarding the genetics, pathogenesis, disease phenotype evaluation, therapies and expected outcomes for children with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA).Recent studies evaluated human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 subtypes and non-major histocompatibility complex genes including toll like receptor 4, NLRP3, CXCR4 and PTPN12 in children with ERA.

Finally, long-term effectiveness studies of biologics in children with ERA have helped inform provider and patient expectations of disease response and prognosis.Further evaluation of the role of the microbiome and the interleukin 17/interleukin 23 axis, techniques to optimize evaluation of disease features, and efficacy and effectiveness of newer medications are greatly needed in this understudied population of children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501515>Loss of PTPN22 abrogates the beneficial effect of cohousing-mediated fecal  transfer in murine colitis.</a></h1><p>Fecal  transfer (FMT) is a very efficient approach for the treatment of severe and recurring C. difficile infections. However, the beneficial effect of FMT in other disorders such as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease remains unclear. Furthermore, it is currently unknown how disease-associated genetic variants in donors or recipients influence the effect of FMT. We found that bacteria-transfer from wild-type (WT) donors via cohousing was efficient in inducing recovery from colitis in WT mice, but not in mice deficient in protein- phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), a known risk gene for several chronic inflammatory diseases. Also cohousing of PTPN22-deficient mice with diseased WT mice failed to induce faster recovery. Our data indicate that the genetic background of the donor and the recipient influences the outcome of  transfer, and offers a potential explanation why transfer of fecal microbes from some, but not all donors is efficient in UC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29954466>Antibiotic-induced alterations of the gut  and microbial fermentation in protein parallel the changes in host nitrogen metabolism of growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Gut microbes, especially those in the large intestine, are actively involved in nutrient metabolism; however, their impact on host nitrogen (N) metabolism remains largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate the effects of feeding a cocktail of antibiotics (AGM) (ampicillin, gentamycin and metronidazole) on intestinal , N utilization efficiency, and amino acid (AA) digestibility in cannulated pigs, with the aim of exploring the impact of gut  on host N metabolism. In total, 16 piglets were surgically fitted with a simple distal ileal T-cannula and a jugular venous catheter. The pigs were fed a basal diet without antibiotics (control; CON) or with antibiotics (antibiotic; ANTI), for 2 weeks. The results showed that feeding AGM did not affect weight gain or digestive enzyme activity. The antibiotics increased the concentration of urea N (P&lt;0.05). However, they reduced N utilization, and the total tract apparent digestibility of isoleucine, methionine, valine,  and total AA (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the antibiotics increased the terminal ileum apparent digestibility of CP, phenylalanine, valine, alanine,  and total AA (P&lt;0.05). AGM markedly altered the composition of the  in the ileum and feces, with a reduction in populations of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Ruminococcus, and an increase in the abundance of Escherichia coli (P&lt;0.05). The antibiotics also significantly increased the concentration of cadaverine and ammonia, both in ileal digesta and feces (P&lt;0.05), suggesting a marked impact on N metabolism in the intestine. The analyses indicated that the alteration of gut  was correlated with the apparent digestibility of CP and AA in the intestine. These findings suggest that the AGM-induced alteration of gut  may contribute to the change in intestinal N metabolism, and consequently, N excretion from the body. These results also suggest that antibiotics could have a significant effect on host N metabolism. The present study contributes to our understanding of the effects of antibiotics and provides a rational scientific basis for diet formulation during AGM use.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21967856>Specific prebiotics in a formula for infants with Phenylketonuria.</a></h1><p>This exploratory study investigated the influence of adding a patented, specific mixture of prebiotic oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS [9:1 ratio], Danone Research) to a protein substitute suitable for infants with Phenylketonuria (PKU); PKU Anamix Infant (Nutricia).This was an 8-week open-label, single-arm, pilot intervention study in 9 infants (8-week median age) diagnosed with PKU. On study entry, infants were prescribed PKU Anamix Infant to replace an infant phenylalanine-free protein substitute without prebiotics (IPS). Blood phenylalanine concentrations were monitored and stool samples analyzed for pH/bacterial groups.PKU Anamix infant was well tolerated and accepted with no adverse events reported. Overall, plasma phenylalanine and  concentrations were maintained within target ranges throughout the study (120-360 μmol/l phenylalanine, 30-100 μmol/). All infants exhibited  dominated by bifidobacteria (median 58.97% at Week 8), although no statistically significant change from baseline was observed at study endpoint. No infants showed abnormally high levels of Clostridium histolyticum/lituseburense or potentially pathogenic enterobacteriaceae at any point during the study. A significant reduction in median stool pH versus baseline was observed at Week 4 (pH reduced from 6.79 to 5.83), but this significance was not present at Week 8 (pH = 6.61).PKU Anamix Infant maintains phenylalanine control in line with established IPS without prebiotics and maintains levels of bifidobacteria and lowers stool pH. In exclusively breast-fed infants the latter two factors have been associated with a reduced risk of infection and may be of particular importance in infants with PKU.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the current study was to elucidate how host genetics influence gut  and the relationship between  and organ inflammation in spondyloarthritides.BALB/c ZAP-70(W163C) -mutant (SKG) mice, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-deficient SKG mice, and wild-type BALB/c mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. SKG and wild-type BALB/c mice were maintained under germ-free conditions, and some of these mice were recolonized with altered Schaedler flora. All of the mice were injected intraperitoneally with microbial β-1,3-glucan (curdlan). Arthritis, spondylitis, and ileitis were assessed histologically. Microbiome composition was analyzed in serial fecal samples obtained from mice that were co-housed beginning at the time of weaning, using 454 pyrosequencing. Infiltrating cells and cytokines in the peritoneal cavity were measured by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker, and tight junction protein transcription was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. content and response to curdlan varied according to whether T cell receptor signal strength was normal or was impaired due to the ZAP-70(W163C) mutation. Curdlan triggered acute inflammation regardless of the presence of the SKG allele or . However, no or limited  content attenuated the severity of arthritis. In contrast, ileal IL-23 expression, ER stress, lymph node IL-17A production, goblet cell loss, and ileitis development were -dependent. Ileitis but not arthritis was suppressed by  transfer upon co-housing SKG mice with wild-type BALB/c mice, as well as by TLR-4 deficiency.The interaction between immunogenetic background and host  leads to an IL-23-dependent loss of mucosal function, triggering ileitis in response to curdlan.Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Rheumatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359553>Modelling the role of microbial p-cresol in colorectal genotoxicity.</a></h1><p>: A greater understanding of mechanisms explaining the interactions between diet and the gut  in colorectal cancer is desirable. Genotoxic microbial metabolites present in the colon may be implicated in carcinogenesis and potentially influenced by diet. : We hypothesised that microbial p-cresol is a colonic genotoxin and set out to model potential exposures in the colon and the effects of these exposures on colonic cells. : Batch culture fermentations with human faecal inoculate were used to determine the synthesis of p-cresol and other metabolites in response to various substrates. The fermentation supernatants were evaluated for genotoxicity and the independent effects of p-cresol on colonic cells were studied . : In batch culture fermentation, supplementary protein increased the synthesis of phenols, indoles and p-cresol, whereas supplementary fructoligosaccharide (FOS) increased the synthesis of short chain fatty acids. The p-cresol was the greatest predictor of genotoxicity against colonocytes in the fermentation supernatants. Spiking fermentation supernatants with exogenous p-cresol further increased DNA damage, and independently p-cresol induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner against HT29 and Caco-2 cells and influenced cell cycle kinetics. : In the colon p-cresol may reach physiologically significant concentrations which contribute to genotoxic exposures in the intestinal lumen, p-cresol production may be attenuated by substrate, and therefore diet, making it a potential modifiable biomarker of genotoxicity in the colon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411471>Alterations of the Brain Proteome and Gut  in d-Galactose-Induced Brain-Aging Mice with Krill Oil Supplementation.</a></h1><p>Brain aging is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, but the ameliorative effect of krill oil and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, the components of krill oil were measured, and the antiaging effects of krill oil were investigated in mice with d-galactose (d-gal)-induced brain aging via proteomics and gut  analysis. Krill oil treatment decreased the expression of truncated dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoproteins and proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway. In addition, the concentrations of dopamine were increased in the serum ( < 0.05) and brain ( > 0.05) due to the enhanced expressions of -3-monooxygenase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase. Moreover, krill oil alleviated gut  dysbiosis, decreased the abundance of bacteria that consume the precursor , and increased the abundance of  spp. and short-chain fatty acid producers. This study revealed the beneficial effect of krill oil against d-gal-induced brain aging and clarified the underlying mechanism through proteomics and gut  analysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26712080>New findings on the in vivo antioxidant activity of Curcuma longa extract by an integrated (1)H NMR and HPLC-MS metabolomic approach.</a></h1><p>Curcuminoids possess powerful antioxidant activity as demonstrated in many chemical in vitro tests and in several in vivo trials. Nevertheless, the mechanism of this activity is not completely elucidated and studies on the in vivo antioxidant effects are still needed. Metabolomics may be used as an attractive approach for such studies and in this paper, we describe the effects of oral administration of a Curcuma longa L. extract (150 mg/kg of total curcuminoids) to 12 healthy rats with particular attention to urinary markers of oxidative stress. The experiment was carried out over 33 days and changes in the 24-h urine samples metabolome were evaluated by (1)H NMR and HPLC-MS. Both techniques produced similar representations for the collected samples confirming our previous study. Modifications of the urinary metabolome lead to the observation of different variables proving the complementarity of (1)H NMR and HPLC-MS for metabolomic purposes. The urinary levels of allantoin, m-, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and nitrotyrosine were decreased in the treated group thus supporting an in vivo antioxidant effect of the oral administration of Curcuma extract to healthy rats. On the other hand, urinary TMAO levels were higher in the treated compared to the control group suggesting a role of curcumin supplementation on  or on TMAO urinary excretion. Furthermore, the urinary levels of the sulphur containing compounds taurine and cystine were also changed suggesting a role for such constituents in the biochemical pathways involved in Curcuma extract bioactivity and indicating the need for further investigation on the complex role of antioxidant curcumin effects.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

CLRs play important roles in host defense against infection by fungi and bacteria by recognizing specific carbohydrate components of these pathogens. However, these immune receptors also make important contributions to immune homeostasis of mucosa and skin in mammals by recognizing components of , as well as by recognizing self-components such as alarmins from dead cells and noncanonical non-carbohydrate ligands. CLR deficiency not only induces hypersensitivity to infection, but also causes dysregulation of muco-cutaneous immune homeostasis, resulting in the development of allergy, inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumors. In this review, we introduce recent discoveries regarding the roles of myeloid CLRs in the immune system exposed to the environment, and discuss the roles of these lectin receptors in the development of colitis, asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and cancer. Although some CLRs are suggested to be involved in the development of these diseases, the function of CLRs and their ligands still largely remain to be elucidated.©2019 The Authors.

In Drosophila, the ERK signaling pathway inhibits enteric virus infection. The intestinal microflora also impacts immunity but its role in enteric viral infection is unknown. Here we show that two signals are required to activate antiviral ERK signaling in the intestinal epithelium. One signal depends on recognition of peptidoglycan from the , particularly from the commensal Acetobacter pomorum, which primes the NF-kB-dependent induction of a secreted factor, Pvf2. However, the  is not sufficient to induce this pathway; a second virus-initiated signaling event involving release of transcriptional paused genes mediated by the kinase Cdk9 is also required for Pvf2 production. Pvf2 stimulates antiviral immunity by binding to the receptor  kinase PVR, which is necessary and sufficient for intestinal ERK responses. These findings demonstrate that sensing of specific commensals primes inflammatory signaling required for epithelial responses that restrict enteric viral infections.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Gut microbial communities are important for diverse host functions. However, in birds, the relationship between the composition of the intestinal  and the genetic variation of the host is not clearly understood. To dissect these interactions, a Chinese yellow broiler line (genetically selected for a high growth rate) and Huiyang Beard chickens (low growth rate) were crossed, generating an F2 population. The population structures of the gut microbes in the phenotypically high and low 91-d body weight individuals of both sexes in the F2 population were studied. Interestingly, a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that the  of the high-weight and low-weight females was clearly separated into 2 clusters. A β-diversity analysis showed that the locus rs16775833 within the doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor (DMRT) gene cluster accounted for approximately 21% of the variation in the population structure of the gut . Furthermore, the 2 genetic loci rs15142709 and rs15142674 were significantly associated with specific species of Methanobacterium. These loci are located in the pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) and lck/yes-related novel  kinase (LYN) genes, which are involved in cell differentiation and growth. This finding suggests evidence for the influence of the host genetics on the composition of the gut  in birds and the importance and utility of the host-microbe status to better understand its effect on the potential growth of birds.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p></html>
