We used a metabolomic approach to identify urine  markers before cardiac surgery, aiming to define the physiology of patients with complex CHD and to contribute to predict their neurodevelopmental outcome.In a prospective, observational, single-center study we enrolled 28 patients with complex biventricular and univentricular CHD aged less than 5 years, on stable hemodynamic conditions, and with no genetic anomalies. We analyzed urine samples, collected at the induction of anesthesia, by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Profiles of 1H NMR spectra were submitted to unsupervised (principal component) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant) multivariate analysis. Neurodevelopment was assessed by neuropsychological and adaptive functioning testing.Principal components analysis divided CHD patients  profiles in two distinct clusters (RED and BLACK).  profiles belonging to the RED cluster showed higher levels of accumulation of citric acid cycle intermediates and glucose compared to the profiles in the BLACK cluster, indicating a possible switching to anaerobic . Patients belonging to the RED cluster were significantly more prone to show an adverse neurodevelopment pattern (p = 0.01).The application of metabolomic analysis to CHD children permitted a deeper insight on their  status that could help to obtain a better understanding of the physiological implications and to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.© 2019 The Authors.

The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is important for the maintenance of ATP production and other functions of mitochondria. The electron transport chain (ETC) generates an electrochemical gradient of protons known as the proton-motive force across the IMM and thus produces the mitochondrial membrane potential that is critical to ATP synthesis. One of the main factors regulating the structural and functional integrity of the IMM is the changes in the matrix volume. Mild (reversible) swelling regulates mitochondrial  and function; however, excessive (irreversible) swelling causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The central mechanism of mitochondrial swelling includes the opening of non-selective channels known as permeability transition pores (PTPs) in the IMM by high mitochondrial Ca and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mechanisms of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling and transition between these two states are still unknown. The present study elucidates an upgraded biophysical model of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics. The model provides a description of the PTP regulation dynamics using an additional differential equation. The rigidity tensor was used in numerical simulations of the mitochondrial parameter dynamics with different initial conditions defined by Ca concentration in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum. We were able to estimate the values of the IMM rigidity tensor components by fitting the model to the previously reported experimental data. Overall, the model provides a better description of the reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

Additionally, local  by enzymes preferentially or exclusively occurring in the lung is important for favorable or toxic effects of xenobiotics entering the organism also by routes other than by inhalation. The data collected in this review show that generally activities of cytochromes P450 are low in the lung of all investigated species and in vitro models. Other oxidoreductases may turn out to be more important, but are largely not investigated. Phase II enzymes are generally much higher with the exception of UGT glucuronosyltransferases which are generally very low. Insofar as data are available the xenobiotic  in the lung of monkeys comes closed to that in the human lung; however, very few data are available for this comparison. Second best rate the mouse and rat lung, followed by the rabbit. Of the human in vitro model primary cells in culture, such as alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells as well as the A549 cell line appear quite acceptable. However, (1) this generalization represents a temporary oversimplification born from the lack of more comparable data; () the relative suitability of individual species/models is different for different enzymes; (3) when more data become available, the conclusions derived from these comparisons quite possibly may change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667988>The  fate of the two new psychoactive substances -aminoindane and N-methyl--aminoindane studied in vitro and in vivo to support drug testing.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo  of -aminoindane (,3-dihydro-1H-inden--amine, -AI), and N-methyl--aminoindane (N-methyl-,3-dihydro-1H-inden--amine, NM--AI) after incubations using pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM), pooled human liver S9 fraction (pS9), as well as rat urine after oral administration. After analysis using liquid-chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, pHLM incubations revealed that -AI was left unmetabolized, while NM--AI formed a hydroxylamine and diastereomers of a metabolite formed after hydroxylation in beta position. Incubations using pS9 led to the formation of an acetyl conjugation in case of -AI and merely a hydroxylamine for NM--AI. Investigations on rat urine showed that -AI was hydroxylated also forming diasteromers as described for NM--AI or acetylated similar to incubations using pS9. All hydroxylated metabolites of NM--AI except the hydroxylamine were found in rat urine as additional sulfates. Assuming similar patterns in humans, urine screening procedures might be focused on the parent compounds but should also include their metabolites. At last, an activity screening using human recombinant N-acetyl transferase (NAT) isoforms 1 and  revealed that -AI was acetylated exclusively by NAT2 which is polymorphically expressed.This article is protected by copyright.

Although anti-cancer drug oxaliplatin (Oxa) effectively inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, the growing resistance and side-effects make it urgent to improve the therapeutic strategy of Oxa. Although Oxa induces the autophagy process, the role of PFKFB3 in this process remains unknown. In addition, whether PFKFB3 affects the cytotoxicity of Oxa has not been investigated. Here, we show that Oxa-inhibited cell proliferation and migration concomitant with the induction of apoptosis and autophagy in SW480 cells. Both inhibition of autophagy by small molecule inhibitors and siRNA modification decreased the cell viability loss and apoptosis induced by Oxa. Utilizing quantitative PCR and immunoblotting, we observed that Oxa increased PFKFB3 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, suppression of PFKFB3 attenuated both the basal and Oxa-induced autophagy, by monitoring the autophagic flux and phosphorylated-Ulk1, which play essential roles in autophagy initiation. Moreover, PFKFB3 inhibition further inhibited the cell proliferation/migration, and cell viability decreased by Oxa. Collectively, the presented data demonstrated that PFKFB3 inhibition attenuated Oxa-induced autophagy and enhanced its cytotoxicity in colorectal cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666664>LC-MS based metabolomic profiling for renal cell carcinoma histologic subtypes.</a></h2><p>Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are classified according to their histological features. Accurate classification of RCC and comprehensive understanding of their  dysregulation are of critical importance. Here we investigate the use of metabolomic analyses to classify the main RCC subtypes and to describe the  variation for each subtype. To this end, we performed metabolomic profiling of 65 RCC frozen samples (40 clear cell, 14 papillary and 11 chromophobe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. OPLS-DA multivariate analysis based on metabolomic data showed clear discrimination of all three main subtypes of RCC (R = 75.0%, Q = 59.7%). The prognostic performance was evaluated using an independent cohort and showed an AUROC of 0.924, 0.991 and 1 for clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC, respectively. Further pathway analysis using the 21 top metabolites showed significant differences in amino acid and fatty acid  between three RCC subtypes. In conclusion, this study shows that metabolomic profiling could serve as a tool that is complementary to histology for RCC subtype classification. An overview of  dysregulation in RCC subtypes was established giving new insights into the understanding of their clinical behaviour and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668649>Effect of Oat β-Glucan Supplementation on Chronic Kidney Disease: A Feasibility Study.</a></h2><p>Dietary supplementation with grains containing high β-glucan fiber has been shown to attenuate the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and vascular calcification in animal models. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of consuming an oat β-glucan supplement and to assess its effects on certain uremic toxins and markers of mineral  in patients with CKD.This is a 20-week, nonrandomized, single-center, pretest-posttest study. Twenty-eight subjects with CKD stages 3-4 were enrolled. The mean age was 67.6 ± 8.9 years, and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 35 ± 14 mL/min/1.73 m. Subjects received a dietary supplement containing 3 g of oat β-glucan per day for 12 weeks. The 4-week period before the start of the intervention was used as a baseline comparison for each subject. The primary outcome was pre-post supplement changes in plasma levels of two uremic toxins: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and asymmetric dimethylarginine. Secondary outcomes were pre-post supplement changes in serum calcium, phosphorus, and Klotho levels. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test the differences in outcomes over the three-month-long intervention.Serum levels of TMAO decreased by a median of -17% (interquartile range: -46%, 7%) at the end of the intervention. A nonstatistically significant change was observed for asymmetric dimethylarginine (median -0.6% [-12%, 20%]) and serum Klotho (median -3% [-8%, 7%]). There were no changes in serum levels of calcium and phosphorus. One month after discontinuation of β-glucan therapy, TMAO levels increased by a median of 16% (-12%, 36%) but remained slightly below the pretreatment levels. Eight subjects experienced side effects and discontinued the treatment.A diet supplemented with β-glucan is safe and potentially efficacious in lowering serum concentrations of TMAO in patients with CKD. Larger trials with longer follow-up times are needed to determine whether such reductions translate into clinical benefits.Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Cognitive function is related to dysregulated glucose , which is the typical cause of type  diabetes; however, hippocampal glycogen and its metabolite lactate are also crucial for hippocampus-dependent memory function. Type  diabetes induced hippocampus-dependent learning and memory dysfunction can be improved by chronic exercise and this improvement may possibly mediate through an adaptation of the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). This chapter focuses on the dysregulation of hippocampal glycometabolism in type  diabetes examining both existing evidence as well as the potential underlying pathophysiological mechanism responsible for memory dysfunction in type  diabetes, and showing for the first time that chronic exercise could be an effective therapy for type--diabetes-induced hippocampal memory decline.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676728>Does -FDG-PET Accurately Reflect Quantitative In vivo Glucose Utilization?</a></h2><p>-Deoxy--[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (-FDG) with positron emission tomography (-FDG-PET) is undeniably useful in the clinic, among other uses, to monitor change over time using the -FDG standardized uptake values (SUV) metric. This report suggests some potentially serious caveats for this and related roles for -FDG PET. Most critical is the assumption that there is an exact proportionality between glucose  and -FDG , called the lumped constant, LC. This report describes that LC is not constant for a specific tissue and may be variable before and after disease treatment. The purpose of this work is not to deny the clinical value of -FDG PET; it is a reminder that when one extends the use of an appropriately qualified imaging method, new observations may arise and further validation would be necessary. Current understanding of glucose-based energetics in vivo is based on the quantification of glucose  rates with -FDG PET, a method that permits the non-invasive assessment in various human disorders. However, -FDG is only a good substrate for facilitated-glucose transporters (GLUTs) but not for sodium-dependent glucose co-transporters (SGLTs), which have recently been shown to be distributed in multiple human tissues. Thus, the GLUT-mediated in vivo glucose utilization measured by -FDG PET would be blinded to the potentially substantial role of functional SGLTs in glucose transport and utilization. Therefore, in these circumstances the -FDG LC used to quantify in vivo glucose utilization should not be expected to remain constant. -FDG LC variations have been especially significant in tumors, particularly at different stages of cancer development, affecting the accuracy of quantitative glucose measures and potentially limiting the prognostic value of -FDG, as well as its accuracy in monitoring treatments. SGLT-mediated glucose transport can be estimated using α-methyl-4-deoxy-4-[18F]fluoro-D-glucopyranoside (Me-4FDG). Utilizing both -FDG and Me-4FDG should provide a more complete picture of glucose utilization via both GLUT and SGLT transporters in health and disease stages. Given the widespread use of -FDG PET to infer glucose , appreciating the potential limitations of -FDG as a surrogate for glucose  rate and the potential reasons for variability in LC is relevant. Even when the readout for the -FDG PET study is only an SUV parameter, variability in LC is important, particularly if it changes over the course of disease progression (e.g., an evolving tumor).Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672758>Relationship of obstructive sleep apnoea severity and subclinical systemic atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing. Untreated OSA might accelerate atherosclerosis, potentially increasing the cardiovascular disease burden in patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between objectively measured OSA severity and the presence of subclinical systemic atherosclerosis using non-invasive measurements, including tomographic quantification of the calcium burden.A total of 2157 participants of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, who were free of structural heart disease and underwent both in-home polysomnography and chest computed tomography, were cross-sectionally analysed. Participants were divided into three groups based on the severity of OSA: no OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index [AHI]<5, n=1096), mild OSA (5≤AHI<15, n=700), and moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI≥15, n=361). Calcium deposits in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries were measured by the Agatston score.Participants with moderate-to-severe OSA were 1.6 times (95% CI=1.18-.15, p=0.002) more likely to have ascending thoracic aorta calcification (aTAC≥100 units) than those without OSA, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between moderate-to-severe OSA and aTAC of subjects with higher epicardial fat volume (EFV) was slightly stronger than that in patients without OSA and lower EFV tertile (OR=.11; 95% CI=1.30-3.43).Severity of OSA in the general population was independently associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of severe OSA, especially in subjects with higher epicardial fat, as a possible predictive factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678277>TLR4 signaling modulation of PGC1-α mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in the LPS-Chronic mild stress model: Effect of fluoxetine and pentoxiyfylline.</a></h2><p>The addition of repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to chronic mild stress was recently proposed in our lab as an alternative model of depression, highlighting the possible interaction between stress and immune-inflammatory  in predisposing depression. Given that CMS-induced depressive behavior was previously related to impaired hippocampal energy  and mitochondrial dysfunction, our current study aimed to investigate the interplay between toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivators-1-alpha (PGC1-α) as a physiological regulator of energy  and mitochondrial biogenesis in the combined LPS/CMS model.Male Wistar rats were exposed to either LPS (50 μg/kg i.p.) over  weeks, CMS protocol for 4 weeks or LPS over  weeks followed by 4 weeks of CMS (LPS/CMS). Three additional groups of rats were exposed to LPS/CMS protocol and treated with either pentoxifylline (PTX), fluoxetine (FLX) or a combination of both. Rats were examined for behavioral, neurochemical, gene expression and mitochondrial ultra-structural changes.LPS/CMS increased the expression of TLR4 and its downstream players; MyD88, NFκB and TNF-α along with an escalation in hippocampal-energy  and p-AMPK. Simultaneously LPS/CMS attenuated the expression of PGC1-α/NRF1/Tfam and mt-DNA. The antidepressant (AD) 'FLX', the TNF-α inhibitor 'PTX' and their combination ameliorated the LPS/CMS-induced changes. Interestingly, all the aforementioned changes induced by the LPS/CMS combined model were significantly less than those induced by CMS alone.Blocking the TLR4/NFκB signaling enhanced the activation of the PGC1-α/NRF1/Tfam and mt-DNA content independent on the activation of the energy-sensing kinase AMPK.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on  rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting  rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every  weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by .3 kg. The  rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases  rate by PPAR and PPAR activation.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ±  vs. 33 ±  mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0. mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0. [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased lipid availability, which primarily results from maintained insulin-stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665018>A  reconstruction of Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112 and analysis of its potential as a cell factory.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative Lactic Acid Bacterium (LAB) that is commonly used for food fermentations and probiotic purposes.

It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale  models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational  engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate  model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the  were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic , the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas , varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these  result in different energy yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these  in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central  demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects.

BTH at 100 mg·L regulated changes in ROS generation and scavenging in healing tissues of potato tubers. A higher HO content was presented in healing tissues of potato tubers, while cell membrane permeability and malondialdehyde content declined due to BTH treatment. Additionally, the activities and transcript level of enzymes related with ROS generation, including NADPH oxidase, peroxidase and polyamine oxidase, as well as enzymes involved in ROS scavenging, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, were significantly enhanced by BTH treatment. It is suggested that ROS  might play a crucial role in wound healing of potato tubers mediated by BTH during postharvest.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that compounds that interact with both the autophagosome protein microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) and the disease-causing protein may target the latter for autophagic clearance. Mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) contains an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract and causes Huntington's disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disorder. Here, using small-molecule-microarray-based screening, we identified four compounds that interact with both LC3 and mHTT, but not with the wild-type HTT protein. Some of these compounds targeted mHTT to autophagosomes, reduced mHTT levels in an allele-selective manner, and rescued disease-relevant phenotypes in cells and in vivo in fly and mouse models of Huntington's disease. We further show that these compounds interact with the expanded polyQ stretch and could lower the level of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3), another disease-causing protein with an expanded polyQ tract. This study presents candidate compounds for lowering mHTT and potentially other disease-causing proteins with polyQ expansions, demonstrating the concept of lowering levels of disease-causing proteins using autophagosome-tethering compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665391>A Combination of Metabolites Predicts Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Pattern and Its Associations with Insulin Sensitivity and Lipid Homeostasis in the General Population: The Fenland Study, United Kingdom.</a></h2><p>Cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been recognized, but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.We aimed to investigate how the Mediterranean diet could influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations of the diet with cardiometabolic risk factors.Among 10,806 participants (58.9% women, mean age = 48.4 y) in the Fenland Study (2004-2015) in the United Kingdom, we assessed dietary consumption with FFQs and conducted a targeted metabolomics assay for 175 plasma metabolites (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids). We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other  factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve  of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679790></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>Understanding the  response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years, body mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole-body stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine  changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4  following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue  and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate ). More  were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino acid, tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean body mass.These preliminary data show different  changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, weight-bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean body mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679424></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669409>Using a multimodal near-infrared spectroscopy and MRI to quantify gray matter  rate for oxygen: A hypothermia validation study.</a></h2><p>Non-invasive quantitative imaging of cerebral oxygen  (CMRO) in small animal models is crucial to understand the role of oxidative  in healthy and diseased brains. In this study, we developed a multimodal method combining near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and MRI to non-invasively study oxygen delivery and consumption in the cortex of mouse and rat models. The term CASNIRS is proposed to the technique that measures CMRO with ASL and NIRS. To determine the reliability of this method, CMRO values were compared with reported values measured with other techniques. Also, the sensitivity of the CASNIRS technique to detect changes in CMRO in the cortex of the animals was assessed by applying a reduction in core temperature, which is known to reduce CMRO. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO were measured in five mice and five rats at a core temperature of 37 °C followed by another measurement at 33 °C. CMRO was 7.8 ± 1.8 and 3.7 ± 0.9 (ml/100 g/min, mean ± SD) in mice and rats respectively. These values are in good agreement with reported values measured by O PET, O NMR, and BOLD fMRI. In hypothermia, we detected a significant decrease of 37% and 32% in CMRO in the cortex of mice and rats, respectively. Q10 was calculated to be 3. in mice and .7 in rats. In this study we showed that it is possible to assess absolute values of  correlates such as CMRO, CBF and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) noninvasively in living brain of mice and rats by combining NIRS with MRI. This will open new possibilities for studying brain  in patients as well as the many mouse/rat models of brain disorders.Copyright © 2019.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Wingless type 5a (Wnt5a) is implicated in cardiovascular diseases through non-canonical Wnt cascades. However, its precise role during the pathogenesis of AS is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor  (Ror2)  in the promotion of AS process through affecting lipid accumulation and inflammation. In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of inflammation. Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the oxygen-glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from 5.0 to .8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic glycolysis, not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic  of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669948>CO treatment improves the hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant properties of fenugreek seeds.</a></h2><p>A high level of serum cholesterol is a major cause of atherosclerosis. Fenugreek is a well-known hypocholesterolaemic agent with amazing phytochemical composition. Due to its impact on plant , CO enrichment was tested as a strategy to support functional values in fenugreek seeds. Phytochemical composition and biological activities of three fenugreek cultivars (G2, G6 and G30) grown under ambient (aCO, 400 μmol mol) and elevated CO (eCO, 620 μmol mol) were assessed. Applying eCO improved physical parameters of fenugreek seeds, and enhanced their biological activities. A significant increase in hypocholesterolaemic potential, as indicated by inhibition of cholesterol micellar solubility and pancreatic lipase activity, was recorded. In addition, antioxidant, anti-lipid peroxidation and antibacterial activities were improved. These enhanced biological activities were accompanied by improved seed chemical composition at the primary and secondary  levels. Therefore, eCO treatment represents an efficient strategy to increase the hypocholesterolaemic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of fenugreek seeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism of protection is uncertain.The percentages of mediating effects of 19 biomarkers were determined by comparing the hazard ratios for the effect of randomized treatment from an unadjusted model and from a model adjusting for the biomarker of interest. Multivariable analyses were used to assess the joint effects of biomarkers that mediated most strongly in univariable analyses.Early changes after randomization in levels of 3 biomarkers (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, serum bicarbonate, and serum urate) were identified as mediating the effect of canagliflozin on heart failure. Average post-randomization levels of 14 biomarkers (systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, weight, body mass index, gamma glutamyltransferase, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, serum albumin, erythrocyte concentration, serum bicarbonate, and serum urate) were identified as significant mediators. Individually, the 3 biomarkers with the largest mediating effect were erythrocyte concentration (45%), hemoglobin concentration (43%), and serum urate (40%). In a parsimonious multivariable model, erythrocyte concentration, serum urate, and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio were the 3 biomarkers that maximized cumulative mediation (102%).A diverse set of potential mediators of the effect of canagliflozin on heart failure were identified. Some mediating effects were anticipated, whereas others were not. The mediators that were identified support existing and novel hypothesized mechanisms for the prevention of heart failure with sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here we demonstrate that DHA, but not arachidonic acid (ARA), suppressed oligomeric amyloid-β peptide (oAβ)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in primary mouse microglia and immortalized mouse microglia (BV2). Similarly, DHA but not ARA suppressed oAβ-induced increases in phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (p-cPLA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in BV2 cells. LC-MS/MS assay indicated the ability for DHA to cause an increase in 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and suppress oAβ-induced increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Although oAβ did not alter the nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2) pathway, exogenous DHA, ARA as well as low concentrations of 4-HHE and 4-HNE upregulated this pathway and increased production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in microglial cells. These results suggest that DHA modulates ARA  in oAβ-stimulated microglia through suppressing oxidative and inflammatory  and upregulating the antioxidative stress pathway involving Nrf2/HO-1. Understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial effects of DHA on microglia should shed light into nutraceutical therapy for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679024>Effects of vitamin B6 on growth, diarrhea rate, intestinal morphology, function, and inflammatory factors expression in a high-protein diet fed to weaned piglets.</a></h2><p>Vitamin B6 (VB6) is an important coenzyme factor which participates in many  reactions, especially amino acid . There are few reports on how VB6 mediates weaned piglet intestinal health. This study purposed to investigate dietary VB6 effects on growth, diarrhea rates, and intestinal morphology and function in weaned piglets fed a high-crude protein (22% CP) diet. Eighteen 21-day old weaned [(Yorkshire × Landrace) × Duroc] piglets with body weights of 7.03 ± 0.15 (means ± SEM) kg were randomly assigned into 3 VB6-containing dietary treatments. Vitamin B6 content was: 0 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 7 mg/kg respectively. The feeding period lasted 14 days. The results showed that no siginificant difference existed for the growth performance. The 7 mg/kg VB6 group had a tendency to decrease diarrhea rate (P = 0.065). Blood biochemical parameters analysis demonstrated that total protein, cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein significantly increased in the 7 mg/kg VB6 group (P < 0.05). In the jejunum, no significant differences were detected for villus height, villus width, crypt depth, villus height and crypt depth ratios, and positive Ki67 counts and the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin B6 significantly increased the mRNA expression of SLC6A19 and SLC6A20 (P < 0.05) and decreased mRNA expression of SLC36A1 (P < 0.05). In the ileum, VB6 significantly increased villus height and villus width (P < 0.05) while decreased positive Ki67 cell counts for 7 mg/kg VB6 group (P < 0.05). Vitamin B6 had significantly increased the mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α，COX- and TGF-β (P < 0.05). Vitamin B6 also had significantly increased mRNA expression of SLC6A19，SLC7A6, SLC7A7 and SLC36A1 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with VB6 may affect the intestinal morphology and absorption and  of protein in weaned piglets fed a high-protein diet by altering the expression of intestinal inflammatory cytokines and amino acid transporters.© The Author(s) 2019.

This retrospective study aimed to ascertain the prevalence and risk factors for hypertension from birth through childhood as of 2014. Stratified cluster sampling was used to select 17,007 participants (5971 with biochemical indexes available) aged 6-12 years on two avenues per region in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The prevalence of hypertension was 12.55%; children with obesity combined with rural residence, low family income, birth weight (<3000 g) (BWP) or >10 months of breastfeeding had a significantly elevated prevalence of hypertension (37.06%, 30.41%, 30.04%, and 30.84%, respectively). Obesity and heart rate were the significant anthropometric determinants; gestational hypertension, BWP25 and >10 months of breastfeeding were the significant perinatal determinants; rural residence was the significant socioeconomic determinant; fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were the significant serum biochemical determinants; and red blood cell counts and platelet counts were the significant haematological determinants of childhood hypertension. The adjusted R values were 14.45% and 24.88% in the full models excluding and including serum indexes, respectively. We observed a notable prevalence of hypertension in a large paediatric sample.

Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to  weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH. These methods can be employed to identify optimal reference genes in other systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677975>Transferrin isoelectric focusing for the investigation of congenital disorders of glycosylation: analysis of a ten-year experience in a Brazilian center.</a></h2><p>To characterize cases of suspected congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) investigated in a laboratory in southern Brazil using the transferrin isoelectric focusing TfIEF test from 2008 to 2017.Observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study.

We have recently shown 30-d exposure to increased inspired CO (InCO) leads to a steady-state ventilation that exceeds the level predicted by the sustained acidosis and the acute CO/H chemoreflex, suggesting plasticity within respiratory control centers. Based on data showing brainstem changes in aminergic and inflammatory signaling during carotid body denervation-induced hypercapnia, we hypothesized chronic hypercapnia  will lead to similar changes. We found that: ) increased InCO increased IL-1β in the medullary raphe (MR), ventral respiratory column, and cuneate nucleus after 24 h, but not after 30 d of hypercapnia; ) the number of serotonergic and total neurons were reduced within the MR and ventrolateral medulla following 30 d of increased InCO; ) markers of tryptophan  were altered following 24 h, but not 30 d of InCO; and ) there were few changes in brainstem amine levels following 24 h or 30 d of increased InCO.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of macronutrient supplements for infants born small on later development and .We searched OvidMedline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to April 1, 2019, and controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and anzctr.org.au. Randomised or quasirandomised trials were included if the intention was to increase macronutrient intake to improve growth or development of infants born small and assessed post-discharge outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were cognitive impairment and  risk, evaluated in toddlers (<3 years), childhood (3 to 8 years), and adolescence (9 to 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and data were pooled using random-effect models. Twenty-one randomised and one quasirandomised trial of variable methodological quality involving 3,680 infants were included. In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to .65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD 5.60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -.04; 95% CI -7.04 to .95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to .57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and fasting insulin concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some  outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665961>Diabetes Mellitus Severity and a Switch From Using Lipoprotein Lipase to Adipose-Derived Fatty Acid Results in a Cardiac  Signature That Embraces Cell Death.</a></h2><p>Background Fatty acid (FA) provision to the heart is from cardiomyocyte and adipose depots, plus lipoprotein lipase action. We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a - to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic acid or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant lipid accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of diabetes mellitus, when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac  signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669626>Changing trends in the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus from 1990 to 2018: A retrospective study in a Portuguese population.</a></h2><p>to estimate the prevalence of DR in a Portuguese population with type 1 diabetes.Retrospective review of all patients with type 1 DM, whose reference center was Centro Hospitalar de São João, a tertiary center in Portugal, who were diagnosed between 1990 and 2018.

Selenium is a nutritionally essential trace metalloid well documented to elicit compelling pharmacological activities in vitro and in vivo. Report on the influence of selenium on arsenic-mediated behavioral derangement is lacking in literature. Hence, to fill this knowledge gap, rats were either exposed to arsenic per se in drinking water at 60 µg AsONa/L or co-administered with inorganic selenium at 0.25 mg/kg or organic selenium diphenyl diselenide (DPDS) at .5 mg/kg body weight for 45 successive days. Neurobehavioural data from rats in a new environment using video-tracking software evinced that inorganic and organic forms of selenium significantly (p < 0.05) abrogated arsenic-induced motor and locomotor insufficiencies such as increased negative geotaxis and fecal pellets numbers as well as the diminution in grip strength, body rotation, maximum speed, absolute turn angle and total distance travelled. The augmentation in the behavioral activities in rats co-administered with arsenic and both forms of selenium was substantiated using track and occupancy plots analyses. Selenium mitigated arsenic-induced decreases in glutathione level and acetylcholinesterase activity as well as the increase in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Moreover, selenium diminished inflammatory parameters (myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 beta levels), caspase-3 activity and ameliorated histological lesions in the cerebellum, cerebrum and liver of the rats. Collectively, selenium abated arsenic-induced behavioral derangements via anti-inflammation, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic mechanisms in rats.Copyright © 2019.

Vedolizumab with concomitant immunosuppression showed comparable effectiveness outcomes compared to vedolizumab monotherapy (week 104: 21% vs. 23%, p=0.77), while 8 out of 13 severe infections occurred in patients treated with concomitant immunosuppression. To conclude, the clinical effect was 19% for CD and 28% for UC after  years of follow-up regardless of concomitant immunosuppression.© 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2019 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668704>The Human-Specific BOLA2 Duplication Modifies Iron Homeostasis and Anemia Predisposition in Chromosome 16p11. Autism Individuals.</a></h2><p>Human-specific duplications at chromosome 16p11. mediate recurrent pathogenic 600 kbp BP4-BP5 copy-number variations, which are among the most common genetic causes of autism. These copy-number polymorphic duplications are under positive selection and include three to eight copies of BOLA2, a gene involved in the maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins. To investigate the potential advantage provided by the rapid expansion of BOLA2, we assessed hematological traits and anemia prevalence in 379,385 controls and individuals who have lost or gained copies of BOLA2: 89 chromosome 16p11. BP4-BP5 deletion carriers and 56 reciprocal duplication carriers in the UK Biobank. We found that the 16p11. deletion is associated with anemia (18/89 carriers, 20%, p = 4e-7, OR = 5), particularly iron-deficiency anemia. We observed similar enrichments in two clinical 16p11. deletion cohorts, which included 6/63 (10%) and 7/20 (35%) unrelated individuals with anemia, microcytosis, low serum iron, or low blood hemoglobin. Upon stratification by BOLA2 copy number, our data showed an association between low BOLA2 dosage and the above phenotypes (8/15 individuals with three copies, 53%, p = 1e-4). In parallel, we analyzed hematological traits in mice carrying the 16p11. orthologous deletion or duplication, as well as Bola2 and Bola2 animals. The Bola2-deficient mice and the mice carrying the deletion showed early evidence of iron deficiency, including a mild decrease in hemoglobin, lower plasma iron, microcytosis, and an increased red blood cell zinc-protoporphyrin-to-heme ratio. Our results indicate that BOLA2 participates in iron homeostasis in vivo, and its expansion has a potential adaptive role in protecting against iron deficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

SCFAs are known to improve host  but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL,  mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid  related stearic acid and glycerol--phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid  products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty acid synthesis and promoted lipid  process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis.

In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty acid (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body fat and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA .

RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway and Wnt signalling pathway both implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to investigate the effect of denosumab or romosozumab therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with primary osteoporosis.PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to June 4, 2019. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of denosumab or romosozumab versus active comparators or placebo for at least 6 months in patients with primary osteoporosis or osteopenia were included. Two investigators independently extracted data for study characteristics, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.17 relevant studies (denosumab: n = 11, 13615 participants; romosozumab: n = 6, 12219 participants) were included. No associations between denosumab therapy and risk of a composite cardiovascular outcome (1.06 [95 % CI, 0.88-1.28], p = 0.54), three-point major adverse cardiovascular event (3P MACE, 1.01 [95 % CI, 0.83-1.23], p = 0.93), and four-point major adverse cardiovascular event (4P MACE, 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.83-1.18], p = 0.89) were identified. Romosozumab therapy did not increase the risk of composite cardiovascular outcome (1.26 [95 % CI, 0.95-1.68], p = 0.11), and 3P MACE (1.41 [95 % CI, 0.99-.02], p = 0.06), while increased the risk of 4P MACE (1.39 [95 % CI, 1.01-1.90], p = 0.04) among elderly men and postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis over a period of 12-36 months. Denosumab or romosozumab did not increase or reduce specific cardiovascular outcomes, including CV death or death, myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, aortic and intracranial aneurysm, aortic dissection, aortic valve disease and hypertension (all p＞0.05). Sensitivity analysis conducted by random effects model altered the result of 4 P MACE in romosozumab (1.36 [0.99-1.87], p = 0.06). No other significant difference was detected in the sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses.Denosumab therapy was not associated with any risk of composite and specific cardiovascular outcomes among patients with primary osteoporosis than active comparators or placebo, while romosozumab therapy might increase the risk of 4 P MACE.Copyright © 2019.

However, some patients with RTH show thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression due to thyrotoxicosis. We report a case of painless thyroiditis in a patient with RTH that was misdiagnosed as Graves' disease because of TSH-suppressed thyrotoxicosis.A sixteen-year-old boy consulted a local general physician for fatigue. He had a goiter, and biochemical analysis showed TSH < 0.1 μIU/mL, free triiodothyronine (FT3) of .70 pg/mL, and free thyroxine (FT4) of 3.6 ng/dL. He was diagnosed with Graves' disease and was treated with 20 mg thiamazole. One year later, he was referred to the department of endocrinology because of SITSH. He was finally diagnosed with RTH due to the finding of a heterozygous missense mutation (methionine 334 threonine) in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene. Three years after cessation of thiamazole, his hyperthyroxinemia showed marked exacerbation with TSH suppression. We diagnosed him with painless destructive thyroiditis because of low technetium-99 m (Tc-99 m) uptake in the thyroid. Extreme hyperthyroxinemia was ameliorated, with a return to the usual SITSH levels, within 1 month without any treatment.The present case demonstrates that diagnosing RTH is difficult when patients show hyperthyroxinemia with complete suppression of TSH to undetectable levels, and the data lead to misdiagnosis of RTH as Graves' disease. The initial diagnosis is important, and Tc-99 m scintigraphy is useful for the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis accompanying RTH.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670980>Critical thinking about three meta-analyses: can vitamin D alone or with calcium prevent fractures?</a></h2><p>Critical thinking is crucially important in both research and practice.

These two enantiomers behave differently in the environment due to enantioselective catabolism by microorganisms. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this enantioselective catabolism remain largely unknown. In this study, the genes (snaH and snpd) involved in the catabolism of NAP were cloned from Sphingobium sp. B2, which was capable of catabolizing both NAP enantiomers. Compared to (R)-NAP, (S)-NAP was much more rapidly transformed by the amidase SnaH, which initially cleaved the amide bonds of (S)/(R)-NAP to form (S)/(R)--(1-naphthalenyloxy)-propanoic acid ((S)/(R)-NP) and diethylamine. The α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase Snpd, showing strict stereoselectivity for (S)-NP, further transformed (S)-NP to 1-naphthol and pyruvate. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that when the (S)-enantiomers of NAP and NP occupied the active sites, the distance between the ligand molecule and the coordination atom was shorter than that when the (R)-enantiomers occupied the active sites, which facilitated formation of the transition state complex. This study enhances our understanding of the preferential catabolism of the (S)-enantiomer of NAP on the molecular level. This article is protected by copyright.

This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the acid soluble Cd in soil was increased by .83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate/energy/amino acid  were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation.

Recently, a new plasma glucagon assay based on liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was developed. We evaluated the influence of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (anagliptin) on plasma glucagon levels in Japanese patients with type  diabetes by using this new assay.Twenty-four patients with type  diabetes were enrolled in a prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label study and were randomly allocated to 4 weeks of treatment with metformin (1000 mg/day) or anagliptin (200 mg/day). A liquid test meal labeled with sodium [C] acetate was ingested before and after the treatment period. Samples of blood and expired air were collected over 3 hours. Plasma levels of glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were measured, and gastric emptying was also evaluated.Twenty-two patients completed the study (metformin group: n=10; anagliptin group: n=12). Glycemic control showed similar improvement in both groups. In the anagliptin group, there was a slight decrease of the incremental area under the plasma concentration versus time curve for glucagon after the test meal (P=0.048). In addition, the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP was increased, and plasma C-peptide was also increased versus baseline. Neither anagliptin nor metformin delayed gastric emptying.In patients with type  diabetes maintained endogenous insulin secretion, anagliptin increased the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP in association with a slight stimulation of insulin secretion and slight inhibition of glucagon secretion, but did not delay gastric emptying.Copyright © 2019.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy  and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner.

This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant microbiota of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut microbiota physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral microbiota could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte , themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of microbiota to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut microbiota close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We sought to quantify bone degradation by comparing urinary concentrations of carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1), a well-described marker of bone resorption, in a prospective cohort of 52 adults with sickle cell disease enrolled in the Sickle Cell Pain Markers Study. We also questioned if changes in urinary CTX-1 concentrations correlated with changes in hemolysis and inflammatory markers measured both during and after resolution of a painful vaso-occlusive episode. Thirty-one of the 52 adults enrolled in the study had paired urine samples for CTX-1 analysis. Urinary CTX-1, corrected for urine creatinine, significantly decreased from a mean of 3.45 μg/mmol during vaso-occlusive crises to .62 μg/mmol at recovery (p = 0.01). Thus, increased bone loss appears to correlate with acute vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease.

Here we demonstrate that in human endothelial cells, activation of mTORC2 signaling by GFs is mediated by transmembrane cell adhesion protein CD146. Upon GF stimulation, the cytoplasmic tail of CD146 is phosphorylated, which permits its positively charged, juxtamembrane KKGK motif to interact with Rictor, the defining subunit of mTORC2. The formation of the CD146-Rictor/mTORC2 complex protects Rictor from ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby specifically upregulating mTORC2 activity with no intervention of the PI3K and mTORC1 . This CD146-mediated mTORC2 activation in response to GF stimulation promotes cell proliferation and survival. Therefore, our findings identify a molecular mechanism by which extracellular stimuli regulate mTORC2 activity, linking environmental cues with mTORC2 regulation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

This may result from altered energy  or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001).

We investigated associations of low bone mineral density (BMD) at various bone sites with five year all-cause and CVD mortality in ESRD patients.In a post hoc analysis of 426 ESRD patients (median age 56 years, 62% men) starting dialysis, BMD (whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), body composition, nutritional status (subjective global assessment, SGA), handgrip strength (%HGS), Framingham CVD risk score (FRS) and biochemical biomarkers of nutrition and inflammation were assessed. We used the Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis to assess survival analysis.In multivariate logistic regression analysis, %HGS and intact parathyroid hormone associated with low tertile of: BMD, BMD and BMD, after adjusting for FRS, SGA, %HGS, s-albumin, hsCRP, lean body mass index and year of recruitment. Patients with high FRS had low BMD (p < 0.001). Low tertile of BMD (sHR, 1.53), BMD (sHR 1.54) and BMD (sHR 1.60) associated with increased all-cause mortality whereas no such associations were found for the trabecular bone rich sites BMD arm, leg, trunk, rib or spine. Low tertile of BMD (sHR 1.94), BMD (sHR 1.68), BMD (sHR .25) and BMD (sHR .45) associated with increased CVD mortality whereas BMD at other sites did not associate with CVD mortality.Low head and pelvis BMD, and low total BMD, as assessed by whole-body DXA, were independent predictors of increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Cortical BMD appeared to have stronger association to survival in ESRD than trabecular BMD.Copyright © 2019.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its  actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; ) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle , particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tg6 mice with chronic erythropoietin overexpression have a high hematocrit, reduced trabecular and cortical bone and bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  driven ectopic bone and adipocyte formation. Erythropoietin treatment (1 200 IU·kg) for 10 days similarly exhibit increased hematocrit, reduced bone and bone marrow adipocytes without increased osteoclasts, and reduced bone morphogenic protein signaling in the bone marrow. Interestingly, endogenous erythropoietin is required for normal differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes. ΔEpoR mice with erythroid restricted erythropoietin receptor exhibit reduced trabecular bone, increased bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein  ectopic bone formation. Erythropoietin treated ΔEpoR mice achieved hematocrit similar to wild-type mice without reduced bone, suggesting that bone reduction with erythropoietin treatment is associated with non-erythropoietic erythropoietin response. Bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type, Tg6, and ΔEpoR-mice were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to assess development into a bone/marrow organ. Like endogenous bone formation, Tg6 bone marrow cells exhibited reduced differentiation to bone and adipocytes indicating that high erythropoietin inhibits osteogenesis and adipogenesis, while ΔEpoR bone marrow cells formed ectopic bones with reduced trabecular regions and increased adipocytes, indicating that loss of erythropoietin signaling favors adipogenesis at the expense of osteogenesis. In summary, endogenous erythropoietin signaling regulates bone marrow stromal cell fate and aberrant erythropoietin levels result in their impaired differentiation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675917>Optimizing microbiome sequencing for small intestinal aspirates: validation of novel techniques through the REIMAGINE study.</a></h2><p>The human small intestine plays a central role in the processes of digestion and nutrient absorption. However, characterizations of the human gut microbiome have largely relied on stool samples, and the associated methodologies are ill-suited for the viscosity and low microbial biomass of small intestine samples. As part of the REIMAGINE study to examine the specific roles of the small bowel microbiome in human health and disease, this study aimed to develop and validate methodologies to optimize microbial analysis of the small intestine.Subjects undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy without colon preparation for standard of care were prospectively recruited, and ~  ml samples of luminal fluid were obtained from the duodenum using a custom sterile aspiration catheter. Samples of duodenal aspirates were either untreated (DA-U, N = 127) or pretreated with dithiothreitol (DA-DTT, N = 101), then cultured on MacConkey agar for quantitation of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, typically from the class Gammaproteobacteria, and on blood agar for quantitation of anaerobic microorganisms. DA-DTT exhibited .86-fold greater anaerobic bacterial counts compared to DA-U (P = 0.0101), but were not statistically different on MacConkey agar. DNA isolation from DA-U (N = 112) and DA-DTT (N = 43) samples and library preparation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also performed using modified protocols. DA-DTT samples exhibited 3.81-fold higher DNA concentrations (P = 0.0014) and 4.18-fold higher 16S library concentrations (P < 0.0001) then DA-U samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed increases in the detected relative abundances of obligate and facultative anaerobes in DA-DTT samples, including increases in the genera Clostridium (false discovery rate (FDR) P = 4.38E-6), Enterococcus (FDR P = .57E-8), Fusobacterium (FDR P = 0.02) and Bacteroides (FDR P = 5.43E-9). Detected levels of Gram-negative enteropathogens from the phylum Proteobacteria, such as Klebsiella (FDR P = .73E-6) and Providencia (FDR P < 0.0001) (family Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas (family Pseudomonadaceae) (FDR P = 0.04), were also increased in DA-DTT samples.This study validates novel DTT-based methodology which optimizes microbial culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for the study of the small bowel microbiome.

The prototypical ligand of the AHR is an environmental contaminant called ,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD exposure is associated with many adverse health outcomes in humans including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that AHR ligands alter cholesterol homeostasis in mice through repression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as Hmgcr, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis called 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of HMGCR repression in TCDD-induced liver injury. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to TCDD in the presence or absence of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMGCR. Simvastatin exposure decreased TCDD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in both sexes, but was most prominent in females. Simvastatin and TCDD (S + T) co-treatment increased hepatic AHR-battery gene expression and liver injury in male, but not female, mice. In addition, the S + T co-treatment led to an increase in hepatic glycogen content that coincides with heavier liver in female mice. Results from this study suggest that statins, which are amongst the most prescribed pharmaceuticals, may protect from AHR-mediated steatosis, but alter glycogen  and increase the risk of TCDD-elicited liver damage in a sex-specific manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675452>Bone Marrow and Muscle Fat Infiltration are Correlated Among Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis: the AMBERS Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Bone and muscle have shown to interact, but little is known about fat within bone and muscle. Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<5%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat  and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to  flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid  alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves  deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal  communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

TT1 is clinically characterized by acute liver failure, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, renal and neurological problems, and consequently an extremely poor outcome. This review showed that the introduction of -(-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) in 1992 has revolutionized the outcome of TT1 patients, especially when started pre-clinically. If started early, NTBC can prevent liver failure, renal problems, and neurological attacks and decrease the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. NTBC has been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although the long-term effectiveness of treatment with NTBC needs to be awaited. The high tyrosine concentrations caused by treatment with NTBC could result in ophthalmological and skin problems and requires life-long dietary restriction of tyrosine and its precursor phenylalanine, which could be strenuous to adhere to. In addition, neurocognitive problems have been reported since the introduction of NTBC, with hypothesized but as yet unproven pathophysiological mechanisms. Further research should be done to investigate the possible relationship between important clinical outcomes and blood concentrations of biochemical parameters such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, succinylacetone, and NTBC, and to develop clear guidelines for treatment and follow-up with reliable measurements. This all in order to ultimately improve the combined NTBC and dietary treatment and limit possible complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma development, neurocognitive problems, and impaired quality of life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669906>Overlooked  of denitrification in a sulfur-based denitrification system with organic supplementation.</a></h2><p>Elemental sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrification (SADN) is a cost-effective approach for treating secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Additional organics are generally supplemented to promote total nitrogen (TN) removal, reduce nitrite accumulation and sulfate production, and balance the pH decrease induced by SADN. However, understanding of the impacts of organic supplementation on microbial communities, nitrogen , denitrifier activity, and SADN rates in sulfur-based denitrification reactors is still limited. Here, a sulfur-based denitrification reactor was continuously operated for 272 days during which six different C/N ratios were tested successively (.7, 1.5, 0.7, 0.5, 0.25, and 0). Organic supplementation improved TN removal and decreased NO accumulation, but reduced the relative abundance of denitrifiers and the contribution of autotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria (aNRB) to TN removal during the long-term operation of reactor. Predictive functional profiling showed that nitrogen  potential increased with decreasing C/N ratios. SADN was the predominant removal process when the C/N ratio was ≤0.7 (achieving 60% contribution when C/N = 0.7). Although organic supplementation weakened the dominant role of aNRB in denitrification, batch tests for the first time demonstrated that it could accelerate the SADN rate, attributed to the improvement of sulfur bioavailability, likely via the formation of polysulfide. A possible nitrogen removal pathway with multiple electron donors (i.e., sulfur, organics, sulfide, and polysulfide) in a sulfur-based denitrification reactor with organic supplementation was therefore proposed. However, supplementation with a high level of organics could increase the operational cost and effluent concentrations of sulfide and organics as well as enrich heterotrophic denitrifiers. Moreover, microbial community had substantial changes at C/N ratios of >0.5. Accordingly, an optimal C/N ratio of 0.25-0.5 was suggested, which could simultaneously minimize the additional operating cost associated with organic supplementation and maximize TN removal and SADN rates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with LGA birthweight.LGA was significantly higher in those with T1DM (39%) than T2DM (17%) (p<0.001). Among those with T1DM, there was a nonsignificant association between LGA and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.39; p=0.06) and excess maternal weight gain (T1DM odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.43; p=0.069).

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on insulin-related  in the central nervous system, especially in type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on insulin sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate- (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that an increase in dietary saturated fat could lead to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and heart rhythm by a NOX2 (NADPH oxidase )-dependent mechanism.We investigated this hypothesis by feeding mice high-fat diets. In vivo heart rhythm telemetry, optical mapping, and isolated cardiac myocyte imaging were used to quantify arrhythmias, repolarization, calcium transients, and intracellular calcium sparks.We found that saturated fat activates NOX (NADPH oxidase), whereas polyunsaturated fat does not. The high saturated fat diet increased repolarization heterogeneity and ventricular tachycardia inducibility in perfused hearts. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NOX2 prevented arrhythmogenic abnormalities in vivo during high statured fat diet and resulted in less inducible ventricular tachycardia. High saturated fat diet activates CaMK (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in the heart, which contributes to abnormal calcium handling, promoting arrhythmia.We conclude that NOX2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition prevents the arrhythmogenic effects of a high saturated fat diet, in part mediated by activation of CaMK. This work reveals a molecular mechanism linking cardiac  to arrhythmia and suggests that NOX2 inhibitors could be a novel therapy for heart rhythm abnormalities caused by cardiac lipid overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677481>Simultaneous determination of 24 free amino acids in MGC803 cells by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Amino acids play key roles in cellular protein biosynthesis and energy  .

We hypothesized that low dietary Mg intake may alter sPTH response to s25OHD in a population with excess body weight, thereby leading to a worsening of cardiometabolic health. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional study on adults who were either overweight or obese (owt/ob). Dietary Mg intake was measured using a Mg food frequency questionnaire (MgFFQ). Body composition information was measured using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Blood samples were obtained for all biochemical analyses. A total of 57 participants, 22 to 65 years of age, with a body mass index between 25 to 45 kg/m were divided into 3 groups, according to dietary Mg intake percentiles (Low Mg Group = <33 percentile, Medium Mg Group = 33 to 66 percentile, High Mg Group = >66 percentile).

In this study, we investigated the correlations between cardiovascular phenotypes and karyotypes in TS.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 105 local patients with TS aged 6-43 years between January 1994 and December 2018. They were categorized into two groups of complete monosomy X (45,X) and other X chromosome abnormalities. Most of the patients underwent echocardiography (n = 88, 83.8%), cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography, and/or cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 58, 55.%).

We hypothesized that suppression of proinflammatory pathway of IKKβ/NF-κBin the hypothalamuscan improve energy balance and cardiac function in type  diabetic (T2D)rats.Normal rats and T2D rats received bilateral hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) infusions of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 or vehicle via osmotic minipump. phenotyping, immunohistochemical analyses, and biochemical analyses were used to investigate the outcomes of inhibition of the hypothalamic IKKβ. Echocardiography and glucometer were used for measuring cardiac function and blood glucose,respectively. Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (PICs). Heart was harvested for cardiacmorphology evaluations. The ARC was harvested and analyzed for IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NAD(P)H (gp91phox,p47phox) oxidase activitylevels and neuropeptides.Compared with normal rats, T2D rats were characterized by hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, cardiac dysfunction, as well as higher ARC levels of IKKβ, NF-κB, PICs, ROS, gp91phox and p47phox. ARC infusion of IKKβ inhibitor SC-514 attenuated all these changes in T2D rats, but not in normal rats.Our results indicate that hypothalamic IKKβ/NF-κB pathway plays a key role in modulatingenergy imbalance and cardiac dysfunction, suggesting its potential therapeutic role during type 2diabetes.© 2019 S.

Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and  months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Recent studies indicated an emerging role of these eicosanoids in  diseases and the EET signaling pathway was shown to be involved in hepatic insulin sensitivity. However, compared to vascular tissues, there is only limited knowledge about the underlying signaling  in the liver. Therefore, we employed an LC-MS/MS-based time-resolved phosphoproteomics approach to characterize 11,12-EET-mediated signaling events in the liver cell line Hepa 1-6. 11,12-EET treatment resulted in the time-dependent regulation of phosphopeptides involved in processes as yet unknown to be affected by EETs, including RNA processing, splicing and translation regulation. Pathway analysis combined with western blot-based validation revealed enhanced AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling as demonstrated by increased acute phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and p70S6K (Thr389). In addition, 11,12-EET treatment led to differential regulation of phosphopeptides including important mediators of the DNA damage response and we observed a prolonged induction of the etoposide-induced DNA damage marker γH2AX in response to 11,12-EET. In summary, our findings extend current knowledge of 11,12-EET signaling events and emphasize the importance of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in hepatic 11,12-EET signaling. Based on the results presented in this study, we furthermore propose a novel role of EET signaling in the regulation of the DNA damage response.Copyright © 2019.

Enhancing DIT can lead to weight loss. Factors that increase DIT are expected to lower body mass index and body fat mass. Although various methods have been developed for measuring DIT in humans, there is currently no method available for calculating absolute DIT values in mice. Therefore, we attempted to measure DIT in mice by applying the method more commonly used for humans. Mouse energy  was first measured under fasting conditions; EE was plotted against the square root of the activity count, and a linear regression equation was fit to the data. Then, energy  was measured in mice that were allowed to feed ad libitum, and EE was plotted in the same way. We calculated the DIT by subtracting the predicted EE value from the fed EE value for the same activity count. The methodology for measuring DIT in mice may be helpful for researching ways of combatting obesity by increasing DIT. •The methodology for measuring absolute DIT values in mice is developed.•For mice, the proportion of DIT compared with calorie intake and EE are 12.3% and 21.7%, respectively.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665679>Probing the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of novel chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates to zebrafish larvae: Implication of structural specificity.</a></h2><p>Hepatotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae elicited by legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its three novel chlorinated alternatives, including chlorinated polyfluorooctane sulfonate (Cl-PFOS) and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (6: and 8: Cl-PFESA analogs), was evaluated in this study. Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6: Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8: Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8: Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, %, or 5% FM) or FOS (~%, 5%, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three SCFA transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at % and 5% FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance ( h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665043>Arabidopsis thaliana alternative dehydrogenases: a potential therapy for mitochondrial complex I deficiency? Perspectives and pitfalls.</a></h2><p>Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH- from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH- (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the mitochondria were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per oxygen atom reduced to water by half in control cells.In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH- should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669490>Integrated thermodynamic analysis of electron bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase to inform anaerobic  and H production.</a></h2><p>Electron bifurcating, [FeFe]-hydrogenases are recently described members of the hydrogenase family and catalyze a combination of exergonic and endergonic electron exchanges between three carriers ( ferredoxin + NAD(P)H + 3H =  ferredoxin + NAD(P) +  H). A thermodynamic analysis of the bifurcating, [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction, using electron path-independent variables, quantified potential biological roles of the reaction without requiring enzyme details. The bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction, like all bifurcating reactions, can be written as a sum of two non-bifurcating reactions. Therefore, the thermodynamic properties of the bifurcating reaction can never exceed the properties of the individual, non-bifurcating, reactions. The bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction has three competitive properties: 1) enabling NAD(P)H-driven proton reduction at pH higher than the concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions, ) oxidation of NAD(P)H and ferredoxin simultaneously in a 1:1 ratio, both are produced during typical glucose fermentations, and 3) enhanced energy conservation (~10 kJ mol H) relative to concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions. Our analysis demonstrated ferredoxin E°' largely determines the sensitivity of the bifurcating reaction to pH, modulation of the reduced/oxidized electron carrier ratios contributed less to equilibria shifts. Hydrogenase thermodynamics data were integrated with typical and non-typical glycolysis  to evaluate achieving the 'Thauer limit' (4 H per glucose) as a function of temperature and pH. For instance, the bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction permits the Thauer limit at 60 °C if pH  ≤ ~10 mbar. The results also predict Archaea, expressing a non-typical glycolysis pathway, would not benefit from a bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction; interestingly, no Archaea have been observed experimentally with a [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme.Copyright © 2019.

Despite prior work suggesting that distinct neural  underlie these cognitive operations, there has been little study of these  in Parkinson's disease, and their relationship to inter-individual differences in impulsivity. High-resolution diffusion MRI data were acquired from 57 individuals with Parkinson's disease (19 females, mean age 62, mean Hoehn and Yahr stage .6) prior to surgery for deep brain stimulation. Reward evaluation and response inhibition  were reconstructed with seed-based probabilistic tractography. Impulsivity was evaluated using two approaches: (i) neuropsychiatric instruments were used to assess latent constructs of impulsivity, including trait impulsiveness and compulsivity, disinhibition, and also impatience; and (ii) participants gambled in an ecologically-valid virtual casino to obtain a behavioural read-out of explorative, risk-taking, impulsive behaviour. Multivariate analyses revealed that different components of impulsivity were associated with distinct variations in structural connectivity, implicating both reward evaluation and response inhibition . Larger bet sizes in the virtual casino were associated with greater connectivity of the reward evaluation network, particularly bilateral fibre tracts between the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, weaker connectivity of the response inhibition network was associated with increased exploration of alternative slot machines in the virtual casino, with right-hemispheric tracts between the subthalamic nucleus and the pre-supplementary motor area contributing most strongly. Further, reduced connectivity of the reward evaluation network was associated with more 'double or nothing' gambles, weighted by connections between the subthalamic nucleus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Notably, the variance explained by structural connectivity was higher for behavioural indices of impulsivity, derived from clinician-administered tasks and the gambling paradigm, as compared to questionnaire data. Lastly, a clinically-meaningful distinction could be made amongst participants with a history of impulse control behaviours based on the interaction of their network connectivity with medication dosage and gambling behaviour. In summary, we report structural brain-behaviour covariation in Parkinson's disease with distinct reward evaluation and response inhibition  that underlie dissociable aspects of impulsivity (cf. choosing and stopping). More broadly, our findings demonstrate the potential of using naturalistic paradigms and neuroimaging techniques in clinical settings to assist in the identification of those susceptible to harmful behaviours.© The Author(s) (2019).

Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD)  are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling  in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino acids (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic , we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43. ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x Insulin/22.5), OGTT glucose and insulin profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle insulin sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x insulin [AUC]) during OGTT, insulin response as (insulin [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased insulin concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting insulin, HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of insulin response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Many tumour cells show "glutamine dependence". However, the relationship between glutamine  and PD-L1 expression has not been reported. In this study, changes in PD-L1 expression in renal carcinoma cells were evaluated during glutamine deprivation and recovery. Although PD-L1 expression differed in two renal cancer cell lines, both cell lines upregulated PD-L1 during glutamine deprivation, and the upregulated PD-L1 was restored to normal after glutamine recovery. Mechanistically, glutamine deprivation resulted in activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling via extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and  (ERK1/) and c-Jun. Additionally, treatment of renal cancer cells with EGF also induced PD-L1 expression and ERK1/ phosphorylation. Finally, inhibitors of EGFR, ERK, and c-Jun all inhibited phosphorylation of c-Jun and downregulated PD-L1 expression induced by glutamine deprivation. Taken together, the data suggest that glutamine regulates the expression of PD-L1 through the EGFR/ERK/c-Jun pathway in renal cancer. Implications: This study reveals glutamine deprivation induces PD-L1 expression via activation of EGFR/ERK/c-Jun signaling in renal cancer and provides novel markers for the treatment of renal cancer.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676954>Comparing directly measured versus mathematically calculated free serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level in children.</a></h2><p>25-Hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) is essential for calcium homeostasis and bone . The majority of serum 25(OH)D is bound to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) (~ 85%) and to albumin (~ 15%), with only a miniscule amount circulating as free 25(OH)D.

Exogenous administration of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs have also been implicated in the modulation of cardiovascular functions. This brief review summarizes the role of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in vascular relaxation through the modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). The effects of taurine on vascular health are controversial. However, in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors, it has been proposed that taurine can increase vascular NO levels by increasing eNOS expression, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177, NO bioavailability, the level of antioxidative defense, and the l-arginine/NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. The taurine-conjugated BA-mediated activation of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5) and/or muscarinic 3 receptor (M3) was also reported to increase vascular NO production. FXR activation increases eNOS expression and may reduce ADMA formation, while TGR5 increases mobilization of Ca and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells. Furthermore, taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs might regulate NO synthesis and activity by enhancing HS generation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of both taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs in reversing the endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, obesity, malnutrition, and smoking. In addition, taurine-conjugated BAs have emerged as a potential treatment for portal hypertension. Despite these favorable findings, there is a need to further explore the mechanisms and signaling  underlying the endothelial effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs. Here, we summarize the main findings regarding the effects of taurine and taurine-conjugated BAs on the endothelial dysfunction associated with altered NO  in cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

In addition, although micro-TESE (mTESE) has been advocated as the gold standard for sperm retrieval in men with NOA, its superiority over conventional TESE (cTESE) remains conflicting.The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the currently available studies comparing the techniques of sperm retrieval and to identify clinical and biochemical factors predicting SRR in men with NOA. In addition, PRs and live birth rates (LBRs), as derived from subjects with NOA post-ICSI, were also analysed as secondary outcomes.An extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane search was performed. All trials reporting SRR derived from cTESE or mTESE in patients with NOA and their specific determinants were included. Data derived from genetic causes of NOA or testicular sperm aspiration were excluded.Out of 1236 studies, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, enrolling 21 404 patients with a mean age (± SD) of 35.0 ± .7 years. cTESE and mTESE were used in 56 and 43 studies, respectively. In addition, 10 studies used a mixed approach and 8 studies compared cTESE with mTESE approach. Overall, a SRR per TESE procedure of 47[45;49]% (mean percentage [95% CI]) was found. No differences were observed when mTESE was compared to cTESE (46[43;49]% for cTESE versus 46[42;49]% for mTESE). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SRR per cycle was independent of age and hormonal parameters at enrolment. However, the SRR increased as a function of testis volume. In particular, by applying ROC curve analysis, a mean testis volume higher than 12.5 ml predicted SRR >60% with an accuracy of 86.% ± 0.01. In addition, SRR decreased as a function of the number of Klinefelter's syndrome cases included (S = -0.02[-0.04;-0.01]; P < 0.01. I = 0.12[-0.05;0.29]; P = 0.16). Information on fertility outcomes after ICSI was available in 42 studies. Overall, a total of 1096 biochemical pregnancies were reported (cumulative PR = 29[25;32]% per ICSI cycle). A similar rate was observed when LBR was analysed (569 live births with a cumulative LBR = 24[20;28]% per ICSI cycle). No influence of male and female age, mean testis volume or hormonal parameters on both PR and LBR per ICSI cycle was observed. Finally, a higher PR per ICSI cycle was observed when the use of fresh sperm was compared to cryopreserved sperm (PR = 35[30;40]%, versus 20[13;29]% respectively): however, this result was not confirmed when cumulative LBR per ICSI cycle was analysed (LBR = 30[20;41]% for fresh versus 20[12;31]% for cryopreserved sperm).This analysis shows that cTESE/mTESE in subjects with NOA results in SRRs of up to 50%, with no differences when cTESE was compared to mTESE. Retrieved sperms resulted in a LBR of up to 28% ICSI cycle. Although no difference between techniques was found, to conclusively clarify if one technique is superior to the other, there is a need for a sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare mTESE to cTESE in men with NOA.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of cigarette smoking on multiple AD biomarkers among older individuals with normal cognition (NC). Among 415 older individuals with NC from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, we examined the associations between smoking status (non-smokers vs smokers) and global cognition, verbal memory, hippocampal volumes, cerebral glucose  and CSF AD pathologies. The primary findings of this study were: (1) In NC, smokers showed worse performance on verbal memory tests [Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) total learning score and delayed recall] than non-smokers; () Compared with non-smokers, smokers had significantly lower HpVR; (3) Smokers, relative to non-smokers, demonstrated lower levels of cerebral glucose  as measured by FDG-PET; and (4) there were no significant differences in CSF AD pathologies (CSF Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau) between non-smokers and smokers. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the relationship between cigarettes smoking and changes in AD-related markers over time. Further, ADNI participants were highly educated and predominantly white. This may limit the generalizability of our results. In summary, among individuals with NC, cigarette smoking was associated with memory impairment, hippocampal atrophy and cerebral glucose hypometabolism, but not CSF AD pathologies.Copyright © 2019.

Low carnitine availability may contribute to  inflexibility and impaired glucose tolerance. Here, we investigated whether carnitine supplementation improves  flexibility and insulin sensitivity in impaired glucose tolerant (IGT) volunteers.Eleven IGT- volunteers followed a 36-day placebo- and L-carnitine treatment ( g/day) in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind crossover design. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m/min), combined with indirect calorimetry (ventilated hood) was performed to determine insulin sensitivity and  flexibility. Furthermore,  flexibility was assessed in response to a high-energy meal. Skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations were measured in vivo using long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS, TE=500 ms) in the resting state (7:00AM and 5:00PM) and after a 30-min cycling exercise. Twelve normal glucose tolerant (NGT) volunteers were included without any intervention as control group. flexibility of IGT-subjects completely restored towards NGT control values upon carnitine supplementation, measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and meal test. In muscle, carnitine supplementation enhanced the increase in resting acetylcarnitine concentrations over the day (delta 7:00 AM versus 5:00 PM) in IGT-subjects. Furthermore, carnitine supplementation increased post-exercise acetylcarnitine concentrations and reduced long-chain acylcarnitine species in IGT-subjects, suggesting the stimulation of a more complete fat oxidation in muscle. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was not affected.Carnitine supplementation improves acetylcarnitine formation and rescues  flexibility in IGT-subjects. Future research should investigate the potential of carnitine in prevention/treatment of type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abrus cantoniensis Hance (AC), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used as a folk medicine for treating hepatitis in China from ancient times. However, its active ingredients are still unclear.Our previous study indicated that saponins extracted from AC (ACS) were the active anti-HBV ingredients in AC. This study aimed to further investigate the anti-HBV effect of ACS in vitro and in vivo.HepG2..15 cells which consecutively produce HBV DNA and HBV antigens were used for in vitro test, and C57BL/6 mice infected by a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector carrying 1.3 copies of HBV genome (rAAV8-HBV1.3) were used for in vivo test. The histopathological changes and the immune indices were evaluated in mice model. Genechip was conducted to identify genes and  regulated by ACS in HepG2..15 cells.In this study, we confirmed that ACS treatment prominently inhibited production of HBV DNA, Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg), and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepG2..15 cells. ACS treatment also decreased serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA level in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice, which is in accordance with the in vitro results. Moreover, HBV infection-induced liver inflammation was significantly relieved by ACS, which could be observed in H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. ACS treatment elevated IFN-γ level in mice serum and increased CD4 T cell percentage in splenocytes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that phenylalanine  pathway and tyrosine  pathway were greatly regulated by ACS treatment.ACS exerted potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in vivo and in vitro, which may provide basis for its potential clinical usage.Copyright © 2019.

The Afirma Gene Sequencing Classifier (GSC) was developed to improve the specificity of the Gene Expression Classifier (GEC). Independent studies are needed to assess the performance of GSC.The aim was to compare the performance of GEC and GSC in the assessment of indeterminate nodules.Retrospective analysis of Bethesda III and IV nodules tested with GEC or GSC in an academic center between December 2011 and September 2018. Benign call rates (BCR) and surgical outcomes were compared. Histopathologic data were collected on nodules that were surgically resected to calculate measures of test performance.The BCR was 41% (73/178) for GEC and 67.8% (82/121) for GSC (p<0.001). Among specimens with dominant Hürthle cell cytology, the BCR was 22% (6/27) for GEC and 63.% (12/19) for GSC (p=0.005). The overall surgery rate decreased from 47.8% in the GEC group to 34.7% in the GSC group (p=0.025). One GEC-benign and three GSC-benign nodules proved to be malignant in surgical excision. GSC had a statistically significant higher specificity (94% vs 60%, p<0.001) and positive predictive value (PPV) (85.3% vs 40%, p<0.001) compared to GEC. While sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) dropped with GSC (97.0% vs 90.6% and 98.6% vs 96.3%, respectively), these differences were not significantly different.GSC reclassified more indeterminate nodules as benign and improved the specificity and PPV of the test. These enhancements appear to be resulting in fewer diagnostic surgeries.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of hepatic AMPK signaling in adaptation to nutritional status and the potential sex-specific response in chickens. Hepatic genes and proteins were compared between the two sexes immediately after hatching. From 20d of age, chicks from each sex received feed treatments: Control was fed ad libitum; Fasted was starved for 24 h; Refed was fed for 4 h after a 24 h fasting. As a result, hepatic AMPKα1 mRNA level in males was significantly higher at both ages compared to females, due to the presence of Z-chromosomes. However, this did not make this kinase "male-bias" as it was eventually compensated at a translational level, which was not reported in previous studies. The protein levels and activation of AMPKα were even lower in newly-hatched male compared to female chicks, accompanied with a higher FAS and SREBP-1 gene expressions. Accordingly, hepatic G6PC2 mRNA levels in males were significantly lower associated with lower plasma glucose levels after hatching. Fasting activated hepatic AMPK, which in turn inhibited gene expression of GS, FAS and SREBP-1, and stimulated the downstream G6PC2 in both sexes. These changes recovered after refeeding. In conclusion, AMPK plays a role in adaptation to nutritional environment for both sexes. The Z-linked AMPK did not exert a sex-specific signaling, due to a "translational compensation" of AMPKα1.Copyright © 2019.

Androgen is suggested not only to regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis but also to affect . In this study, Glp1r mRNA was found widely expressed in normal male mice and its levels were positively correlated with the serum testosterone (T) concentrations. Using mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells, which highly express GLP-1R, we observed GLP-1R was upregulated both at transcriptional and protein levels induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and was downregulated by androgen receptor inhibitor ARN-509 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Glp1r mRNA. In normal C57BL/6 mice and db/db mice, Glp1r mRNA levels in the pancreases increased in the DHT treatment group and decreased in the ARN-509 treatment group. And the increased GLP-1R expression had insulinotropic function both in vitro and in vivo. Further analysis showed that the androgen receptor (Ar) located in the cytosol of MIN6 cells and translocated to the nucleus after DHT treatment. In addition, we found that there was an Ar motif in the promoter region of the Glp1r gene. Further studies revealed that the translocated DHT/Ar complex from the cytosol to the nucleus bound to the Ar motif of the Glp1r gene and upregulated gene transcription. Taken together, the widely expressed GLP-1R was positively regulated by androgen under physiological condition and in diabetic models at the transcriptional level.Copyright © 2019.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the  syndrome (MetS), and type  diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose .  parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo -deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally insulin injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced insulin resistance compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The f information is critical to the understanding the risk of victim drug-drug interactions in the clinic. Inhibitor selectivity is essential in order to generate reliable data and irreversible inhibitors are often preferred over reversible inhibitors to minimize the impact of inhibitor depletion. Although many selective cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors are available, identification of selective CYP2B6 inhibitors have been challenging due to cross inhibition to the other enzymes. In this study, dasotraline is evaluated as a selective inactivator of CYP2B6 under reaction phenotyping conditions with human hepatocytes. The results show that dasotraline is a very selective inactivator for CYP2B6 with minimal inhibition to other enzymes. A concentration of 0.1 μM dasotraline is recommended for reaction phenotyping with a hepatocyte cell density of 0.5 million cells/mL or 0.5 μM for  million cells/mL, when using a 15 minute preincubation, as well as the protocol of inactivator removal before addition of substrates.This article is protected by copyright.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter  inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed.

Pin1 interacts with the motif containing phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro of substrates and enhances cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, thereby controlling the functions of these substrates. Importantly, the Pin1 expression level is highly upregulated in most cancer cells and correlates with malignant properties, and thereby with poor outcomes. In addition, Pin1 was revealed to promote the functions of multiple oncogenes and to abrogate tumor suppressors. Accordingly, Pin1 is well recognized as a master regulator of malignant processes. Recent studies have shown that Pin1 also binds to a variety of  regulators, such as AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate kinase2, indicating Pin1 to have major impacts on lipid and glucose  in cancer cells. In this review, we focus on the roles of Pin1 in  reprogramming, such as "Warburg effects", of cancer cells.

Outcomes were mortality (procedure-related, 30-day), complications (early (≤ 30 days) and late) and success rates.   A total of 760 procedures (469 PRG and 291 PEG) were analyzed. Most common indications were head and neck cancer (HNC), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success rates for placement were 91. % for PEG and 97.1 % for PRG (   = 0.001). Procedure-related mortality was 1.7 % in PEG and 0.4 % in PRG (   = 0.113). The 30-day mortality was 10.7 % in PEG and 5.1 % in PRG (   = 0.481 after multivariate logistic regression) CVA was associated with higher 30-day mortality, whereas ALS, higher body weight, and prophylactic placements in HNC were associated with lower rates. Tube-related complications were less frequent in PEG, both early (.7 % vs. 26.4 %,   ≤ 0.001) and late (8.6 % vs. 31.5 %,   ≤ 0.001). The percentage of major complications and infections did not differ.   With respect to procedure-related and 30-day mortality, PEG and PRG compare equally. PRG had a higher procedural success rate. Tube-related complications and pain are less frequent after PEG compared to PRG. The choice for either PEG or PRG therefore should primarily be based on local facilities and expertise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672500>Relationship between glucose variability evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring and clinical factors, including glucagon-stimulated insulin secretion in patients with type  diabetes.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the clinical factors affecting daily and day-to-day glucose variability by using continuous glucose monitoring.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who underwent a glucagon stimulation test (GST) with 72 h of continuous glucose monitoring. Daily glucose variability was evaluated by mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE], percentage coefficient of variation for glucose (%CV), and day-to-day glucose variability (mean of daily differences [MODD]) by using continuous glucose monitoring. Correlations of clinical factors, including insulin secretion ability by the GST with MAGE, %CV, and MODD, were analyzed.In 83 T2DM with insulin therapy, age and hemoglobin A (HbA) correlated with MAGE and %CV, fasting plasma glucose with MAGE and MODD, and increment of C-peptide immunoreactivity (ΔCPR) by GST correlated inversely with MAGE, %CV, and MODD. In 126 T2DM without insulin therapy, age, diastolic blood pressure, and triglycerides correlated with MODD, HbA with MAGE and MODD, and ΔCPR inversely correlated with %CV. Use of α-glucosidase inhibitors inversely correlated with %CV, whereas that of sulfonylurea was associated with MAGE and %CV.These results suggest that ΔCPR correlated with stability of glycemic control, whereas poorly controlled diabetes is associated with increase in glucose variability. α-glucosidase inhibitors may be superior to sulfonylureas in reducing the glucose variability in T2DM.Copyright © 2019.

Clinical samples were separately processed and compared using solid phase extraction (SPE) and acetonitrile (ACN) protein precipitation.The calibration curve was validated over the range of 0.1-100 nmol/L with R2 >0.99. Both SPE and ACN had excellent and comparable reproducibility. The intra-day and inter-day CVs were <3% and <6%,. There was 89% and 88% hepcidin recovery by SPE and ACN preparation. Measurement of secondary reference material using non-traceable calibrators yielded up to 30% positive bias, comparable with values obtained by an external comparator. Hepcidin was stable in serum at ambient temperature and at 4°C. Relative errors (RE) were ≤1.% and ≤4.4%, respectively. Freeze-thaw (-70°C) stability after 3 cycles showed a RE of ≤1.8%. The impact on hepcidin recovery due to hemolysis (4+), lipemia (4+) and Icterus (4+) was < 3%.We have developed and validated a simple, sensitive, robust, and cost-effective HPLC/MS/MS method for the quantitation of serum hepcidin. The method uses ACN protein precipitation for sample preparation and reverse-phase normal flow HPLC. Sample preparation is inexpensive; it can be automated with a liquid handling system to allow high-throughput application.This article is protected by copyright.

This secondary, pooled analysis of data from the DEVOTE trial examined whether baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) categories were associated with a higher risk of these outcomes.DEVOTE was a treat-to-target, double-blind trial involving 7637 patients with T2D at high CV risk who were randomized to once-daily treatment with either insulin degludec (degludec) or insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100). Patients with estimated GFR data at baseline (n = 7522) were analyzed following stratification into four GFR categories.The risks of MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality increased with worsening baseline GFR category (P < 0.05), with a trend towards higher rates of severe hypoglycemia. Patients with prior CVD, CKD (estimated GFR < 60 mL/min/m), or both were at higher risk of MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality. Only CKD was associated with a higher rate of severe hypoglycemia, and the risk of MACE was higher in patients with CVD than in those with CKD (P  = 0.0003). There were no significant interactions between randomized treatment and GFR category.The risks of MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality were higher with lower baseline GFR and with prior CVD, CKD, or both. The relative effects of degludec versus glargine U100 on outcomes were consistent across baseline GFR categories, suggesting that the lower rate of severe hypoglycemia associated with degludec use versus glargine U100 use was independent of baseline GFR category.Novo Nordisk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680189></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679276>Metformin: A Salutary Candidate for Colorectal Cancer Treatment in Patients with Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The current study is a review of the literature on patients with diabetes who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), encompassing recent research on CRC and the molecular level changes occurring in these patients on the basis of varying environmental as well as non-environmental factors.

We assessed the utility of these urine steroid profiles in detecting ACC recurrence, either when interpreted by expert clinicians, or when analyzed by Random Forest, a machine learning-based classifier. Radiological recurrence detection served as the reference standard.Imaging detected recurrent disease in 42 of 135 patients; 32 had provided pre- and post-recurrence urine samples. 39 patients remained disease-free for ≥3 years. The urine "steroid fingerprint" at recurrence resembled that observed before R0 resection in the majority of cases. Review of longitudinally collected urine steroid profiles by three blinded experts detected recurrence by the time of radiological diagnosis in 50-72% of cases, improving to 69-92%, if a pre-operative urine steroid result was available. Recurrence detection by steroid profiling preceded detection by imaging by more than  months in 22-39% of patients. Specificities varied considerably, ranging from 61 to 97%. The computational classifier detected ACC recurrence with superior accuracy (sensitivity=specificity=81%).Urine steroid metabolomics is a promising tool for post-operative recurrence detection in ACC; availability of a pre-operative urine considerably improves the ability to detect ACC recurrence.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670910>Synthesis and identification of deschloroketamine metabolites in rats' urine and a quantification method for deschloroketamine and metabolites in rats' serum and brain tissue using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Deschloroketamine (-(methylamino)--phenyl-cyclohexanone) is a ketamine analogue belonging to a group of dissociative anaesthetics, which have been distributed within the illicit market since 2015. However, it was also being sold as 'ketamine' misleading people to believe that they were getting genuine ketamine. Dissociative anaesthetics have also come to the attention of psychiatric field due to their potential properties in the treatment of depression. At present, there is dearth of information on deschloroketamine related to its , biodistribution and its mechanism of action. We have therefore carried out a metabolomics study for deschloroketamine via non-targeted screening of urine samples employing liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry. We developed and validated a multiple reaction monitoring method using a triple quadrupole instrument to track metabolites of deschloroketamine. Furthermore, significant metabolites of deschloroketamine, (trans-dihydrodeschloroketamine, cis- and trans-dihydronordeschloroketamine, and nordeschloroketamine), were synthesized in-house. The prepared standards were utilized in the developed multiple reaction monitoring method. The quantification method for serum samples provided intra-day accuracy ranging from 86-112% with precision of 3% in average. The concentrations of cis/trans-dihydronordeschloroketamines and trans-dihydrodeschloroketamine were lower than 10 ng/mL, nordeschloroketamine and deschloroketamine ranged from 0.5 to 860 ng/mL in real samples. The quantification method for brain tissue provided intra-day accuracy ranging from 80-125% with precision of 7% in average. The concentrations of cis/trans-dihydronordeschloroketamines and trans-dihydrodeschloroketamine ranged from 0.5 to 70 ng/g, nordeschloroketamine and deschloroketamine varied from 0.5 to 4700 ng/g in real samples.This article is protected by copyright.

We aimed to examine the prospective association of alcohol consumption with echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, in individuals with and without type  diabetes (T2DM).We included 778 participants from the Hoorn Study (aged 68.4 ± 7. years, 49% women), a population-based prospective cohort study, oversampled for people with impaired glucose  or T2DM. Self-reported alcohol consumption was collected at baseline with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and categorized into: none (0/week), light (>0-≤30 g/week), light-to-moderate (>30-≤70 g/week), moderate (>70-≤140 g/week), and heavy drinkers (>140 g/week). Echocardiography was performed at baseline (N = 778) and after 8 years follow-up (N = 404). Multiple linear regression was used to study the association between alcohol consumption and echocardiographic measures (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial volume index (LAVI) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI)), adjusted for confounders. Moderate and heavy alcohol consumption were associated with a decreased LVEF of -3.91% (CI: -7.13;-0.69) for moderate and -4.77% (-8.18;-1.36) for heavy drinkers compared to light drinkers. No associations were found between alcohol consumption, LVMI and LAVI. Modified Poisson regression showed a trend that higher alcohol consumption amounts were associated with a higher risk of incident systolic dysfunction (LVEF≤50%) (P-for-trend 0.058).The findings provide longitudinal evidence that moderate and heavy alcohol consumption are associated with decreased LVEF and trend towards a higher risk of incident LV systolic dysfunction, compared to light drinkers.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and  traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score≥+3.).β-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.  traits, including lipids and glycolysis-related metabolites, were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with  traits were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use).198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77% female. Of 23 summary  traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted β =0.050 (95% CI 0.024,0.076),p=1.71x10 , β =6.54x10 (1.87x10 ,0.001),p=0.006 and β =.40x10 (6.49x10 ,4.14x10 ),p=0.007 (β= increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1μg/L BTM increase). Inverse relationships of β-CTX (β=-0.276 [-0.434,-0.118],p=6.03x10 ) and osteocalcin (-0.004 [-0.007,-0.001],p=0.020) with triglycerides were also identified. We explored the generalizability of these associations in 3,664 perimenopausal women (age 47.9 [4.4] years) from a UK family cohort. We confirmed a positive, albeit lower magnitude, association between β-CTX and citrate (adjusted β =0.020 [0.013,0.026],p=1.95x10 ) and an inverse association of similar magnitude between β-CTX and triglycerides (β=-0.354 [-0.471,-0.237],p=3.03x10 ).Bone resorption is positively related to circulating citrate and inversely related to triglycerides. Further studies are justified to determine whether plasma citrate or triglyceride concentrations are altered by factors known to modulate bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674141>Can intensity in strength training change caloric expenditure? systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Strength training (ST) is considered an important strategy for maintaining body weight, as it promotes an increase in total energy expenditure (EE).

In this study, we used hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced injury in human hepatic L02 cells to investigate the mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of γ-oryzanol. The injuries produced by HO in L02 cells include increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased protein expressions of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with γ-oryzanol enhanced the ROS scavenging activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased lipid peroxidation in HO treated cells. Moreover, pretreatment with γ-oryzanol inhibited HO-induced apoptosis by restoring MMP, upregulating the expression ratio of Bcl-/Bax, and inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings show that γ-oryzanol can prevent HO-induced apoptosis by suppressing intracellular accumulation of ROS and impeding ROS-activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to  activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative  leads to increased reactive oxygen species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic inflammation is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the  of astrocytes and increases the utilization of glycolysis. Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.© 2019 The Authors.

Since prevention of osteoporosis is important, it might act as a potential cofactor in osteoporosis prevention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of VSEE on osteoporosis and abnormal lipid metabolisms.MC3T3-E1 cell and OVX rat model were used to evaluate VSEE on regulation of bone and lipid metabolisms. Differentiation and matrix mineralization of preosteoblast were significantly increased by VSEE (P <0.05), which attributed to stimulating calcium influx, then to activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and regulating runt-related transcription factor  (Runx2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). VSEE could cross Caco-/HT-29 co-cultured monolayer via paracellular pathway and peptide transporter (PepT1), and could be detected in blood and maximum concentration was 122.84± 3.68 mg/L at 60 min. Additionally, VSEE was found to reverse bone loss and regulate dyslipidemia through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in OVX rats. Firmicutes phylum, Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae and six genera in VSEE group were significantly different compared with Model group (P <0.05).VSEE promotes bone growth and inhibit abnormal lipid  in OVX model through the regulation of intestinal microbiota compositions and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

Participants were classified as having normoglycemia, borderline glycemia, or diabetes mellitus (DM) with prior CAD (CAD+) or without prior CAD (CAD-). Cox regression model identified variables related to the incidence of CAD.Among CAD-, management of traditional risks differed from those with and without subsequent CAD events. On the other hand, such differences were weaker in borderline glycemia and DM CAD+, and the influence of traditional risk factors on subsequent CAD was not observed. Cox regression model showed that borderline glycemia and DM confer approximately 1.- and .8-fold excess risks of CAD, respectively, compared with CAD- with normoglycemia. CAD+ confers approximately a 5- to 8-fold increased risk. The impacts of DM and prior CAD additively reached a hazard ratio (HR) of 15.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.82-21.00).

ROS are chemically similar to reactive sulfur species (RSS) and signal through identical mechanisms. Here we examined the effects of LA on RSS in HEK293 cells using HS and polysulfide (PS) specific fluorophores, AzMC and SSP4. We show that LA concentration-dependently increased both HS and PS. Physioxia (5% O) augmented the effects of LA on HS production but decreased PS production. Thiosulfate, a known substrate for reduced LA, and an intermediate in the catabolism of HS enhanced the effects of LA on HS and PS production. Inhibiting peroxiredoxins with conoidin A and gluraredoxins with tiopronin augmented the effects of LA on PS and HS, respectively while decreasing glutathione with buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) or diethyl maleate (DEM) decreased the stimulatory effect of LA on HS production but augmented LA's effect on PS. Aminooxyacetate (AOA) and propargylglycine (PPG), inhibitors of HS production from cysteine partially inhibited LA augmentation of HS production and further decreased the LA effect when applied concurrently with BSO and DEM. The selective and cell-permeable HS scavenger, SS20, inhibited the effects of LA on cellular HS. Estimates of single-cell HS production suggest that 0.1-0.% of O consumption is used to metabolize HS and these requirements may increase to 1-% with 1 mM LA. Collectively, these results suggest that LA rescues HS from irreversible oxidation and that the effects of LA on RSS directly confer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective responses. They also suggest that TS may be an effective supplement to increase the efficacy of LA in clinical settings.Copyright © 2019.

Neurotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons triggered by aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein is a major pathogenic trait of PD. However, growing evidence indicates that peripheral processes, including  changes, may precede and contribute to neurodegeneration. The present study was undertaken to identify a  signature of PD through the quantification of serum amino acids and derivatives.Twenty older adults with PD (11 men and 9 women; mean age 73.1 ± 10. years) and 30 age-matched controls (14 men and 16 women; mean age 74.6 ± 4.3 years) were enrolled. A panel of 37 serum amino acids and derivatives was assessed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) followed by double cross-validation was used to characterize the relationship between amino acid profiles and PD.The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found to be three latent variables. The proportion of correct classifications was 99.3 ± .5% for participants with PD and 94.7 ± 3.0% for non-PD controls. Higher levels of β-amino butyric acid, cystine, ornithine, phosphoethanolamine, and proline defined the circulating amino acid profile of older people with PD. Controls were characterized by higher concentrations of 3-methyl-histidine, citrulline, and serine.Our findings indicate the existence of a distinct metabotype in older persons with PD. Future studies will have to establish whether changes in amino acid  are involved in the pathogenesis of PD.

This insufficiency is mostly post-ischaemic in nature, but other aetiologies are possible in this high-risk population. In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal microbiota, and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a 'microbiota-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments. Correction of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency could, therefore, constitute an innovative therapeutic approach to cases of this disease with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, we demonstrated that recombinant human (rh)NRG-1 enhances glucose uptake in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes via the ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodimer and PI3Kα. The present study aimed to further elucidate the mechanism whereby rhNRG-1 activates glucose uptake in comparison to the well-established insulin and to extend the findings to adult models. Combinations of rhNRG-1 with increasing doses of insulin did not yield any additive effect on glucose uptake measured as H-deoxy-d-glucose incorporation, indicating that the mechanisms of the two stimuli are similar. In c-Myc-GLUT4-mCherry-transfected neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, rhNRG-1 increased sarcolemmal GLUT4 by 16-fold, similar to insulin. In contrast to insulin, rhNRG-1 did not phosphorylate IRS-1 at Tyr, indicating that IRS-1 is not implicated in the signal transmission. Treatment of neonatal rats with rhNRG-1 in vivo induced a signaling response comparable with that observed in vitro, including increased ErbB4-pTyr, Akt-pThr and Erk1/-pThr/Tyr. In contrast, in adult cardiomyocytes rhNRG-1 only increased the phosphorylation of Erk1/ without having any significant effect on Akt and AS160 phosphorylation and glucose uptake, suggesting that rhNRG-1 function in neonatal cardiomyocytes differs from that in adult cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our results show that similar to insulin, rhNRG-1 can induce glucose uptake by activating the PI3Kα-Akt-AS160 pathway and GLUT4 translocation. Unlike insulin, the rhNRG-1-induced effect is not mediated by IRS proteins and is observed in neonatal, but not in adult rat cardiomyocytes.

Sprague-Dawley (SD) and transgenic rats TGR(A1-7)3292 (TR) which overproduce Ang-(1-7) (.5-fold increase) were submitted to ESE. The data showed no differences in time to exhaustion (SD: 4.90 ± 1.37 h vs. TR: 5.15 ± 1.15 h), creatine kinase, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Lactate dehydrogenase (SD: 219.9 ± 12.04 U/L vs. TR: 143.9 ± 35.21 U/L) and α-actinin (SD: 336.7 ± 104.5 U/L vs. TR: 224.6 ± 82.45 U/L) values were significantly lower in TR. There was a significant decrease in the range of blood glucose levels (SD: -41.4 ± 28.32 mg/dl vs. TR: -13.08 ± 39.63 mg/dl) in SD rats. Muscle (SD: 0.06 ± 0.02 mg/g vs. TR: 0.13 ± 0.01 mg/g) and hepatic glycogen (SD: 0.66 ± 0.36 mg/g vs. TG: .24 ± 1.85 mg/g) in TR were higher.

Using physical activity interviews and the Baecke questionnaire, we identified 10 twin pairs as LTPA discordant for the past 3 years. Of the twin pairs, 8 pairs participated in both RFO and PFO measurements, and  pairs participated in either of the measurements. We quantified the participants'  health with a -h oral glucose tolerance test.Fat oxidation within co-twins was correlated at rest [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.78] and during exercise (ICC = 0.67, 95% CI 0.33-0.86). The LTPA-discordant pairs had no pairwise differences in RFO or PFO. In the twin individual-based analysis, PFO was positively correlated with the past 12-month LTPA (r = 0.26, p = 0.034) and the Baecke score (r = 0.40, p = 0.022) and negatively correlated with the area under the curve of insulin (r = - 0.42, p = 0.015) and glucose (r = - 0.31, p = 0.050) during the oral glucose tolerance test.Hereditary factors were more important than LTPA for determining fat oxidation at rest and during exercise. Additionally, PFO, but not RFO, was associated with better  health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672447>The Rho GTPase RND3 regulates adipocyte lipolysis.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in diet- and obesity-related insulin resistance, with implications for several  diseases. Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type  diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte . In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5--fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The indication for RAI treatment was Graves in 5 (18.6%), toxic nodular or multinodular goiter in 16 (69.%), and unknown in 6 (22.%) patients. A total of 48 thyroid nodules were evaluated with FNAB and cytological diagnosis were benign in 24 (50.0%), nondiagnostic in 15 (31.%), atypia of undetermined significance in 5 (10.4%), suspicous for malignancy in  (4.%), and malignant in  (4.%) nodules. Thyroidectomy was performed in 10 patients, 5 were benign (50.0%), and 5 (50.0%) were malignant histopathologically. Ultrasonography features of 31 cytologically/histopathologically benign and five cytologically/histopathologically malignant nodules were compared. Prevalence of isoechoic nodules was higher in benign nodules (P = .025). Macrocalcification was observed in 4 (80.0%) of malignant and 10 (32.3%) of benign nodules (P = .042).In patients with a history of RAI treatment for hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules with suspicious ultrasonography features, particulary hypoechoic appearence and macrocalcification, should be evaluated with FNAB irrespective of the time elapsed after RAI treatment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667314>Proteome dataset of subcutaneous adipose tissue from postpartum cows treated with sodium salicylate.</a></h2><p>This article contains raw and processed data related to research published by Takiya et al.

Literature have shown that treatment with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent sodium salicylate () during the first days postpartum in dairy cows increased lactation performance [], and tended to alter glucose  [3]. Yet, the specific effects of systemic SS treatment on the proteome of the adipose tissue () and on the inflammatory process in AT of postpartum cows is unknown. Subcutaneous AT samples were collected at 7 d of lactation from control cows (n = 5) and from cows treated with .3 g/L SS (n = 5) via drinking water during the first 7 d of lactation. Protein extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were performed to obtain proteomics data. Differential abundance of proteins was determined through MS1 intensity based label-free method. Proteomics analysis generated a novel dataset consisted of 1422 proteins, 80 (5.6%) of which were differentially abundant [fold change ± 1.5,  < 0.05 -way ANOVA] when comparing control and SS-treated cows.

In the first study, RA subjects were matched by age, sex, and BMI with healthy adults. In the second, RA subjects were matched by sex and BMI to adults 10-20 years older. SMF, IMAT and SAT were measured with Computed Tomography images of the mid-thigh region. We used parametric or non-parametric related-samples tests to compare fat accumulation between RA subjects and healthy adults.In the first study SMF was significantly higher in the RA cohort compared to their age-matched healthy counterparts (mean difference = -3.5 HU (95% -6., -0.9), p = 0.011), but IMAT and SAT were similar between cohorts. In the second study, SMF, IMAT and SAT were not significantly different between the RA and matched older healthy cohorts. In both studies, there were no significant differences in mid-thigh muscle area between RA subjects and healthy adults.SMF accumulation in RA was higher than in healthy individuals of similar age, sex, BMI. Accumulation of fat within and around the muscles in RA was not different compared to the matched healthy older individuals, indicating that muscle fat accumulation in RA might mimic a pattern not different from healthy aging.Copyright © 2018.

However, the detailed clinical course of aspiration pneumonia in neonates and infants diagnosed with this disorder remains unclear. We report a case of a -yr-old girl diagnosed with MIRAGE syndrome during the early neonatal period. The patient developed 3 episodes of aspiration pneumonia until 4 mo of age, and this complication was attributed to esophageal hypoperistalsis secondary to achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux. Enteral feeding via a duodenal tube effectively prevented further episodes of aspiration pneumonia in this patient.2019©The Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671770>Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Dysregulation of Glucose : Beyond Weight Gain.</a></h2><p>Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia because of their high clinical efficacy. However, SGA treatment is associated with severe  alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that  changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the  disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the  side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668396>PAR2 controls cholesterol homeostasis and lipid  in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Increases in hepatic and plasma cholesterol occur in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the reason for this is not well understood. We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor  (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile acid output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/ as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related  conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate " were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, -methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) -6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body fat in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Resveratrol triggers signaling dependent on the protein kinase activated by adenosine monophosphate (AMPK), the sensor of cellular energy  that regulates autophagy, eliminates damaged mitochondria, and increases energy sources. In the present study, we investigated the participation of AMPK activation in the protective effect of resveratrol on cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity. We found that resveratrol increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in primary cultured neurons exposed to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Resveratrol (1.8 mg/Kg; i. v.; administered at the beginning of reperfusion) decreased the infarct area and increased survival of rats subjected to MCAO. In neuronal cultures, resveratrol treatment (40 μM, after excitotoxicity) reduced the production of superoxide anion, prevented the overload of intracellular Ca associated to mitochondrial failure, reduced the release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, and reduced death. It also promoted mitophagy (increased Beclin 1 level, favored the recruitment of LC3-II, reduced LAMP1, and reduced mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60 levels). In both models, inhibition of AMPK activation with Compound C obstructed the effect of resveratrol, showing that its protective effect depends, partially, on the activation of the AMPK/autophagy pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672442>Active pyruvate dehydrogenase and impaired gluconeogenesis in orthotopic hepatomas of rats.</a></h2><p>Therapies targeting altered activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) have been proposed for hepatomas. However, the activities of these  in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells.  of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and energy production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) /4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer , lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related  alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the cause of reduced myometrial P4 responsiveness that promotes contractions at labour is not fully determined. Uterine stretch occurs with advancing gestation but most in vitro experimental models do not take this into consideration. We aimed to examine whether tissue-level myometrial stretch influences the ability of P4 to regulate pro-labour protein abundance by using myometrial biopsies from term gestation pregnant women to assess the impact of 24 h exposure to combinations of (i) stretch-mediated tension, (ii) P4 (100 nM) and (iii) an anti-progestin, RU-486 (1 μM). Firstly, we observed baseline COX- and Cx43 protein levels increased, whereas P4 content along with calponin-1 and progesterone receptor (PR) protein abundance decreased, in vehicle-treated tissues. P4 supplementation subtly reduced COX- levels in un-stretched tissues. Spontaneous and oxytocin-augmented contractility were unchanged by tissue culture exposure to P4 and/or RU-486. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β; 1 ng/ml) enhanced COX- protein and PGE content in un-stretched tissues. Overall, tissue stretch may, in part, regulate P4-sensitive pro-labour protein levels, but this is likely to be reliant on interaction with other in utero factors that were absent in our tissue cultures. More complex culture conditions should be evaluated in future to aid further development of a physiologically relevant model to improve our understanding of in utero myometrial P4 responsiveness.Copyright © 2019.

Systematical investigating the regulatory mechanism of chloroplast development and chlorophyll (Chl) content variation is necessary for clarifying the photosynthesis mechanism for crops.This study aims to explore the critical regulatory mechanism of leaf color mutation in a yellow-green leaf sesame mutant Siyl-1.We performed the genetic analysis of the yellow-green leaf color mutation using the F population of the mutant Siyl-1. We compared the morphological structure of the chloroplasts, chlorophyll content of the three genotypes of the mutant F progeny. We performed the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (-DE) and compared the protein expression variation between the mutant progeny and the wild type.Genetic analysis indicated that there were 3 phenotypes of the F population of the mutant Siyl-1, i.e., YY type with light-yellow leaf color (lethal); Yy type with yellow-green leaf color, and yy type with normal green leaf color. The yellow-green mutation was controlled by an incompletely dominant nuclear gene, Siyl-1. Compared with the wild genotype, the chloroplast number and the morphological structure in YY and Yy mutant lines varied evidently. The chlorophyll content also significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The -DE comparison showed that there were 98 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among YY, Yy, and yy lines. All the 98 DEPs were classified into 5 functional groups. Of which 82.7% DEPs proteins belonged to the photosynthesis and energy  group.The results revealed the genetic character of yellow-green leaf color mutant Siyl-1. 98 DEPs were found in YY and Yy mutant compared with the wild genotype.

Furthermore, expression of -related markers was correlated with mutational status to examine mutations associated with rewired tumor .Mutation analysis was performed for 97 tumors. Glucose and glutamine -related marker expression was measured by immunofluorescent staining (protein) and qPCR (mRNA) (n = 81).Glutamine -related markers were significantly higher in adeno- than squamous cell NSCLCs. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression was higher in solid compared to lepidic adenocarcinomas (P < 0.01). In adenocarcinomas, mRNA expression of glutamine transporter SLC1A5 correlated with tumor size (r(p) = 0.41, P = 0.005). Furthermore, SLC1A5 protein expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas with worse pTNM stage (r(s) = 0.39, P = 0.009). EGFR-mutated tumors showed lower GLUT1 protein (P = 0.017), higher glutaminase  (GLS2) protein (P = 0.025) and higher GLS2 mRNA expression (P = 0.004), compared to EGFR wild-type tumors. GLS mRNA expression was higher in KRAS-mutated tumors (P = 0.019). TP53-mutated tumors showed higher GLUT1 expression (P = 0.009).NSCLC is a heterogeneous disease, with differences in mutational status and -related marker expression between adeno- and squamous cell NSCLCs, and also within adenocarcinoma subtypes. GLUT1 and SLC1A5 expression correlate with aggressive tumor behavior in adenocarcinomas but not in squamous cell NSCLCs. Therefore, these markers could steer treatment modification for subgroups of adenocarcinoma patients. TP53, EGFR and KRAS mutations are associated with expression of glucose and glutamine -related markers in NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

Ten Italian Simmental calves were used for the experiment and were offered 6 L of bulk whole milk/d from an open-bucket starting at day  from birth and through 5 weeks. Blood samples were collected at birth and weekly to assess biochemical indicators related to energy  and liver function, minerals, markers of inflammation, and oxidative stress. Body weight (BW), heart girth (HG), and solid feed intake were positively affected by aging. Calves increased solid feed intake consumption after  week and reached a BW gain of 28.16 kg at 5 weeks. Most of blood biomarkers were affected by age, mostly concerned the period after birth and day 1, whereas no changes were observed for haptoglobin, urea, β-hydroxybutyrate, Na, and K. The amount of milk fed to calves throughout this study contributes to the maintenance of glucose concentration over time, coupled also with a considerable amount of starter intake. Glucose levels associated to the high ADG (0.89 ± 0.09 kg/d, mean ± SEM) suggest that calves experienced a positive energy balance throughout the entire pre-weaning period. Similar levels of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, together with a gradual increase of albumin, reflect good liver functionality and a stable condition regarding the inflammatory status. These results suggest that blood biomarkers of Simmental calves in the pre-weaning phase vary with growing stages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While there is strong evidence for a diurnal (i.e. 24-h) rhythmicity of the expression of prepro-orexin (PPO) and its cleavage products, orexin A and B, it is not known whether orexin receptors are also subject to diurnal regulation. Here we ask whether besides the regulation of PPO the expression of the orexin receptor subtypes OXR and OXR varies over 24 hours in the mouse brain. The mRNA levels of PPO, OXR, and OXR as well as of various clock genes were analyzed over 24 hours in the hypothalamus, cortex, and adrenal glands of male mice using qPCR. We found a significant diurnal regulation of the mRNA levels of PPO as well as both orexin receptor subtypes in the brain, while no regulation was observed in adrenal glands. While in the cortex the mRNA levels of both OXR and OXR showed a significant diurnal regulation, in the hypothalamus, only the OXR mRNA expression was subject to a diurnal rhythm. The expression of both orexin receptor subtypes significantly correlated with that of clock genes. Remarkably, the expression pattern of OXR showed a strong and highly significant correlation with that of the clock gene Bmal1 in the cortex and hypothalamus. These results suggest that the rhythmic expression of orexin receptors is linked to clock gene expression and that OXR may potentially play a role in the timing of sleep-wake behavior.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti-obesity treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in obesity and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of obesity is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent  involved in bodyweight homeostasis and Obesity.To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE  cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced obesity models compared to controls, ) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, 5) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by  cues and involved in  receptor endocytosis. C2CD5 represent a new target and pathway that could be targeted in Obesity.Copyright © 2019.

So far, the lack of genomic resources has hindered further research on revealing the immunological characteristics of T. sinensis in response to TSHSV. In the present study, we performed a transcriptome analysis from the lungs of T. sinensis challenged by TSHSV using Illumina-based RNA-Seq. The validity of transcriptomic data was confirmed with the gradual increase of TSHSV RNA copies detected in lung. A total of 103079339 clean reads were generated, and 58374764 unique mapped reads were analyzed. Assembly of the sequence data allowed identifying 16383 unigenes consisting of 36 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were categorized into 30 GO-enriched bioprocesses and 9 KEGG . The combinational analysis of GO-enriched bioprocesses and KEGG  demonstrated that TSHSV modulated several immune genes of T. sinensis related to various biological processes, including virus recognition (RIG-I/MDA-5), immune initiation (IFIT-1 and IFIT-5), endocytosis (CUBN, ENPP2 and LRP2) and steroid  (FCNIL and STAR). In summary, the finding of this study revealed several immune  and candidated genes involved in the immune response of T. sinensis against TSHSV-infection. These results will provide helpful information to investigate molecular mechanism of T. sinensis in response to TSHSV.Copyright © 2019.

The relationship between cannabinoid system and nesfatin-1 levels remains to be elucidated. This study investigated nesfatin-1 and insulin resistance in 72-h rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-deprived mice under the effects of cannabinoid, and cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R blocking. Sixty mice were exposed to 72-h sleep deprivation. Groups and drug administrations were as follows: Group 1 (control) received injection of vehicle. Group  received WIN 55,212,. Group 3 received AM251 (CB1R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212, injection. Group 4 received SR144528 (CB2R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212, injection. Group 5 received only AM251. Group 6 received only SR144528. Blood samples were collected 1 h after drug administration and prepared for biochemical measurements. Glucose levels were measured by glucometer, whereas insulin and nesfatin-1 levels were measured by ELISA. Central nesfatin-1 was also assessed using immunohistochemistry. One-way analysis of variance together with post hoc Tukey's test was used for inter-group comparisons. Serum nesfatin-1 levels were comparable in all study groups. Brain nesfatin-1 immune-positive cell count was lower in WIN group compared to controls. The administration of CB1R or CB2R antagonist prevented reduction in nesfatin-1-positive cell count. Insulin resistance was higher in WINCB2 and CB2 groups than in control and WINCB1 groups. Cannabinoid treatment reduced nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity in the central nervous system and this effect was prevented by either CB1R or CB2R antagonist pretreatment. Insulin resistance might be related to CB2 receptor activation which was independent from central nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677263>Sugar sensing responses to low and high light in leaves of the C4 model grass Setaria viridis.</a></h2><p>Although sugar regulate photosynthesis, the signalling  underlying this process remain elusive, especially for C4 crops. To address this knowledge gap and identify potential candidate genes, we treated Setaria viridis (C4 model) plants acclimated to medium light intensity (ML, 500 µmol m- s-1) with low (LL, 50 µmol m- s-1) or high (HL, 1000 µmol m- s-1) light for 4 days and observed the consequences on carbon  and the transcriptome of source leaves. LL impaired photosynthesis and reduced leaf content of signalling sugars (glucose, sucrose and trehalose-6-phosphate). Contrastingly, HL strongly induced sugar accumulation without repressing photosynthesis. LL more profoundly impacted leaf transcriptome, including photosynthetic genes. LL and HL contrastingly altered the expression of HXK and SnRK1 sugar sensors and trehalose pathway genes. The expression of key target genes of HXK and SnRK1 were affected by LL and sugar depletion, while surprisingly HL and strong sugar accumulation only slightly repressed the SnRK1 signalling pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LL profoundly impacted photosynthesis and the transcriptome of S. viridis source leaves, while HL altered sugar levels more than LL. We also present the first evidence that sugar signalling  in C4 source leaves may respond to light intensity and sugar accumulation differently to C3 source leaves.© The Author(s) 2019.

Multifaceted lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise are recommended as the first-line treatment for the  syndrome.To investigate the effects of lifestyle interventions that include both diet interventions and supervised exercise on outcomes for people with  syndrome.A systematic review and meta-regression was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from the earliest date possible until November 2018 to identify randomised controlled trials examining the effects of lifestyle interventions compared to usual care on patient health outcomes and components of  syndrome. Post-intervention means and standard deviations were pooled using inverse variance methods and random-effects models to calculate mean differences (MD), standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Searching identified 2598 articles, of which 15 articles reporting data from 10 trials, with 1160 participants were included in this review. Compared to usual care, supervised lifestyle intervention demonstrated significant improvements in all but one of the components of  syndrome. Reductions were seen in waist circumference (-4.9 cm, 95%CI -8.0 to -1.7), systolic blood pressure (-6.5 mmHg, 95%CI -10.7 to -.3), diastolic blood pressure (-1.9 mmHg, 95%CI -3.6 to -0.), triglycerides (SMD -0.46, 95%CI -0.88 to -0.04) and fasting glucose (SMD -0.68, 95%CI -1.20 to -0.15). Prevalence of  syndrome was reduced by 39% in intervention group participants compared to control group participants (Risk Ratio 0.61, 95%CI 0.38 to 0.96). Improvements in quality of life were not statistically significant.There is low to moderate quality evidence that supervised multifaceted lifestyle intervention improves multiple risk factors of  syndrome, as well as reducing prevalence of the disease. Health services should consider implementing lifestyle intervention programs for people with  syndrome to improve health outcomes and prevent progression to chronic disease.Crown Copyright © 2019.

As gut microbial imbalances and maladaptive host responses have been implicated in the pathology of obesity and diabetes, this study aimed to determine the effects of pharmacologically stimulated GLP-1 and GLP- receptor function on the gut microbiome composition in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice received treatment with a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide, 0. mg/kg, BID) or dual GLP-1/GLP- receptor agonist (GUB09-145, 0.04 mg/kg, BID) for 4 weeks. Both compounds suppressed caloric intake, promoted a marked weight loss, improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. 16S rDNA sequencing and deep-sequencing shotgun metagenomics was applied for comprehensive within-subject profiling of changes in gut microbiome signatures. Compared to baseline, DIO mice assumed phylogenetically similar gut bacterial compositional changes following liraglutide and GUB09-145 treatment, characterized by discrete shifts in low-abundant species and related bacterial  . The microbiome alterations may potentially associate to the converging biological actions of GLP-1 and GLP- receptor signaling on caloric intake, glucose  and lipid handling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673062>Reticular Dysgenesis and Mitochondriopathy Induced by Adenylate Kinase  Deficiency with Atypical Presentation.</a></h2><p>Reticular dysgenesis is an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that usually manifests in newborns. It is a unique example of an immune deficiency that is linked to dysfunctional mitochondrial energy  and caused by adenylate kinase  (AK2) deficiency. It is characterized by an early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage, impaired lymphoid maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. In this study, a novel AK2 homozygous mutation, c.622 T > C [p.Ser208Pro], was identified in an Old Order Amish patient through whole exome sequencing. Functional studies showed that the patient's cells have no detectable AK2 protein, as well as low oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and proton production rate (PPR). An increased production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and mitochondrial mass, and decreased ATP production, were also observed. The results confirm the pathogenicity of the AK2 mutation and demonstrate that reticular dysgenesis should be considered in Amish individuals presenting with immune deficiency. We also describe other pathophysiological aspects of AK2 deficiency not previously reported.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674057>Herbal medicine in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders: A systematic review with meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>The efficacy of herbal medicines (HMs) for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD) and functional constipation (FC) is controversial. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to determine their effectiveness for FGIDs.We searched the following electronic databases till July 2019 with English language restriction: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PUBMED. Randomized double-blind controlled trials of HMs compared with placebo or conventional pharmacological drugs for adult FGIDs patients were included.In total, 49 trials involving 7396 participants with FGIDs were included. The risk of bias was low in 9, unclear in 36, and high in 4 trials. More than 33 different herbal formulae were tested. HMs demonstrated statistically significant benefits for symptom improvement compared with placebo in 46 trials (RR= 1.67, 95% CI 1.48-1.88). When compared with conventional pharmacological therapy in 5 trials, HMs were found to be non-inferior (RR= 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18). The number of trials with regards to FD, IBS and FC were 19, 23 and 7 respectively. Subgroup analysis found that HMs were better than placebo in alleviating symptoms for FD (RR= 1.50, 95% CI 1.32-1.69), IBS (RR= 1.62, 95% CI 1.32-1.97) and FC (RR= 3.83, 95% CI .26-6.50). HMs tended to have more patients with adverse events than placebo, but similar to conventional pharmacological drugs.Our findings provide a positive signal for HMs as a potentially well-tolerated and effective treatment for FGIDs, deserving further examination in high-quality trials.This article is protected by copyright.

Male miniature pigs were fed a diet containing 10%SOY, 9%CAN+1%SOY, or 9%HSO+1%SOY for 18 months. The scheduled autopsies revealed no abnormalities in histopathological examination of the major organs, except the testes. Atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and hyperplasia in the Leydig cells were found in the SOY and CAN groups. DNA microarray analysis indicated downregulation in the CAN and the HSO groups of genes encoding for gonadotropins in the pituitary gland and of enzymes and proteins involved in steroid hormone  in the testes, compared to the SOY group. Plasma levels of sex hormones in the CAN and HSO groups tended to be higher and testosterone and dihydrotestosteorne in the HSO group were significantly higher than in the SOY group. These results demonstrate that testes are morphologically and functionally affected by the dietary oils, while the plasma steroid hormone levels do not necessarily reflect the gene expression, probably owing to feedback regulation via the gonadal hormones in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.Copyright © 2019.

In the present study, pyriproxyfen was used as a pivot/template to search the database of the Maybridge Database for potential inhibitors of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase and juvenile hormone as well. The initial virtual screening based on the 3D shape resulted in 2000 molecules with Tanimoto index ranging from 0.58-0.88. A new reclassification was performed on the overlapping of positive and negative charges, which resulted in 100 molecules with Tanimoto's electrostatic score ranging from 0.627-0.87. Using parameters related to Absorption, Distribution,  and Excretion and the pivot molecule, the molecules selected in the previous stage were evaluated regarding these criteria, and 21 were then selected. The pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties were considered and for 12 molecules the DEREK software not fired any alert of toxicity, which were thus considered satisfactory for prediction of biological activity using the web server PASS.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

Due to its pathological similarities to type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), such as β-amyloid deposition, oxidative stress, inflammation, disordered glucose , impaired signaling  of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), we speculate that AD is another form of brain diabetes. Clarifying the relationship between T2DM and AD is important for us to better understand the exact pathological mechanisms of AD. Silibinin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts hepatoprotective, anti- diabetic and neuroprotective effects. Streptozotocin (STZ), which is used to disrupt the insulin signal transduction pathway, could well mimic the sporadic AD models by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Therefore, we selected ICV injection of STZ (ICV-STZ) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of silibinin in rats and to make a foundation for further exploring the relationship between AD and T2DM. ICV-STZ obviously caused memory damage, sharply reduced the number of nissl bodies and destroyed morphological structure of hippocampal neuronal cells, while silibinin attenuated the damages. Moreover, silibinin significantly decreased STZ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation (ser404) in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, markedly inhibited apoptosis of neurons induced by STZ, and up-regulated insulin signal transduction pathway. Silibinin exerts neuroprotective effect in STZ-treated rats, indicating the potential of silibinin for the treatment of AD patients with T2DM in future.Copyright © 2019.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) impair cellular function by oxidizing cell components containing proteins, lipids, and DNA. Tumor oxidant status is elevated due to high  activity under influence of abnormal growth factors, cytokines and function ROS-producing enzymes, including nitric oxide synthases, cyclooxygenases, and lipoxygenases. Nuclear factor-erythroid -related factor  (NRF2) is a transcriptional master regulator element which is believed to recognize cellular oxidative stress followed by binding to promoter of cyto-protective and anti-oxidative genes to maintain cellular redox status through promoting antioxidant response participants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, ferritin, NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1). However, Nrf2 signaling protects malignant cells from ROS damage against tumor growth and chemoresistance. In addition, Nrf2 is able to participate in differentiation of certain stem cells by modulating autophagy procedure, also NRF2 provokes DNA damage response and facilitates drug  and drug resistance by controlling of downstream enzyme and transporter members. In this review, we discuss the role of NRF2 in stemness, self-renewal ability, tumorigenesis and chemoresistance of CSCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, disruption of the plasma membrane poses a critical risk to cells, which requires immediate repair to avoid uncontrolled osmotic lysis and cell death. The initial repair response to stop the leakage usually occurs within 10-45 s and implicates Ca-activated phospholipid-binding proteins including annexins. We previously reported that annexin-induced curvature of lateral membrane around the hole plays an important role for immediate resealing of human cancer cells. Once the breach has been sealed, the cell often regenerates itself by removing the damaged membrane. This process, which also involves annexins includes excision and shedding of damaged membrane implicating the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) III and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Hence, studies of cell membrane repair mechanisms should differentiate between the immediate repair response happening within seconds and the subsequent regeneration phase, which occurs in the order of minutes to hours after injury.© 2019 The Author(s).

Insulin, which is produced by β-pancreatic cells, is a chief orchestrator of glucose , regulating its consumption within cells, which leads to energy generation or storage as glycogen. Abnormally lower insulin secretion from β-cells, insulin insensitivity, and insulin tolerance lead to higher plasma glucose levels, resulting in  complications. The last century has witnessed extraordinary efforts by the scientific community to develop anti-diabetic drugs, and these efforts yielded the discovery of exogenous insulin and various classes of oral anti-diabetic drugs.Despite these exhaustive anti-diabetic pharmaceutical and therapeutic efforts, long-term glycemic control, hypoglycemic crisis, safety issues, large-scale economic burden, side effects remain core problems.The last decade has witnessed the development of various new classes of anti-diabetic drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles.

In vitro assay platforms such as primary hepatocyte and immortalized liver-derived cell lines have been developed to evaluate drug effects. However, several limitations have been suggested regarding discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo assays. In this study, we aimed to investigate drug  and toxicity based on mouse small intestinal and liver organoids derived from resident stem cells. At first, expressions and activities of CYP subfamilies (CYPs) in intestinal and liver organoids were investigated. Organoids treated with three CYPs-inducers dexamethasone (Dex), β-naphthoflavone (BNF), and 1,4-bis--(3, 5-dichloropyridyloxy)-benzene (TCPOBOP) were evaluated for CYPs activities. The CYPs-induced intestinal and liver organoids were confirmed to digest more docetaxel, as colon cancer cell-line survived more in CYPs-induced organoid's medium than in non-induced organoid's medium. Then, the activity of docetaxel in a co-culture platform of mouse liver organoids and human pancreatic tumoroids was measured. We obtained significant statistical values on CYPs-induced  activities: cell survival rates of pancreatic tumoroids co-cultured with docetaxel-treated undifferentiated, differentiated, and CYPs-induced differentiated organoids were 66.05 ± .14%, 89.20 ± .67%, and 101.90 ± 0.94%, respectively. To sum up, gene expression modification and drug  evaluation were able to be done with organoids as done with tissues.

Asc's ability to reduce metals makes it an essential enzyme co-factor. Recent Advances: The ability of Asc to act as a reductant also plays an important part in its overall role in iron , where Asc induces both non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) and transferrin-bound iron uptake at physiological concentrations (~ 50 µM). Moreover, Asc has emerged to play an important role in multiple diseases and its effects at pharmacological doses could be important for their treatment.Ascorbate's role as a regulator of cellular iron  along with its cytotoxic effects and different roles at pharmacological concentrations makes it a candidate as an anti-cancer agent. Ever since the controversy regarding the studies from the Mayo Clinic were finally explained, there has been a renewed interest in using Asc as a therapeutic approach towards cancer due to its minimal side effects. Numerous studies have been able to demonstrate the anti-cancer activity of Asc through selective oxidative stress towards cancer cells via H2O2-generation at pharmacological concentrations. Studies have demonstrated that Asc's cytotoxic mechanism at concentrations (>1 mM) has been associated with decreased cellular iron uptake.Recent studies have also suggested other mechanisms, such as Asc's effects on autophagy, polyamine , the cell cycle, etc. Clearly, more has yet to be discovered about Asc's mechanism of action to facilitate safe and effective treatment options for cancer and other diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669830>Differential expression of structural and functional proteins during bean common mosaic virus-host plant interaction.</a></h2><p>Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), the most common seed-borne pathogen in Phaseolus vulgaris L. is known to cause severe loss in productivity across the globe.

We also highlight physiological aspects of glycogen  that limit the conditions under which glycogen  can be useful or advantageous over glucose . Comparisons with glycogen  in skeletal muscle provide an additional perspective on potential functions of glycogen in brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676333>Effects of feeding and digestion on myocardial contractility and expression of calcium-handling proteins in Burmese pythons (Python molurus).</a></h2><p>Pythons are important models of studies on postprandial  because their physiological responses are exacerbated when digesting large prey. Prior studies of these animals have shown hypertrophy of the cardiac tissue  to 3 days after feeding, coinciding with the peak of the specific dynamic action (SDA), but the consequences of this remodeling in myocardial contractility have not been studied, which is the purpose of this work. Specimens of Python molurus were divided into two groups: a Digesting group ( days after feeding, at the peak of SDA), and a Fasting group (28 days after feeding). When compared to the Fasting group, the Digesting group showed higher relative ventricular mass and calcium-handling protein expression such as sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB), and the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX). Digesting pythons also exhibited significant increases in the cardiac contraction force (Fc), rates of force development and relaxation, and cardiac pumping capacity. Therefore, the higher SERCA, PLB and NCX expression levels increased cytosolic Ca transient amplitude, improving myofilament force. These changes are crucial to maintain cardiac output and a relatively high and continuous blood flow required by  expenditure that occurs in postprandial animals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We recruited relatives of the identified carriers and showed that protection was associated with better insulin secretion due to enhanced glucose responsiveness and proinsulin conversion, particularly when compared with individuals matched for the genotype of a common T2D-risk allele in SLC30A8, p.Arg325. In genome-edited human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived β-like cells, we establish that the p.Arg138* allele results in reduced SLC30A8 expression due to haploinsufficiency. In human β cells, loss of SLC30A8 leads to increased glucose responsiveness and reduced K channel function similar to isolated islets from carriers of the T2D-protective allele p.Trp325.

In Cushing's disease, mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) have been detected. These mutations are associated with hyperactivation of USP8 that prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation. This leads to increased EGFR stability and results in the maintenance of EGFR signaling in Cushing's disease. USP8 inhibitors can suppress the growth of various tumors. In this study, the effects of a potent USP8 inhibitor, DUBs-IN-, on ACTH production and cell proliferation were examined in mouse corticotroph tumor (AtT-20) cells. Proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) mRNA levels and ACTH levels were decreased in AtT-20 cells by DUBs-IN-. Further, cell proliferation was inhibited, and apoptosis was induced by DUBs-IN-. Transcript levels of pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (Pttg1), a pituitary tumor growth marker, were increased; and transcript levels of stress response growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (Gadd45β) and Cdk5 and ABL enzyme substrate 1 (Cables1) mRNA levels were increased in response to the drug. Gadd45β or Cables1 knockdown partially inhibited the DUBs-IN--induced decrease in cell proliferation, but not Pomc mRNA levels. Both GADD45β and CABLES1 may be responsible, at least in part, for the USP8-induced suppression of corticotroph tumor cell proliferation. USP-8 may be a new treatment target in Cushing's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676093>PM aggravates diabetes via the systemically activated IL-6-mediated STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in rats' liver.</a></h2><p>PM exposure aggravates type  diabetes, in which inflammatory factors play an important role. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for aggravating diabetes after PM exposure, and study the roles of inflammatory factors in insulin-resistant type  diabetes. Our study indicated that short-time PM exposure enhances insulin resistance in type  diabetic rats and significantly raises inflammatory factors, including IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1, in lungs. However, we found that of these inflammatory factors only IL-6 levels are elevated in blood, liver, adipose tissue, and macrophages, but not in skeletal muscle. IL-6 induced activation of the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver, but not other downstream  including STAT1, ERK1/, and PI3K. Both STAT3 inhibition and IL-6 neutralization effectively alleviated the disorders of glucose  after PM exposure. Taken together, this suggests that the systemic increase in IL-6 may play an important role in the deterioration of the type  diabetes via IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver after short-time exposure to PM. Besides, we unexpectedly found a stronger resistance to the PM exposure-induced increase in IL-6 in skeleton muscle than those of many other tissues.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Military Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

Insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein  in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at 0 min (post-absorptive), 120 min and 300 min relative to the ingestion of 170 g pork loin (36 g protein and 5 g fat) to examine skeletal muscle protein signalling, plasma proteomic signatures, and whole-body phenylalanine disappearance rates (R).Phenylalanine R was not different in obese compared to lean individuals at all time points and was not responsive to a pork ingestion (basal, P = .056; 120 & 300 min, P > .05). IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle. In addition, proteomic analysis showed no differences in proteomic signatures between obese, overweight or lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Bioremediation by microorganisms can be used as a potential treatment to remove this pollutant. In this work, a consortium of two microorganisms, Arthrospira maxima and Chlorella vulgaris, was employed to remove 4-NP from water. The parameters analyzed included cell growth, removal of 4-NP, and 4-NP remnant in the biomass. In addition, the metabolites produced in the process by this consortium were identified. It was found that C. vulgaris is more resistant to 4-NP than A. maxima (cell growth inhibition by 4-NP of 99%). The consortium used in this study had an IC greater than any strain of microalgae or cyanobacteria reported for 4-NP removal (9.29 mg/L) and reduced up to 96% of 4-NP in water in the first 48 h of culture. It was also observed that there is a bio-transformation of 4-NP, comparable with the process carried out by another bacterium, in which three similar metabolites were found (4-(1-methyl-octyl)-4-hydroxy-cyclohex--enone, 4-nonyl-4-hydroxy-ciclohexa-,5-dienone and 4-nonyl-4-hydroxy- ciclohex--enone) and one that is similar to plant  (4-nonyl-(1-methyl,6,8-metoxy)-hydroxybenzene).

ASD risk is thought to arise from both genetic and environmental factors, with the perinatal period as a critical window. Understanding early transcriptional changes in ASD would assist in clarifying disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers. However, little is known about umbilical cord blood gene expression profiles in babies later diagnosed with ASD compared to non-typically developing and non-ASD (Non-TD) or typically developing (TD) children.Genome-wide transcript levels were measured by Affymetrix Human Gene .0 array in RNA from cord blood samples from both the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) high-risk pregnancy cohorts that enroll younger siblings of a child previously diagnosed with ASD. Younger siblings were diagnosed based on assessments at 36 months, and 59 ASD, 92 Non-TD, and 120 TD subjects were included. Using both differential expression analysis and weighted gene correlation network analysis, gene expression between ASD and TD, and between Non-TD and TD, was compared within each study and via meta-analysis.While cord blood gene expression differences comparing either ASD or Non-TD to TD did not reach genome-wide significance, 172 genes were nominally differentially expressed between ASD and TD cord blood (log(fold change) > 0.1,  < 0.01). These genes were significantly enriched for functions in xenobiotic , chromatin regulation, and systemic lupus erythematosus (FDR  < 0.05). In contrast, 66 genes were nominally differentially expressed between Non-TD and TD, including 8 genes that were also differentially expressed in ASD. Gene coexpression modules were significantly correlated with demographic factors and cell type proportions.ASD-associated gene expression differences identified in this study are subtle, as cord blood is not the main affected tissue, it is composed of many cell types, and ASD is a heterogeneous disorder.This is the first study to identify gene expression differences in cord blood specific to ASD through a meta-analysis across two prospective pregnancy cohorts.

Our objective was to assess the longitudinal associations of soluble CD163 (sCD163), a novel biomarker of ATM activation, with insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and dysglycemia in high-risk subjects.Adults at-risk for type  diabetes in PROMISE had three assessments over 6 years (n=408). sCD163 was measured using fasting serum. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by HOMA2-%S and the Matsuda index (ISI). β-cell function was determined by insulinogenic index (IGI) over HOMA-IR and ISSI-. Incident dysglycemia was defined as the onset of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type  diabetes. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) evaluated longitudinal associations of sCD163 with insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and incident dysglycemia adjusting for demographic and lifestyle covariates. Areas under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AROC) tested whether sCD163 improved dysglycemia prediction in a clinical model.Longitudinal analyses showed significant inverse associations between sCD163 and insulin sensitivity (% difference per SD increase of sCD163 for HOMA2-%S (β=-7.01, 95% CI -12.26 to -1.44) and ISI (β=-7.60, 95% CI -11.09 to -3.97) and β-cell function (ISSI- (β=-4.67, 95 %CI -8.59 to -0.58) and IGI/HOMA-IR (β=-8.75, 95% CI -15.42 to -1.56)).

The majority believed that nitrate consumption can improve sports performance (59%) and reduce blood pressure (54%), but were unsure about effects on cognitive function (71%), kidney function (80%) and cancer risk (70%). Knowledge of dietary sources of nitrate and factors affecting its content in food were generally good (41%-79% of participants providing correct answers). However, most participants were unsure of the average population intake (65%) and the acceptable daily intake (64%) of nitrate. Most participants (65%) recognised at least one compound (ie, nitric oxide or nitrosamines) that is derived from dietary nitrate in the body. Knowledge of nitrate, quantified by a 23-point index created by summing correct responses, was greater in individuals with a PhD (p=0.01; median (IQR)=13 (9-17)) and tended to be better in respondents with a masters degree (p=0.054; 13 (8-15)) compared with undergraduate-level qualifications (10 (-14)).UK-based nutrition professionals demonstrated mixed knowledge about the physiology of dietary nitrate, which was better in participants with higher education. More efficient dissemination of current knowledge about inorganic nitrate and its effects on health to nutrition professionals will support them to make more informed recommendations about consumption of this compound.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This challenge may theoretically be resolved if the oxidation process can be characterized by a distinct dual isotope enrichment. In this work, we aimed to explore the carbon and chlorine isotope effects associated with TCE oxidation by a variety of oxygenases. These included pure strains and enrichment cultures of methane, toluene and ammonia oxidizers, as well as experiments with crude extracts. Isotope effects determined for TCE oxidation by toluene and ammonia oxidizers were mostly in line with expected values for epoxidation mechanism (ϵC -11.0 ± 0.7 to -24.8 ± 0.‰ and ϵCl +0.9 ± 0.5 to +1.0 ± 0.4‰), whereas, the methanotrophs resulted in distinctively different isotope effects (ϵC -.4 ± 0.4 to -3.4 ± 0.8‰ and ϵCl -1.8 ± 0. to -.9 ± 0.9‰). It is suggested that in TCE oxidation by methanotrophs, substrate binding rather than bond cleavage is rate limiting, leading to this unexpected isotope effect. On the environmental level, our results imply that the oxidative process can be differentiated if catalyzed by toluene and ammonia oxidizers or by methanotrophs. Additionally, the oxidative process can be distinguished from the reductive one. However, using dual isotope analysis in the field may result in an under-estimation of the overall co- process if methanotrophs are to be excluded due to low isotope effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although studies look into xenobiotic biotransformation by Tsukamurella isolates, the relevant enzymes remain uncharacterized. We investigated the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme family, known for its role in the xenobiotic  of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Xenobiotic sensitivity of Tsukamurella paurometabola type strain DSM 20162 was assessed, followed by cloning, recombinant expression and functional characterization of its single NAT homolog (TSUPD)NAT1. The bacterium appeared quite robust against chloroanilines, but more sensitive to 4-anisidine and -aminophenol. However,  activity was not evident towards those compounds, presumably due to mechanisms protecting cells from xenobiotic entry. Of the pharmaceutical arylhydrazines tested, hydralazine was toxic, but the bacterium was less sensitive to isoniazid, a drug targeting mycolic acid biosynthesis in mycobacteria. Although (TSUPD)NAT1 protein has an atypical Cys-His-Glu (instead of the expected Cys-His-Asp) catalytic triad, it is enzymatically active, suggesting that this deviation is likely due to evolutionary adaptation potentially serving a different function. The protein was indeed found to use malonyl-CoA, instead of the archetypal acetyl-CoA, as its preferred donor substrate. Malonyl-CoA is important for microbial biosynthesis of fatty acids (including mycolic acids) and polyketide chains, and the corresponding enzymatic systems have common evolutionary histories, also linked to xenobiotic .

A central function of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, known as mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondria maintain oxidative phosphorylation by creating a membrane potential gradient that is generated by the electron transport chain to drive the synthesis of ATP. Mitochondria are essential for tumour initiation and maintaining tumour cell growth in cell culture and xenografts. However, our understanding of oxidative mitochondrial  in cancer is limited because most studies have been performed in vitro in cell culture models. This highlights a need for in vivo studies to better understand how oxidative  supports tumour growth. Here we measure mitochondrial membrane potential in non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo using a voltage-sensitive, positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer known as 4-[F]fluorobenzyl-triphenylphosphonium (F-BnTP).

A face-centered central composite design was adopted to observe the effects of different formulation variables on TBN-BLS, and artificial neural network (ANN) modeling was employed to optimize TBN-BLS. TBN-BLS were prepared by a thin film hydration method integrating soybean phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol as a lipid phase and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) as a surfactant with or without the coating of chitosan (CTS). After being subjected to physicochemical characterization, TBN-BLS were enrolled in a histopathological study and pharmacokinetic investigation in a rat model. The optimized TBN chitosan-coated bilosomes (TBN-CTS-BLS) were spherical vesicles (245.13 ± 10.23 nm) with adequate entrapment efficiency (65.25 ± 5.51%) and good permeation characteristics (340.11 ± 22.34 μg/cm). The TBN-CTS-BLS gel formulation was well-tolerated with no inflammatory signs manifested upon histopathological evaluation. The pharmacokinetic study revealed that the optimized TBN-CTS-BLS formulation successively enhanced the bioavailability of TBN by about .33-fold and increased t to about 6.21 ± 0.24 h as compared to the oral solution. These findings support the prospect use of BLS as active and safe transdermal carrier for TBN in the treatment of asthma.

Our objective is to describe the theory of the novel hormonal conditioning mechanism using the findings from the EROS study.In this cross-sectional study, we selected 25 healthy athletes (ATL) and 12 non-physically active healthy controls (NPAC), 18-50 years old, males, with BMI 20-30 kg/m, with similar baseline characteristics, who underwent gold-standard exercise-independent tests: cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) and insulin tolerance test (ITT), to evaluate cortisol response to CST, and ACTH, cortisol, GH, and prolactin responses to an ITT.Responses to ITT were significantly earlier and higher in ATL than NPAC for cortisol [Mean ± SD: 21.7 ± 3.1 vs 16.9 ± 4.1 μg/dL; p < 0.001], GH [Median (95% CI): 12.73 (1.1-38.1) vs 4.80 (0.33-27.36) μg/L; p = 0.015], and prolactin [24.3 (10.5-67.45) vs 10.50 (6.21-43.44) ng/mL; p = 0.002]. Cortisol response to CST was similar between ATL and NPAC. During ITT, cortisol, GH, and ACTH mean increase in ATL were 52., 265., and 18.6% higher than NPAC, respectively. Prolactin response was absent in NPAC, while present in ATL.We found sufficient evidence to propose the existence of a diffuse enhancement of the hypothalamic-pituitary activity in athletes, not restricted to any axis, showing an intrinsic and independent process of "hormonal conditioning" in athletes, similar to those observed in the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. This novel conditioning process may be the missing link for understanding the improved responses observed in athletes to harmful situations, traumas, infections, inflammations, and psychiatric conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665017>Treatment failure and hospital readmissions in severe COPD exacerbations treated with azithromycin versus placebo - a post-hoc analysis of the BACE randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>In the BACE trial, a 3-month (3 m) intervention with azithromycin, initiated at the onset of an infectious COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization, decreased the rate of a first treatment failure (TF); the composite of treatment intensification (TI), step-up in hospital care (SH) and mortality.(1) To investigate the intervention's effect on recurrent events, and () to identify clinical subgroups most likely to benefit, determined from the incidence rate of TF and hospital readmissions.Enrolment criteria included the diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years and ≥ 1 exacerbation in the previous year. Rate ratio (RR) calculations, subgroup analyses and modelling of continuous variables using splines were based on a Poisson regression model, adjusted for exposure time.Azithromycin significantly reduced TF by 24% within 3 m (RR = 0.76, 95%CI:0.59;0.97, p = 0.031) through a 50% reduction in SH (RR = 0.50, 95%CI:0.30;0.81, p = 0.006), which comprised of a 53% reduction in hospital readmissions (RR = 0.47, 95%CI:0.27;0.80; p = 0.007). A significant interaction between the intervention, CRP and blood eosinophil count at hospital admission was found, with azithromycin significantly reducing hospital readmissions in patients with high CRP (> 50 mg/L, RR = 0.18, 95%CI:0.05;0.60, p = 0.005), or low blood eosinophil count (<300cells/μL, RR = 0.33, 95%CI:0.17;0.64, p = 0.001). No differences were observed in treatment response by age, FEV1, CRP or blood eosinophil count in continuous analyses.This post-hoc analysis of the BACE trial shows that azithromycin initiated at the onset of an infectious COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization reduces the incidence rate of TF within 3 m by preventing hospital readmissions. In patients with high CRP or low blood eosinophil count at admission this treatment effect was more pronounced, suggesting a potential role for these biomarkers in guiding azithromycin therapy.ClinicalTrials.gov number.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and microbiota in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h2><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P. clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, , 5 and 10 mg/L) of cadmium (Cd). We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and microbiota in P. clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P. clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal microbiota in P. clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the  related to , diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal microbiota composition and functions of P. clarkii. Our study can be an important step toward a better understanding of the toxic effects of Cd on aquatic crustaceans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of potential CYP interactions referring to the most clinically relevant drugs and exploring the relationship between them and quality of life and physical performance in Spanish octogenarians. Institutionalized and community-dwelling octogenarians ( = 102) treated at three primary care centers, were recruited by a research nurse. Anthropometric measurements, chronic diseases, prescribed drugs, quality of life, physical performance, mobility skills, hand grip strength and cognitive status data were collected. Potential CYP drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were selected referring to the main CYP implicated in their . The 72.% of recruited octogenarians presented potentially inappropriate CYP inhibitor-substrate or CYP inductor-substrate combinations. Analyzing the EuroQol Visual Analogue scale (EQ-VAS) results, patients with a potential CYP DDI perceived worse health status than patients without it ( = 0.004). In addition, patients with a potential CYP DDI presented worse exercise capacity, kinesthetic abilities, or mobility than those who didn't present a potential interaction ( = 0.01,  = 0.047, and  = 0.02, respectively). To investigate and control factors associated with loss of muscle strength and poor quality of life, polypharmacy and DDIs could help institutions in the management of physical frailty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h2><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling, energy , adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair. Several of these actions rely on Ca delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU's gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic  impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy  and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT. Inhibition of PVAT remodeling by luseogliflozin may be a novel therapeutic target for vascular remodeling after angioplasty.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675615>PET [C]acetate is also a perfusion tracer for kidney evaluation purposes.</a></h2><p>Renal positron emission tomography (PET) functional imaging allows non-invasive and dynamic measurements of functional and  parameters. [O]HO is used as a perfusion tracer, and [C]acetate as an oxidative  in this purpose, requiring two injections to assess those fundamental parameters. Yet, in cardiac physiology study, the high first-pass myocardial extraction fraction of [C]acetate allowed to use its influx rate as a blood flow marker too. Since [C]acetate has been characterized by a 20-25% single pass renal extraction in dogs, it could be used as a potential tracer for renal perfusion. The aim of this study was to determine whether [C]acetate influx rate can be used as quantitative in vivo marker of kidney perfusion in human.In 10 healthy subjects, dynamic PET acquisitions were performed after [O]HO and [C]acetate injections spaced by a 15-minute interval. As previously validated, with compartmental modeling of kinetics, renal perfusion and oxidative  were estimated respectively with influx rate of [O]HO and efflux rate of [C]acetate. Additionally, influx rate of [C]acetate was regressed to influx rate of [O]HO.Renal time activity curves of [C]-acetate was best fitted with a mono compartmental model compared to a bi-compartmental model (p < 0.0001). [C]acetate influx rate was significantly correlated with perfusion quantified with [O]HO (r = 0.37, p < 0.001) at baseline. This regression allowed the computation of a renal [C]acetate extraction fraction (EF), and further the computation of renal blood flow from its influx rate.In healthy subjects, over a wide range of renal perfusion, direct estimates of renal oxygen consumption as well as tissue perfusion can be obtained by PET with a single tracer [C]acetate. This approach needs to be validated in CKD patients, and would be of great interest to design clinical protocol aiming at evaluating ischemic nephropathies candidate to revascularization.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type  diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type  diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.
