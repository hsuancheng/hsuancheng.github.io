Homozygous mutations in BSND, CLCNKA, and CLCNKB mutations cause the disorder. Here we report a 3-year-old boy who had not been evaluated and investigated before cochlear implantation. Hypokalemia was detected during the routine laboratory workup before surgery. Further analyses revealed  alkalosis with high renin and aldosterone levels. Hypokalemia improved with oral potassium chloride supplementation. Genetic tests revealed a homozygous c.139G>A (pG47R) mutation in BSND gene, and both parents were heterozygous for the same mutation. We want to emphasize the importance of evaluating hearing loss in children, since some of the genetic syndromes may cause life threatening abnormalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695465>How Western Diet And Lifestyle Drive The Pandemic Of Obesity And Civilization Diseases.</a></h1><p>Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674843>Phytochemical analysis of crude extract of  and its effect on hypertension and  perturbations in fructose fed rats.</a></h1><p>The present study aims at phytochemical profiling and valuating the effect of crude extract of  on fructose mediated rise in blood pressure and  abnormalities in rats. Therefore, rats were fed on fructose (10%w/v) for 6 weeks. Rats in treatment groups received amlodipine 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg of DB-Cr separately in concurrent to fructose. Various parameters of  perturbations were assessed at the end of study. Further, DB-Cr was analyzed using LC-MS technique. DB-Cr exerted remarkable antihypertensive effect whereas, sympathetic hyperactivity and hyperinsulinemia in these rats was significantly blunted, further, endothelium functionality was successfully restored. LC-MS analysis of DB-Cr revealed the presence of a variety of chemical constituents (41) including quinic acid, scopolin, gingerol, Robinetin 3-rutinoside, KAPA and maleic acid.

This mismatch results in an excess of fat storage in ectopic depots, notably in the liver and viscera (= hepato-visceral, or central fat). There is still no FDA-approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. The prime aim should be a preferential loss of central fat, through lifestyle measures. Failure to sustain these measures is frequent, and the standard approach is to add an estroprogestagen contraceptive, even for girls who do not need contraception. Treatment with SPIOMET, a low-dose combination of spironolactone (to antagonize androgen and mineralocorticoid effects, and to activate BAT thereby raising energy expenditure), pioglitazone (to raise circulating HMW adiponectin concentrations) and metformin, is an alternative approach that holds the potential to revert the PCOS phenotype.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692530>Pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current perspectives on diagnosis and management.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common cause of chronic liver disease in childhood. To date, the "multiple-hit" hypothesis is largely recognized as an explanation of NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. Obesity and features of the  have been closely linked to NAFLD development. Due to the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions over time. Given its unfavorable cardiometabolic burden (such as cardiovascular and  consequences), it represents a worrying phenomenon needing a more comprehensive and successful management. Laboratory tests and classical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in NAFLD diagnosis, but novel noninvasive alternative methods to diagnose and monitor NAFLD have been investigated. Currently, lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay treatment, although its efficacy is poor because of the lack of compliance. Pediatric research is focusing on multiple alternative treatments targeting the main pathogenic factors such as insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, gut-liver axis and microbiota, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory pathways. Results from these studies are promising but larger validation is needed. Innovative therapeutic approaches might add an important piece in the complex knowledge of pediatric NAFLD. We aimed to summarize recent insights into NAFLD diagnosis and treatment in children, with a focus on possible future perspectives in pediatric research.© 2019 Di Sessa et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662402>Metabolically healthy obesity and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.</a></h1><p>Metabolically healthy obese phenotype (MHO) refers to obese individuals with an adequate  profile and absence of . Many prospective studies have reported the benign condition relating the MHO phenotype and its potential role in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. However, inconsistent results were found and the question remains controversial. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the associations these associations from relevant prospective studies.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 statement was used to prepare this protocol. MEDLINE, Web of Science databases, EMBASE and Cochrane Database will be used for literature search from their inception up to December 2019 with restriction of published studies in English. Published prospective studies reporting adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for the association between MHO phenotype and cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause or cause-specific mortality will be included. The process of study screening, selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, and the risk of bias for the studies included will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. HRs or RRs for disease events and mortality with 95% CIs will be considered as primary outcomes, and summary HRs/RRs will be pooled using random-effects models. The Cochrane's Q and the I statistics will be used to assess and quantify heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out according to study characteristics to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.As this meta-analysis is performed based on the published studies, no ethical approval and patient safety considerations are required.

To date, the clinical impact of elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels in MetS is still under discussion. The aim of this cross sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and the potential role of Hcy in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic complications of MetS.We recruited 300 outpatients with MetS. All patients underwent a medical history collection, physical examination, blood sampling and carotid ultrasound echo-color Doppler. According to Hcy levels, MetS patients were divided into two groups: "normal" (< 10.7 μmol/l; n = 140, group 1) and "high" Hcy (≥ 10.7 μmol/l; n = 160, group 2). Comparisons between groups were made by Student's t-test or Chi-square test. The effects of potential covariates on group differences were evaluated by general linear models. The relationships between continuous variables were assessed by simple or multiple correlation and by linear regression. Multiple regression models were built to evaluate the effects of Hcy, together with other potential risk factors, on carotid atherosclerosis.Patients with high Hcy were predominantly male and slightly older than group 1 patients. Smokers and non-smokers exhibited similar Hcy levels, nor was a statistical relationship between pack-years and Hcy observed. Group 2 showed lower levels of folic acid, vitamin D, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) than group 1, but higher levels of C-peptide, uric acid and triglycerides. In all patients, Hcy was positively correlated with C-peptide and uric acid and negatively with folic acid and e-GFR. Intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid stenosis degree were significantly higher in patients with high Hcy and a positive relationship between Hcy and both IMT and carotid stenosis was detected in all patients. Finally, Hcy atherogenic effects were independent of other well-known atherosclerosis risk factors.Our results highlight a link between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and a direct effect of Hcy on atherogenic process during MetS. Early correction of folic acid levels may contribute to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS patients.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692257>Myokine levels after resistance exercise in young adults with Prader-Willi  (PWS).</a></h1><p>Individuals with PWS require marked caloric restriction and daily exercise to prevent morbid obesity. Lower energy expenditure, hypotonia, decreased muscle mass, and cognitive impairment make exercise challenging for this population. Exercise guidelines include resistance training as an important component. Myokine responses to resistance exercise may mediate beneficial  effects. We aimed to determine if young PWS adults can perform a resistance exercise program and to measure myokine responses in PWS versus age- and BMI-matched controls. Each group included 11 participants (7M/4F). Ages and BMI for PWS and controls were 30.7 ± 4.6 versus 30.1 ± 4.3 years and 28.3 ± 4.3 versus 28.2 ± 4.2 kg/m , respectively. Glucose, creatine kinase (CK), lactate, and myokines were measured before, after, 30, and 60 min after completing eight resistance exercises. Myokines were assayed using a multiplex myokine panel (Merck Millipore). CK was lower in PWS versus controls (62 ± 16 vs.322 ± 100 U/L, p < .04). Peak lactate was 3.7 ± 0.7 in PWS versus 7.3 ± 0.7 mmol/Lin controls (p < .001). The increase in interleukin-6 was similar in PWS and controls (41 ± 16% and 35 ± 10%, respectively). Pre- and post-exercise levels of the six myokines assayed showed no consistent differences between the PWS and control participants. PWS young adults are capable of performing resistance/strength-building exercise. The lower CK and peak lactate levels in PWS may reflect decreased muscle mass in this population. Further studies are needed to determine optimal exercise regimens and assess the role of myokines incontributing to the  phenotype of PWS.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668310>Glucose and Insulin Responses to an Intravenous Glucose Load in Thoroughbred and Paso Fino Horses.</a></h1><p>Certain breeds of horses may be genetically predisposed to developing insulin dysregulation, which is a risk factor for development of endocrinopathic laminitis in horses. This study was performed to test the hypotheses that Paso Fino horses exhibit evidence of insulin dysregulation compared with Thoroughbred horses and that obesity exaggerates the insulin dysregulation. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed in 14 moderate-weight Thoroughbreds, 12 moderate-weight Paso Finos, and 12 overweight Paso Finos. Moderate Paso Finos had greater baseline serum insulin concentrations, area under the insulin concentration curve, peak insulin, insulin-to-glucose ratio, area under the insulin to glucose curve, and modified glucose-to-insulin ratio compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. The reciprocal inverse square of basal insulin (RISQI) and glucose-to-insulin ratio were significantly lower in moderate Paso Finos compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had greater baseline insulin concentrations, area under the insulin concentration curve, time to peak insulin, baseline plasma glucose concentration, insulin-to-glucose ratio, and area under the insulin to glucose curve compared with moderate Paso Finos. The RISQI and glucose-to-insulin ratio were significantly lower in overweight Paso Finos compared with moderate Paso Finos. In conclusion, moderate-weight Paso Finos had higher baseline serum insulin concentrations and an excessive hyperinsulinemic response to an intravenous glucose load when compared with moderate-weight Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had even greater baseline insulin concentrations and hyperinsulinemic responses to glucose compared with moderate Paso Finos, as well as greater baseline plasma glucose concentrations. Paso Finos exhibit insulin dysregulation compared with Thoroughbreds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

SIRT1 is a  sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669422>Differential  and multi-tissue transcriptomic responses to fructose consumption among genetically diverse mice.</a></h1><p>Understanding how individuals react differently to the same treatment is a major concern in precision medicine.  challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential  dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/2 J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type 2 diabetes and obesity traits. Liver and adipose genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Data were pooled using a random-effects model and weighted mean difference (WMD) was considered as the overall effect size. Nineteen trials were included in this meta-analysis. Administration of RS resulted in significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (14 studies) (WMD: -4.28; 95% CI: -7.01, -1.55), insulin (12 studies) (WMD: -1.95; 95% CI: -3.22, -0.68), and HbA1C (8 studies) (WMD: -0.60; 95% CI: -0.95, -0.24).

Although whole-body glucose clearance is normal, one-month-old lambs with IUGR at birth have higher rates of hindlimb glucose uptake, which may compensate for myocyte deficiencies in glucose oxidation. Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in IUGR lambs is due to lower intra-islet insulin availability and not from glucose sensing. We investigated adrenergic receptor (ADR) β2 desensitization by administering oral ADRβ modifiers for the first month after birth to activate ADRβ2 and antagonize ADRβ1/3. In IUGR lambs ADRβ2 activation increased whole-body glucose utilization rates and insulin sensitivity but had no effect on isolated islet or myocyte deficiencies. IUGR establishes risk for developing diabetes. In IUGR lambs we identified disparities in key aspects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, providing new insights into potential mechanisms for this risk.Placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and disturbances in glucose homeostasis with associated β-adrenergic receptor (ADRβ) desensitization. Our objectives were to measure insulin-sensitive glucose metabolism in neonatal lambs with IUGR and to determine whether daily treatment with ADRβ2 agonist and ADRβ1/β3 antagonists for one month normalizes their glucose metabolism. Growth, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and glucose utilization rates (GUR) were measured in control lambs, IUGR lambs, and IUGR lambs treated with β2-agonist clenbuterol, β1-antagonist atenolol, and β3-antagonist SR59230A (IUGR-AR). In IUGR lambs, islet insulin content and GSIS were less than in controls; however, insulin sensitivity and whole-body GUR were not different from controls. Of importance, ADRβ2 stimulation with β1/β3 inhibition increases both insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose utilization in IUGR lambs. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs, hindlimb GUR were greater but fractional glucose oxidation rates and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose oxidation rates were lower than controls. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) was lower in IUGR and IUGR-AR skeletal muscle than in controls but GLUT1 was greater in IUGR-AR. ADRβ2, insulin receptor, glycogen content, and citrate synthase activity were similar among groups. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs heart rates were greater, which was independent of cardiac ADRβ1 activation. We conclude that targeted ADRβ2 stimulation improved whole-body insulin sensitivity but minimally affected defects in GSIS and skeletal muscle glucose oxidation. We show that risk factors for developing diabetes are independent of postnatal catch-up growth in IUGR lambs as early as one-month of age and are inherent to the islets and myocytes.

N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the  and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular  phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the , obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

Primary care staff delivered the DPP curriculum, and lifestyle coaches provided monthly direction to achieve weight loss. For this substudy, barriers to weight loss and physical activity described by participants, as well as approaches coaches used to address them, were gathered. Groupings of barriers (DPP defined) were analyzed in relation to demographic characteristics and compared to data from the DPP sample.Top weight loss barriers were problems with self-monitoring, too little physical activity, internal thought/mood cues, vacation/holidays, and social cues. Percentages reporting a barrier were much higher in SHINE. Top physical activity barriers were problems with self-monitoring, access/weather, time management, aches/pains, and vacation/holidays. These did not correspond closely to DPP data. Coaches used problem solving, self-monitoring skills review, increased physical activity, and motivational strategies. SHINE coaches were more likely than DPP coaches to use alternative approaches.Barriers to weight loss and physical activity in a community sample of persons at risk for diabetes occurred at much higher rates than in the highly screened DPP sample.

As we move rapidly into the era of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein modulators, the opportunity to start a presymptomatic infant, identified through CF NBS, on these agents offers the prospect of true disease-modifying interventions which could result in a paradigm shift in CF care.Conversely, the introduction of NBS has resulted in many children being asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Some screened newborns are classified as "CF Screening Positive, Inconclusive Diagnosis", or "CFTR-related " when the diagnosis can neither be confirmed nor excluded. Appropriate assessment and follow-up should be arranged at specialist centers as a proportion of these infants and adults will eventually be diagnosed with CF.Symptoms and signs are particularly pertinent when considering a diagnosis of CF outside the context of NBS. In older patients with a late diagnosis, the spectrum of clinical presentation can be very variable with vigilant clinicians from multiple specialties suspecting the diagnosis in conditions such as recurrent pulmonary infections, male infertility, pancreatitis, nasal polyposis, and malabsorption.In addition to clinical symptoms or positive NBS results, sweat test and genetic analysis are cornerstones in the diagnosis of CF, but in some cases the diagnosis cannot be confirmed on genetic or sweat testing. Difficult diagnosis may be supported by  or  electrophysiology measurements on respiratory or intestinal epithelia. This can be done by either measuring transepithelial nasal potential difference or intestinal current measurements.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663108>Effects of Sargaquinoic Acid in Sargassum Serratifolium on Inducing Brown Adipocyte-like Phenotype in Mouse Adipocytes In Vitro.</a></h1><p>A previous study showed that the meroterpenoid-rich fraction of an ethanolic extract of  (MES) stimulated adipose tissue browning and inhibited diet-induced obesity and . Sargaquinoic acid (SQA) is a major component in MES. We investigated the effects of SQA on the differentiation of preadipocytes to the beige adipocytes. SQA was treated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated under a special condition that has been reported to induce the browning of adipocytes. SQA at 10 µM reduced lipid accumulation by approximately 23%. SQA at 2.5 - 10 µM induced the differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes partially by increasing the mitochondrial density and the expression of beige/brown adipocyte markers. In addition, SQA activated lipid catabolic pathways, evidenced by the increased expression levels of perilipin, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1. As a partial mechanism, biochemical and  analyses indicate that SQA activated AMP-activated protein kinase signaling in adipocytes.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695463>The Epidemic Of The  Among The Palestinians In The Gaza Strip.</a></h1><p>The  (MetS) is a major public health and clinical challenge worldwide. However, limited data are available in the Gaza strip. This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of MetS and its association with atherosclerotic risk factors and cardiovascular diseases among Gazan adults' community.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017, among all adults ≥25 years of age. Participants were selected by stratified cluster sampling method, in five governorates (urban, camps and rural) of Gaza strip. Questionnaires on socioeconomic status, lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors were completed for 2107 participants. The cardiovascular diseases included clinical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), Lower extremity artery disease (LEAD diagnosed as ankle brachial index < 0.90) and history of stroke. MetS was defined based on the International Diabetes Federation criteria (IDF).Among participants, 864 (41%) fulfilled the definition of MetS higher in females than males (50% vs 39%). In both genders, MetS prevalence increased significantly with age (p<0.001). Subjects with MetS were more obese (73.0% vs 29.4%), hypertensive (49.9% vs 13.0%), diabetic (36.8% vs 5.8%) and had more often low physical activity (58.1% vs 41.3%). Additionally, lipids profiles disorders were more prevalent in cases with MetS. We found MetS significantly associated with all cardiovascular conditions with odd-ratio (95% CI) respectively at 2.4 (95% CI 1.8-3.4) for CAD, 1.5 (95% CI1.1-1.9) for LEAD and 2.1 (95% CI 1.3-3.5) for stroke.The MetS is highly prevalent in the Palestinian population, particularly among women.

In response to low energy, AMPK stimulates catabolic pathways such as autophagy to enhance energy production while inhibiting anabolic pathways regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We previously found that constitutive disruption of  in mice resulted in a lack of peripheral B cells because of a block in B cell development at the pre-B cell stage. Both AMPK and mTORC1 were activated in -deficient B cell progenitors. In this study, we found inappropriate mTOR localization at the lysosome under nutrient-depleted conditions. Ex vivo lysine or arginine depletion resulted in increased apoptosis. Genetic inhibition of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or restoration of cell viability with a Bcl-x transgene failed to rescue B cell development in -deficient mice. -deficient B cell progenitors exhibited increased nuclear localization of transcription factor binding to IgHM enhancer 3 (TFE3) in developing B cells, which correlated with an increased expression of TFE3-target genes, increased lysosome numbers and function, and increased autophagic flux. These results indicate that Fnip1 modulates autophagy and energy response pathways in part through the regulation of AMPK, mTORC1, and TFE3 in B cell progenitors.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676465>Abnormal C-reactive protein blood levels as a specific biomarker of major depression and non-remission under antidepressants in schizophrenia.</a></h1><p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a general marker of peripheral inflammation and has been shown to be a good marker of neuroinflammation. CRP has been found to be elevated in patients with mood disorders (especially unipolar disorders (UD) and in schizophrenia (SZ)) but also to be lowered by antidepressants.The objectives were (i) to determine the prevalence of major depression, antidepressant prescription and remission under antidepressant in a stabilized population of SZ and UD patients consulting in a daily hospital, and (ii) to determine if CRP was a marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in these SZ and UD populations.Abnormal CRP was defined by a CRP blood level ≥ 3 mg/L. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Calgary Depression Rating Scale score. The clinicians were blinded of the CRP status of the patient.411 patients were included (272 SZ and 139 UD). 171 (41.6%) were diagnosed with current major depression (74 (27.2%) for SZ and 97 (69.8%) for UD). 86 SZ (31.6%) and 119 UD (85.6%) were treated by antidepressant. Only 28/74 (37.8%) of the SZ subjects with major depression were administered antidepressants vs. 87/97 (89.7%) for UD. The non-remission rate under antidepressant was 28/86(32.6%) for SZ and 87/119 (73.1%) for UD. Overall, 105 (40.1%) of SZ and 39 (28.1%) of UD patients were found to have abnormal CRP blood levels. Abnormal CRP levels were significantly associated with increased MDD and more strongly with increased rates of non-remission under antidepressants in SZ patients, independently of age, gender, psychotic symptomatology, functioning, tobacco smoking and . This result was not replicated in UD patients, which suggests that CRP may be a specific marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in SZ patients.The development of biomarkers in psychiatry may orientate specific etiologic therapies in patients with mental disorders. The present findings suggest that major depression is frequent in SZ patients and that increased CRP levels are associated with non-remission under antidepressants in this population. Anti-inflammatory strategies may be particularly useful in this specific population.Copyright © 2019.

Blood vessel blockage can lead to thrombotic complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, peripheral occlusive disease, and pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytic therapy currently aims to rectify this through the administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Research is underway to design an ideal thrombolytic drug with the lowest risk. Despite the potent clot lysis achievable using approved thrombolytic drugs such as alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase, tenecteplase, and some other fibrinolytic agents, there are some drawbacks, such as high production cost, systemic bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, vessel re-occlusion by platelet-rich and retracted secondary clots, and non-fibrin specificity. In comparison, bacterial staphylokinase, is a new, small-size plasminogen activator, unlike bacterial streptokinase, it hinders the systemic degradation of fibrinogen and reduces the risk of severe hemorrhage. A fibrin-bound plasmin-staphylokinase complex shows high resistance to a-antiplasmin-related inhibition. Staphylokinase has the potential to be considered as a promising thrombolytic agent with properties of cost-effective production and the least side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695927>Mechanisms of action of coffee bioactive components on lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of , obesity and diabetes, which may be related to the effects of coffee and its bioactive components on lipid metabolism. Coffee contains caffeine, a known neuromodulator that acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, as well as other components, such as chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, cafestol and kahweol. Thus, this review discusses the up-to-date knowledge of mechanisms of action of coffee and its bioactive compounds on lipid metabolism. Although there is evidence that coffee and/or its bioactive compounds regulate transcription factors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and sterol regulatory element binding proteins) and enzymes (e.g. AMP-activated protein kinase) involved in lipogenesis, lipid uptake, transport, fatty acid β-oxidation and/or lipolysis, needs for the understanding of coffee and its effects on lipid metabolism in humans remain to be answered.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692279>Kidney function in minority children and adolescents with metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity.</a></h1><p> and/or body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m are risk factors for kidney function decline in the general population. To compare creatinine (Cr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) between minority children and adolescents with metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO), a chart review was conducted on subjects aged 4 to 20 years with BMI ≥95 percentile from July 2014 to April 2017. They were stratified into MHO and MUO groups. Cr, eGFR and BUN were studied. Total n = 277: MHO n = 105 vs MUO n = 172. Cr was higher and BUN was lower in MUO whereas eGFR did not differ between the groups. Using general linear model, we found that  status predicted BUN (P = .009) but not Cr or eGFR. When age, sex and Tanner stage matched, BUN, Cr and eGFR were similar between the groups. Higher BUN in MHO could be due to higher dietary protein intake. Subjects were divided into BMI ≥40 vs <40 kg/m , BUN and eGFR were not different. A trend towards higher Cr in those with BMI ≥40 kg/m (P = .054) was found; the group being older and taller. After age and height matching, all outcomes were not different. Higher Cr was found in those with elevated blood pressures vs the MHO (P = .047).

It arises from somatic, gain-of-function mutations in GNAS, leading to mosaic Gαs activation and inappropriate production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The clinical phenotype is largely determined by the location and extent of affected tissues, and the pathophysiologic effects of Gαs activation within these tissues. In bone, Gαs activation results in impaired differentiation of skeletal stem cells, leading to discrete skeletal lesions prone to fracture, deformity, and pain. Extraskeletal manifestations include a variable combination of hyperpigmented macules and hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies. Distinctive age-related changes in disease development has key effects on histologic, radiographic, and clinical features. FD/MAS thus presents along a uniquely broad clinical spectrum, and the resulting challenges in diagnosis and management can be difficult for clinicians. This review presents FD/MAS in the context of a mosaic disorder of Gαs activation, providing an intellectual framework within which to understand, evaluate, and treat this interesting disease. It includes a comprehensive summary of current understanding of FD/MAS pathogenesis, and a detailed discussion of clinical presentation and management. Critical areas of unmet need are highlighted, including discussion of key challenges and potential solutions to advance research and clinical care in FD/MAS.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.

Asymmetrical neuroperipheral connections involving neuropeptidases from the left or right hemisphere and aminopeptidases from the heart or plasma have been suggested to play a role in this asymmetry. We hypothesize that such asymmetries could be extended to the connection between the brain and physiologic parameters and  factors from plasma and urine. To assess this hypothesis, we analyzed the possible correlation between neuropeptidases from the left and right frontal cortex with peripheral parameters in normotensive (Wistar Kyoto [WKY]) rats and hypertensive rats (spontaneously hypertensive rats [SHR]) untreated or treated with vasoactive drugs such as captopril, propranolol and L-nitro-arginine methyl ester. Neuropeptidase activities from the frontal cortex were analyzed fluorometrically using arylamide derivatives as substrates. Physiological parameters and  factors from plasma and urine were determined using routine laboratory techniques. Vasoactive drug treatments differentially modified the asymmetrical neuroperipheral pattern by changing the predominance of the correlations between peripheral parameters and central neuropeptidase activities of the left and right frontal cortex. The response pattern also differed between SHR and WKY rats.

However, despite its importance, the morphometric analysis of paramylon has not been conducted so far. In this study, we attempted to observe the detailed three-dimensional structure of paramylon by focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Paramylon samples were fixed and three-dimensional image reconstruction and segmentation of the image stack were created using computer software (Amira v6.0.1, FEI). The results indicated that the inside of paramylon particles (diameter: 5μm, thickness: 3μm) was comprised of a dense structure with no evidence of the presence of large pores and gaps, although a small 100 nm crack was observed. The specific surface area of paramylon particles measured by the BET method, was not as large as activated charcoal, but similar to those of plant starches, indicating that the cholesterol-lowering effect of paramylon cannot be simply attributed to its adsorption ability. The FIB/SEM method was found to be useful for elucidating the internal structure of small solid particles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691175> in Children and Adolescents: Diagnostic Criteria, Therapeutic Options and Perspectives.</a></h1><p>This review summarizes our current understanding of the  (MetS) in children and adolescents. Special emphasis is given towards diagnostic criteria and therapeutic options.Consistent diagnostic criteria to define MetS in childhood and adolescence are not available to date. There is common agreement that the main features defining MetS include (1) disturbed glucose metabolism, (2) arterial hypertension, (3) dyslipidemia, and (4) abdominal obesity. However, settings of cut-off values are still heterogeneous in the pediatric population. Additional features that may define cardiometabolic risk, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFDL) or hyperuricemia, are not considered to date. Prevalence of childhood obesity has more than doubled since 1980, and 6-39% of obese children and adolescents already present with MetS, depending on the definition applied. There is common agreement that a consistent definition of MetS is urgently needed for children to identify those at risk as early as possible. Such definition criteria should consider age, gender, pubertal stage, or ethnicity. Additional features such as NAFDL or hyperuricemia should also be included in MetS criteria. Lifestyle modification is still the main basis to prevent or treat childhood obesity and MetS, as other therapeutic options (pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery) are not available or not recommended for the majority of affected youngster.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695461>Can Low SHBG Serum Concentration Be A Good Early Marker Of Male Hypogonadism In ?</a></h1><p>In men suffering from , accompanying insulin resistance may result in a lowering of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) plasma levels and cause changes in their androgenic status.The objective of the research was to assess selected androgens and SHBG plasma levels in males meeting diagnostic criteria for MS compared to healthy males.The group consisted of 65 men aged between 40 and 70 years old fitting IDF  criteria and 84 controls.

The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) and cardiometabolic risk factors and the clustering of these risk factors () in euthyroid children and adolescents. A total of 250 euthyroid children and adolescents aged 10-18 years were included using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2015. In the unadjusted correlation analyses, TSH was positively correlated with glucose (r = 0.172, P = 0.006), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (r = 0.149, P = 0.018), insulin (r = 0.144, P = 0.023), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.163, P = 0.010), and triglyceride (TG) (r = 0.155, P = 0.014), whereas FT4 was negatively associated with the waist circumference (WC) standard deviation score (SDS) (r = -0.134, P = 0.035), body mass index (BMI) SDS (r = -0.126, P = 0.046), insulin (r = -0.219, P < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.211, P < 0.001). In the multiple linear regression analysis, TSH was positively associated with glucose (β = 1.179, P = 0.021), HbA1c (β = 0.044, P = 0.039), and TG (β = 8.158, P = 0.041) after adjustment for possible confounders. FT4 was negatively associated with serum fasting insulin (β = -5.884, P = 0.017) and HOMA-IR (β = -1.364, P = 0.023) in the multiple linear regression analysis. Boys and girls with elevated glucose levels had a higher adjusted mean TSH level compared to those without elevated glucose levels after controlling for confounding factors in the analysis of covariance (2.16 mIU/L vs 3.88 mIU/L, P = 0.004).

This study aims to explore the relationship between TSH levels and  factors in euthyroid individuals.A total of 2,663 subjects were enrolled from a nationwide population-based cross-sectional survey of iodine nutrition, thyroid disease and diabetes in China (2014-2017). Euthyroid individuals were divided into four groups according to quartiles of TSH levels: group A (n=305, 0.3-1.3 mIU/L), group B (n=829, 1.3-2.2 mIU/L), group C (n=673, 2.2-3.2 mIU/L) and group D (n=349, 3.2-4.2 mIU/L). Anthropometric parameters, biochemical indicators and TSH levels were determined.A total of 2,156 euthyroid subjects with serum TSH levels within the normal range accounted for 86.8% of the sample. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) in group D was significantly higher than that in the other three groups. Group C displayed significantly lower thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) levels than the other three groups. Group C also had lower anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) levels than groups A and D, whereas the TgAb levels in group B were only lower than those in group A. Spearman's or Pearson's linear regression analysis showed that SBP (r=0.054; =0.013) was positively correlated with TSH, but cholesterol (TC) (r=-0.043, =0.047) was negatively correlated with TSH. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that SBP, the urinary iodine concentration (UIC), waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), TC, triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were independent predictors of serum TSH levels.This large population-based study demonstrates a significant interaction between  factors and TSH levels.

However, evidence for an inverse connection between dietary fiber consumption and asymptomatic colonic diverticulosis is lacking. Specifically, few studies have investigated this subject in Asians with different presentations of diverticulosis. Therefore, we assessed the protective effects of a vegetarian diet for asymptomatic colonic diverticulosis in Buddhist monks who are obligatory vegetarians for spiritual reasons compared with the general population.A retrospective, cross-sectional, case-control study was conducted in age- and sex-matched Buddhist monks and the general population who underwent colonoscopy for screening at a Korean health promotion center from August 2005 to June 2018.

Hearing loss has been rarely reported following methadone use, and when reported, long term follow-up is rare. Herein we report a case of methadone poisoning with rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and persistent hearing loss documented by a 2 year follow up.The patient was a 34 years old male who presented with a reduced level of consciousness and acute hearing loss after suicidal ingestion of 40 mg of methadone while experiencing family-related stresses. He had no prior history of methadone use, abuse, or addiction. Initial laboratory testing was significant for a serum creatinine concentration of 4.1 mg/dl, a mixed  and respiratory acidosis, thrombocytopenia, abnormal hepatic transaminases, and coagulation tests.

Cd is a toxic heavy metal, and is widely present in environment. It has been reported that chronic Cd exposure is associated with kidney disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Smoking causes exposure to significantly higher Cd levels in humans. Tobacco smoke transports Cd into the lungs. Blood then transport it to the rest of the body where it increases effects by potentiating Cd that is already present from Cd-rich food. Other high exposures of Cd can occur with people, who live near hazardous waste sites, or factories that release Cd into the air and people who work in the metal refinery industry. Breathing of Cd can severely damage the lungs and may even cause death. Multiple studies have shown an association between environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals including toxic metals and obesity, diabetes, and . At the same time, the existing data on the impact of Cd exposure on obesity and diabetes are contradictory. On the converse, results of epidemiologic studies linking Cd exposure and Osteoporosis, overweight or obesity are far less consistent and even conflicting, also depending on differences in exposure levels. In turn, laboratory studies demonstrated that Cd adversely affects adipose tissue physiopathology through several mechanisms, thus contributing to increased insulin resistance and enhancing diabetes. However, intimate biological mechanisms linking Cd exposure with human diseases are still to be adequately investigated.

Aging, as a complex process characterized by graduated senescence, triggers various pathways such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, metabolism dysfunction, but also telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated autophagy. A better understanding of the senescence underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for the age-related pathologies and extend the healthy lifespan. Modulating lifestyle risk factors and adopting healthy dietary patterns remain powerful tools which may delay the aging process, decrease age-associated co-morbidities and mortality, increase life expectancy, and, consequently, prevent the development of the cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, such a strategy represents the most cost-effective approach, and the subjects' quality of life may be significantly improved. An integrated, personalized approach targeting at cardiometabolic aging and frailty is suggested in daily clinical practice. However, it should be started from an early age, while there is a need for further well designed and controlled studies in order to elucidate a link between the time of feeding, longevity and cardiovascular prevention.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on ADMA, cardiometabolic risk factors, and hormonal status in women with PCOS. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 66 women with PCOS, aged 18-45 years, were randomly assigned to receive either 200 μg/day selenium or placebo, for 12 weeks. Circulating concentrations of ADMA, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), lipid profiles, and glycemic parameters were assessed at baseline and following supplementation. ADMA concentration decreased significantly compared to baseline values (85.14 ± 75 to 56.4 ± 38.64 ng/l, p = 0.02) in the selenium group. This change was marginally significant compared with the placebo group (28.74 ± 68.63 vs. - 1.77 ± 52.88 ng/l, p = 0.056).

Various studies have indicated that a lack of vitamin D must be regarded as a pathogenic factor for type 2 diabetes and the , since a vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) increases insulin resistance and reduces insulin secretion from beta cells in the pancreas. A recent study by Pittas et al. did not show a clear preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation with respect to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In terms of this study, it must be remembered that more than 70% of the participants in both the vitamin D supplement group and the placebo group did not have a vitamin D deficiency. In medical and pharmaceutical practice, more attention should be paid to vitamin D deficiency than has previously been accorded. Vitamin D status can be assessed objectively when necessary by laboratory testing of the serum 25(OH)D levels. Type 2 diabetes patients benefit from improving their vitamin D status with respect to their glucose metabolism and decreased mortality risk. Patients with insulin resistance who are vitamin D deficient should be treated with an appropriate amount of vitamin D to achieve circulating levels of 25(OH)D of 40-60 ng/mL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684708>Clusters of cardiovascular risk factors and its association with muscle strength in adults.</a></h1><p>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally.

In addition, MS was negatively associated with number of positive MetS components (1, 2, 3 and 4 factors; β of at least -0.05 kgf/kg). Individually or combined in clusters of two, three and four risk factors (β of at least -0.20 kgf/kg), abdominal obesity was directly associated with lower MS values.

Most traditional methods are expensive and time-consuming; therefore, developments of rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive methods for the assessment of vitamins and minerals in biological samples are of high importance in research. Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid single-stranded DNA or RNA that can be synthesized . They can be engineered to be analyte-specific and have been suggested as a substitute for monoclonal antibodies, due to their high sensitivity and affinity. In addition, aptamers can be chemically synthesized and readily modified for use as biosensors. These features make aptamers a promising tool for the detection of biological analytes. In this review, we provide an overview of the potential use of aptamer-based biosensors. Search terms were conducted on several online databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct from January 2000 to August 2019. Eligibility criteria were used and quality evaluation was performed. Following the review of 4349 articles, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. Aptasensors have recently been developed for the detection of vitamins by using optical methods, with a detection range from 74 pM to 204 pM, and lower limit of detection of 2.4 pM. Both electrochemical and optical methods have been used for detection of minerals, however electrochemical methods show a wider linear range and lower detection limits compared to optical methods with a wide linear range from 0.2 fM to 1.0 mM and limit of detection of 14.7 fM. The current report reviews recent developments in aptamer-based biosensors for detection of vitamins and minerals. Studies have shown that aptasensors' properties are suitable for the quantification of vitamins and minerals with high sensitivity, affinity, and specificity. Nevertheless, the limitations and future directions of aptamers require further research and new technological innovation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696087>Comparing serum concentration of spexin among patients with , healthy overweight/obese, and normal-weight individuals.</a></h1><p> There are many factors related to etiology of  (MetS) including obesity. Spexin, a peptide hormone released from adipose tissue, is the most down-regulated gene in obese, compared to non-obese adipose tissue. Hence, it potentially contributes to the progression and development of  diseases. This study was designed to evaluate serum concentration of spexin in patients with MetS compared to weight-matched and normal-weight controls.  In this case-control study, 153 participants (51 per group) were collected from October 2014 to June 2016. The study groups were all matched for age and sex and included overweight/obese individuals with MetS and 2 control groups without MetS (including weight-matched and normal-weight participants). Body composition and serum concentration of spexin and leptin were measured.  Serum leptin and spexin levels were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in normal-weight compared to overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p< 0.02). No significant difference was observed in serum leptin and spexin concentrations between the overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p≥ 0.05). Also, spexin, with cutoff value of 4.6, had 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity for diagnosing overweight/obese from normal-weight participants. Spexin had 78% sensitivity and specificity, with cutoff value of 4.35, in diagnosing MetS participants from normal-weight group.  This study found no correlation between the circulating level of spexin and MetS development. Higher serum concentration of spexin in normal-weight adults compared to the obese participants illustrated the potential role of this novel peptide in obesity.© 2019 Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677709>Early markers of endocrinometabolic disease in newborns with delayed intrauterine growth.</a></h1><p>The adjustments to malnutrition in growth restricted fetus (GRF) that lead to obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood are not well known. The most feasible explanation for this association is the hypothesis of catch up. Some studies postulate a greater influence of catch up growth than the low birth weight itself in developing  and cardiovascular disease.This is a prospective cohort study of newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (defined as weight percentile at birth less than 10th) born during a one-year period. Clinical data of patients were recorded (gender, gestational age, data about breastfeeding and anthropometry during follow-up every 3 months). Some details of pregnancy and characteristics of the mother were also registered. Serum biochemical parameters (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA) were collected at birth from cord blood, 9 and 12 months. Two main comparative groups were established: those GRF who made a catch-up growth (increase in weight Z score higher than 0,67) during the follow-up and those who did not get it.126 GRF children were born in the study period. 125 accepted the inclusion in the study and 67 of them completed the full monitoring for a year; 47 of them made recovery growth and 20 did not. A significant difference between both groups was found in glucose in umbilical cord and triglycerides at 12 months: GRF children with catch up growth showed lower glucose levels (p = 0.03) and higher levels of triglycerides (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in the rest of laboratory parameters analyzed (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, HOMA at 9 and 12 months or triglycerides at 9 months).Those GRF with catch up growth during the first year of life have early changes in the triglycerides at the end of that period with higher levels than those GRF children without catch up growth. This finding could be useful to develop a tool for early detection of GRF children with higher  risk in order to prevent future pathology.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Here, we report clinical, biochemical and neuroimaging findings from nine unrelated children carrying GFM1 variants, 10 of which were not previously reported. All patients presented with neurological involvement-mainly axial hypotonia and dystonia during the neonatal period-with five diagnosed with West ; two children had liver involvement with cytolysis episodes or hepatic failure. While two patients died in infancy, six exhibited a stable clinical course. Brain MRI showed involvement of basal ganglia, brainstem and periventricular white matter. Mutant EFG1 and OXPHOS proteins were decreased in patient fibroblasts consistent with impaired mitochondrial translation. Thus, we expand the genetic spectrum of GFM1-linked disease and provide detailed clinical profiles of the patients that will improve the diagnostic success for other patients carrying GFM1 mutations.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Generally, normal individual can exhibit 2- to 10-folds rise in serum cortisol levels during stressful period. But patients with panhypopituitarism are more prone to develop  and haemodynamic instability particularly during stressful perioperative period. This can potentially increase significant morbidity and mortality.A 62-year-old female patient presented with breathlessness on exertion. Her coronary angiography revealed critical triple vessel coronary artery disease, and she was scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. She had been diagnosed with Sheehan's  (postpartum hypopituitarism) since 20 years. She was taking steroid and thyroxine regularly. After uneventful off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, patient had severe haemodynamic compromise with Addisonian crisis in the post-operative phase. Left ventricular dysfunction was refractory to maximal inotropic therapy. Addisonian crisis was treated with higher 'Stress doses' of intravenous hydrocortisone and routine oral thyroxin.Acute Addisonian crisis after stressful surgery is a life-threatening complication. Evidence-based approach plays an important role in appropriate biochemical assessments and specific therapeutic decisions regarding hormonal over-replacement or under-replacement in the perioperative period.© The Author(s) 2019.

Electroretinogram (ERG) and visual evoked potentials are not able to provide topographical information of optic damage. The purpose of this study was to explore retrochiasmatic optic pathway alteration in KSS with diffusion tractographic analysis and to compare it with different tracts.DTI from 8 KSS subjects (14.7 years) and 10 healthy controls (HC) were acquired on a 3T scanner. Optic radiations (OR), optic tracts (OT), inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (IFOF) and corticospinal tract (CST) were reconstructed with probabilistic tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were calculated, evaluating group differences. T test on diffusion parameters identified significantly different track portions among cohorts.All patients had optic pathway alterations at electrophysiological examination. Significant lower FA were found in OT, IFOF, and CST of KSS group. RD was significantly higher in bilateral OR, IFOF, CST, and right OT, while ADC was higher in bilateral OR and CST. RD values were higher in the proximal and distal portion of OR bilaterally and in the distal portion of right OT, while widespread differences were found in IFOF and CST. No significant differences were found for AD. FA profiles analysis demonstrated significant differences between groups in several regions of OT, IFOF, and CST, while ADC assessment revealed spread differences in OR and CST.DTI evaluation of retrochiasmatic tracks may represent a useful tool to topographically investigate retrochiasmatic visual impairment in KSS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680948>Characterization of the Therapeutic Profile of Albiflorin for the .</a></h1><p>Albiflorin (AF) is a small molecule (MW 481) isolated from , a plant used as a remedy for various conditions with pathogenesis shared by  diseases. Reported here is our characterization of its therapeutic profiles in three mouse models with distinctive pathological features of  (MetS). Our results firstly showed that AF alleviated high fat (HF) induced obesity and associated glucose intolerance, suggesting its therapeutic efficacy for MetS. In the type 2 diabetes (T2D) model induced by a combination of HF and low doses of streptozotocin, AF lowered hyperglycaemia and improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-like model resulting from a HF and high cholesterol (HF-HC) diet, AF reversed the increased liver triglyceride and cholesterol, plasma aspartate aminotransferase, and liver TNFα mRNA levels. Consistent with its effect in promoting glucose disposal in HF-fed mice, AF stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. However, these effects were unlikely to be associated with activation of insulin, AMPK, ER, or cellular stress signalling cascades. Further studies revealed that AF increased the whole-body energy expenditure and physical activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that AF exerts a therapeutic potential for MetS and related diseases possibly by promoting physical activity associated whole-body energy expenditure and glucose uptake in muscle. These effects are possibly mediated by a new mechanism distinct from other therapeutics derived from Chinese medicine.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Fouda, Zeng, Li, Zhang, Xu and Ye.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694083>Letter: Increased Serum Angiopoietin-Like 6 Ahead of  in a Prospective Cohort Study ( 2019;43:521-9).</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661963>Nutritionally attenuating the human gut microbiome to prevent and manage .</a></h1><p> (MSyn) constitutes a litany of pathophysiological conditions such as central adiposity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and  disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance,  and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue.

Although it has become one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the Western world, the proportion of NAFLD patients developing these complications is rather small. Therefore, current guidelines recommend noninvasive tests for the initial assessment of NAFLD. Among the available non-invasive tests, transient elastography by FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) is commonly used by hepatologists in Europe and Asia, and the machine has been introduced to the United States in 2013 with rapid adoption. Transient elastography measures liver stiffness and the controlled attenuation parameter simultaneously and can serve as a one-stop examination for both liver steatosis and fibrosis. Liver stiffness measurement also correlates with clinical outcomes and can be used to select patients for varices screening. Although obesity is a common reason for measurement failures, the development of the XL probe allows successful measurements in the majority of obese patients. This article reviews the performance and limitations of transient elastography in NAFLD and highlights its clinical applications.

Bioinformatic tools developed include FindSV, SVDB, Rhocall, Rhoviz, and vcf2cytosure.First, we validated our structural variant (SV)-calling pipeline on cohort 1, consisting of three trisomies and 79 deletions and duplications with a median size of 850 kb (min 500 bp, max 155 Mb). All variants were detected. Second, we utilized the same pipeline in cohort 2 and analyzed with monogenic WGS panels, increasing the diagnostic yield to 8%. Next, cohort 3 was analyzed by both CMA and WGS. The WGS data was processed for large (> 10 kb) SVs genome-wide and for exonic SVs and SNVs in a panel of 887 genes linked to intellectual disability as well as genes matched to patient-specific Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) phenotypes. This yielded a total of 25 pathogenic variants (SNVs or SVs), of which 12 were detected by CMA as well. We also applied short tandem repeat (STR) expansion detection and discovered one pathologic expansion in ATXN7. Finally, a case of Prader-Willi  with uniparental disomy (UPD) was validated in the WGS data. Important positional information was obtained in all cohorts. Remarkably, 7% of the analyzed cases harbored complex structural variants, as exemplified by a ring chromosome and two duplications found to be an insertional translocation and part of a cryptic unbalanced translocation, respectively.The overall diagnostic rate of 27% was more than doubled compared to clinical microarray (12%).

This study compared the relationships between MetS and ghrelin parameters in patients with schizophrenia.Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and under olanzapine monotherapy were recruited. Fasting blood samples were collected for the analyses of  and ghrelin parameters. The serum levels of total ghrelin and AG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. DAG level was calculated by subtracting the AG level from the total ghrelin level.We recruited 151 subjects with schizophrenia, and classified them into those with MetS ( = 41) and those without MetS ( = 110). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher AG/DAG ratio, as well as lower total ghrelin and DAG levels. There were no sex differences in ghrelin parameters. The AG/DAG ratio was significantly and positively correlated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference, insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and number of MetS components. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the number of MetS components remained significantly associated with the AG/DAG ratio.Our results revealed that lower AG/DAG ratios were associated with better  profiles in olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. These observations suggest that the balance between AG and DAG plays a crucial role in the  homeostasis among patients with schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692434>Therapeutic potential of targeting Transforming growth factor beta in colorectal cancer: Rational and Progress.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer and is associated with an increasing rate of mortality. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is often upregulated in CRC, and appears to play an important role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, immune surveillance, apoptosis, cell differentiation, drug-resistance and many cellular processes that may be involved in CRC, and therefore underscores its potential value as a therapeutic target in the treatment of CRC. An increased expression of TGF-β pathway has been associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including CRC.Here, we describe the critical role of the TGF-β pathway in CRC as well as the preclinical and clinical investigations on TGF-β inhibitors, with particular emphasis on recent findings with small-molecule inhibitors in CRC. Several TGF-β inhibitors (e.g., Trabedersen, Galunisertib, Gradalis, PF-03446962, NIS793) have been generated over the past decade for targeting this pathway.There is accumulating evidence of the therapeutic potential of this and other TGF-β inhibitors for the treatment of other malignancies. These inhibitors might be used in combination with chemotherapy as well as with other biological agents, in order to overcome different resistance mechanisms. However, further studies are needed to identify determinants of the activity of TGF-β inhibitors, through the analysis of genetic and environmental alterations affecting TGF-β and parallel pro-cancer pathways.These studies will be critical to improving the efficacy and selectivity of current and future anticancer strategies targeting TGF-β.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646117>Hypertension in diabetes and the risk of cardiovascular disease.</a></h1><p>Hypertension (HTN) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and its many manifestations.

Patients with disordered eating also suffer from sexual morbidity, which may be due to comorbid psychiatric illness and emaciation-induced hypogonadism. Promising data show that the Mediterranean diet helps alleviate sexual dysfunction in women, but other dietary patterns require more formal investigation.Incorporation of healthy dietary patterns into everyday life may positively influence female sexuality, but more substantial data are needed to confirm this idea.

In this paper, an integrated metabolomic method was presented for a systematic discovery of potential active components in Fangji Huangqi Tang (FHT), a well-known TCM prescription for nephrotic  treatment, based on "correlations between chemical and  profiles." Firstly, a metabolomics study was carried out to select representative biomarkers of nephrotic . Then, after drug administration, the dynamic process of serum composition was investigated by the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) technique to detect the prototypes and related metabolites of relative components from FHT. Pearson correlation analysis was finally used to find out the correlations between the endogenous  spectrums and the chemical serum spectrums. As a result, 17 biomarkers for nephrotic  indication were identified, and the main  pathways of their concern included linoleic acid metabolism; cyanoamino acid metabolism; alpha-linolenic acid metabolism; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; arachidonic acid metabolism; and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Meanwhile, active components in FHT for nephrotic  treatment were screened out, including (+)-tetrandrine demethylation, fenfangjine G hydrogenation, tetrandrine, -methylfangchinoline, tetrandrine demethylation, fangchinoline, glycyrrhetic acid, astragaloside II alcohol dehydration, atractylenolide III demethylation + hydrogenation, atractylenolide III demethylation + hydrogenation, and licoricone--acetylcysteine conjugation. This study demonstrated a promising way to elucidate the active chemical material basis of TCM prescription.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Zhou, Zhu, Xie and Cai.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666762>Long-term care, from neonatal period to adulthood, of children born small for gestational age.</a></h1><p>Children born small for gestational age (SGA) face an increased risk of health problems in later life, particularly persistent short stature, neurocognitive dysfunction, impaired renal and pulmonary function, decreased bone density, sensorineural hearing loss, premature adrenarche, and . Insulin resistance appears to be a key component underlying these  complications. Long-term, continuous, GH treatments in short children born SGA lead to a normalization of height through childhood to adulthood. Recombinant human GH has been proven to be relatively safe.

Obesity, insulin resistance, and the risk of  increase with catch-up growth, but short stature and cognitive dysfunction increase without catch-up growth in children born SGA. A solution to this catch-up dilemma is breast feeding for a minimum of 6 to 12 mo. Because the overall prevalence of  risk factors is very low, routine evaluation of  parameters is not recommended for all children born SGA, but it may be useful to consider  evaluations in overweight or obese children born SGA.

The purpose of this study is to explore the potential accuracy of this combination of three cytokines in screening PCOS.186 individuals were recruited for this study. Circulating Irisin, Betatrophin and ZAG concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between these serum biomarkers and PCOS was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of these biomarkers for PCOS women.In women with PCOS, serum Irisin and Betatrophin levels were markedly elevated compared to those in healthy controls (p<0.01), while ZAG levels were lower (p<0.01). PCOS women with IR (M-value<6.28) had lower circulating ZAG concentrations, and higher circulating Irisin and Betatrophin levels relative to PCOS women without IR (M-value ≥ 6.28). ROC curve analyses showed that the AUC for Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin for predicting PCOS were 0.77, 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. In a joint ROC curves analysis of these serum markers and other parameters, the results showed that the AUC was 0.93, and the sensitivity and specificity were 82.1 % and 92.3 %, respectively.When compared to using single cytokine, the analysis of Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin elevates the accuracy in diagnosing PCOS.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668388>Focus on FKBP51: A molecular link between stress and  disorders.</a></h1><p>Obesity, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as stress-related disorders are rising public health threats and major burdens for modern society.

Recently, energy metabolism in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and liver and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved  homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous fat tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired  compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors. A new approach targeting adipose tissue progenitors might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of NAFLD.© 2019 Taketani et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688095>Effect of branched-chain amino acid supplementation, dietary intake and circulating levels in cardiometabolic diseases: an updated review.</a></h1><p>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential amino acids derived from diet. BCAA supplementation has been recommended in elderly and athletes, but recent studies suggest an association between high dietary BCAAs and blood levels of BCAAs with greater risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). This review aims to integrate current epidemiological evidence analyzing the association between BCAAs and related-CMD risk factors.Most epidemiological studies consistently show that dietary BCAAs are associated with higher risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D) whereas there is limited evidence related with other cardiovascular risk factors. Evidence also exists showing an association between higher circulating BCAA levels and risk of T2D and cardiovascular disease, and also probably with  and overweight/obesity. Several clinical trials suggest beneficial cardiometabolic effect of BCAAs supplementation, although with a small sample size and short follow-up. Studies show a weak correlation between dietary BCAAs and circulating BCAA levels. Protein quality sources and whole dietary pattern are key aspects to improve our understanding of the effect of BCAAs as well as factors associated with higher protein needs, such as age or frailty.Dietary and circulating BCAAs exhibit possible detrimental cardiometabolic effects, but BCAA supplementation may have some positive influence on target groups with nutritional deficiencies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671431>Outcomes of Patients with Central Precocious Puberty due to Loss-of-Function Mutations in MKRN3 Gene After Treatment with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analog.</a></h1><p>Loss-of-function mutation of MKRN3 represents the most frequent genetic cause of familial central precocious puberty (CPP).

The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of six anthropometric indices to identify MetS in the Polish population. The highest odds ratios for the occurrence of MetS, according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), were noted for the following indices: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, OR = 24.87) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE, OR = 17.47) in men and WHtR (OR = 25.61) and body roundness index (BRI, OR = 16.44) in women. The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = 5.83), WHtR (OR = 5.70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = 5.65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27.2 kg/m. The weakest predictor of the  was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the  (MetS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism.  parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally insulin injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the Insulin Resistance ) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced insulin resistance compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MetS were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses across serum ALP quartiles (Q1: ≤190 U/L; Q2: 191-224 U/L; Q3: 225-263 U/L; and Q4: ≥264 U/L for men and Q1: ≤163 U/L; Q2: 164-201 U/L; Q3: 202-251 U/L; and Q4: ≥252 U/L for women).The mean values of most cardiometabolic variables, HOMA-IR, and leukocyte count gradually increased with serum ALP quartile. The prevalence of MetS significantly increased in accordance with serum ALP quartile. In comparison with those of individuals in the lowest quartile, the OR (95% CI) for MetS in the highest quartile was 1.32 (1.05-1.64) in men and 1.99 (1.42-3.81) in women after adjusting for age, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, regular exercise, household income, education level, occupation, AST, ALT, and GGT levels.Serum ALP level was positively and independently associated with MetS in men and women.Copyright © 2019.

Progression of peritoneal metastasis, as with other advanced malignancies, is associated with cancer cachexia anorexia  (CAS), involving poor appetite (anorexia), involuntary weight loss, and chronic inflammation. Eventual causes of mortality include dysfunctional metabolism and energy store exhaustion. Etiology of CAS in PM patients is multifactorial including tumor growth, host response, cytokine release, systemic inflammation, proteolysis, lipolysis, malignant small bowel obstruction, ascites, and gastrointestinal side effects of drug therapy (chemotherapy, opioids).  changes of CAS in PM relate more to a systemic inflammatory response than an adaptation to starvation.  reprogramming is required for cancer cells shed into the peritoneal cavity to resist anoikis (i.e., programmed cell death). Profound changes in hexokinase metabolism are needed to compensate ineffective oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. During the development of PM, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a key role in activating both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, increasing the uptake of glucose, lipid, and glutamine into cancer cells. HIF-1α upregulates hexokinase II, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), pyruvate kinase muscle isoenzyme 2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose transporters (GLUT) and promotes cytoplasmic glycolysis. HIF-1α also stimulates the utilization of glutamine and fatty acids as alternative energy substrates. Cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity interact with cancer-associated fibroblasts and adipocytes to meet  demands and incorporate autophagy products for growth. Therapy of CAS in PM is challenging. Optimal nutritional intake alone including total parenteral nutrition is unable to reverse CAS. Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) stabilized nutritional status in a significant proportion of PM patients. Agents targeting the mechanisms of CAS are under development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670454>Gender differences in  risk factors among patients with serious mental illness.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of  and its components continue to increase among patients with serious mental illness. This cross-sectional study investigated whether  prevalence and risk factors differ between male and female patients with serious mental illness. In total, 260 eligible patients were recruited from two hospitals. The data on demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviour factors, biochemistry, and anthropometry were collected. Analyses were performed using multivariate logistic regression.  prevalence was 40.8% (35.1% in men and 46.8% in women). Among patients aged 40-49 years,  prevalence was higher in men; however, the trend was reversed among patients aged 50 years or older. Notably, gender-specific  risk factors were observed. In men, they included low education level, high body mass index (BMI), prolonged illness, comorbid physical illness, and diagnosis of bipolar disorder, whereas they included being married, old age, and high BMI in women. Our findings suggest that mental health professionals should consider the gender- and age-based  prevalence trend in patients with serious mental illness when designing interventions for the study population to minimize  prevalence.© 2019 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681334>Influence of Gut Microbiota on Progression to Tuberculosis Generated by High Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in C3HeB/FeJ Mice.</a></h1><p>The administration of a high fat content diet is an accelerating factor for , impaired glucose tolerance, and early type 2 diabetes. The present study aims to assess the impact of a high fat diet on tuberculosis progression and microbiota composition in an experimental animal model using a C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain submitted to single or multiple consecutive aerosol infections. These models allowed us to study the protection induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination as well as by the natural immunity induced by chemotherapy after a low dose  infection. Our results show that a high fat diet is able to trigger a pro-inflammatory response, which results in a faster progression toward active tuberculosis and an impaired protective effect of BCG vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut microbiota caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes. As diabetes mellitus type 2 is a risk factor for developing tuberculosis, these findings may prove useful in the search for new prophylactic strategies for this population subset.Copyright © 2019 Arias, Goig, Cardona, Torres-Puente, Díaz, Rosales, Garcia, Tapia, Comas, Vilaplana and Cardona.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691133>Impact of a Formulation Containing Unusual Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, Trace Elements, Polyphenols and Plant Sterols on Insulin Resistance and Associated Disturbances.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the effect of a lipid-based formulation containing unusual polyunsaturated fatty acids, trace elements, polyphenols and plant sterols on insulin resistance and its associated disturbances among adults at risk of diabetes.This was an 8-week, three-arm, open-label randomized clinical trial.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive: 7 ml sunflower oil (control group), 3.5 ml of the study formulation + 3.5 ml of sunflower oil (low-dose group) or 7 ml of study formulation (high-dose group).We randomized 25 individuals. After one withdrawal in the high-dose group, the study sample comprised nine patients in the control, nine in the low-dose and six in the high-dose groups. The insulin sensitivity increased significantly and in a dose-dependent fashion, up to 10% in the high-dose group. At week 8 the low-dose group exhibited lower glycemic excursions during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), especially 1 h after the glucose challenge (32 mg/dl or 23% lower vs. control group). The incremental area under the glucose curve in the OGTT was 17.1% lower in the low-dose group vs. the control group. Waist circumference increased in the control group, remained constant in the low-dose group and decreased in the high-dose group. C-reactive protein decreased in both formulation groups, up to 50% in the high-dose group. Participants in the formulation groups exhibited increased secretion of GLP-1 and plasma irisin at week 8 vs. the control group.The formulation induced favorable changes in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, abdominal obesity and inflammation.

Our goal is to decipher the gene regulatory networks controlling EECs specification from enteroendocrine progenitors. In this context, we studied the role of the transcription factor Rfx6 which had been identified as the cause of Mitchell-Riley , characterized by neonatal diabetes and congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. We previously reported that Rfx6 was essential for pancreatic beta cell development and function; however, the role of Rfx6 in EECs differentiation remained to be elucidated.We examined the molecular, cellular, and  consequences of constitutive and conditional deletion of Rfx6 in the embryonic and adult mouse intestine. We performed single cell and bulk RNA-Seq to characterize EECs diversity and identify Rfx6-regulated genes.Rfx6 is expressed in the gut endoderm; later, it is turned on in, and restricted to, enteroendocrine progenitors and persists in hormone-positive EECs. In the embryonic intestine, the constitutive lack of Rfx6 leads to gastric heterotopia, suggesting a role in the maintenance of intestinal identity. In the absence of intestinal Rfx6, EECs differentiation is severely impaired both in the embryo and adult. However, the number of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells and mucosal 5-HT content are increased. Concomitantly, Neurog3-positive enteroendocrine progenitors accumulate. Combined analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data revealed that enteroendocrine progenitors differentiate in two main cell trajectories, the enterochromaffin (EC) cells and the Peptidergic Enteroendocrine (PE) cells, the differentiation programs of which are differentially regulated by Rfx6. Rfx6 operates upstream of Arx, Pax6 and Isl1 to trigger the differentiation of peptidergic EECs such as GIP-, GLP-1-, or CCK-secreting cells. On the contrary, Rfx6 represses Lmx1a and Tph1, two genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis. Finally, we identified transcriptional changes uncovering adaptive responses to the prolonged lack of enteroendocrine hormones and leading to malabsorption and lower food efficiency ratio in Rfx6-deficient mouse intestine.These studies identify Rfx6 as an essential transcriptional regulator of EECs specification and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of intestinal failures in human RFX6-deficiencies such as Mitchell-Riley .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To examine the association of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its treatment, with IVH and its severity.  In this retrospective cohort study, we included preterm neonates born at <29 weeks, admitted to a tertiary level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Calgary, Canada, between 2013 and 2016, who had a head ultrasound in the first 7 days of life. A subset analysis included neonates who also had cardiac ultrasound in the first 3 days of life.  Of the 495 neonates, 121 (24.4%) had IVH of any grade and 48 (9.7%) had severe IVH. Identified risk factors were small birth gestation and weight, lack of antenatal corticosteroids, maternal chorioamnionitis, Apgar score <5 at 5 min, umbilical cord pH < 7, respiratory distress , early onset sepsis, hypercapnia, pCO fluctuations, prolonged intubation, inhaled nitric oxide, inotropes or normal saline boluses,  derangements, opioids infusions, and bicarbonate/THAM therapy. In a primary analysis of the total cohort, when the decision to treat a PDA was used as a surrogate marker of its clinical significance, a PDA requiring treatment was associated with a higher risk of IVH. There was no significant difference in the incidence of IVH between neonates with early treatment of a clinically significant PDA compared to late, however early indomethacin treatment was associated with reduced severity of IVH. In the subset analysis, the presence of a hemodynamically significant PDA (hs-PDA) was not associated with a higher probability of IVH. Of those with severe IVH, 18 (55%) had a hs-PDA; this is clinically but not statistically significant.  Identified risk factors should be the target of IVH reduction bundles.

This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid metabolism has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid metabolism as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty acid derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty acid–binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype.

Treatment with growth hormone (GH) increases the adult height of people with TS. The effects of adding the androgen, oxandrolone, in addition to GH are unclear. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to investigate the benefits and harms of oxandrolone as an adjuvant therapy for people with TS treated with GH.To assess the effects of oxandrolone on growth hormone-treated girls aged up to 18 years with Turner .We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search was October 2018. We applied no language restrictions.We included randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that enrolled girls aged up to 18 years with TS who were treated with GH and oxandrolone compared with GH only treatment.Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus, or by consultation with a fourth review author. We assessed trials for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument.We included six trials with 498 participants with TS, 267 participants were randomised to oxandrolone plus GH treatment and 231 participants were randomised to GH only treatment. The individual trial sample size ranged between 22 and 133 participants. The included trials were conducted in 65 different paediatric endocrinology healthcare facilities including clinics, centres, hospitals and academia in the USA and Europe. The duration of interventions ranged between 3 and 7.6 years. The mean age of participants at start of therapy ranged from 9 to 12 years. Overall, we judged only one trial at low risk of bias in all domains and another trial at high risk of bias in most domains. We downgraded the level of evidence mainly because of imprecision (low number of trials, low number of participants or both). Comparing oxandrolone plus GH with GH only for final adult height showed a mean difference (MD) of 2.7 cm in favour of oxandrolone plus GH treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 4.1; P < 0.001; 5 trials, 270 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.3 cm and 5.1 cm. For adverse events, we based our main analysis on reliable date from two trials with overall low risk of bias. There was no evidence of a difference between oxandrolone plus GH and GH for adverse events (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.96; P = 0.14; 2 trials, 170 participants; low-quality evidence). Six out of 86 (18.6%) participants receiving oxandrolone plus GH compared with 8/84 (9.5%) participants receiving GH only reported adverse events, mainly signs of virilisation (e.g. deepening of the voice). One trial each investigated the effects of treatments on speech (voice frequency; 88 participants), cognition (51 participants) and psychological status (106 participants). The overall results for these comparisons were inconclusive (very low-quality evidence). No trial reported on health-related quality of life or all-cause mortality.Addition of oxandrolone to the GH therapy led to a modest increase in the final adult height of girls aged up to 18 years with TS.

Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine carrier protein cystinosin. CTNS mutations result in either complete absence or reduced cystine transporting function of the protein. The diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is generally based on measuring leukocyte cystine level, demonstration of corneal cystine crystals by the slit lamp examination and confirmed by genetic analysis of the CTNS gene.A boy born to consanguineous Caucasian parents had the characteristic clinical features of the infantile nephropathic cystinosis including renal Fanconi  (polydipsia/polyuria,  acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, cystine crystals in the cornea) and elevated WBC cystine levels. Initially we performed RFLP analysis of the common in the Northern European population 57-kb deletion of proband's DNA, then a direct Sanger sequencing which revealed no mutations in the coding part of the CTNS gene. To confirm the diagnosis we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA obtained from patient-derived fibroblasts in combination with cDNA sequencing. This revealed the skipping of exon 4 and exon 5 in the CTNS in our patient. Therefore, we detected a novel 9-kb homozygous deletion in the CTNS gene at genomic DNA level, spanning region from intron 3 to intron 5. In order to identify the inheritance pattern of the deletion we analyzed DNA of proband's mother and father. Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of the CTNS mutation.Analysis of CTNS gene transcript allowed to identify a large homozygous deletion in the patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the protein carbonyl (PC) groups in different clinical conditions. It included different groups of subjects: 81 trained subjects; 23 subjects with mild essential hypertension; 31 middle-aged subjects with  (MS); 106 subjects with MS not selected for age (subdivided into two subgroups, with and without diabetes mellitus); 91 obese adults subdivided in two subgroups (BMI 30-35 Kg/m2 and BMI > 35 kg/m2); 48 subjects with obstructive sleep apnea  (OSAS) subdivided in accordance with the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI); 27 subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative therapy; 31 subjects with CKD on haemodialysis treatment; and 50 subjects with juvenile myocardial infarction. PC groups were reduced in trained subjects in comparison with sedentary controls, while no variation was observed in mild essential hypertension. PC groups were increased in MS subjects and in adult obese subjects. In MS subjects the PC groups were not influenced by the presence of diabetes mellitus and in adult obese subjects were not influenced by the obesity degree. In OSAS subjects only those with AHI > 30 showed an increase of PC groups. PC groups increased in CKD subjects undergoing conservative treatment and haemodialysis therapy. In dialyzed subjects, after a standard dialysis session, there was a marked increase in PC groups. In juvenile myocardial infarction PC groups were higher than in controls; there was no difference between STEMI and NSTEMI and their concentration was unaffected by the number of cardiovascular risk factors or stenosed coronary vessels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664557>Bartter and Gitelman syndromes: Questions of class.</a></h1><p>Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are rare inherited tubulopathies characterized by hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic  alkalosis. They are caused by mutations in at least 7 genes involved in the reabsorption of sodium in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle and/or the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Different subtypes can be distinguished and various classifications have been proposed based on clinical symptoms and/or the underlying genetic cause. Yet, the clinical phenotype can show remarkable variability, leading to potential divergences between classifications. These problems mostly relate to uncertainties over the role of the basolateral chloride exit channel CLCNKB, expressed in both TAL and DCT and to what degree the closely related paralogue CLCNKA can compensate for the loss of CLCNKB function. Here, we review what is known about the physiology of the transport proteins involved in these disorders. We also review the various proposed classifications and explain why a gene-based classification constitutes a pragmatic solution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646127> clinic for individuals with HIV/AIDS: a commitment and vision to the future of HIV services.</a></h1><p>One of the biggest current challenges in managing an ageing cohort living with the HIV is handling dyslipidaemia, diabetes,  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a  clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a  clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the  team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the  clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with , type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum insulin were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.  Ferritin and insulin are significant predictors of NASH. Clinicians may use these to better assess cardiovascular risk and provide better management to hypertensive patients with NASH.

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with , this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686883>Lymphocyte To High-Density Lipoprotein Ratio As A New Indicator Of Inflammation And .</a></h1><p> (MetS), which is a global public health problem, is a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. This study looked at the changes in hematological parameters and the predictive value of the lymphocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (LHR) as a new index in subjects with and without MetS in coastal cities in southern China.In this cross-sectional study, there were 852 participants (n = 598 with MetS and n = 254 without MetS). MetS was defined in accordance with the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria.MetS was positively correlated with white blood cell count, total lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (<0.05). In addition, there was a positive correlation between LHR and the number of  risk factors for MetS. In a logistic regression analysis, LHR (odds ratio: 4.117; 95% CI: 2.766-6.309; <0.001) was an independent predictor of MetS. When a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the value of LHR for predicting MetS, the area under the curve yielded a cut-off value of 1.657, with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 64% (<0.0001).In summary, MetS can involve changes in blood parameters, and LHR may be a useful marker of inflammation to assess the presence and severity of MetS.© 2019 Chen et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662283>Associations of a  severity score with coronary heart disease and diabetes in fasting vs. non-fasting individuals.</a></h1><p>Many traditional assessments of risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes require laboratory studies performed after an 8-h fast. We assessed whether  (MetS) severity would remain linked to future CHD and diabetes even when assessed from non-fasting samples.Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were assessed at 4 visits and followed for 20-years of adjudicated CHD outcomes. We used Cox proportional-hazard models (for 20-year CHD outcomes) and logistic regression (for 9-year diabetes outcomes) to compare incident disease risk associated with a race/ethnicity-specific MetS-severity Z-score (MetS-Z) calculated in participants who were fasting (≥8 h) or non-fasting. All analyses were adjusted for sex, race, education, income and smoking. MetS Z-scores were overall similar between participants who were always fasting vs. those non-fasting at Visits 1-3 (all values -0.1 to 0.4), while MetS-Z for participants who were non-fasting at Visit-4 were higher at each visit. Baseline MetS-Z was linked to future CHD when calculated from both fasting and non-fasting measurements, with hazard ratio (HR) for fasting MetS-Z 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42, 1.66) and for non-fasting 1.28 (CI 1.08, 1.51). MetS-Z at Visit-1 also remained linked to future diabetes when measured from non-fasting samples, with odds ratio for fasting MetS-Z 3.10 (CI 2.88, 3.35) and for non-fasting 1.92 (CI 1.05, 3.51).MetS-Z remained linked to future CHD and diabetes when assessed from non-fasting samples. A score such as this may allow for identification of at-risk individuals and serve as a motivation toward interventions to reduce risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Therefore, we conducted this first systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies to quantify these associations.We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies up to 1 April 2019. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by a random-effects model. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019131788).We included eight high-quality (n = 5) or medium-quality (n = 3) cross-sectional studies in the final meta-analysis, comprising 6058 MetS events and 28,998 participants. The summary ORs of MetS for the highest versus lowest categories were 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.38, I = 0, tau = 0, n = 5) for dietary GI, 1.06 (95% CI 0.89-1.25, I = 36.2%, tau = 0.0151, n = 6) for dietary GL. The summary OR was 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.26, I = 0, tau = 0, n = 3) per 5 GI units, 0.96 (95% CI 0.83-1.10, I = 33.4%, tau = 0.0059, n = 2) per 20 GL units.Dietary GI was positively associated with the prevalence of MetS. However, no significant association was found between dietary GL and the prevalence of MetS.

Thus, the aim of the present hypothesis generating pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of multiple hormonal replacement therapies in chronic HF.Five stable HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, with a concomitant diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency and testosterone deficiency, on top of guideline-based HF treatment underwent 1 year of GH replacement therapy by subcutaneous injections of somatotropin at a dose of 0.012 mg/kg every second day. After 12 months, a T replacement treatment was added at a dosage of 1000 mg every 3 months. Each patient underwent a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination, and an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer at baseline (BL), after 1 year of GH treatment (V1), and after 1 year of combined GH + T treatments (V2). One-year of GH treatment resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (+5.4%, P < 0.01), New York Heart Association functional class (P < 0.05), and peak oxygen consumption (VO peak) (+19.3%, P < 0.01), and in a significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels (-35.1%, P < 0.01). Notably, one additional year of combined GH and T replacement therapy induced a further increase in VO peak (+27.7%, final delta change + 52.44%, P < 0.01), as well as a significant improvement in muscular strength, as assessed by handgrip dynamometry (+17.5%, final delta change + 25.8%, P < 0.01). These beneficial effects were paralleled with an improvement of the overall clinical status (as assessed by New York Heart Association class). Of note, neither adverse effects nor cardiovascular events were reported during the follow-up period.Our preliminary data suggest for the first time that combined replacement therapy with GH and T could be considered safe and therapeutic in HF patients with multiple hormone deficiencies, supporting the hypothesis that multiple hormone deficiencies  can be considered as a novel and promising therapeutic target in HF. Further studies with a more robust design and larger population are needed.© 2019 The Authors.

Patients of Met S were recruited from the Endocrinology and Diabetic Clinic of Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, over the time span of 6 months from July to December 2016. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ADRB3 was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and of LXR-α by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of TT variant of ADRB3 T>C in Met S was 69 (34.5%) and in controls 89 (44.5%), frequency of TC 103 (51.5%) and 96 (48%), and of CC 28 (14%) and 15 (7.5%), respectively. In the recessive model (CC: TT + TC), CC genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.027; odds ratio [OR] = 2.09; confidence interval [CI] =1.08-4.03) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex. The frequency of GG variant of LXR-α G>A in Met S was 35 (17.5%) and in controls 15 (7.5%), GA 129 (64.5%) and 137 (68.5%), and AA 36 (18%) and 48 (24%), respectively. In the recessive model (GG: GA + AA), GG genotype was found to be associated with the increased risk of Met S (P = 0.004; OR = 2.52; CI = 1.33-4.80) and the association remained significant after controlling for the confounders such as age and sex. It was concluded that SNP of ADRB3 (190 T>C) and LXR-α (-115 G>A) were associated with the risk of Met S and might increase the susceptibility to the obesity-related traits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698065>Preclinical and clinical results regarding the effects of a plant-based antidiabetic formulation versus well established antidiabetic molecules.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex  with debilitating long-term complications, comprising alterations of carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolisms, along increased oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation. Diet management and plant-based formulations can improve the  status of patients, being used as adjuvants of classic antidiabetic therapy. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the impact of a plant-based antidiabetic formulation (PBAF), containing Vaccinium myrtillus, Ribes nigrum, Rosa canina and Capsicum annuum, on the increased oxidative burden found in diabetes mellitus, comparing it with the effects of metformin and gliclazide. Firstly, we characterized the individual plant-derived components of this formulation and also assessed their in vitro radical scavenging capacity. We devised a preclinical study protocol to examine the impact of the PBAF, along metformin and gliclazide, on tissue histology as well as on the redox status of tissue, mitochondria, serum and serum lipoproteins of alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Subsequently, we assessed their long-term impact on the redox status of serum and isolated serum lipoproteins of type 2 DM (T2DM) patients, taking into consideration their cardiometabolic profile. In the preclinical stage, we found that PBAF was able to enhance total serum antioxidant defense, while metformin yielded the best results regarding the advanced glycation and protein/lipid oxidation of serum and of serum lipoproteins. The latter also improved overall serum redox status and HDL redox function. Also, antidiabetic treatment seemed to increase mitochondrial redox activity, without overturning overall tissue redox balance. Histologically, liver and brain tissues of treated diabetic rats were fairly similar to those of non-diabetic rats. In T2DM patients, the most striking results involved the effects on serum lipoproteins. The tested PBAF exerted protective antioxidant effects on low-density and, especially, on high density lipoproteins. We conclude that this formulation might constitute a good addition to the well-established pharmacological approach of DM, contributing to the reduction of overall oxidative burden.Copyright © 2019.

Targeting cardiovascular and  risk factors may be potential mechanisms to modify AD risk and address racial/ethnic disparities in AD dementia.This study investigated relationships among cardiovascular and  risk factors, APOE genotype, AD biomarkers, and intracranial arterial blood flow in Whites and African Americans enriched for AD risk.399 cognitively unimpaired adults from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center completed physical and neuroimaging examinations. A 4D Flow MRI sequence (phase-contrast vastly under sampled isotropic projection imaging) measured intracranial arterial flow in the Circle of Willis. Linear mixed-effects regression models estimated relationships between risk factors and intracranial arterial flow and tested interactions with racial group, APOE genotype, and AD biomarkers, with separate models per risk factor.Higher fasting glucose was associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; no additional relationships between flow and risk factors were observed. Main effects of racial group were observed, without an interaction, indicating lower flow in African Americans compared to Whites. In race-stratified analyses, higher glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower flow for African Americans, but not for Whites. No main effects or interactions among risk factors, APOE, or AD biomarkers, and flow were observed.Elevated fasting glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; these relationships were more prominent in African Americans.

About 15% of AS cases have autosomal mutations of COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes, including homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations. Here, we present a case of a two-year-old boy with autosomal recessive Alport  (ARAS) caused by a novel c.193-2A>C COL4A4 mutation. The patient had a delayed motor and sensory development coupled with speech and language delay, megalencephaly, hematuria and proteinuria, and normal tonal audiogram and ophthalmology exam.

The development of dual GIPR-GLP1R coagonists that bind to either one or the other receptor (sequence-mixed dual agonists) has emerged as an innovative therapeutic strategy for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Combined activation of both receptors may act synergistically providing additive effects on glucose and body weight in comparison of GLP1 analogues alone. Preclinical studies have confirmed that GIPR-GLP1R coagonists improve several hallmarks of , such as obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. These  benefits have been translated from mice to nonhuman primates and humans. Recent clinical trials have shown that coagonists induce significant benefits on body weight, fasting, and postprandial glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and total cholesterol.

To determine the underlying mechanism for impaired bone formation, we modelled the disease by silencing SMS in human bone marrow - derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) derived from healthy donors. We found that silencing SMS in MSCs led to reduced cell proliferation and deficient bone formation in vitro, as evidenced by reduced mineralization and decreased bone sialoprotein expression. Furthermore, transplantation of MSCs in osteoconductive scaffolds into immune deficient mice shows that silencing SMS also reduces ectopic bone formation in vivo. Tag-Seq Gene Expression Profiling shows that deficient SMS expression causes strong transcriptome changes, especially in genes related to cell proliferation and  functions. Similarly, metabolome analysis by mass spectrometry, shows that silencing SMS strongly impacts glucose metabolism. This was consistent with observations using electron microscopy, where SMS deficient MSCs show high levels of mitochondrial fusion. In line with these findings, SMS deficiency causes a reduction in glucose consumption and increase in lactate secretion. Our data also suggests that SMS deficiency affects iron metabolism in the cells, which we hypothesize is linked to deficient mitochondrial function. Altogether, our studies suggest that SMS deficiency causes strong transcriptomic and  changes in MSCs, which are likely associated with the observed impaired osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670860>50 bp deletion in promoter superoxide dismutase 1 gene and increasing risk of cardiovascular disease in Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder cohort study.</a></h1><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the main mortality causes worldwide is considered to be affected by general oxidative stress and inadequacy antioxidant system.

A 6-years case control follow up study was designed to genotype the 526 participants (311 controls and 215 cases) for studying the 50 bp INS/DEL polymorphism at SOD1 promoter gene and analyze their blood lipid profile and anthropometric characteristics. Among the two possible alleles of the SOD1 gene (Wild [W] and Mutant [M]) the meaningful association was detected between the Mutants' frequency and the prevalence of CVD patients (p-value <.001). The W and M allele refer to inserted and deleted 50 bp in the polymorphic site of the SOD1 promoter, respectively. The WM and MM genotypes' frequency which indicate the wild heterozygotes and Mutant homozygotes, respectively, were significantly correlated with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (p-value <.001). The present study has the potential to introduce the 50 bp INS/DEL polymorphism of SOD1 genotyping as a novel unique diagnostic approach for screening the high risk CVD.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662928>A Rare Case of Cyclophosphamide-Induced Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy  in a Patient with Anti-GBM Vasculitis, and Review of Current Literature.</a></h1><p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy  (PRES) is a clinical  of headache, altered mental status, and seizures with reversible mainly posterior leukoencephalopathy on neuroimaging.

Although MetS affects one third of American adults, its pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Tyramine, a derivative of tyrosine, has been shown to act as a catecholamine releasing agent in the human body. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of tyramine as an early biomarker for nascent MetS without the confounding of T2DM, ASCVD or smoking. Patients and methods This was an exploratory study of 28 patients with nascent MetS and 20 matched controls carried out in 2018. Metabolites were evaluated from patient's frozen early morning urine samples and were correlated with biomarkers of inflammation and adipokines. They were assayed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Western Metabolomics Center using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and standardized to urinary creatinine. All patients had normal hepatic and renal function. Results Tyramine concentrations were significantly reduced in patients with MetS compared to controls, p = 0.0009. In addition, tyramine was significantly inversely correlated with multiple biomarkers of inflammation and cardiometabolic risk factors such as RBP4, monocyte TLR-4 abundance and P38MAPKinase activity, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) (both systolic and diastolic).

The muscle weakness is directly related to respiratory muscles weakness, causing reduction in vital capacity, especially when associated with mechanical ventilation (MV). Conventional MV weaning in NMD is generally difficult. Weaning process can be conducted in protocols such as: 'T' piece or Pressure Support Ventilaton. Weaning failure is frequent because of muscle weakness. Protocol aim is to assess the effects of different weaning protocols in NMD patients receiving invasive MV in weaning success rate, duration of weaning, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay and ICU mortality.A search will be carried in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, United States National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Protal, of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Inclusion criteria of individuals are adults (above 16 years old) and children (from 5 to 16 years old), with clinical diagnosis of NMD (muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congenital myasthenia, myasthenia gravis, congenital myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy, Guillian Barré , severe inherited neuropathies,  myopathies, inflammatory myopathies, mitochondrial diseases) of any gender. All patients ventilated for at least 48 hours due to respiratory failure and clinically considered ready for weaning. Other respiratory or cardiovascular diagnosis associated will not be included. Intervention assessed will be weaning from MV using a protocol with 30 min to 2 hours of spontaneous breathing trial at the end point. All comparisons of different protocols will be considered.Formal ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected, since it will be a systematic review. All studies included should have ethical committee approval. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and in conferences and congresses or symposia.CRD42019117393.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In this context, chrononutrition has appeared as a research field centered on the study of the interactions among biological rhythms, nutrition, and metabolism. This review summarizes the role of phenolic compounds in the modulation of biological rhythms, focusing on their effects in the treatment or prevention of chronic diseases. Heterotrophs are able to sense chemical cues mediated by phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, promoting their adaptation to environmental conditions. This is called xenohormesis. Hence, the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in phenolic compounds exerts several health benefits, mainly attributed to the product of their metabolism. However, the profile of phenolic compounds present in plants differs among species and is highly variable depending on agricultural and technological factors. In this sense, the seasonal consumption of polyphenol-rich fruits could induce important changes in the regulation of physiology and metabolism due to the particular phenolic profile that the fruits contain. This fact highlights the need for studies that evaluate the impact of these specific phenolic profiles on health to establish more accurate dietary recommendations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672441>Supervised lifestyle intervention for people with  improves outcomes and reduces individual risk factors of : A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p> is characterised by a clustering of  risk factors including abdominal obesity, raised triglycerides, lowered HDL cholesterol, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance.

This can lead to hyperinsulinemia and further reduce insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance is one of the primary factors contributing to  (MetS), causing elevated glucose and fatty acid concentrations in the blood. Smoking is associated with insulin resistance in a dose-dependent manner. It directly increases the risk for insulin resistance, mainly via hormone activation, and may indirectly cause insulin resistance due to its effects on abdominal obesity. Nicotine may be the factor underlying these potential mechanisms. With the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes on the rise, and considering the role of smoking and its relationship to insulin resistance, smoking reduction or cessation may be a viable option for those who are at risk or already identified as insulin resistant. Therefore, smoking cessation or reduction would serve as a beneficial component in any diabetes prevention or treatment plan.© 2017 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687097>Coenzyme Q.</a></h1><p>Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is among the most widely used dietary and nutritional supplements on the market.

Although clinical trials of CoQ in SAMS have conflicting conclusions, the weight of the evidence, as seen in meta-analyses, supports the use of CoQ in SAMS overall. In CHF, there is a lack of large-scale randomized clinical trial data regarding the use of statins in patients receiving contemporary treatment.

However, the relationship between  (MetS) and periodontitis remains controversial. The aim of the present case-control (1:3) study was to evaluate the potential association between periodontitis and MetS, as well as the influence of risk variables on this association.Sample comprised 122 individuals with MetS (cases) and 366 controls. Plaque index, probing depth, clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing were evaluated through a full-mouth periodontal examination. The association between risk variables, MetS and periodontitis was tested through univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.A high prevalence of periodontitis was observed among cases (54.6%) when compared to controls (45.4%). Significant variables associated with the occurrence of periodontitis in the final logistic model were: MetS (OR = 2.02; p = 0.003), number of teeth up 14 (OR = 1.78; p = 0.034), and smoking (OR = 2.19; p = 0.001).An important risk association between MetS and periodontitis was reported, being that individuals with MetS presented worse periodontal status and higher prevalence, severity and extension of periodontitis.

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was estimated from bioimpedance analysis measurements, and the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was calculated by dividing the sum of ASM by body weight. Sarcopenia was defined as a gender-specific SMI value > 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean for healthy young adults. NAFLD was defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis on ultrasonography with no other causes of chronic liver disease.Among the entire study population (mean age: 57.4 ± 10.8 years), 1278 (30.4%) had NAFLD and 1240 (29.5%) had sarcopenia, and the prevalence of NAFLD was significantly higher in those with sarcopenia: 46.2% vs 25.1% (P < 0.001) in men; 38.3% vs 25.4% (P < 0.001) in women. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with higher risk of NAFLD in men [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-2.17], whereas the association was attenuated in women after adjusting for clinical risk factors.Sarcopenia is independently associated with NAFLD in men with T2DM, which suggests that sarcopenia may be a risk factor for NAFLD in men with T2DM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Latent class analysis (LCA) identified NCI profiles separately by HIV serostatus and in a combined sample. Obtained classes were examined against the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and diagnoses of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Multinomial regression identified  predictors of classification.LCA identified three latent classes in each participant sample: Class1Multidomain NCI (high probability of impairment across multiple domains), Class 2Learning & Recall NCI (high probability of impairment in learning and recall), and Class 3NC Unimpaired (low probability of NCI across all domains). Severity of NCI implied by classes corresponded with MoCA scores and HAND diagnoses. In analyses on the combined sample, compared to HIV-uninfected individuals, PLWH were more likely to be in Class1Multidomain NCI. Among PLWH, those with dyslipidemia and hypertension had greater odds of classification in Class 1Multidomain NCI while those with central obesity had higher odds of classification in Class 2Learning & Recall NCI;  approached significance as a differential predictor. Regardless of HIV status, individuals with diabetes were more likely to be in Class 1Multidomain NCI. risk factors confer heightened risk of NCI in HIV infection.

However, little is known either about developmental programming in subjects of normal birthweight, or about events between the ages which separate early programming and the occurrence of disease at late adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and insulin in young, healthy adults, born with a birth size within the normal range, are influenced by early life growth patterns. In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of  function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their body composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-, was associated with low weight at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult weight = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial insulin and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) insulin resistance. Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and insulin correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (p<0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low weight at age two years and insulin resistance. We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low weight in early infancy and increased cardio- risk in adulthood in heathy subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668457>Circulating glutamate level as a potential biomarker for abdominal obesity and  risk.</a></h1><p>Circulating level of glutamate, a by-product of the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, has been positively correlated with visceral adipose tissue accumulation and waist circumference (WC). The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of using glutamate level to identify individuals with abdominal obesity and a high cardiometabolic risk.The study sample included 99 men and 99 women.

Anthropometric and  variables were used to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (WC ≥ 95 cm in both sexes), the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTW) phenotype and the  (MetS). Mean (±SD) age was 34.1 ± 10.1 years, mean BMI was 29.0 ± 6.2 kg/m and mean WC was 92.7 ± 16.5 cm. Glutamate was strongly correlated with WC (r = 0.66 for men; r = 0.76 for women, both p < 0.0001) and multiple markers of  dysfunction, particularly fasting triglyceride level (r = 0.59 for men; r = 0.57 for women, both p < 0.0001), HDL-cholesterol level (r = -0.45, p < 0.0001 in both sexes) and the HOMA-IR index (r = 0.65 for men; r = 0.60 for women, both p < 0.0001). Logistic regressions showed that glutamate had an excellent accuracy to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (ROC_AUC: 0.90 for both sexes), a good accuracy to identify those with the HTW phenotype (ROC_AUC: 0.82 for men; 0.85 for women) and fair-to-good accuracy for the MetS (ROC_AUC: 0.78 for men; 0.89 for women).Glutamate level may represent an interesting potential biomarker of abdominal obesity and  risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society.

This study aims to report a literature review considering epidemiological and molecular mechanisms that correlate PCOS and breast cancer, as well as the influence of PCOS treatment on the incidence of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies failed to adjust potential variables that affect the risk and have thus provided inconclusive results. Molecular effects of androgenic pathways in breast cancer have been studied and androgens seem to have an inhibitory effect on mammary epithelial proliferation. However, increased bioavailable androgens were associated with recurrence of breast cancer due to conversion to oestrogens. Sex hormone-binding globulin has a role in hormone-dependent cancers and can be considered a marker for PCOS; a gene profile has already been linked to breast cancer risk in these patients. PCOS medical treatment is a promising tool for stratifying breast cancer risk due to the  influence and hormonal environment. Clinical reports are inconsistent, emphasizing the need for further studies with a prospective design. In the future, the role of pharmacological interventions in PCOS will increase knowledge and awareness of breast cancer pathogenesis and will help to refine breast cancer risk stratification.Copyright © 2019.

MetS was defined according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), Cook and colleagues, Ford and colleagues, and de Ferranti and colleagues criteria.Dietary patterns identified were: "DP1", "DP2", and "DP3". Among males, "DP3" was associated with MetS (Cook and collaborators) (OR, 12.14; 95%CI, 1.66-89.05), hypertriglyceridemia (OR, 3.89; 95%CI, 1.01-15.07), and insulin resistance (OR, 6.66; 95%CI, 1.12-39.70). "DP2" was associated with abdominal obesity (OR, 5.11; 95%CI, 1.57-16.66)."DP3" entertained a greater risk of MetS, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance, while "DP2" possessed a greater risk of abdominal obesity among adolescent males.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657510>The Buckwheat Iminosugar d-Fagomine Attenuates Sucrose-Induced Steatosis and Hypertension in Rats.</a></h1><p>This study examines the long-term functional effects of d-fagomine on sucrose- induced factors of  dysfunctions and explores possible molecular mechanisms behind its action.Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution with d-fagomine (or not, for comparison) or mineral water (controls) for 24 weeks.

Various approaches, including bariatric surgery and pharmacotherapy, have been used in the clinical setting for obesity treatment; however, these conventional options remain ineffective and carry risks of adverse effects. Therefore, treatments with higher efficacy and specificity are urgently required. Emerging drug delivery systems use polymeric materials and chemical strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy and specificity through stabilization and spatiotemporally controlled release of antiobesity agents. In this review, we provide insights into current treatments for obesity with a focus on recent developments of polymeric carriers for enhanced antiobesity drug delivery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major  controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like  condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Diabetes and  are among the biggest risk factors. Nesfatin-1, the adipokine derivative of NUCB2 (nucleobindin derivative 2) is linked to the clinical course of EC. Molecular factors, including mutations in MLH1 and MHS2 genes, c-MET and ARID1A are also related to prognosis in endometrial cancer.Using sections of paraffin-embedded preparations and immunohistochemistry, the expression of NESF1, MLH1, MSH2,c-MET and ARID1A were examined.In this study on protein expression, EC tissues manifested (although insignificantly) an elevated expression of NESF-1 in type II EC. In type I EC, NESF-1 expression was significantly higher in G1 in comparison to G2 and G3 together. A significantly lower expression of MLH1 was demonstrated in type I EC.The most pronounced expression involved c-MET in all EC I and EC II tissues (in over 80% of cases).

A total of 104,333 eligible men who participated in biennial examinations at least once from 2006 to 2015 were recruited. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effects of MetS components on CRC risk.  During an 824,211.96 person-years follow-up, 394 CRC cases were verified. Participants with high waist circumference (≥90 vs. <90 cm) had a significantly higher risk of developing incident CRC (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.64). Compared with participants with no MetS components, the HRs (95% CI) of developing CRC for men with 1, 2, and ≥3 MetS components were 1.53 (1.01-2.32), 1.42 (0.94-2.14), and 1.70 (1.12-2.56), respectively. In addition, a statistically significant trend ( for trend =0.04) of increased CRC risk with an increasing number of abnormal MetS components was observed. Furthermore, compared with no MetS components, the combination of high waist circumference and elevated fasting blood glucose along with normal levels of the other 3 components, showed a 126% increased risk of CRC.  Our study suggests that CRC risk is correlated with the number of abnormal MetS components in Chinese men. Men with high waist circumference and elevated fasting blood glucose may have a higher CRC risk even if they do not meet the MetS diagnostic criteria.Copyright © 2019 Li, Chen, Wang, Feng, Lyu, Wei, Wen, Chen, Wu, Hang, Dai, Li and He.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657699>Are there any differences among psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in terms of  and cardiovascular risk factors?</a></h1><p>Although the frequency of  has been studied separately in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, there is no study that compares the prevalence of  in all three diseases.

It is caused by a germline amorphic allele of the FH gene, which encodes the TCA cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH). HLRCC patients are genetically predisposed to develop skin leiomyomas, uterine fibroids, and the aggressive kidney cancer of type 2 papillary morphology. Loss-of-heterozygocity at the FH locus that cause a complete loss of FH enzymatic function is always detected in these tumor tissues. Molecular pathway elucidation, genomic studies, and systematic genetics screens reported over the last two decades have identified several FH-inactivation driven pathways alterations, as well as rationally conceived treatment strategies that specifically target FH tumor cells. These treatment strategies include ferroptosis induction, oxidative stress promotion, and  alteration. As the fundamental biology of HLRCC continues to be uncovered, these treatment strategies continue to be refined and may one day lead to a strategy to prevent disease onset among HLRCC patients. With a more complete picture of HLRCC biology, the safe translation of experimental treatment strategies into clinical practice is achievable in the foreseeable future.Copyright © 2019.

Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut microbiota and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster 2) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster 2 TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster 2 TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

The aim of this study was to evaluate dietary patterns and adherence to WHO healthy diet in children and adolescents and their associations with MetS.Subjects of this cohort study were selected from among children and adolescents of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study participants, aged 6-18 years (n = 424). Dietary measurements were collected using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire. MetS was defined as the existence of at least 3 risk factors according to the Cook criteria. Diet was assessed based on dietary components of the WHO healthy diet. Dietary patterns were defined by principal component analysis.The mean ± SD age of participants (42% boys and 57% girls) was 13.5 ± 3.7 years. The most consistency with the WHO healthy diet was observed for cholesterol, free sugar and protein consumption in both genders, and the least was for n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid, trans-fatty acid and salt. Intake of SFA up to 12% of energy intake (third quartile) reduced the risk of MetS, compared to the first quartile. Subjects in the third quartile of n-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acid intake (6.2% of energy) showed the lowest odds ratio of MetS compared to the first quartile (OR: 0.18, CI: 0.04-0.66). In the adjusted model, the risk of MetS reduced across quartiles of MUFA intake by 60% (OR: 1, 0.40, 0.40, 0.42; P trend = 0.05). No significant trends were observed in the risk of MetS components across quartiles of the WHO healthy diet components. Three major dietary patterns were identified, the healthy, unhealthy and cereal/meat. An increased risk of MetS was observed in the highest quartile of unhealthy dietary pattern score compared to the lowest quartile (OR: 1, 0.81, 0.93, 2.49; P trend = 0.03).Our results demonstrated that the majority of our population did not meet some components of WHO healthy diet recommendations.

However, whether this association is causal is still unclear. We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with MS and its  traits, using mendelian randomization (MR) methodology.Ten thousand six hundred fifty-five participants were enrolled from the SPECT-China study, which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014 to 2016. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 genes with known effects on 25(OH) D concentrations, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) as instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the effect of genetically lowered 25(OH) D on MS and cardiometabolic risk factors. MS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria.Lower measured 25(OH)D levels were associated with MS (OR 0.921, 95% CI 0.888, 0.954) after multivariable adjustment. However, the MR-derived odds ratio of genetically determined 25(OH) D for risk of MS was 0.977 (95% CI 0.966, 1.030). The MR-derived estimates for raised fasting plasma glucose was 0.578 (95% CI 0.321, 0.980) per 10 nmol/L GRS determined increase of 25(OH) D levels.We found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25(OH)D conferred an increased risk of MS and its  traits. However, we created our GRS only on the basis of common variants, which represent limited amount of variance in 25(OH)D.

Although gender differences in MetS are well documented, little is known about sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of COPD, especially when combined with MetS. Consequently, it is not clear whether the same treatment regime has comparable efficacy in men and women diagnosed with MetS and COPD. In the present study using sodium glutamate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke extract, we simulated lipid metabolism disorders, obesity, hyperglycemia, and pulmonary emphysema (comorbidity) in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the gender-specific impact of lipid metabolism disorders and pulmonary emphysema on angiogenic precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cells of the lumen of the nascent vessel), as well as the biological effects of pegylated glucagon-like peptide 1 (pegGLP-1) in this experimental paradigm. Simulation of MetS/COPD comorbidity caused an accumulation of EPC (CD45CD31CD34), pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lungs of female mice. In contrast, the number of cells involved in the angiogenesis decreased in the lungs of male animals. PegGLP-1 had a positive effect on lipids and area under the curve (AUC), obesity, and prevented the development of pulmonary emphysema. The severity of these effects was stronger in males than in females. Furthermore, PegGLP-1 stimulated regeneration of pulmonary endothelium. At the same time, PegGLP-1 administration caused a mobilization of EPC (CD45CD31CD34) into the bloodstream in females and migration of precursors of angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cells to the lungs in male animals. Gender differences in stimulatory action of pegGLP-1 on CD31 endothelial lung cells in vitro were not observed. Based on these findings, we postulated that the cellular mechanism of in vivo regeneration of lung epithelium was at least partly gender-specific. Thus, we concluded that a pegGLP-1-based treatment regime for  disorder and COPD should be further developed primarily for male patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661060>Bartter  type III with only a synonymous mutation of the  gene .</a></h1><p>Bartter  (BS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting renal tubular potassium handling, is characterized by hypokalemia,  alkalosis, and renal salt wasting.

Consequently, the effects of adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes can have long term consequences. A key clinical challenge for youth mental health is to develop and test new systems that align with current evidence for comorbid presentations and underlying neurobiology, and are useful for predicting outcomes and guiding decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care. Our highly personalised and measurement-based care model includes three core concepts: ▶ A multidimensional assessment and outcomes framework that includes: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviour; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness trajectory. ▶ Clinical stage. ▶ Three common illness subtypes (psychosis, anxious depression, bipolar spectrum) based on proposed pathophysiological mechanisms (neurodevelopmental, hyperarousal, circadian). The model explicitly aims to prevent progression to more complex and severe forms of illness and is better aligned to contemporary models of the patterns of emergence of psychopathology. Inherent within this highly personalised approach is the incorporation of other evidence-based processes, including real-time measurement-based care as well as utilisation of multidisciplinary teams of health professionals. Data-driven local system modelling and personalised health information technologies provide crucial infrastructure support to these processes for better access to, and higher quality, mental health care for young people. CHAPTER 1: MULTIDIMENSIONAL OUTCOMES IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CARE: WHAT MATTERS AND WHY?: Mood and psychotic syndromes present one of the most serious public health challenges that we face in the 21st century. Factors including prevalence, age of onset, and chronicity contribute to substantial burden and secondary risks such as alcohol or other substance misuse. Mood and psychotic syndromes most often emerge during adolescence and young adulthood, a period characterised by major physical and social change; thus, effects can have long term consequences. We propose five key domains which make up a multidimensional outcomes framework that aims to address the specific needs of young people presenting to health services with emerging mental illness. These include social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness type, stage and trajectory. Impairment and concurrent morbidity are well established in young people by the time they present for mental health care. Despite this, services and health professionals tend to focus on only one aspect of the presentation - illness type, stage and trajectory - and are often at odds with the preferences of young people and their families. There is a need to address the disconnect between mental health, physical health and social services and interventions, to ensure that youth mental health care focuses on the outcomes that matter to young people. CHAPTER 2: COMBINING CLINICAL STAGE AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO UNDERSTAND ILLNESS TRAJECTORIES IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EMERGING MOOD AND PSYCHOTIC SYNDROMES: Traditional diagnostic classification systems for mental disorders map poorly onto the early stages of illness experienced by young people, and purport categorical distinctions that are not readily supported by research into genetic, environmental and neurobiological risk factors. Consequently, a key clinical challenge in youth mental health is to develop and test new classification systems that align with current evidence on comorbid presentations, are consistent with current understanding of underlying neurobiology, and provide utility for predicting outcomes and guiding decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care. This chapter outlines a transdiagnostic framework for classifying common adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes, combining two independent but complementary dimensions: clinical staging, and three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical staging reflects the progression of mental disorders and is in line with the concept used in general medicine, where more advanced stages are associated with a poorer prognosis and a need for more intensive interventions with a higher risk-to-benefit ratio. The three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms are neurodevelopmental abnormalities, hyperarousal and circadian dysfunction, which, over time, have illness trajectories (or pathways) to psychosis, anxious depression and bipolar spectrum disorders, respectively. The transdiagnostic framework has been evaluated in young people presenting to youth mental health clinics of the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre, alongside a range of clinical and objective measures. Our research to date provides support for this framework, and we are now exploring its application to the development of more personalised models of care. CHAPTER 3: A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: GUIDING HIGHLY PERSONALISED AND MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES: There is an urgent need for improved care for young people with mental health problems, in particular those with subthreshold mental disorders that are not sufficiently severe to meet traditional diagnostic criteria. New comprehensive assessment frameworks are needed to capture the biopsychosocial profile of a young person to drive highly personalised and measurement-based mental health care. We present a range of multidimensional measures involving five key domains: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness type, stage and trajectory. Objective measures include: neuropsychological function; sleep-wake behaviours and circadian rhythms;  and immune markers; and brain structure and function. The recommended multidimensional measures facilitate the development of a comprehensive clinical picture. The objective measures help to further develop informative and novel insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and illness trajectories to guide personalised care plans. A panel of specific multidimensional and objective measures are recommended as standard clinical practice, while others are recommended secondarily to provide deeper insights with the aim of revealing alternative clinical paths for targeted interventions and treatments matched to the clinical stage and proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of the young person. CHAPTER 4: PERSONALISING CARE OPTIONS IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT, CLINICAL STAGE, PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS, AND INDIVIDUAL ILLNESS TRAJECTORIES TO GUIDE TREATMENT SELECTION: New models of mental health care for young people require that interventions be matched to illness type, clinical stage, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and individual illness trajectories. Narrow -focused classifications often direct clinical attention away from other key factors such as functional impairment, self-harm and suicidality, alcohol or other substance misuse, and poor physical health. By contrast, we outline a treatment selection guide for early intervention for adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes (ie, active treatments and indicated and more specific secondary prevention strategies). This guide is based on experiences with the Brain and Mind Centre's highly personalised and measurement-based care model to manage youth mental health. The model incorporates three complementary core concepts: ▶A multidimensional assessment and outcomes framework including: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness trajectory. ▶Clinical stage. ▶Three common illness subtypes (psychosis, anxious depression, bipolar spectrum) based on three underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (neurodevelopmental, hyperarousal, circadian). These core concepts are not mutually exclusive and together may facilitate improved outcomes through a clinical stage-appropriate and transdiagnostic framework that helps guide decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care options. Given its emphasis on adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes, the Brain and Mind Centre's model of care also respects a fundamental developmental perspective - categorising childhood problems (eg, anxiety and neurodevelopmental difficulties) as risk factors and respecting the fact that young people are in a period of major biological and social transition. Based on these factors, a range of social, psychological and pharmacological interventions are recommended, with an emphasis on balancing the personal benefit-to-cost ratio. CHAPTER 5: A SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL TO SUPPORT HIGHLY PERSONALISED AND MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: Over the past decade, we have seen a growing focus on creating mental health service delivery models that better meet the unique needs of young Australians. Recent policy directives from the Australian Government recommend the adoption of stepped-care services to improve the appropriateness of care, determined by severity of need. Here, we propose that a highly personalised approach enhances stepped-care models by incorporating clinical staging and a young person's current and multidimensional needs. It explicitly aims to prevent progression to more complex and severe forms of illness and is better aligned to contemporary models of the patterns of emergence of psychopathology. Inherent within a highly personalised approach is the incorporation of other evidence-based processes, including real-time measurement-based care and use of multidisciplinary teams of health professionals. Data-driven local system modelling and personalised health information technologies provide crucial infrastructure support to these processes for better access to, and higher quality of, mental health care for young people.© 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683340>Markers of  in Patients with Pituitary Adenoma: A Case Series of 303 Patients.</a></h1><p>To assess the demographic characteristics and hormonal status of patients who presented to our clinic with pituitary adenoma and to demonstrate the presence, prevalence, and relationship of  parameters in these patients.

Using whole exome sequencing, we identified biallelic DMXL2 mutations in three sibling pairs with Ohtahara , belonging to three unrelated families. Siblings in Family 1 were compound heterozygous for the c.5135C>T (p.Ala1712Val) missense substitution and the c.4478C>G (p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution; in Family 2 were homozygous for the c.4478C>A (p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution and in Family 3 were homozygous for the c.7518-1G>A (p.Trp2507Argfs*4) substitution. The severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy manifested from the first day of life and was associated with deafness, mild peripheral polyneuropathy and dysmorphic features. Early brain MRI investigations in the first months of life revealed thin corpus callosum with brain hypomyelination in all. Follow-up MRI scans in three patients revealed progressive moderate brain shrinkage with leukoencephalopathy. Five patients died within the first 9 years of life and none achieved developmental, communicative or motor skills following birth. These clinical findings are consistent with a developmental brain disorder that begins in the prenatal brain, prevents neural connections from reaching the expected stages at birth, and follows a progressive course. DMXL2 is highly expressed in the brain and at synaptic terminals, regulates v-ATPase assembly and activity and participates in intracellular signalling pathways; however, its functional role is far from complete elucidation. Expression analysis in patient-derived skin fibroblasts demonstrated absence of the DMXL2 protein, revealing a loss of function phenotype. Patients' fibroblasts also exhibited an increased LysoTracker® signal associated with decreased endolysosomal markers and degradative processes. Defective endolysosomal homeostasis was accompanied by impaired autophagy, revealed by lower LC3II signal, accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, and autophagy receptor p62, with morphological alterations of the autolysosomal structures on electron microscopy. Altered lysosomal homeostasis and defective autophagy were recapitulated in Dmxl2-silenced mouse hippocampal neurons, which exhibited impaired neurite elongation and synaptic loss. Impaired lysosomal function and autophagy caused by biallelic DMXL2 mutations affect neuronal development and synapse formation and result in Ohtahara  with profound developmental impairment and reduced life expectancy.© The Author(s) (2019).

Therefore, insulin-sensitizing agents are suggested to improve both reproductive as well as  aspects of PCOS. This study aimed to compare the effects of metformin taken alone with that of a combination of metformin and pioglitazone on menstrual cycle, hormonal parameters, insulin resistance, and inflammatory biomarkers in women with PCOS. One hundred and six women with PCOS participated in the study. All subjects were randomized into two-arm intervention groups (Arm 1 and 2). Participants in Arm-1 received metformin (500 mg BD) daily while those in Arm-2 a combination of metformin (500 mg BD) and pioglitazone (15 mg BD) for 12 wks. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured using ELISA whereas insulin resistance was assessed using HOMA-IR. At baseline women with PCOS had significantly elevated circulating concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8. Treatment decreased IL-6 in both the groups, however, only the combination group showed a significant decrease (p=0.005). Serum IL-8 level had a significant decrease after treatment in both groups (p <0.001). HOMA-IR and insulin levels also decreased in both the groups (both p <0.001). Testosterone, FSH, and prolactin significantly decreased in both groups. LH also decreased in both groups, however, the change was significant only in the combination group (p=0.013). Combination of metformin and pioglitazone therapy was more effective as compared to metformin alone in reducing the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 as well as insulin resistance in PCOS.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced  distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h1><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying . Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated  disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), body weight, feces weight and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced  distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687084>Relationships between Serum Uric Acid, Malondialdehyde Levels, and Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in the Patients with .</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress is the major cause of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. This cross-sectional study is aimed at determining if parallel serum markers of oxidative stress are related to carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).

Biochemical profiles and potential oxidative stress biomarkers malondialdehyde (MDA) and uric acid were measured in fasting plasma. We found that carotid IMT positively correlated with both MDA and uric acid levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that both MDA ( < 0.05) and uric acid ( < 0.01) levels were significantly associated with carotid IMT in participants whose Met-S scores were ≥1 or ≥2. However, only uric acid ( < 0.01) levels were positively associated with carotid IMT in patients with . Linear regression model analysis revealed that the prediction accuracies for carotid IMT from MDA combined with uric acid and from a combination of MDA, uric acid, and Met-S score were 0.176 and 0.237, respectively. These were better than the predication accuracies from MDA (  = 0.075) and uric acid (  = 0.148) individually.

Both DM and hypertension are major risk factors, for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events and mortality. Strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetics has been associated with a cardiovascular and renal risk decrease. Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal tubule is a relatively novel class of agents for treatment of type 2 DM. Inhibition of SGLT-2 co-transporter combines proximal tubule diuretic and osmotic diuretic action leading to glucose reabsorption reduction and mild natriuretic and diuretic effects. On this basis, several studies showed that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors can effectively decrease hyperglycemia but also increase BP control and reduce renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality. Based on such evidence, the recent guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes now suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors should be preferred among oral agents in combination with metformin, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease or heart failure. This review summarizes the existing data from studies evaluating the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on BP, and its potential value for cardio and nephroprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670618>Metformin: Up to Date.</a></h1><p>Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent extensively used as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes.

Conversely, although exercise may generate several hormonal effects, an intrinsic hormonal conditioning process has not been reported. In the Endocrine and  Responses on Overtraining  (EROS) study, we observed inherent and independent conditioning processes of the hypothalamic-pituitary axes in athletes. Our objective is to describe the theory of the novel hormonal conditioning mechanism using the findings from the EROS study.In this cross-sectional study, we selected 25 healthy athletes (ATL) and 12 non-physically active healthy controls (NPAC), 18-50 years old, males, with BMI 20-30 kg/m, with similar baseline characteristics, who underwent gold-standard exercise-independent tests: cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) and insulin tolerance test (ITT), to evaluate cortisol response to CST, and ACTH, cortisol, GH, and prolactin responses to an ITT.Responses to ITT were significantly earlier and higher in ATL than NPAC for cortisol [Mean ± SD: 21.7 ± 3.1 vs 16.9 ± 4.1 μg/dL; p < 0.001], GH [Median (95% CI): 12.73 (1.1-38.1) vs 4.80 (0.33-27.36) μg/L; p = 0.015], and prolactin [24.3 (10.5-67.45) vs 10.50 (6.21-43.44) ng/mL; p = 0.002]. Cortisol response to CST was similar between ATL and NPAC. During ITT, cortisol, GH, and ACTH mean increase in ATL were 52.2, 265.2, and 18.6% higher than NPAC, respectively. Prolactin response was absent in NPAC, while present in ATL.We found sufficient evidence to propose the existence of a diffuse enhancement of the hypothalamic-pituitary activity in athletes, not restricted to any axis, showing an intrinsic and independent process of "hormonal conditioning" in athletes, similar to those observed in the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. This novel conditioning process may be the missing link for understanding the improved responses observed in athletes to harmful situations, traumas, infections, inflammations, and psychiatric conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679370>Is There any Association between Age at Menarche and Risk of ? The Tehran Lipid & Glucose Study.</a></h1><p>There is controversial data available regarding the impact of age at menarche on cardio- parameters. This community-based study aimed to assess this association among Iranian women.We recruited 5,344 eligible women out of 7718, aged 10-50 years who participated in the Tehran lipid and glucose study (TLGS), conducted in 1999-2000. Based on their age at menarche, these women were subdivided into five groups: <11 years, 11-12 years, 13-14 years, 15-16 years and ≥17 years. The status of  (MetS) and its components were compared among study subgroups.The crude prevalence of MetS was 11.9, 95% CI: 11.0-13.0. Prevalence values for MetS components were 20.1 for central obesity (95% CI: 19.0-21.3), 15.7 for high fasting blood sugar (FBS), (95% CI: 14.5-17.1), 15.1 for high triglycerides, (95% CI: 14.1-16.3), 53.5 for low high density lipoproteins (HDL) (95% CI: 51.9-55.0) and 9.5 for high blood pressure (BP) (95% CI: 8.5-10.4). After adjustment for covariates, menarche age <11 years, compared to 13-14 years, was significantly associated with higher risk of Mets (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.4) and its components; i.e. central obesity (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5-4.2), BP (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4-6.0) and FBS (OR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.4-6.0). To compare our results with other studies, we calculated the standardized prevalence of MetS which was based on the WHO standardized population 11.5, 95%CI: 10.7-12.5 and the standardized prevalence of MetS by the population in Tehran was 11.7, 95% CI: 10.7-12.6.Early menarche can be associated with an increase in  disturbances later in life.© 2019 The Author(s).

The prevalence and the factors associated with the development of chronic CI in the population admitted to a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) have not yet been clarified.An observational prospective cohort study was undertaken at the RICU of the University Hospital of Modena (Italy). Patients mechanically ventilated with ARF in RICU were enrolled. Demographics, severity scores (APACHEII, SOFA, SAPSII), and clinical condition (septic shock, pneumonia, ARDS) were recorded on admission. Respiratory mechanics and inflammatory- blood parameters were measured both on admission and over the first week of stay. All variables were tested as predictors of chronic CI through univariate and multivariate analysis.Chronic CI occurred in 33 out of 100 patients observed. Higher APACHEII, the presence of septic shock, diaphragmatic dysfunction (DD) at sonography, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infection, the occurrence of a second infection during stay, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) serum level inceasing 7 days over admission were associated with chronic CI. Septic shock was the strongest predictor of chronic CI (AUC = 0.92 p < 0.0001).Chronic CI is frequent in patients admitted to RICU and mechanically ventilated due to ARF.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one pathogenic factor in the development of insulin resistance in patients with obesity. We explored whether mitochondrial dysfunction correlates with insulin resistance and other  complications.We investigated the changes of mRNA expression of genes encoding selected subunits of oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and citrate synthase (CS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) and peripheral monocytes (PM) and mitochondrial enzyme activity in platelets of 24 patients with active Cushing's  and in 9 of them after successful treatment and 22 healthy control subjects.Patients with active Cushing's  had significantly increased body mass index (BMI), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum lipids relative to the control group. The expression of all investigated genes for selected mitochondrial proteins was decreased in SCAT in patients with active Cushing's  and remained decreased after successful treatment. The expression of most tested genes in SCAT correlated inversely with BMI and HOMA-IR. The expression of genes encoding selected OXPHOS subunits and CS was increased in PM in patients with active Cushing's  with a tendency to decrease toward normal levels after cure.

None of them presented with a sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). VPSG recordings were reviewed identifying all eating episodes. For each episode, eating latency (time delay from awakening to food intake), eating duration (time between eating onset to eating offset) and sleep latency after eating offset (time delay from eating offset to sleep) were calculated. Total episode duration was considered as the time between awakening and sleep latency after eating offset.Ten patients fulfilled the A1 core criterion for NES (evening hyperphagia with consumption of at least 25% of the daily caloric intake after the evening meal); within this group, eight patients also fulfilled the A2 criterion (at least two episodes of nocturnal eating per week) and were thus included in the evening hyperphagia (EH) subgroup. The remaining 10 patients satisfied only the A2 core criterion for NES, constituting the nocturnal ingestion (NI) subgroup. We recorded 20 eating episodes, seven in the EH group and 13 in the NI group. In the EH subgroup, three eating episodes occurred before sleep onset, one after an awakening from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 1 sleep, two from NREM stage 2 and one from REM sleep. All 13 NI episodes occurred after an awakening from sleep (1 from NREM stage 1 sleep, 8 from NREM stage 2 and four from NREM stage 3). In EH patients, eating latency, total episode duration and sleep latency after eating offset were significantly longer than in NI patients.Our VPSG data from a case series of 20 patients referred to our center for nocturnal eating indicate potential different NES subtypes.

To better understand the integrated molecular physiological effects of adipose H6PDH, we created a tissue-specific knockout of the H6PDH gene mouse model in adipocytes (H6PDHAcKO mice). H6PDHAcKO mice exhibited almost complete absence of H6PDH expression and decreased intra-adipose corticosterone production with a reduction of 11β-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue. These mice also had decreased abdominal fat mass, which was paralleled by decreased adipose lipogenic ACC and ACL gene expression and reduction of their transcription factor C/EBPα mRNA levels. Moreover, H6PDHAcKO mice also had reduced fasting blood glucose levels, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity. In addition, plasma FFA levels were decreased with a concomitant decrease in the expression of lipase ATGL and HSL in adipose tissue. These results indicate that inactivation of adipocyte H6PDH expression is sufficient to cause intra-adipose GC inactivation that leads to a favorable pattern of  phenotypes. These data suggest that H6PDHAcKO mice may provide a good model for studying the potential contributions of fat-specific H6PDH inhibition to improve the  phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that suppression or inactivation of H6PDH expression in adipocytes could be an effective intervention for treating obesity and diabetes.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657304>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy or Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass for Patients with : An MBSAQIP Analysis.</a></h1><p>In patients undergoing bariatric surgery, the presence of  (MetS) contributes to perioperative morbidity.

An accurate estimate of the fat in the liver is important in the diagnostic work-up of patients with NAFLD because the degree of liver steatosis is linked to the  and the cardiovascular risk. Ultrasound (US) B-mode imaging allows to subjectively estimate the fatty infiltration in the liver; however, it has a low performance for the detection of mild steatosis. Quantitative US is based on the analysis of the radiofrequency echoes detected by an US system, and it allows to calculate a backscatter coefficient or an attenuation coefficient or the sound speed. The estimation of the backscatter coefficient is rather cumbersome and requires the use of a phantom for addressing all sources of variability. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) available on the FibroScan system (Echosens, France) measures the attenuation of the US beam. CAP is accurate in grading fatty infiltration-even though there is an overlap between consecutive grade of liver steatosis-and the values are not influenced by liver fibrosis. Several US manufacturers are developing or have already developed software for quantifying the attenuation of the US beam. Preliminary results show that proprietary technologies implemented in US systems seem more accurate than CAP for grading liver steatosis. Another available method for quantifying liver steatosis is based on the computation of the sound speed and the initial results appear promising.©The Author(s) 2019.

A significant inverse association between dietary total Ca intake and MetS were observed (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.48-0.81, P for trend = 0.002 for the highest quartile of total Ca intake compared with the lowest quartile). Trends for animal Ca (IRR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62-0.97, P for trend = 0.039) and vegetable Ca (IRR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.40-0.73, P for trend <0.001) were similar. The individual components of overall MetS were also inversely related to total, animal, and vegetable Ca. The tendency for an inverse association was more evident in the group with two of any of the  abnormalities of MetS at baseline than in the group with no more than one MetS component.Our findings indicate that a relatively high dietary intake of Ca is associated with lower risk of MetS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

It's unknown whether long-term consumption of maleic acid-modified starch is harmful to the human. However, many studies have indicated that maleic acid causes renal tubular damage in animal models, even as the associated pathways remain unclear. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) is the most innovative of the label-free quantitative technologies, which have better quantification performance. Therefore, SWATH technology was used to investigate the effect of maleic acid on rat kidney proteome in this study.SD rats were treated with 0 mg/kg (control), 6 mg/kg (low-dose), 10 mg/kg (medium-dose) and 60 mg/kg (high-dose) of maleic acid. After kidney protein extraction, 28% SDS-PAGE was used, followed by in-gel digestion and desalting. Next, the samples were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with Q-TOF MS, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH technology were also used. The gene ontology and pathway analysis were accomplished. Ultimately, these protein biomarkers were validated by using scheduled high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM ).Comparisons of the control group with the other three groups revealed that 95, 130, and 103 proteins were expressed at significantly different levels from in the control group in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. According to the gene ontology analysis, the major processes that these proteins were involved in were  processes, biological regulation, cellular processes, and responses to stimuli; the major functions these proteins were involved in were binding, hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and oxidoreductase activity; and the major cellular components they were involved in were the cytoplasm, extracellular region, membrane, and mitochondria. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, these proteins were involved in 35 pathways, 5 of which, including the carbohydrate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, renal tubular resorption, amino acid metabolism, and Ras signaling pathways, are discussed in this study. Ultimately, 19 proteins involved in 12 important pathways were validated by sMRM .It was demonstrated that maleic acid caused insufficient energy production, which might lead to a decrease in the activity of the sodium-potassium ATP pump and hydrogen ion ATP pump, which could have in turn caused renal tubular resorption and hydrogen ion regulation to be blocked, thus leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules, which would then result in renal tubular acidification followed finally by Fanconi .This article is protected by copyright.

Beyond these well-known etiologic factors, however, sleep habits and sleep apnea also seem to contribute to abdominal obesity and : Evidence suggests that sleep deprivation and behaviors linked to evening chronotype and social jetlag affect eating behaviors like meal preferences and eating times. When circadian rest and activity rhythms are disrupted, hormonal and  regulations also become desynchronized, and this is known to contribute to the development of . The  consequences of obstructive sleep apnea  (OSAS) also contribute to incident . These observations, along with the first sleep intervention studies, have demonstrated that sleep is a relevant lifestyle factor that needs to be addressed along with diet and physical activity. Personalized lifestyle interventions should be tested in subjects with , based on their specific diet and physical activity habits, but also according to their circadian preference. The present review therefore focuses (i) on the role of sleep habits in the development of , (ii) on the reciprocal relationship between sleep apnea and , and (iii) on the results of sleep intervention studies.</p></html>
