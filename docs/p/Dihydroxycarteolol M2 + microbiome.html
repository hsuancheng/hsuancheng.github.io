It was demonstrated that the protons produced and accumulated inside the biofilm during the anodic phase greatly favored the oxygen reduction reaction when the electrode was switched to become the biocathode. Protons accumulation, which hindered the bioanode operation, thus became an advantage for the biocathode. The bioanodes, formed from garden compost leachate under constant polarization at -0.2 V vs. SCE, were able to support long exposure to forced aeration, with only a slight alteration of their anodic efficiency. They produced a current density of 16±1.7 A/ for acetate oxidation and up to -0.4 A/ for oxygen reduction. Analysis of the microbial communities by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing revealed strong selection of Chloroflexi (49±1%), which was not observed for conventional bioanodes not exposed to oxygen. Chloroflexi were found as the dominant phylum of electroactive biofilms for the first time.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have suggested an important role of gut  (GM) in modulating the host metabolism and immune system, leading to alterations in bone mass. Probiotic bacteria administered in adequate amounts can alter the composition of GM and confer health benefits to the host. Given the inflammatory osteolysis that occurs in wear debris-induced prosthesis loosening, we examined whether the probiotic  could reduce osteolysis in a mouse calvarial resorption model. In this study,  markedly protected mice from CoCrMo particles (CoPs)-induced osteolysis. Osteoclast gene markers and the number of osteoclasts were significantly decreased in -treated mice. Probiotic treatment decreased the M1-like macrophage phenotype indicated by downregulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and increased the -like macrophage phenotype indicated by upregulation of IL-4, IL-10 and arginase. Collectively, these results indicated that the  treatment modulated the immune status and suppressed wear particle-induced osteolysis in vivo. Thus, probiotic treatment may represent a potential preventive and therapeutic approach to reduced wear debris-induced osteolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139852>Targeting gut  and barrier function with prebiotics to alleviate autoimmune manifestations in NOD mice.</a></h2><p>Adopting a diet containing indigestible fibre compounds such as prebiotics to fuel advantageous bacteria has proven beneficial for alleviating inflammation. The effect of the microbial changes on autoimmunity, however, remains unknown. We studied the effects of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides (XOS) on pancreatic islet and salivary gland inflammation in NOD mice and tested whether these were mediated by the gut .Mother and offspring mice were fed an XOS-supplemented diet until diabetes onset or weaning and were compared with a control-fed group. Diabetes incidence was monitored, insulitis and sialadenitis were scored in histological sections from adult mice, and several metabolic and immune variables were analysed in mice before the development of diabetes. Gut barrier function was assessed using an in vivo FITC-dextran permeability test. The importance of XOS-mediated gut microbial changes were evaluated in antibiotic-treated mice fed either XOS or control diet or given a faecal  transplant from test animals.Diabetes onset was delayed in the XOS-fed mice, which also had fewer cellular infiltrations in their pancreatic islets and salivary glands. Interestingly, insulitis was most reduced in the XOS-fed groups when the mice were also treated with an antibiotic cocktail. There was no difference in sialadenitis between the dietary groups treated with antibiotics; the mice were protected by  depletion regardless of diet. Faecal  transplantation was not able to transfer protection. No major differences in glucose-insulin regulation, glucagon-like peptide-1, or short-chain fatty acid production were related to the XOS diet. The XOS diet did, however, reduce gut permeability markers in the small and large intestine. This was accompanied by a more anti-inflammatory environment locally and systemically, dominated by a shift from M1 to  macrophages, a higher abundance of activated regulatory T cells, and lower levels of induction of natural killer T cells and cytotoxic T cells.Prebiotic XOS have -dependent effects on salivary gland inflammation and -independent effects on pancreatic islet pathology that are accompanied by an improved gut barrier that seems able to heighten control of intestinal diabetogenic antigens that have the potential to penetrate the mucosa to activate autoreactive immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490103>Postprandial Gastrointestinal Function Differs after Acute Administration of Sourdough Compared with Brewer's Yeast Bakery Products in Healthy Adults.</a></h2><p>Europeans consume large quantities of bakery products, although these are known as one of the food categories that potentially leads to postprandial symptoms (such as fullness and bloating).The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sourdough baked goods on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal fermentation and symptoms in healthy people.In a double-blind, randomized crossover study, 2 sourdough croissants (SCs) or 2 brewer's yeast croissants (BCs) were served as single meals to 17 healthy adults [9 women; age range: 18-40 y; body mass index range (in kg/): 18-24]. Gastric volume (GV) was evaluated by magnetic resonance to calculate gastric-emptying rate in the 3-h interval after croissant ingestion. A hydrogen breath test was performed to measure hydrogen production after SC and BC ingestion. Palatability and postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms (discomfort, nausea, fullness, and bloating) over a 4-h period after the meal were evaluated. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the overall effects on all variables tested.The total GV AUC was reduced by 11% during the 3 h after the consumption of SCs compared with BCs (P = 0.02). Hydrogen production during the 4-h interval after ingestion of SCs was 30% lower than after BCs (P = 0.03). SCs were rated as being >2 times as palatable as BCs (P < 0.001). The overall severity of postprandial symptoms was 36% lower during the 4 h after intake of SCs compared with BCs (P = 0.05).Sourdough bakery products could promote better postprandial gastrointestinal function in healthy adults and be more acceptable than those prepared with brewer's yeast.

To further our understanding of the complex interactions between the gut  and muscle, we examined the effect of -derived phenolic metabolites on the ability of human muscle cells to take up and metabolize glucose. As a model, we used the differentiated human skeletal muscle myoblast line, LHCN-, which expresses typical muscle phenotypic markers. We initially tested a selected panel of parent phenolic compounds and microbial metabolites, and their respective phenolic conjugates, as found in blood. Several of the tested compounds increased glucose uptake and metabolism, notably in high glucose- and insulin-treated myotubes.

Here, we have set up a study to investigate the effectiveness of two probiotic formulations containing a blend of seven bacterial species in modulating intestinal inflammation in two rodent models of colitis, induced by treating mice with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Despite the taxonomy of the bacterial species in the two probiotic formulations being similar, only one preparation (Blend 2-Vivomixx) effectively attenuated the development of colitis in both models. In the TNBS model of colitis, Blend 2 reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes while increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, promoting the expansion  macrophages and the formation of IL-10-producing Treg cells in the colon's . In the DSS model of colitis, disease attenuation and Treg formation was observed only in mice administered with Blend 2, and this effect was associated with intestinal  remodeling and increased formation of lactate, butyrate, and propionate. None of these effects were observed in mice administered with Blend 1 (VSL#3). In summary, we have shown that two probiotic mixtures obtained by combining taxonomically similar species produced with different manufacturing methods exert divergent effects in mouse models of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101203>Porcine Small and Large Intestinal  Rapidly Hydrolyze the Masked Mycotoxin Deoxynivalenol-3-Glucoside and Release Deoxynivalenol in Spiked Batch Cultures .</a></h2><p>Mycotoxin contamination of cereal grains causes well-recognized toxicities in animals and humans, but the fate of plant-bound masked mycotoxins in the gut is less well understood. Masked mycotoxins have been found to be stable under conditions prevailing in the small intestine but are rapidly hydrolyzed by fecal . This study aims to assess the hydrolysis of the masked mycotoxin deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON3Glc) by the  of different regions of the porcine intestinal tract. Intestinal digesta samples were collected from the jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and feces of 5 pigs and immediately frozen under anaerobic conditions. Sample slurries were prepared in  culture medium, spiked with DON3Glc or free deoxynivalenol (DON; 2 nmol/ml), and incubated anaerobically for up to 72 h. Mycotoxin concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the  composition was determined using a quantitative PCR methodology. The jejunal  hydrolyzed DON3Glc very slowly, while samples from the ileum, cecum, colon, and feces rapidly and efficiently hydrolyzed DON3Glc. No further metabolism of DON was observed in any sample. The microbial load and  composition in the ileum were significantly different from those in the distal intestinal regions, whereas those in the cecum, colon and feces did not differ. Results from this study clearly demonstrate that the masked mycotoxin DON3Glc is hydrolyzed efficiently in the distal small intestine and large intestine of pigs. Once DON is released, toxicity and absorption in the distal intestinal tract likely occur  This study further supports the need to include masked metabolites in mycotoxin risk assessments and regulatory actions for feed and food.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25698557>Timosaponin AIII and its metabolite sarsasapogenin ameliorate colitis in mice by inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK activation and restoring Th17/Treg cell balance.</a></h2><p>The rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (AA, family Liliaceae), which contains furostanol and spirostanol saponins, is a typical herbal medicine that improves learning and memory in rats and inhibits inflammation. In a preliminary study, timosaponin AIII, one of AA main constituents, was metabolized to sarsasapogenin by gut  and inhibited NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Here we have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of AIII and sarsasapogenin in vitro and in vivo. Both AIII and sarsasapogenin potently inhibited NF-κB and MAPK activation, as well as IRAK1, TAK1, and IκBα phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Further, AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited the binding of LPS to macrophage Toll-like receptor 4, as well as polarization of  to M1 macrophages. Oral administration of AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited 2,3,4-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice, along with reducing NF-κB activation and interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 levels, while simultaneously increasing IL-10. Both compounds inhibited Th17 cell differentiation in colonic lamina propria, but induced Treg cell differentiation. Further, AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited the differentiation of splenic CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells in vitro. The vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of sarsasapogenin were more potent than AIII. These results suggest that orally administered AIII may be metabolized to sarsasapogenin by gut , which may ameliorate inflammatory diseases such as colitis by inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway and restoring Th17/Treg cell balance.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

UC is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. UC was first described by Samuel Wilks in 1859 and it is more common than Crohn's disease worldwide. The overall incidence and prevalence of UC is reported to be 1.2-20.3 and 7.6-245 cases per 100,000 persons/year respectively. UC has a bimodal age distribution with an incidence peak in the 2nd or 3rd decades and followed by second peak between 50 and 80 years of age. The key risk factors for UC include genetics, environmental factors, autoimmunity and gut . The classic presentation of UC include bloody diarrhea with or without mucus, rectal urgency, tenesmus, and variable degrees of abdominal pain that is often relieved by defecation. UC is diagnosed based on the combination of clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, histology, and the absence of alternative diagnoses. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of UC, it is also important to define the extent and severity of inflammation, which aids in the selection of appropriate treatment and for predicting the patient's prognosis. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of UC. A pathognomonic finding of UC is the presence of continuous colonic inflammation characterized by erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, granularity, erosions, friability, bleeding, and ulcerations, with distinct demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed bowel. Histopathology is the definitive tool in diagnosing UC, assessing the disease severity and identifying intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) or cancer. The classical histological changes in UC include decreased crypt density, crypt architectural distortion, irregular mucosal surface and heavy diffuse transmucosal inflammation, in the absence of genuine granulomas. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the preferred initial radiographic imaging study in UC patients with acute abdominal symptoms. The hallmark CT finding of UC is mural thickening with a mean wall thickness of 8 mm, as opposed to a 2-3 mm mean wall thickness of the normal colon. The Mayo scoring system is a commonly used index to assess disease severity and monitor patients during therapy. The goals of treatment in UC are three fold-improve quality of life, achieve steroid free remission and minimize the risk of cancer. The choice of treatment depends on disease extent, severity and the course of the disease. For proctitis, topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs are used as the first line agents. UC patients with more extensive or severe disease should be treated with a combination of oral and topical 5-ASA drugs +/- corticosteroids to induce remission. Patients with severe UC need to be hospitalized for treatment. The options in these patients include intravenous steroids and if refractory, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies (infliximab) are utilized. Once remission is induced, patients are then continued on appropriate medications to maintain remission. Indications for emergency surgery include refractory toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, or severe colorectal bleeding.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Antibiotic treatments are likely to affect the gut flora and GI immune system, subsequently disturbing GI motility and body metabolism. In the present study, we investigated antibiotic‑induced alterations of body metabolism and GI motility in association with the macrophage profile in the colon. Specific pathogen‑free (SPF) mice (ICR; 6 weeks old; female) were orally administered vancomycin (0.2 mg/ml) in drinking water for 5 weeks, and subsequent changes in pathophysiology were observed. The expression of CD80 and CD163 was examined by immunohistochemistry and the expression of cytokines in colonic tissues was evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine red (6% w/v) solution. In the vancomycin‑treated SPF mice, significant increases in body weight, cecum weight and GITT were observed compared with the controls.

At 40 days of age, duck serum and pectorals were collected for biochemical tests; liver and cecal contents of ducks were gathered for proteome and  analysis, respectively. Serum MDA increased while pectorals T-AOC reduced linearly with enhancing stocking density. Duck lipid metabolism was altered under different stocking density as well. Serum LDL-C increased linearly with increasing stocking density. Proteome analysis revealed fatty acid biosynthesis proteins such as acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 and fatty acid oxidation related proteins including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase were enriched in high stocking density group. Additionally, high stocking density increased oxidative response associated proteins such as DDRGK domain containing 1. Furthermore, increasing stocking density diminished proteins of anti-oxidant capacity including regucalcin and catalase. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that higher stocking density was accompanied with decreased microbial diversity, as well as depletion of anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa, including Bacteroidales, Butyricimonas and Alistipe. Besides, reduced bile acid metabolism-associated bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionaceae were found in the high-density group.

Biofilms are communities of microbes embedded in matrices composed of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and have been implicated in both the healthy  and disease states. The immune system recognizes many different bacterial patterns, molecules, and antigens, but these components can be camouflaged in the biofilm mode of growth. Instead, immune cells come into contact with components of the EPS matrix, a diverse, hydrated mixture of extracellular DNA (bacterial and host), proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. As bacterial cells transition from planktonic to biofilm-associated they produce small molecules, which can increase inflammation, induce cell death, and even cause necrosis. To survive, invading bacteria must overcome the epithelial barrier, host , complement, and a variety of leukocytes. If bacteria can evade these initial cell populations they have an increased chance at surviving and causing ongoing disease in the host. Planktonic cells are readily cleared, but biofilms reduce the effectiveness of both polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages. In addition, in the presence of these cells, biofilm formation is actively enhanced, and components of host immune cells are assimilated into the EPS matrix. While pathogenic biofilms contribute to states of chronic inflammation, probiotic Lactobacillus biofilms cause a negligible immune response and, in states of inflammation, exhibit robust antiinflammatory properties. These probiotic biofilms colonize and protect the gut and vagina, and have been implicated in improved healing of damaged skin. Overall, biofilms stimulate a unique immune response that we are only beginning to understand.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

While no effective chemopreventive drug available in the market, researchers have been searching for alternative strategies against CRC that are in demand. Therefore, we tested the cancer-preventive properties of Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi) polysaccharides (GLP), along with the saponins extracted from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS), an herbal tea with prebiotic-like effects. Here, we report that saponins from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS) and polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum (GLP together with GpS) profoundly improved the inflamed gut barrier of Apc mice by reducing polyps, shifting colonic M1 to  macrophages, positively reverting E-cadherin/N-cadherin ratio, and downregulating oncogenic signaling molecules. The treatments also markedly promoted short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria and abridged sulfate-reducing bacteria in a time-dependent manner. G-protein coupled-receptors were significantly stimulated in the treated mice, accompanied by the modulated expressions of histone deacetylases, anti-cancer gut hormone PYY, and PPAPγ. These findings suggest that some of the herbal medicinal foods could modulate the relationship between the host and the gut  (GM) to exert their beneficial properties to the host.

YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a key component of the Hippo pathway and was recently suggested to promote epithelial cell regeneration for IBD recovery. However, it is unclear how YAP regulates macrophage polarization, inflammation, and gut microbial homeostasis. Although YAP has been shown to promote epithelial regeneration and alleviate IBD, here we show that YAP in macrophages aggravates IBD, accompanied by the production of antimicrobial peptides and changes in gut . YAP impairs interleukin-4 (IL-4)/IL-13-induced  macrophage polarization while promoting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon γ (IFN-γ)-triggered M1 macrophage activation for IL-6 production. In addition, YAP expression is differently regulated during the induction of  versus M1 macrophages.

Here, using 2-bromoacetophenone as the derivatization reagent (BP, 10 mg/mL, 40 °C for 20 min), a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method was established for the quantitative determination of seven short-chain fatty acids in plasma and feces.

The established method has largely improved the sensitivity by 200- to 2000-fold than that in gas chromatography (GC). Especially for butyrate, the lower quantitative limit of 1 ng/mL, 1600-fold higher in sensitivity than that of GC (1.6 μg/mL), ensured the accurate determination of its low level in blood or feces (88 ± 29 ng/mL in blood, 176 ± 18 μg/g in feces). Then, the validated method was applied for therapeutic studies of berberine in hyperlipidemia hamsters in vivo and screening of 13 compounds (including five metabolites of berberine and eight typical isoquinoline alkaloids) in vitro. After berberine treatment (oral, 200 mg/kg, 2 weeks) to hyperlipidemia hamsters, the levels of butyrate were significantly upregulated in blood (77 ± 10 ng/mL vs. 117 ± 13 ng/mL, *P < 0.05) and feces (132 ± 11 μg/g vs. 547 ± 57 μg/g, ***P < 0.001), which further verified butyrate as an active endogenous metabolite in coordination with berberine to lower the blood lipids. Additionally, the berberine metabolites (M1, , M3), as well as two isoquinoline alkaloids (tetrandrine and dauricine), could also obviously induce the production of SCFAs (butyrate, etc.) in gut . In total, we have successfully established a new derivative LC-MS/MS method for the targeted quantitative determination of seven SCFAs in biological samples.

Current biomarkers or their combinations cannot adequately predict IBD risk, diagnosis, progression or relapse, and response to therapy. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is emerging as a significant mediator of the inflammatory process. We aimed to assess levels of serum PKM2 in healthy and newly diagnosed IBD patients and its relationship with IBD indices and  changes.IBD serum samples from newly diagnosed patients were collected and analyzed using a PKM2-ELISA and correlated with disease activity scores, IBD disease type, and intestinal . Furthermore, we tested the genetic and protein expression of PKM2 in an in vitro intestinal cell model of inflammation.Serum PKM2 levels were 6-fold higher in IBD patients compared to healthy controls, with no sensitivity to disease phenotype (Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) or localization of inflammation. Serum PKM2 had considerably less interindividual variability than established IBD fecal biomarkers. A positive Pearson correlation (r=0.6121) existed between serum PKM2 and Bacteroidetes fecal levels in Crohn's disease (CD), while a negative (r=-0.6128) correlation was observed with Actinobacteria fecal levels. Furthermore, LPS (500ng/mL) significantly increased PKM2 expression in vitro, which was significantly suppressed by an anti-inflammatory flaxseed bioactive agent.Our data suggests PKM2 as a putative biomarker for IBD and the dysbiosis of microflora in CD. Investigations involving larger number of clinical patients are necessary to validate its use as a serum biomarker of IBD.Copyright © 2017 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

No language restrictions were applied.Randomized and quasi-randomized parallel trials that assessed the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics vs any other intervention but bariatric surgery or fecal transplantation in overweight or obese adults were selected.Three teams of 2 authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. Data were pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.Nineteen randomized trials (28 publications, 1412 participants) were included. There were no differences in mean body weight change [mean difference (MD), -0.54 kg; 95%CI, -1.09 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) or mean BMI change (MD, -0.19 kg/; 95%CI, -0.43 to 0.04; I2 = 51%; low quality of evidence) between groups who received probiotics or synbiotics and control groups. Oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced mean waist circumference compared with control (MD, -0.82 cm; 95%CI, -1.43 to -0.21; I2 = 46%; low quality of evidence).The findings suggest that oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics has a small effect to reduce waist circumference but no effect on body weight or BMI, although the quality of evidence is low to moderate. Therefore, the current evidence is not definitive. Large-scale trials are needed and may help to better inform clinical practice.PROSPERO registration number CRD42018075126.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, ADS-I metabolism in humans has not been investigated. In this study, we studied the biotransformation of ADS-I in human intestinal bacteria, and examined the in vitro antitumor activity of the major metabolites. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used to detect ADS-I biotransformation products, and their chemical structures were identified by high performance liquid chromatography-nuclear magnetic resonance (HPLC-NMR). The antitumor activity of the major metabolites was determined by the MTT assay. Here, we show that main reaction seen in the metabolism of ADS-I in human intestinal bacteria was deglycosylation, which produced a total of four metabolites. The structures of the two major metabolites M1 and  were confirmed by using NMR. MTT assay showed that ADS-I metabolites M1 and  have the same levels of inhibitory activities as ADS-I in cultured SMMC-7721 cells and MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates deglycosylation as a primary pathway of ADS-I metabolism in human intestinal bacteria, and suggests that the pharmacological activity of ADS-I may be mediated, at least in part, by its metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28597080>Intratumoral Fusobacterium nucleatum abundance correlates with macrophage infiltration and CDKN2A methylation in microsatellite-unstable colorectal carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a specific species of gut , has been suggested to be enriched in the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) molecular subtype of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). However, the clinicopathologic and molecular factors that interact with Fn in MSI-H CRCs are poorly understood. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA gene DNA sequence of Fn was quantitatively measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in tumor DNA samples from a total of 160 surgically resected MSI-H CRC tissues. Each case was classified into one of the three categories based on the Fn DNA amount: Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative. The clinicopathologic and molecular associations of Fn in MSI-H CRCs were statistically analyzed. Among the 160 MSI-H CRC samples, 15 (9%), 92 (58%), and 53 (33%) cases were Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative, respectively. Compared with Fn-low/negative tumors, Fn-high MSI-H CRCs were significantly associated with a high density of CD68+ tumor-infiltrating macrophages (P = 0.019) and promoter CpG island hypermethylation of the CDKN2A (p16) gene (P = 0.008). There were also tendencies toward associations of Fn-high with the BRAF V600E mutation (P = 0.047) and active Crohn-like lymphoid reactions (P = 0.052) in MSI-H CRCs. However, Fn-high was not significantly associated with CD3+ T cell density, CD163+  macrophage density or PD-L1 expression status. In conclusion, high amounts of intratumoral Fn are correlated with increased macrophage infiltration and CDKN2A promoter methylation in MSI-H CRCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958925>Pathophysiological Consequences of Calcium-Conducting Viroporins.</a></h2><p>Eukaryotic cells have evolved a myriad of ion channels, transporters, and pumps to maintain and regulate transmembrane ion gradients. As intracellular parasites, viruses also have evolved ion channel proteins, called viroporins, which disrupt normal ionic homeostasis to promote viral replication and pathogenesis. The first viral ion channel (influenza  protein) was confirmed only 23 years ago, and since then studies on  and many other viroporins have shown they serve critical functions in virus entry, replication, morphogenesis, and immune evasion. As new candidate viroporins and viroporin-mediated functions are being discovered, we review the experimental criteria for viroporin identification and characterization to facilitate consistency within this field of research. Then we review recent studies on how the few Ca(2+)-conducting viroporins exploit host signaling pathways, including store-operated Ca(2+) entry, autophagy, and inflammasome activation. These viroporin-induced aberrant Ca(2+) signals cause pathophysiological changes resulting in diarrhea, vomiting, and proinflammatory diseases, making both the viroporin and host Ca(2+) signaling pathways potential therapeutic targets for antiviral drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26471282>Conditional deletion of caspase-8 in macrophages alters macrophage activation in a RIPK-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Although caspase-8 is a well-established initiator of apoptosis and suppressor of necroptosis, recent evidence suggests that this enzyme maintains functions beyond its role in cell death. As cells of the innate immune system, and in particular macrophages, are now at the forefront of autoimmune disease pathogenesis, we examined the potential involvement of caspase-8 within this population.Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice were bred via a cross between Casp8 (fl/fl) mice and Cre (LysM) mice, and RIPK3 (-/-) Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice were generated to assess the contribution of receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase (RIPK)3. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were used to examine renal damage. Flow cytometric analysis was employed to characterize splenocyte distribution and activation. Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice were treated with either Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists or oral antibiotics to assess their response to TLR activation or TLR agonist removal. Luminex-based assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure cytokine/chemokine and immunoglobulin levels in serum and cytokine levels in cell culture studies. In vitro cell culture was used to assess macrophage response to cell death stimuli, TLR activation, and M1/ polarization. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.Loss of caspase-8 expression in macrophages promotes onset of a mild systemic inflammatory disease, which is preventable by the deletion of RIPK3. In vitro cell culture studies reveal that caspase-8-deficient macrophages are prone to a caspase-independent death in response to death receptor ligation; yet, caspase-8-deficient macrophages are not predisposed to unchecked survival, as analysis of mixed bone marrow chimeric mice demonstrates that caspase-8 deficiency does not confer preferential expansion of myeloid populations. Loss of caspase-8 in macrophages dictates the response to TLR activation, as injection of TLR ligands upregulates expression of costimulatory CD86 on the Ly6C(high)CD11b(+)F4/80(+) splenic cells, and oral antibiotic treatment to remove  prevents splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice. Further, caspase-8-deficient macrophages are hyperresponsive to TLR activation and exhibit aberrant M1 macrophage polarization due to RIPK activity.These data demonstrate that caspase-8 functions uniquely in macrophages by controlling the response to TLR activation and macrophage polarization in an RIPK-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26712364>Gut -derived lipopolysaccharide uptake and trafficking to adipose tissue: implications for inflammation and obesity.</a></h2><p>The composition of the gut  and excessive ingestion of high-fat diets (HFD) are considered to be important factors for development of obesity. In this review we describe a coherent mechanism of action for the development of obesity, which involves the composition of gut , HFD, low-grade inflammation, expression of fat translocase and scavenger receptor CD36, and the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI). SR-BI binds to both lipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, which may promote incorporation of LPS in chylomicrons (CMs). These CMs are transported via lymph to the circulation, where LPS is transferred to other lipoproteins by translocases, preferentially to HDL. LPS increases the SR-BI binding, transcytosis of lipoproteins over the endothelial barrier,and endocytosis in adipocytes. Especially large size adipocytes with high metabolic activity absorb LPS-rich lipoproteins. In addition, macrophages in adipose tissue internalize LPS-lipoproteins. This may contribute to the polarization from  to M1 phenotype, which is a consequence of increased LPS delivery into the tissue during hypertrophy. In conclusion, evidence suggests that LPS is involved in the development of obesity as a direct targeting molecule for lipid delivery and storage in adipose tissue.© 2015 World Obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593782>"Western-Diet"-Induced Adipose Inflammation Requires a Complex Gut .</a></h2><p>Consumption of a low-fiber, high-fat, Western-style diet (WSD) induces adiposity and adipose inflammation characterized by increases in the M1: macrophage ratio and proinflammatory cytokine expression, both of which contribute to WSD-induced metabolic syndrome. WSD-induced adipose inflammation might result from endoplasmic reticulum stress in lipid-overloaded adipocytes and/or dissemination of gut bacterial products, resulting in activation of innate immune signaling. Hence, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut , and its detection by innate immune signaling pathways, in WSD-induced adipose inflammation.Mice were fed grain-based chow or a WSD for 8 weeks, assessed metabolically, and intestinal and adipose tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.  was ablated via antibiotics and use of gnotobiotic mice that completely lacked  (germ-free mice) or had a low-complexity  (altered Schaedler flora). Innate immune signaling was ablated by genetic deletion of Toll-like receptor signaling adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response 88.Ablation of  via antibiotic, germ-free, or altered Schaedler flora approaches did not significantly impact WSD-induced adiposity, yet dramatically reduced WSD-induced adipose inflammation as assessed by macrophage populations and cytokine expression.  ablation also prevented colonic neutrophil and CD103 dendritic cell infiltration. Such reduced indices of inflammation correlated with protection against WSD-induced dysglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and liver dysfunction. Genetic deletion of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 also prevented WSD-induced adipose inflammation.These results indicate that adipose inflammation, and some aspects of metabolic syndrome, are not purely a consequence of diet-induced adiposity per se but, rather, may require disturbance of intestine- interactions and subsequent activation of innate immunity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Obesity is characterised by low-grade systemic and adipose tissue inflammation. This is suggested to be implicated in the metabolic syndrome and obesity. In the present review, we hypothesise that LPS directly and indirectly participates in the inflammatory reaction in adipose tissue during obesity. The experimental evidence shows that LPS is involved in the transition of macrophages from the  to the M1 phenotype. In addition, LPS inside adipocytes may activate caspase-4/5/11. This may induce a highly inflammatory type of programmed cell death (i.e. pyroptosis), which also occurs after infection with intracellular pathogens. Lipoproteins with or without LPS are taken up by adipocytes. Large adipocytes are more metabolically active and potentially more exposed to LPS than small adipocytes are. Thus, LPS might be involved in defining the adipocyte death size and the formation of crown-like structures. The adipocyte death size is reached when the intracellular concentration of LPS initiates pyroptosis. The mechanistic details remain to be elucidated, but the observations indicate that adipocytes are stimulated to cell death by processes that involve LPS from the gut . There is a complex interplay between the composition of the diet and . This influences the amount of LPS that is translocated from the gut. In particular, the lipid content of a meal may correlate with the amount of LPS built in to chylomicrons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26230509>Obesity Alters the Microbial Community Profile in Korean Adolescents.</a></h2><p>Obesity is an increasing public health concern worldwide. According to the latest Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report (2014), the incidence of child obesity in Korea has exceeded the OECD average. To better understand and control this condition, the present study examined the composition of the gut microbial community in normal and obese adolescents. Fecal samples were collected from 67 obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/, or ≥ 99th BMI percentile) and 67 normal (BMI < 25 kg/ or < 85th BMI percentile) Korean adolescents aged 13-16 years and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Analysis of bacterial composition according to taxonomic rank (genus, family, and phylum) revealed marked differences in the Bacteroides and Prevotella populations in normal and obese samples (p < 0.005) at the genus and family levels; however, there was no difference in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio between normal and obese adolescents samples at the phylum level (F/B normal = 0.50 ± 0.53; F/B obese = 0.56 ± 0.86; p = 0.384). Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between the compositions of several bacterial taxa and child obesity. Among these, Bacteroides and Prevotella showed the most significant association with BMI (p < 0.0001 and 0.0001, respectively). We also found that the composition of Bacteroides was negatively associated with triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-crp) (p = 0.0049, 0.0023, and 0.0038, respectively) levels, whereas that of Prevotella was positively associated with TG and hs-crp levels (p = 0.0394 and 0.0150, respectively). We then applied the association rule mining algorithm to generate "rules" to identify the association between the populations of multiple bacterial taxa and obesity; these rules were able to discriminate obese from normal states. Therefore, the present study describes a systemic approach to identify the association between bacterial populations in the gut and childhood obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26569380> depletion promotes browning of white adipose tissue and reduces obesity.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) promotes a lean and healthy phenotype and improves insulin sensitivity. In response to cold or exercise, brown fat cells also emerge in the white adipose tissue (WAT; also known as beige cells), a process known as browning. Here we show that the development of functional beige fat in the inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ingSAT) and perigonadal visceral adipose tissue (pgVAT) is promoted by the depletion of  either by means of antibiotic treatment or in germ-free mice. This leads to improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and decreased white fat and adipocyte size in lean mice, obese leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Such metabolic improvements are mediated by eosinophil infiltration, enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling and  macrophage polarization in the subcutaneous white fat depots of -depleted animals. The metabolic phenotype and the browning of the subcutaneous fat are impaired by the suppression of type 2 cytokine signaling, and they are reversed by recolonization of the antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice with microbes. These results provide insight into the -fat signaling axis and beige-fat development in health and metabolic disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30049384>Induction and Amelioration of Methotrexate-Induced Gastrointestinal Toxicity are Related to Immune Response and Gut .</a></h2><p>As a widely used anticancer and immunosuppressive agent, methotrexate (MTX) can induce multiple adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as gastrointestinal toxicity, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Gut  has been widely reported to be associated with the onset of multiple diseases as well as treatment outcomes of different drugs. In this study, mucosal injury was observed in MTX-treated mice, leading to significant changes in macrophages (i.e., M1/ ratio, P < 0.05) but not in dendritic cells. Moreover, the population, diversity and principal components of the gut  in mice were dramatically altered after MTX treatment in a time-dependent manner, and Bacteroidales exhibited the most distinct variation among all the taxa (P < 0.05). Bacteroides fragilis was significantly decreased with MTX treatment (P < 0.01) and tended to decrease proportionately with increasing macrophage density. Gavage of mice with B. fragilis ameliorated MTX-induced inflammatory reactions and modulate macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our results delineate a strong impact of the gut  on MTX-induced intestinal mucositis and provide a potential method for the prevention of such ADRs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Gut  is a key regulator of neurological inflammation. Nurturing with prebiotics is an effective  manipulation that can regulate host immunity and cognition. The aim of the present study was to test whether administration of the prebiotic Bimuno® (galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS) mixture) could ameliorate POCD and attenuate surgery-induced neuroinflammation through the -brain-axis.Adult rats undergoing abdominal surgery under isoflurane anesthesia were fed with water or prebiotic B-GOS supplementation (15 g/L) for 3 weeks. Novel objective recognition task was employed for testing cognitive changes on postoperative day three. Expression of microglial marker Iba-1 in the hippocampus was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Expression levels of phenotypic gene markers of activated microglia (M1: iNOS, CD68, CD32; : Ym1, CD206, and SOCS3) in hippocampus were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Feces were collected for microbial community analysis.Rats exhibited an impairment in novel objective recognition 3 days after surgery compared with control rats (P < .01). In the hippocampus, expressions of Iba-1 and M1 markers of surgical rats were significantly upregulated. Similarly, expressions of SOCS3 and CD206 in the hippocampus were upregulated. Additionally, increasing levels of IL-6 and IL-4 were evident in the hippocampus. Administration of B-GOS significantly alleviated cognitive decline induced by surgery (P < .01). B-GOS-fed rats showed a significantly downregulated activation of microglia and expressions of M1-related genes and SOCS3 and IL-6. While there was no significant difference in expressions of CD206 and Ym1 and IL-4 between the surgical and B-GOS groups. Analysis of gut  found that administration of B-GOS induced a significant change beta diversity of the gut  and proliferation of Bifidobacterium and other potentially anti-inflammatory microbes.Administration of B-GOS has a beneficial effect on regulating neuroinflammatory and cognitive impairment in a rat model of abdominal surgery and was associated with the manipulation of gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28804459>Metabolic Variability of a Multispecies Probiotic Preparation Impacts on the Anti-inflammatory Activity.</a></h2><p> In addition to strain taxonomy, the ability of probiotics to confer beneficial effects on the host rely on a number of additional factors including epigenetic modulation of bacterial genes leading to metabolic variability and might impact on probiotic functionality.  To investigate metabolism and functionality of two different batches of a probiotic blend commercialized under the same name in Europe in models of intestinal inflammation.  Boxes of VSL#3, a probiotic mixture used in the treatment of pouchitis, were obtained from pharmacies in UK subjected to metabolomic analysis and their functionality tested in mice rendered colitis by treatment with DSS or TNBS.  VSL#3-A (lot DM538), but not VSL#3-B (lot 507132), attenuated "clinical" signs of colitis in the DSS and TNBS models. In both models, VSL#3-A, but not VSL#3-B, reduced macroscopic scores, intestinal permeability, and expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNAs, while increased the expression of TGFβ and IL-10, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNAs and shifted colonic macrophages from a M1 to  phenotype ( < 0.05 vs. TNBS). In contrast, VSL#3-B failed to reduce inflammation, and worsened intestinal permeability in the DSS model ( < 0.001 vs. VSL#3-A). A metabolomic analysis of the two formulations allowed the identification of two specific patterns, with at least three-folds enrichment in the concentrations of four metabolites, including 1-3 dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an intermediate in the fructose metabolism, in VSL#3-B supernatants. Feeding mice with DHA, increased intestinal permeability.  Two batches of a commercially available probiotic show divergent metabolic activities.

In contrast to its significant pharmacological effects in clinic, the plasma level of BBR is very low. Our previous work revealed that dihydroberberine (dhBBR) could be an absorbable form of BBR in the intestine, and butyrate is an active metabolite that is generated by gut bacteria in rats. In this study, for the first time we describe gut -regulated pharmacokinetics in beagle dogs after oral administration of BBR by single (50 mg/kg) or multiple doses (50 mg/kg/d) for 7 days. GC-MS, GC, LC-MS/MS, and LC/MS-IT-TOF were used to detect dhBBR, butyrate and BBR as well as its Phase I and II metabolites, respectively. The results showed that dhBBR was not detected in dog plasma but was excreted in small amounts in the feces of dogs examined on days 3 and 7. Butyrate was generated by gut bacteria and increased by 1.3- and 1.2-fold in plasma or feces, respectively, after 7 days of BBR treatment compared to the levels before treatment. Changes of intestinal bacterial composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA genes analysis. The results presented that dogs treated with BBR for 7 days increased both the abundance of the butyrate- and the nitroreductases- producing bacteria. We also identified chemical structures of the Phase I and II metabolites and analyzed their contents in beagle dogs. Eleven metabolites were detected in plasma and feces after BBR oral administration (50 mg/kg) to dogs, including 8 metabolites of Phase I and III metabolites of Phase II. The pharmacokinetic profile indicated that the concentration of BBR in plasma was low, with a  value of 36.88 ± 23.45 ng/mL. The relative content of glucuronic acid conjugates (M11) was higher than those of other metabolites (M1, , M12, and M14) in plasma. BBR was detected in feces, with high excreted amounts on day 3 (2625.04 ± 1726.94 μg/g) and day 7 (2793.43 ± 488.10 μg/g). In summary, this is the first study to describe gut -regulated pharmacokinetics in beagle dogs after oral administration of BBR, which is beneficial for discovery of drugs with poor absorption but good therapeutic efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521585> control acute arterial inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia development after arterial injury.</a></h2><p>The  has a functional role in a number of inflammatory processes and disease states. While neointimal hyperplasia development has been linked to inflammation, a direct role of the  in neointimal hyperplasia has not yet been established. Germ-free (GF) mice are an invaluable model for studying causative links between commensal organisms and the host. We hypothesized that GF mice would exhibit altered neointimal hyperplasia following carotid ligation compared to conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice.Twenty-week-old male C57BL/6 GF mice underwent left carotid ligation under sterile conditions. Maintenance of sterility was assessed by cultivation and 16S rRNA qPCR of stool. Neointimal hyperplasia was assessed by morphometric and histologic analysis of arterial sections after 28 days. Local arterial cell proliferation and inflammation was assessed by immunofluorescence for Ki67 and inflammatory cell markers at five days. Systemic inflammation was assessed by multiplex immunoassays of serum. CONV-R mice treated in the same manner served as the control cohort. GF and CONV-R mice were compared using standard statistical methods.All GF mice remained sterile during the entire study period. Twenty-eight days after carotid ligation, CONV-R mice had significantly more neointimal hyperplasia development compared to GF mice, as assessed by intima area, media area, intima+media area, and intima area/(intima+media) area. The collagen content of the neointimal lesions appeared qualitatively similar on Masson's trichrome staining. There was significantly reduced Ki67 immunoreactivity in the media and adventitia of GF carotid arteries 5 days after ligation. GF mice also had increased arterial infiltration of anti-inflammatory  macrophages compared to CONV-R mouse arteries and a reduced proportion of mature neutrophils. GF mice had significantly reduced serum IFN-γ-inducible protein (IP)-10 and MIP-2 5 days after carotid ligation, suggesting a reduced systemic inflammatory response.GF mice have attenuated neointimal hyperplasia development compared to CONV-R mice, which is likely related to altered kinetics of wound healing and acute inflammation.

Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp), gut permeability (sugar and polyethylene glycol absorption tests, plasma zonulin), and gut  profiles (high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were assessed before and after overfeeding, and 14 d after intervention. Additionally, inflammation markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, leptin, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, calprotectin, regulated on activation normal, T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were measured in plasma by ELISA. Finally, lipid parameters were analyzed in serum by a laboratory service.Although participants gained 0.9 ± 0.6 kg (P < 0.001) body weight, overnutrition was not associated with a significant change in insulin sensitivity (M value and glucose disposal). Overfeeding for 7 d resulted in elevated serum total (10.2%), LDL (14.6%) and HDL (14.8%) cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.01). In contrast, fasting plasma triglyceride significantly declined (29.3%) during overfeeding (P < 0.001). In addition, there were no significant changes in inflammatory markers. Urine excretion of 4 sugars and polyethylene glycol, used as a proxy for gut permeability, and plasma concentration of zonulin, a marker of paracellular gut permeability, were unchanged. Moreover, overfeeding was not associated with consistent changes in gut  profiles, but marked alterations were observed in a subgroup of 6 individuals.Our findings suggest that short-term overfeeding with an HFD does not significantly impair insulin sensitivity and gut permeability in normal-weight healthy men, and that changes in dominant communities of fecal bacteria occur only in certain individuals.

YZG-331 was reduced by 14, 11, 6, 46, and 11% within 120 min incubation in human, monkey, dog, rat, and mouse liver microsomes (LMs), respectively. However, YZG-331 was stable in human, monkey, dog, rat, and mouse liver cytoplasm.

Interestingly, the systemic exposure of  and M3 in rats and mice treated with antibiotics were significantly decreased in the pseudo germ-free group. YZG-331 could be metabolized in rat and human liver under the catalysis of CYP enzymes, and the metabolism showed species variation. In addition, 3 phase I metabolites were identified via hydroxyl (M1), hydrolysis (), or hydrolysis/ hydroxyl (M3) pathway. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 (FMO1) and FMO3 participated in the conversion of YZG-331 in rat LMs. Nevertheless, YZG-331 expressed stability with recombinant human FMOs, which further confirmed the species variation in the metabolism. Overall, these studies suggested that YZG-331 is not stable in LMs and gut . CYP450 enzymes and FMOs mediated the metabolism of YZG-331, and the metabolic pathway showed species difference.

Nonetheless, a specific role of obesity and its interaction with genetics in the progression of Crohn's disease (CD) is unclear.We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with CD enrolled in Prospective Registry in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study at Massachusetts General Hospital (PRISM). Information on diagnosis of CD and its complications were collected and confirmed through review of medical records. A genetic risk score was calculated using previously reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms-associated genome-wide with CD susceptibility. We used logistic regression to estimate the effect of body mass index (BMI) and its interaction with genetic risk on risk of CD complications.Among 846 patients with CD, 350 required surgery, 242 with penetrating disease, 182 with stricturing disease, and 226 with perianal disease. There were no associations between obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/) and risk of perianal disease, stricturing disease, or surgery. Compared with normal-weight individuals with BMI < 25 kg/, obesity was associated with lower risk of penetrating disease (odds ratio [OR = 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.99). This association persists among a subgroup of participants with available BMI before development of penetrating disease (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.16-0.88). There were no interactions between BMI and genetic risk score on risk of CD complications (all P interaction > 0.28).Our data suggest that obesity does not negatively impact long-term progression of CD, even after accounting for genetic predisposition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532570>Characterization of a dehydratase and methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide in Lachnospiraceae.</a></h2><p>As a result of the exponential increase in genomic data, discovery of novel ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) has progressed rapidly in the past decade.

However, recent analyses have deciphered a rather broad diversity of microbes in cleanrooms, whose origin as well as physiological status has not been fully understood. Here, we examined the input of intact microbial cells from a surrounding built environment into a spacecraft assembly cleanroom by applying a molecular viability assay based on propidium monoazide (PMA). The controlled cleanroom (CCR) was characterized by ~6.2*103 16S rRNA gene copies of intact bacterial cells per  floor surface, which only represented 1% of the total community that could be captured via molecular assays without viability marker. This was in contrast to the uncontrolled adjoining facility (UAF) that had 12 times more living bacteria. Regarding diversity measures retrieved from 16S rRNA Illumina-tag analyzes, we observed, however, only a minor drop in the cleanroom facility allowing the conclusion that the number but not the diversity of microbes is strongly affected by cleaning procedures. Network analyses allowed tracking a substantial input of living microbes to the cleanroom and a potential enrichment of survival specialists like bacterial spore formers and archaeal halophiles and mesophiles. Moreover, the cleanroom harbored a unique community including 11 exclusive genera, e.g., Haloferax and Sporosarcina, which are herein suggested as indicators of cleanroom environments. In sum, our findings provide evidence that archaea are alive in cleanrooms and that cleaning efforts and cleanroom maintenance substantially decrease the number but not the diversity of indoor microbiomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27100399>The Influence of Prebiotic Arabinoxylan Oligosaccharides on  Derived Uremic Retention Solutes in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>The colonic microbial metabolism is a key contributor to uremic retention solutes accumulating in patients with CKD, relating to adverse outcomes and insulin resistance. Whether prebiotics can reduce intestinal generation of these microbial metabolites and improve insulin resistance in CKD patients not yet on dialysis remains unknown. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study in 40 patients with eGFR between 15 and 45 ml/min/1.73 . Patients were randomized to sequential treatment with prebiotic arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) (10 g twice daily) and maltodextrin for 4 weeks, or vice versa, with a 4-week wash-out period between both intervention periods. Serum levels and 24h urinary excretion of p-cresyl sulfate, p-cresyl glucuronide, indoxyl sulfate, trimethylamine N-oxide and phenylacetylglutamine were determined at each time point using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR). A total of 39 patients completed the study. We observed no significant effect of AXOS on serum p-cresyl sulfate (P 0.42), p-cresyl glucuronide (P 0.59), indoxyl sulfate (P 0.70) and phenylacetylglutamine (P 0.41) and a small, albeit significant decreasing effect on serum trimethylamine N-oxide (P 0.04). There were neither effect of AXOS on 24h urinary excretion of p-cresyl sulfate (P 0.31), p-cresyl glucuronide (P 0.23), indoxyl sulfate (P 0.87) and phenylacetylglutamine (P 0.43), nor on 24h urinary excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide (P 0.97). In addition, we observed no significant change in HOMA-IR (P 0.93).

Animal models point to sex hormone-related differentials in  composition. In this study, we investigated the relationship of sex, body mass index (BMI) and dietary fiber intake with the gut  in 82 humans. We sequenced fecal 16S rRNA genes by 454 FLX technology, then clustered and classified the reads to microbial genomes using the QIIME pipeline. Relationships of sex, BMI, and fiber intake with overall gut  composition and specific taxon abundances were assessed by permutational MANOVA and multivariate logistic regression, respectively. We found that sex was associated with the gut  composition overall (p=0.001). The gut  in women was characterized by a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes (p=0.03). BMI (>25 kg/ vs. <25 kg/) was associated with the gut  composition overall (p=0.05), and this relationship was strong in women (p=0.03) but not in men (p=0.29). Fiber from beans and from fruits and vegetables were associated, respectively, with greater abundance of Actinobacteria (p=0.006 and false discovery rate adjusted q=0.05) and Clostridia (p=0.009 and false discovery rate adjusted q=0.09).

This association has prompted research into alternative treatments aimed at modulating intestinal . Given the novelty of these treatments, scarce evidence regarding their effectiveness in clinical populations exists.This meta-analysis sought to systemically review and quantitatively synthesize evidence on prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic therapies for patients with NAFLD in randomized controlled trials.PRISMA guidelines ensured transparent reporting of evidence. PICOS criteria defined the research question for the systematic review. A systematic keyword search in PubMed and EMBASE identified 25 studies: 9 assessed prebiotic, 11 assessed probiotic, and 7 assessed symbiotic therapies for a total of 1309 patients.Basic population characteristics, the primary variables of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (utilized for NAFLD diagnosis), and the secondary variables of body mass index (BMI), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and triglyceridges (TAG) were extracted. Pooled effect sizes of these variables were calculated by meta-analysis. No publication bias was identified using Begg's and Egger's tests or Cochrane bias assessment tool.Meta-analysis indicated that microbial therapies significantly reduced BMI (-0.37 kg/; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.46 to -0.28; P < 0.001), hepatic enzymes (ALT, -6.9 U/L [95%CI, -9.4 to -4.3]; AST, -4.6 U/L [95%CI, -6.6 to -2.7]; γ-GT, -7.9 U/L [95%CI, -11.4 to -4.4]; P < 0.001), serum cholesterol (-10.1 mg/dL 95%CI, -13.6 to -6.6; P < 0.001), LDL-c (-4.5 mg/dL; 95%CI, -8.9 to -0.17; P < 0.001), and TAG (-10.1 mg/dL; 95%CI, -18.0 to -2.3; P < 0.001), but not inflammation (TNF-α, -2.0 ng/mL; [95%CI, -4.7 to 0.61]; CRP, -0.74 mg/L [95%CI, -1.9 to 0.37]). Subgroup analysis by treatment category indicated similar effects of prebiotics and probiotics on BMI and liver enzymes but not total cholesterol, HDL-c, and LDL-c.This meta-analysis supports the potential use of microbial therapies in the treatment of NAFLD and sheds light on their potential mode of action. Further research into these treatments should consider the limitations of biomarkers currently used for the diagnosis and progression of NAFLD, in addition to the inherent challenges of personalized microbial-based therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29674267>Anti-inflammatory effect of multistrain probiotic formulation (L. rhamnosus, B. lactis, and B. longum).</a></h2><p>In recent years, a great number of studies have been directed toward the evaluation of gastrointestinal  modulation through the introduction of beneficial microorganisms, also known as probiotics. Many studies have highlighted how this category of bacteria is very important for the good development, functioning, and maintenance of our immune system. There is a delicate balance between the immune system, located under the gut epithelial barrier, and the , but many factors can induce a disequilibrium that leads to an inflammatory state and dysbiosis. The aim of this work is to verify the anti-inflammatory effects of a probiotic formulation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum (Serobioma).To mimic the natural host compartmentalization between probiotics and immune cells through the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro, the transwell model was used. We focused on a particular subset of immune cells that play a key role in the mucosal immune system. The immunomodulatory effects of probiotic formulation were investigated in the human macrophage cell line THP1 and macrophages derived from ex vivo human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Probiotic formulation induced a significant increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) production and was able to decrease the secretion of the major proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 by 70% and 80%, respectively. Finally, for the first time, the ability of probiotic formulation to favor the macrophage  phenotype has been identified.The transwell model is an intriguing toll approach to studying the human epithelial barrier.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of early use of antibiotic (EUA), blood  and plasmatic citrulline (marker of the intestinal barrier) on nivolumab efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We included all consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab in our Department between 2014 and 2017. Blood  was analyzed at month (M) M0 and . Citrulline rates were evaluated at M0, , M4 and M6.Seventy-two patients were included (EUA in 42%). Overall survival (OS) was longer without EUA (median 13.4 months) than with EUA (5.1 months, p = 0.03). Thirty-five patients (49%) had plasma samples available. High citrulline rate (≥20 μM) at M0 was associated with tumor response (p = 0.084) and clinical benefit (nivolumab > 6 months) (p = 0.002). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.9 months (high citrulline) vs 1.6 months (low citrulline) (p < 0.0001), and median OS were respectively non reached vs 2.2 months (p < 0.0001). Patients with EUA had lower median citrulline rates at M0: 21 μM (IQR 15.0-30.8) vs 32 μM (IQR 24.0-42.0) without EUA (p = 0.044). The presence of specific bacterial DNA in blood at M0 was associated with response and clinical benefit (Peptostreptococcae, Paludibaculum, Lewinella) or with tumor progression (Gemmatimonadaceae). Multivariate analyses on PFS and OS confirmed the prognostic role of citrulline and blood .EUA is associated with shorter OS with nivolumab and lower citrulline rates.

As an important regulator of intestinal microenvironment, gut  plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, a metastasis-related secretory protein cathepsin K (CTSK) was identified as a vital mediator between the imbalance of intestinal  and CRC metastasis. We implanted MC38 cells into the cecal mesentry of antibiotic-treated mice with intragastrically administration of E. coli to mimic gut  imbalance. The bigger primary tumors and more liver metastatic foci were detected in the E. coli group accompanied with high LPS secretion and CTSK overexpression compared with that in the control group. CTSK contributes to the aggressive phenotype of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing CTSK or administration of Odanacatib, a CTSK-specific inhibitor, totally abolished the CTSK-enhanced migration and motility of CRC cells. Interestingly, the tumor-secreted CTSK could bind to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to stimulate the  polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via an mTOR-dependent pathway. Recombinant CTSK could neither stimulate CRC growth and metastasis, nor induce  macrophage polarization in TRL4 mice. Meanwhile, CTSK could stimulate the secretion of cytokines by  TAMs including IL10 and IL17, which, in turn, promote the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells through NFκB pathway. Clinically, overexpression of CTSK in human CRC tissues is always accompanied with high  TAMs in the stroma, and correlated with CRC metastasis and poor prognosis. Our current research identified CTSK as a mediator between the imbalance of gut  and CRC metastasis. More importantly, we illustrated a CTSK-mediated-positive feedback loop between CRC cells and TAMs during metastasis, prompting CTSK as a novel predictive biomarker and feasible therapeutic target for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30556500>Drug Development Strategy for Type 2 Diabetes: Targeting Positive Energy Balances.</a></h2><p>Newer classes of medications have been proven useful in glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D), but many do not appear capable to slow down the progressive loss of ß-cell function, or to improve population-level glycemic control. Positive energy balance, e.g. surplus energy intake over expenditure, is at the core for developing metabolic syndrome and T2D. Currently available glycemic control drugs come to the market based on their 1-2 years risk-benefit profiles, but most of them do not correct positive energy balance and lose efficacy in the long-term. This denouement is destined by a positive energy balance of T2D. There is continuous endeavor/investment in new drugs for T2D. In this review, we compared the effects of commonly used oral hypoglycemic agents on energy balance and discussed several novel therapeutic targets/approaches for T2D that could potentially correct positive energy balance: changing the composition of intestinal host- to alleviate excess caloric consumption, controlling chylomicron uptake into intestinal lacteals to reduce excessive caloric intake, and activating pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) to ameliorate glucose metabolism and increase energy expenditure. We further reviewed how nicotine affects body weight and ameliorates positive energy balance, and ways to encourage people to adopt a more healthy lifestyle by exercising more and/or decreasing caloric intake. These potential targets/approaches may hopefully correct positive energy balance, delay disease progression, reverse some pathophysiological changes, and eventually prevent and/or cure the disease. Drug development strategies applying new insights into T2D process and therapeutic index to correct positive energy balance need to be seriously considered.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107222>Comprehensive characterization of the in vitro and in vivo metabolites of limonin in human samples using LC-Q-TOF/MS.</a></h2><p>Limonin is a bitter triterpenoid dilactone in the genus Citrus with potential medicinal value.

We explored the effect of the habitual diet and adherence to the dietary reference values on gut  composition and diversity. Further, the association of gut  with serum lipidomics and low-grade inflammation was evaluated. Overweight and obese women (BMI 30·7 (sd 4·4) kg/, n 100) were studied at early pregnancy (≤17 weeks). Intakes of nutrients were calculated from 3-d food diaries. Faecal  composition was analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Fasting serum lipidomic profiles were determined by NMR. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, glycoprotein acetylation (GlycA) and lipopolysaccharide activity were used as markers for low-grade inflammation. The recommended dietary intake of fibre and fat was related to higher gut  richness and lower abundance of Bacteroidaceae. Correlations were observed between gut  richness and GlycA and between a few  genera and serum lipoprotein particles. As a conclusion, adherence to the dietary reference intake of fat and fibre was associated with beneficial gut  composition, which again contributed to lipidomic profile. Higher gut  richness and nutrient intakes were linked to a lower level of low-grade inflammation marker GlycA.

Its major constituent kakkalide is metabolized to irisolidone by gut . This research study was undertaken to understand the anti-colitis mechanism of kakkalide and irisolidone in vitro and in vivo. Kakkalide and its metabolite irisolidone inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression in macrophages. They also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of IRAK1 and TAK1 and activation of NF-κB by inhibiting the binding of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated LPS in vitro. Orally administered irisolidone or kakkalide alleviated colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Their treatments also protected epithelial cell disruption and infiltration of CD11b/CD11c cells in the colon. Furthermore, they suppressed TNBS-induced expression of M1 macrophage markers TNF-α, CD80, CD86, and Arg2 expression while the expression of  macrophage markers Arg1, CD163, CD206, and IL-10 was induced. They also suppressed the fecal Proteobacteria population. Overall, the anti-colitic effects of irisolidone were superior to those of kakkalide.

The tryptophan intake was evaluated by a 24-hours dietary recall (R-24h) performed on 3 different days. Routine biochemical tests and anthropometric measurements were evaluated. IS plasma levels were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescent detection and the interleukin-6 (IL-6) plasma levels by immunoenzymatic method (ELISA, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay).The average of tryptophan intake was according to recommendation, but IS plasma levels (35.0 ± 11.9 mg/L) were elevated, however according to the EUTox values for uremic individuals. There was no correlation between the tryptophan intake and IS plasma levels. However, there was positive correlation between protein intake and tryptophan and variables used to evaluate lean body mass, and moreover, IS levels were positively associated with IL-6 (r = 0.6: p = 0.01).The present study suggests that tryptophan dietary intake may not be a determinant factor to IS levels. However, it suggests that gut  may play an important role in systemic inflammation in patients with CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202619>Exopolysaccharide from  Induces Anti-Inflammatory  Macrophages That Prevent T Cell-Mediated Disease.</a></h2><p>Commensal bacteria contribute to immune homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the underlying mechanisms for this are not well understood. A single dose of exopolysaccharide (EPS) from the probiotic spore-forming bacterium  protects mice from acute colitis induced by the enteric pathogen  Adoptive transfer of macrophage-rich peritoneal cells from EPS-treated mice confers protection from disease to recipient mice. In vivo, EPS induces development of anti-inflammatory  macrophages in a TLR4-dependent manner, and these cells inhibit T cell activation in vitro and in -infected mice. In vitro,  macrophages inhibit CD4 and CD8 T cells. The inhibition of CD4 T cells is dependent on TGF-β, whereas inhibition of CD8 T cells is dependent on TGF-β and PD-L1. We suggest that administration of  EPS can be used to broadly inhibit T cell activation and, thus, control T cell-mediated immune responses in numerous inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923967>Innate recognition of influenza virus and vaccine development.</a></h2><p>Understanding the mechanisms by which influenza viruses are recognized by the innate immune system to elicit a protective adaptive immune response is essential for the development of effective vaccines.

Given the emerging evidence on immune- interactions in CRC, we also sought to examine the interaction between macrophages and gut . To induce CRC, male C57BL/6 mice ( n = 32) received a single injection of azoxymethane (AOM), followed by three cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-supplemented water in weeks 1, 4, and 7. Prior to the final DSS cycle ( week 7) and twice weekly until euthanasia, mice ( n = 16/group) received either 200 μl ip of clodronate-filled liposomes (CLD) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) encapsulated liposomes to deplete macrophages. Colon tissue was analyzed for polyp burden, macrophage markers, transcription factors, and inflammatory mediators. Stool samples were collected, and DNA was isolated and subsequently sequenced for 16S rRNA. Clodronate liposomes decreased tumor number by ∼36% and specifically large (≥1 mm) tumors by ∼36% ( P < 0.05). This was consistent with a decrease in gene expression of EMR1 in the colon tissue and polyp tissue as well as expression of select markers associated with M1 (IL-6) and  macrophages (IL-13, IL-10, TGFβ, CCL17) in the colon tissue ( P < 0.05). Similarly, there was a decrease in STAT3 and p38 MAPK and ERK signaling in colon tissue. Clodronate liposomes increased the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum ( P < 0.05) and specifically Lactobacillaceae and Clostridiaceae families, which have been associated with reduced CRC risk. Overall, these data support the development of therapeutic strategies to target macrophages in CRC and provide support for further evaluation of immune- interactions in CRC. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that macrophage depletion during late-stage tumorigenesis is effective at reducing tumor growth. This was associated with a decrease in macrophage markers and chemokines in the colon tissue and a decrease in transcription factors that are linked to colorectal cancer. The macrophage-depleted group was found to have an increased abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum with documented anti-tumorigenic effects. Overall, these data support the development of therapeutic strategies to target macrophages in colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546102>Impact of CFTR modulation with Ivacaftor on Gut  and Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Next to progressive airway disease, CF is also associated with intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has improved pulmonary and nutritional status but its effects on the intestinal  and inflammation are unclear. Hence, we assessed the changes on the intestinal microbial communities (16S rRNA variable 3 gene region) and inflammatory markers (calprotectin and -pyruvate kinase [-PK]) in 16 CF individuals (8 children and 8 adults) before and after (median 6.1 months) ivacaftor. Stool calprotectin significantly decreased following ivacaftor (median [IQR]: 154.4 [102.1-284.2] vs. 87.5 [19.5-190.2] mg/kg, P = 0.03). There was a significant increase in Akkermansia with ivacaftor. Increased abundance of Akkermansia was associated with normal stool -PK concentrations, and decreased abundances of Enterobacteriaceae correlated with decreased stool calprotectin concentrations. In summary, changes in the gut  and decrease in intestinal inflammation was associated with Ivacaftor treatment among individuals with CF carrying at least one gating CFTR mutation. Thus, CFTR-modifying therapy may adequately improve the aberrant pathophysiology and milieu of the CF gut to favor a more healthy , which in turn reduces intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622429>Gut  Dysbiosis and Immunometabolism: New Frontiers for Treatment of Metabolic Diseases.</a></h2><p>Maintenance of healthy human metabolism depends on a symbiotic consortium among bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and host eukaryotic cells throughout the human gastrointestinal tract. Microbial communities provide the enzymatic machinery and the metabolic pathways that contribute to food digestion, xenobiotic metabolism, and production of a variety of bioactive molecules. These include vitamins, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and metabolites, which are essential for the interconnected pathways of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid/Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have been elucidating how nutrients that fuel the metabolic processes impact on the ways immune cells, in particular, macrophages, respond to different stimuli under physiological and pathological conditions and become activated and acquire a specialized function. The two major inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages are controlled through differential consumption of glucose, glutamine, and oxygen. M1 phenotype is triggered by polarization signal from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1 proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-, TNF-, and IL-1, or both, whereas  phenotype is triggered by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF, or glucocorticoids. Glucose utilization and production of chemical mediators including ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and NADPH support effector activities of M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis is an imbalance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites. It is now known that the gut -derived products induce low-grade inflammatory activation of tissue-resident macrophages and contribute to metabolic and degenerative diseases, including diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Here, we update the potential interplay of host gut  dysbiosis and metabolic diseases. We also summarize on advances on fecal therapy, probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and nutrients and small molecule inhibitors of metabolic pathway enzymes as prophylactic and therapeutic agents for metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833897>Glabridin Prevents Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity Through Gut  Modulation and Colonic Macrophage Polarization in Mice.</a></h2><p>The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) provokes a dose-related cardiotoxicity. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we demonstrated that glabridin (GLA), an isoflavone from licorice root, prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut  modulation and colonic macrophage polarization in mice. GLA reduced DOX-induced leakage of myocardial enzymes including aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase-MB. GLA downregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved-caspase 9 and cleaved-caspase 3) and upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins (HAX-1 and Bcl-2) in the cardiac tissues. In addition, GLA modulated DOX-induced dysbiosis of gut  and thereby decreased the ratio of M1/ colonic macrophage, accompanied by the downregulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and upregulated butyrate in the feces and peripheral blood. The leakage of myocardial enzymes induced by the DOX was decreased by antibiotics treatment, but not altered by co-treatment with the GLA and antibiotics. The ratio of M1/ colonic macrophage and leakage of myocardial enzymes reduced by the GLA were greatly increased by the  or LPS but decreased by the butyrate. Depletion of the macrophage attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity but failed to further affect the effects of GLA. Importantly, GLA decreased production of M1 cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) but increased production of  cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the colonic macrophage with the downregulation of NF-κB and the upregulation of STAT6. In summary, GLA prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut  modulation and colonic macrophage polarization, and may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29120476>Linking iron-deficiency with allergy: role of molecular allergens and the .</a></h2><p>Atopic individuals tend to develop a Th2 dominant immune response, resulting in hyperresponsiveness to harmless antigens, termed allergens. In the last decade, epidemiological studies have emerged that connected allergy with a deficient iron-status. Immune activation under iron-deficient conditions results in the expansion of Th2-, but not Th1 cells, can induce class-switching in B-cells and hampers the proper activation of , but not M1 macrophages. Moreover, many allergens, in particular with the lipocalin and lipocalin-like folds, seem to be capable of binding iron indirectly via siderophores harboring catechol moieties. The resulting locally restricted iron-deficiency may then lead during immune activation to the generation of Th2-cells and thus prepare for allergic sensitization. Moreover, iron-chelators seem to also influence clinical reactivity: mast cells accumulate iron before degranulation and seem to respond differently depending on the type of the encountered siderophore. Whereas deferoxamine triggers degranulation of connective tissue-type mast cells, catechol-based siderophores reduce activation and degranulation and improve clinical symptoms. Considering the complex interplay of iron, siderophores and immune molecules, it remains to be determined whether iron-deficiencies are the cause or the result of allergy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451811>Sodium butyrate-modified sulfonated polyetheretherketone modulates macrophage behavior and shows enhanced antibacterial and osteogenic functions during implant-associated infections.</a></h2><p>Prevention of implant-associated infections and insufficient bone tissue integration is critical to exploit the immunomodulatory properties and antibacterial effects of implant materials, which have attracted considerable attention. Modulation of the functions of immune cells in different environments is crucial for managing infection and inferior bone integration via immunomodulation. In this work, sodium butyrate, a fermentation product of gut , was loaded onto 3D porous sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SP) to modulate the immune responses of cells in different environments. Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial effects showed that sodium butyrate-loaded SP exhibited superior antibacterial activity, especially in the samples containing high concentrations of sodium butyrate. Under bacterial stimulation, the phagocytic activity of macrophages increased with an increase in the sodium butyrate concentration via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which favoured bactericidal activity in the implant-associated infection stage. For bacterial elimination, sodium butyrate-containing SP could polarize macrophages to the  phenotype and subsequently stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, which is considered beneficial for bone regeneration in the tissue repair stage. In vitro osteogenesis was evaluated and the results demonstrated that treatment with sodium butyrate-containing SP increased the expression of osteogenic genes and proteins. An in vivo rat osteomyelitis model was used to evaluate the protective effect of the SP-loaded with sodium butyrate on bone destruction and osteolysis under infection conditions. To study osteogenesis in vivo, a rat femoral model without infection was used. The results indicated that the SP-B2 group exhibited superior anti-infection capacity and induced new bone formation around the implant in vivo. Treatment with sodium butyrate-containing porous SP modulated the macrophage response under different stimuli, thereby serving as a new approach for the design of smart implant materials with superior antibacterial and bone repair properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636639> Suppresses the Production of Proinflammatory Cytokines in -Infected Macrophages by Inhibiting the Expression of ADAM17.</a></h2><p>The ability of  to evade the host immune system allows the bacterium to colonize the host for a lifetime. Long-term infection with  causes chronic inflammation, which is the major risk factor for the development of gastric ulcers and gastric cancer. Lactobacilli are part of the human  and have been studied as an adjunct treatment in  eradication therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which lactobacilli act against  infection have not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of  strains upon coincubation of host macrophages with . We found that  Kx110A1 (L. gas), a strain isolated from a human stomach, but not other tested  species, blocked the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in -infected macrophages. Interestingly, L. gas also inhibited the release of these cytokines in LPS or LTA stimulated macrophages, demonstrating a general anti-inflammatory property. The inhibition of these cytokines did not occur through the polarization of macrophages from the M1 (proinflammatory) to  (anti-inflammatory) phenotype or through the altered viability of  or host cells. Instead, we show that L. gas suppressed the release of TNF and IL-6 by reducing the expression of ADAM17 (also known as TNF-alpha-converting enzyme, TACE) on host cells. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which L. gas prevents the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in host macrophages.Copyright © 2019 Gebremariam, Qazi, Somiah, Pathak, Sjölinder, Sverremark Ekström and Jonsson.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362639>Mixture of Two Lactobacillus plantarum Strains Modulates the Gut  Structure and Regulatory T Cell Response in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>The gut  has been linked to diet-induced obesity, and microorganisms that influence obesity have important health implications.

However, most pure microorganisms can degrade only limited species of NP with low degradation efficiencies. To establish a microbial consortium that can effectively degrade different forms of NP, in this study, we isolated a facultative microbial consortium NP- and characterized the biodegradation of NP by it. NP- could degrade 75.61% and 89.75% of 1000 mg/L NP within 48 h and 8 days, respectively; an efficiency higher than that of any other consortium or pure microorganism reported so far. The addition of yeast extract promoted the biodegradation more significantly than that of glucose. Moreover, surface-active compounds secreted into the extracellular environment were hypothesized to promote high-efficiency metabolism of NP. The detoxification of NP by this consortium was determined. The degradation pathway was hypothesized to be initiated by oxidization of the benzene ring, followed by step-wise side-chain biodegradation. The bacterial composition of NP- was determined using 16S rDNA library, and the consortium was found to mainly comprise members of the Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Alicycliphilus, and Acidovorax genera, with the former two accounting for 86.86% of the consortium. The high degradation efficiency of NP- indicated that it could be a promising candidate for NP bioremediation in situ.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants maintained habitual self-selected 8-hour sleep schedules for 2 weeks at home prior to a 4-day laboratory visit that included one sleep opportunity per day: 8 hours on night 1, 3 hours on night 2, and 3 hours on mornings 3 and 4. After 3 days of unscheduled sleep at home, participants repeated the entire protocol. Stability and task dependency of individual differences in performance were quantified by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Kendall's Tau, respectively.Performance on Stroop, Visual Search, and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test were highly consistent within individuals during combined sleep restriction and circadian misalignment. Individual differences were trait-like as indicated by ICCs (0.54-0.96) classified according to standard criteria as moderate to almost perfect. Individual differences on other performance tasks commonly reported in sleep studies showed fair to almost perfect ICCs (0.22-0.94). Kendall's rank correlations showed that individual vulnerability to sleep restriction and circadian misalignment varied by task and by metric within a task.Consistent vulnerability of higher-order cognition and maintenance of wakefulness to combined sleep restriction and circadian misalignment has implications for the development of precision countermeasure strategies for workers performing safety-critical tasks, e.g. military, police, health care workers and emergency responders.© Sleep Research Society 2019.

We further examined the iron bioavailability of Mankai in rats.Two hundred and ninety-four abdominally obese/dyslipidemic [mean age = 51.1 y; body mass index (kg/) = 31.3; 88% men] nonanemic participants were randomly assigned to physical activity (PA), PA + MED diet, or PA + green-MED diet. Both isocaloric MED groups consumed 28 g walnuts/d and the low-meat green-MED group further consumed green tea (800 mL/d) and Mankai (100 g green shake/d). In a complementary animal experiment, after 44 d of an iron deficiency anemia-inducing diet, 50 female rats (age = 3 wk; Sprague Dawley strain) were randomly assigned into: iron-deficient diet (vehicle), or vehicle + iso-iron: ferrous gluconate (FG) 14, Mankai 50, and Mankai 80 versions (1.7 mg · kg-1 · d-1 elemental iron), or FG9.5 and Mankai 50-C version (1.15 mg · kg-1 · d-1 elemental iron). The specific primary aim for both studies was changes in iron homeostasis parameters.After 6 mo of intervention, iron status trajectory did not differ between the PA and PA + MED groups. Hemoglobin modestly increased in the PA + green-MED group (0.23 g/dL) compared with PA (-0.1 g/dL; P < 0.001) and PA + MED (-0.1 g/dL; P < 0.001). Serum iron and serum transferrin saturation increased in the PA + green-MED group compared with the PA group (8.21 μg/dL compared with -5.23 μg/dL and 2.39% compared with -1.15%, respectively; P < 0.05 for both comparisons), as did folic acid (P = 0.011). In rats, hemoglobin decreased from 15.7 to 9.4 mg/dL after 44 d of diet-induced anemia. After depletion treatment, the vehicle-treated group had a further decrease of 1.3 mg/dL, whereas hemoglobin concentrations in both FG and Mankai iso-iron treatments similarly rebounded (FG14: +10.8 mg/dL, Mankai 50: +6.4 mg/dL, Mankai 80: +7.3 mg/dL; FG9.5: +5.1 mg/dL, Mankai 50-C: +7.1 mg/dL; P < 0.05 for all vs. the vehicle group).In humans, a green-MED low-meat diet does not impair iron homeostasis.

In the United States, it is currently estimated that about 1.5 million people suffer from IBD, causing considerable suffering, mortality and economic loss every year. Yet the cause of IBD is unknown, and until we understand more, prevention or cure will not be possible. There is a lot of variation in the incidence and prevalence of CD based on geographic region, environment, immigrant population, and ethnic groups. The annual incidence of CD in North America is reported to be 3.1-20.2 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 201 per 100,000 population. Based on the epidemiological, genetic and immunological data, CD is considered to be a heterogeneous disorder with multifactorial etiology in which genetics and environment interact to manifest the disease. Several genes have been studied so for with respect to CD, but thus far the strong and replicated associations have been identified with NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1 genes. The risk factors implicated with CD include smoking, low fiber- high carbohydrate diet, altered  and medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CD is typically characterized by transmural inflammation of the intestine and could affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to perianal area. In terms of distribution of the disease 25% of the patients have colitis only, 25% is ileitis only and 50% have ileocolitis. The Montreal classification is based on the age at diagnosis (<16, 17-40, > 40), disease location (Ileal, colonic, Ileocolonic) and the disease behavior (nonstricturing/nonpenetrating, stricturing, penetrating). The key features for diagnosing CD comprises a combination of radiographic, endoscopic and pathological findings demonstrating focal, asymmetric, transmural or granulomatous features. Abdominal Computed tomography (CT) enterography is the most preferred first-line radiologic study used in the assessment of small bowel CD. The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis is similar to that of CT scans and also prevents exposure to ionizing radiation. Endoscopic scores are considered to be the gold standard tool to measure the activity of CD and they are used more commonly in the clinical trials to measure the efficacy of various drugs on inducing and maintaining mucosal healing. The most common scoring systems used to measure clinical disease activity include Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), HBI- Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and Lehmann score. Management of Crohn's disease has been seen as an evolving challenge owing to its widely heterogeneous manifestations, overlapping characteristics with other inflammatory disorders, often elusive extraintestinal manifestations and uncertain etiology. Therapeutic interventions are tailored to address symptomatic response and subsequent tolerance of the intervention. Chronology of treatment should favor treatment dose acute disease or "induction therapy", followed by maintenance of adequate response or remission, i.e. "maintenance therapy". The medications which are highly effective in inducing remission include steroids and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors. Medications used to maintain remission include 5-aminosalicyclic acid products, immunomodulators (Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) and TNF inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab and golimumab). Surgical interventions like bowel resection, stricturoplasty or drainage of abscess is required in up to two thirds of CD patients during their lifetime. The most common indications for surgical resection are medically refractory disease, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess not amenable to percutaneous drainage, intractable hemorrhage, dysplasia or cancer. Endoscopic recurrence in postoperative CD patients, as defined by Rutgeers score i2-i4 occur in 30-90% of the patients at the neoterminal ileum within 12 months of surgery and almost universally by 5 years. Treating CD requires a comprehensive care team including the patient, primary care provider, and gastroenterologist. In summary CD is a chronic inflammatory condition with a remitting and relapsing course primarily affecting relatively younger population with significant socioeconomic effects.Copyright © 2018 Mosby, Inc.

Knowledge gaps are highlighted to emphasize the need for further investigations. Physical barriers to the entry of microbes include vulvar sealing, vestibule-vaginal constriction, a narrow cervical opening and the mucosal epithelium along with the overlying mucus layer. Genital tract mucosal epithelial cells recognize damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns and respond by secreting antimicrobial peptides and cytokines to recruit and activate immune cells. Neutrophils and macrophages represent the first line of innate immune defenses recruited by cytokines to the site of inflammation. Macrophages, endometrial epithelial cells and dendritic cells interact with T-cells to elicit cellular responses and regulate antibody responses. Immune regulatory components such as -macrophages and regulatory T-cells, although less studied, may work in conjunction with epithelial cell regeneration to coordinate involution of the postpartum uterus and prepare the genital tract for the next pregnancy. A role for the vaginal and uterine  in modulating uterine inflammation is an emerging research focus and further studies are required to integrate information on the nutritional and metabolic status of cows with innate immune responses and host- interactions. A greater understanding of these complex interactions is critical for developing more effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of uterine inflammation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

BAT contributes to non-shivering thermogenesis in a cold environment; WAT stores energy and produces adipokines that fine-tune metabolic and inflammatory responses. Obesity is often characterized by over-expansion and inflammation of WAT where inflammatory cells/mediators are abundant, especially pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation and leading to insulin resistance and metabolic complications. Macrophages constitute the major component of innate immunity and can be activated as a M1 or  (anti-inflammatory) phenotype in response to environmental stimuli. Polarized M1 macrophage causes AT inflammation, whereas polarized  macrophage promotes WAT remodeling into the BAT phenotype, also known as WAT browning/beiging, which enhances insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.

The present study investigated the potential role of autophagy in stress-related IBD in patients and animal model. The correlation between psychosocial stress and intestinal autophagy was determined in 23 patients with IBD. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a well-established inducer of psychosocial stress, was administrated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In IBD patients, the autophagy markers beclin-1, LC3-II/I ratio, Atg16L1, and Atg4B were significantly enhanced. The psychosocial stress score was positively associated with the levels of beclin-1 and the LC3II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens. In IBD mouse model, CRH significantly aggravated intestinal inflammation, increased Paneth cell metaplasia, and enhanced intestinal autophagy (beclin-1, Atg16L1, PIK3R4, and Atg4B upregulation; GAA, CTSD, and PPKAA1 downregulation). Additionally, the CRH-induced gut microbial dysbiosis was evidenced by a marked increase in the number of detrimental bacteria. In LPS-stimulated BMDM, CRH substantially increased M1/ polarization and thus promoted inflammation. In both IBD mice and LPS-treated BMDM, blockade of autophagy by chloroquine abrogated the unbeneficial effects of CRH, whereas autophagy inducer rapamycin resulted in a pronounced protective effect against IBD lesion. Our data demonstrate that psychosocial stress may link the enhanced intestinal autophagy by modulating gut  and inflammation to aggravate IBD. These data indicate autophagy as a promising therapeutic target for psychosocial stress-related IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27860408>Ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 positive macrophages and HO-1 up-regulation in intestinal muscularis resident macrophages.</a></h2><p>Small intestinal muscularis externa macrophages have been associated with interstitial cells of Cajal. They have been proposed to play various roles in motility disorders and to take part in a -driven regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Our objective was to understand the reaction of resident macrophages of the musculature to a pro-inflammatory stimulator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice were injected with LPS or saline and sacrificed after 6 hr. Whole mounts were stained with antibodies toward CD169, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (iba1) (microglial/macrophage marker) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Cell densities were measured using unbiased stereology.iba1 cells showed an overall higher density than CD169 and HO-1 cells. Most HO-1 and iba1 cells were positive for CD 169 in serosa and at Auerbach's plexus (AP). At the deep muscular plexus, mainly iba1 cells were present, and were mostly CD169 ; a few HO-1 cells were present.A new subset of resident macrophages in the intestinal muscularis externa was discovered, identified as iba1 CD169 . HO-1 is constitutively present in most macrophages in serosa and at AP, suggesting a  phenotype. LPS-treatment results in an up-regulation of HO-1 /CD169 cells in serosa and at AP.

Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal tumorigenesis. Deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid increased by a western diet, correlates with intestinal carcinogenesis. However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal  and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal  was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal barrier, gut low grade inflammation and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal  from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced inflammation and recruited  phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal  transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover,  depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development. Our study demonstrated that alteration of the microbial community induced by DCA promoted intestinal carcinogenesis.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636955>[Obesity and cancer].</a></h2><p>The incidence of obesity in the western world has increased dramatically during recent decades. Epidemiological data suggest that obesity is associated with an increased risk of several but not all types of cancers, with clear sex-specific differences. The underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate. This review focuses on the potential factors linking obesity to cancer. Current experimental evidence suggests that insulin resistance and a chronic, subclinical inflammation in the visceral fat are the major metabolic events causing alterations in the levels of insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and 2, adipose tissue-derived proinflammatory cytokines and other bioactive molecules, such as adipokines (e.g. leptin and adiponectin), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), sex hormones, gut  and secondary bile acids. All these factors may act directly or indirectly on the tumor microenvironment to drive tumor progression via stimulation of cell survival/antiapoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion/metastasis of the cancer cells. Therapeutic strategies that target dysfunctional or inflamed fat and have been shown to benefit patients include bariatric surgery, while other cell or hormone-directed interventions, such as conversion of visceral fat macrophages to an anti-inflammatory  phenotype or the pharmacological modulation of serum adipokine levels are still theoretical and need to be clinically evaluated for their ability to successfully treat or prevent obesity-related cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162597>Glucose- and Lipid-Related Biomarkers Are Affected in Healthy Obese or Hyperglycemic Adults Consuming a Whole-Grain Pasta Enriched in Prebiotics and Probiotics: A 12-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Synbiotic foods, which combine the action of prebiotics and probiotics along the gastrointestinal tract, can affect inflammatory and glucose-related markers.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on inflammatory and glycemia-related markers of a whole-grain pasta containing barley β-glucans and Bacillus coagulans BC30, 6086 in healthy overweight or obese volunteers.A single-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary intervention study was carried out. Forty-one healthy sedentary overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25-29.9 kg/) and obese (BMI ≥30) volunteers, aged 30-65 y and low consumers of fruit and vegetables, ate 1 serving/d of whole-grain control (CTR) or innovative (INN) pasta for 12 wk and maintained their habitual diets. Biological samples were collected at baseline and every 4 wk for primary (plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] and fasting plasma lipid profile) and secondary outcomes (glycemia-related markers, blood pressure, fecal  composition, and body weight). Between (CTR compared with INN) and within (among weeks) group differences were tested for the whole population and for subgroups stratified by baseline values of BMI (≥30) and glycemia (≥100 mg/dL).INN or CTR pasta consumption had no effect on primary and secondary outcomes over time, except for a significant increase in plasma γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) after 12 wk of CTR pasta consumption. Comparisons between intervention groups revealed differences only at 12 wk: plasma GGT was higher in the CTR group; plasma hs-CRP, plasma LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, and Bifidobacterium spp. were lower in the INN subgroup of obese volunteers; plasma resistin was lower and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance was higher in the INN subgroup of hyperglycemic volunteers.A daily serving of a synbiotic whole-grain pasta had limited effects on primary and secondary outcomes in the entire group of volunteers but affected glycemia- and lipid-related markers and resistin in a subgroup of healthy obese or hyperglycemic volunteers.

Interleukin-25 (IL-25) promotes type 2 immunity via alternative activation of macrophages, and is closely associated with inflammation-related diseases, even malignancies. However, it is not clear which role IL-25 plays in the development of HCC, and whether gut  are involved.IL-25 was detected by ELISA, Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Chemokines were measured by RT-qPCR and WB. After co-culture with IL-25-stimulated macrophages, the cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT marker of HCC cell lines (MHCC97L and HepG2) were evaluated by Brdu proliferation, Transwell assays and WB. An antibody neutralization assay of chemokine CXCL10 was performed to confirm its role in HCC development. Furthermore, the effects of IL-25 in HCC were investigated in vivo. Dysbiosis of gut microflora was induced by antibiotics (vancomycin, cefoperazone or combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). We used feces suspension to treat colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, and detected IL-25 and tuft cell marker DCLK1 using WB and immunofluorescence staining.We found that the level of IL-25 was significantly elevated in HCC patients, and was negatively correlated with survival rate after hepatectomy. However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and  percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced dysbiosis promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of colonic epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted .IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in colon, induced by gut  dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354183>A preliminary insight of correlation between human fecal microbial diversity and blood lipid profile.</a></h2><p>The study aimed to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and yeast on cholesterol levels.

It has been suggested that weight loss may affect SCFA metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized weight-loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal SCFA concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total SCFA concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following weight loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased SCFA concentrations were low (≤5% of energy) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in SCFA concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

However, the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria in regulating the alveolar macrophages remain unclear. Here, by using an antibiotic-treated (Abt) mouse model, we found commensal bacteria depletion induced lower frequencies and numbers of alveolar macrophages. This effect was accompanied by the altered levels of genes involved in several biological pathways, including  macrophage polarization, as determined by gene expression analysis. Alveolar macrophages from the Abt mice had higher protein and gene levels of Arg1, CCL24, IL-13, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-1β, which could be recovered to normal levels by reconstructing commensal bacteria in the upper respiratory of Abt mice. Moreover, alveolar macrophages performed significant enhancement of  functions, especially CCL24 secretion, in the Abt mice challenged with B16/F10 melanoma. Adoptive transfer of normal alveolar macrophages or antibody neutralization of CCL24 significantly recovered the decrease of γδT17 cells and rescued the defect anti-tumor response of Abt mice, indicating the elevated amount of alveolar macrophage-derived CCL24 inhibited γδT cell mediated anti-tumor response. In conclusion, we demonstrated the ability of commensal bacteria to maintain alveolar macrophages with a low level of CCL24 production, which was necessary for the normal anti-tumor response in the lung.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277587>Dietary Nondigestible Polysaccharides Ameliorate Colitis by Improving Gut  and CD4 Differentiation, as Well as Facilitating  Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of a specific multifiber mix diet (MF) designed to match the fiber content of a healthy diet in interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 ) mice with spontaneous chronic colitis displaying similar characteristics to those of human Crohn's disease (CD).Sixteen-week-old IL-10 mice were used for the experiments with MF diet for 4 weeks. Severity of colitis, the composition of the fecal , expression of Th1/Th17 cells, myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentrations, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], and MIP-1α), as well as arginase 1 (Arg1) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) proteins, were measured at the end of the experiment. In addition, the corresponding metabolites (short-chain fatty acids) of MF on CD4 CD25 Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Tregs) were also detected in vivo and in vitro.MF treatment significantly ameliorated colitis associated with decreased lamina propria frequency of Th1/Th17 cells, MPO concentrations, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2, MCP-1, and MIP-1α). An increase in gut microbial diversity was observed after MF treatment compared with IL-10 mice, including a significant increase in bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum and a significant decrease in bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum. Moreover, MF treatment increased the differentiation of CD4 CD25 Foxp3 Tregs mainly by microbial metabolites butyrate. In addition, Arg1 and STAT6 proteins were also significantly increased after MF treatment.These results shed light on the contribution of MF treatment to the CD mouse model and suggest that MF has potential as a therapeutic strategy for enhancing efficacy in inducing remission in patients with active CD.© 2018 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26143342>Lactobacillus paracasei Induces -Dominant Kupffer Cell Polarization in a Mouse Model of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Gut  may be associated with the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

However, the mechanisms linking immunity to metabolic disease remain to be fully elucidated. It has previously been suggested that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) may be involved in the progression of numerous types of metabolic diseases as these cells act as suppressors and promoters for obesity and associated conditions, and are particularly involved in adipose tissue inflammation, which is a major feature of metabolic imbalance. Group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) have been revealed as anti‑obese immune regulators by secreting anti‑inflammatory cytokines and promoting the polarization of  macrophages, whereas group 1 ILCs (ILC1s), including natural killer cells, may promote adipose tissue inflammation via production of interferon‑γ, which in turn polarizes macrophages toward the M1 type. The majority of studies to date have demonstrated the pathological association between ILCs and obesity in the context of adipose tissue inflammation, whereas the roles of ILCs in other organs which participate in obesity development have not been fully characterized. Therefore, identifying the roles of all types of ILCs as central components mediating obesity‑associated inflammation, is of primary concern, and may lead to the discovery of novel preventative and therapeutic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531665>[Surgical treatment of obesity from the nutritional point - opportunities and dangers].</a></h2><p>Obesity is a civilization disease, which occurrence in the world population is gradually increasing. The basic causes of obesity include a sedentary lifestyle and energy-rich diet contributing to a positive energy balance. Methods of curing obesity contain the lifestyle modification, the pharmacological treatment and the surgical treatment. The bariatric surgery is a therapy that can be used among patients with BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 kg/ with comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, for whom previous treatment has been ineffective. The surgical treatment includes restrictive, limiting absorption and hybrid methods among them the most frequently performed sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Surgical treatment affects the clinical course of many chronic diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus type 2. Unfortunately, this method of treatment is related to complications and is associated with increased risk of many complications, nutritional deficiencies, as well as deterioration of mental health. The potential causes of psychiatric disorders following bariatric surgery include dysbiosis and brain - gut axis dysfunction. After surgery, a dysbiosis is noticed (a reduction of Bifidobacterium spp.) that may increase the risk of depressive disorders occurrence. For this reason, to effective obesity treatment, patients undergoing bariatric surgery should be covered by the longterm care of an interdisciplinary team.© 2018 MEDPRESS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating /M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut  Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues. Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut  in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression.

To discern the mechanism, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), caused abnormal intestinal reparative responses to mucosal injury through differences in intestinal  and the presence of naïve immune cells. To identify such mechanisms, gut microbes and naïve immune cells were compared between rat pups born to dams fed either n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA or breeder chow. Maternal exposure to either of the PUFA rich diets altered the development of the intestinal  with an overall reduction in microbial density. Using qPCR, we found that each type of PUFA differentially altered the major gut phyla; fish oil increased Bacteroidetes and safflower oil increased Firmicutes. Both PUFA diets reduced microbes known to dominate the infant gut like Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacteria spp. when compared to the chow group. Uniquely, maternal fish oil diets resulted in offspring showing blooms of opportunistic pathogens like Bilophila wadsworthia, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis in their gut . As well, fish oil groups showed a reduction in colonic CD8+ T cells, CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells and arginase+  macrophages. In conclusion, fish oil supplementation in pharmacological excess, at 18% by energy as shown in this study, provides an example where excess dosing in utero can prime offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts and alter immune cell homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653264>Helminth infection in mice improves insulin sensitivity via modulation of gut  and fatty acid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Intestinal helminths are prevalent in individuals who live in rural areas of developing countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are rare. In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut  in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the  modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut , most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the  alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to  pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the  by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Reduction of western-diet-associated inflammation was obtained for more than eighteen weeks after immunization. Immunized mice had reduced serum cytokine levels, reduced insulin and fasting glucose concentrations; and gene expression in both liver and visceral adipose tissue confirmed a reduced inflammatory steady-state after immunization.

Here, we investigated the impacts of triterpenoid saponins isolated from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS) on gut , mucosal environment, and the preventive effect on tumor growth. Six-week old ApcMin/+ mice and their wild-type littermates were fed either with vehicle or GpS daily for the duration of 8 weeks. The fecal  was analyzed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Study showed that GpS treatment significantly reduced the number of intestinal polyps in a preventive mode. More importantly, GpS feeding strikingly reduced the sulfate-reducing bacteria lineage, which are known to produce hydrogen sulfide and contribute to damage the intestinal epithelium or even promote cancer progression. Meanwhile, GpS also boosted the beneficial microbes. In the gut barrier of the ApcMin/+ mice, GpS treatment increased Paneth and goblet cells, up-regulated E-cadherin and down-regulated N-cadherin. In addition, GpS decreased the pro-oncogenic β-catenin, p-Src and the p-STAT3. Furthermore, GpS might also improve the inflamed gut epithelium of the ApcMin/+ mice by upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, while downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18. Intriguingly, GpS markedly stimulated  and suppressed M1 macrophage markers, indicating that GpS altered mucosal cytokine profile in favor of the M1 to  macrophages switching, facilitating intestinal tissue repair.

X-ray crystallography revealed that Au-1·PF and Cu-1·PF are dinuclear molecules consisting of two linear intramolecular C-M-C bonds (M = Au and Cu), one M···M interaction, and two metal atoms arranged in a T-shaped geometry; their molecular structures are very similar to the basket-shaped cage structure of the parent complex Ag-1·PF. Because of the smaller ionic radius of copper(I), Cu-1·PF has the smallest upper space of the basket among the three complexes. Au-1·PF and Cu-1·PF were very stable in the solid state and in solution. They did not undergo nucleophilic reaction with thiols 2-mercaptoethanol and 2-benzimidazolethiol (Hbmt) at least for several hours, whereas Ag-1·PF did react, forming precipitates of silver(I) thiolate and the free ligand L-1a·PF. The minimum inhibitory concentration values toward a panel of bacteria, yeasts, and molds were examined in a water-suspension system and a solution system containing dimethyl sulfoxide. The antimicrobial spectra of the three compounds were metal-dependent, and Au-1·PF showed the greatest activity toward Gram-positive bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28439298>Multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria in the gut of young children in Bangladesh.</a></h2><p>The gut of human harbors diverse commensal  performing an array of beneficial role for the hosts. In the present study, the major commensal gut bacteria isolated by culturing methods from 15 children of moderate income families, aged between 10 and 24 months, were studied for their response to different antibiotics, and the molecular basis of drug resistance.Of 122 bacterial colonies primarily selected from Luria-Bertani agar, bacterial genera confirmed by analytical profile index (API) 20E system included  as the predominant (52%) organism, followed by  (16%),  (12%),  (6%),  (6%),  (3%), and  (3%); while  and  were identified as the infrequently occurring genera. An estimated 11 and 22% of the  isolates carried virulence marker genes -2 and , respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility assay revealed 78% of the gut bacteria to be multidrug resistant (MDR) with highest resistance to erythromycin (96%), followed by ampicillin (63%), tetracycline (59%), azithromycin (53%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (43%), cefixime (39%), and ceftriaxone (33%). PCR assay results revealed 56% of the gut bacteria to possess gene cassette Class 1 integron; while 8, 17.5 and 6% of the strains carried tetracycline resistance-related genes A, B, and D, respectively. The macrolide (erythromycin and azithromycin) resistance marker genes A, B, and B were found in 28, 3 and 5% of bacterial isolates, respectively; while 26, 12, 17, 32, 7, 4 and 3% of the MDR bacterial isolates carried the extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-related genes e.g., , , , , ,  and  respectively. Majority of the MDR gut bacteria harbored large plasmids [e.g., 140 MDa (43%), 105 MDa (30%), 90 MDa (14%)] carrying invasion and related antibiotic resistance marker genes.Our results suggest gut of young Bangladeshi children to be an important reservoir for multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria carrying ESBL related genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904023>α-Linolenic acid-derived metabolites from gut lactic acid bacteria induce differentiation of anti-inflammatory  macrophages through G protein-coupled receptor 40.</a></h2><p>Among dietary fatty acids with immunologic effects, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid (ALA), have been considered as factors that contribute to the differentiation of -type macrophages ( macrophages). In this study, we examined the effect of ALA and its gut lactic acid bacteria metabolites 13-hydroxy-9(),15()-octadecadienoic acid (13-OH) and 13-oxo-9(),15()-octadecadienoic acid (13-oxo) on the differentiation of  macrophages from bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. BMDCs were stimulated with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h, and significant increases in  macrophage markers CD206 and Arginase-1 (Arg1) were observed. In addition,  macrophage phenotypes were less prevalent following cotreatment with GPCR40 antagonists or inhibitors of PLC-β and MEK under these conditions, suggesting that GPCR40 signaling is involved in the regulation of  macrophage differentiation. In further experiments, remarkable  macrophage accumulation was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice after intragastric treatments with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo at 1 g/kg of body weight per day for 3 d.

The quaternary mixture of PAHs (phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and benzo[a] pyrene) and metals (Cr, Ni, and Pb) spiked the soil, constructing a microcosm; the microcosms were bioaugmented with newly developed plant bacterial consortia (Cpm and Cpm). The microcosms were amended with biochar (sieved particle size 0.5-2 mm) as redox regulators to reduce oxidative stress of plant-microbe systems. To formulate the two plant-bacterial consortia, plant species were collected and bacteria were isolated from oil spill soil. The bacterial strains used in two formulated consortia includes ─ Cpm (Enterobacter cloacae HS32, Brevibacillus reuszeri HS37, and Stenotrophomonas sp. HS16) and Cpm (Acinetobacter junii HS29, Enterobacter aerogenes HS39 and Enterobacter asburiae HS22). The PAHs degradation and metal removal efficacy of the consortia (Cpm and Cpm) were studied after 24 weeks of trial. The physicochemical properties of microcosm's soil (M and M) were assessed after experimentation, which resulted in the finding that the soil exhibits dropped in pH from basic to neutral after application of the plant microbe's consortium. The electrical conductivity was lower in M and M soils, with a range between 1.60 and 1.80 mS/cm after the treatment. The Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) results illustrate how metabolites with the different molecular weight (M.W) were found in M and M soils (184─446), as a result of the plant-microbes mediated rhizodegradation of four spiked PAHs. The metals in microcosm's soil are very low in concentration after 24 weeks of trial when compared to control(M). The Cr, Ni and Pb removal percentages were found in 45.79, 42.19 and 44.85 in M. However, the removal percentages were found to be 45.41, 41.47 and 44.25 respectively for these same HMs in M soil. Both the consortia that were newly developed showed similar trends of metals removal and PAHs degradation. This study provides a breakthrough in the area of rhizosphere engineering with the goal of maintaining a sustainable application of plant-microbes in ecosystem services.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Increased gut fermentation and plant protein may mediate the effect. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether the appetite-suppressing effects of whole-grain rye porridge could be enhanced by replacing part of the rye with fermented dietary fibre and plant protein, and to explore the role of gut fermentation on appetite and metabolic responses over 8 h. We conducted a randomised, cross-over study using two rye porridges (40 and 55 g), three 40-g rye porridges with addition of inulin:gluten (9:3; 6:6; 3:9 g) and a refined wheat bread control (55 g), served as part of complete breakfasts. A standardised lunch and an ad libitum dinner were served 4 and 8 h later, respectively. Appetite, breath hydrogen and methane, glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) responses were measured over 8 h. Twenty-one healthy men and women, aged 23-60 years, with BMI of 21-33 kg/ participated in this study. Before lunch, the 55-g rye porridges lowered hunger by 20 % and desire to eat by 22 % and increased fullness by 29 % compared with wheat bread (P<0·05). Breath hydrogen increased proportionally to dietary fibre content (P<0·05). Plasma glucose after lunch was 6 % lower after the 55-g rye porridges compared with wheat bread (P<0·05) and correlated to breath hydrogen (P<0·001). No differences were observed in ad libitum food intake, insulin or GLP-1. We conclude that no further increase in satiety was observed when replacing part of the rye with inulin and gluten compared with plain rye porridges.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25644343>Oat avenanthramide-C (2c) is biotransformed by mice and the human  into bioactive metabolites.</a></h2><p>Avenanthramides (AVAs), which are found exclusively in oats, may play an important role in anti-inflammation and antiatherogenesis. Although the bioavailability of AVAs has been investigated previously, little is known about their metabolism.The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolism of avenanthramide-C (2c), one of the major AVAs, in mice and by the human , as well as to elucidate the bioactivity of its major metabolites with the goal of finding new exposure markers to precisely reflect oat consumption.For the mouse study, 10 CF-1 female mice were divided into control (vehicle-treated) and 2c intragastrically treated (200 mg/kg) groups (5 mice/group). Twenty-four-hour urine and fecal samples were collected with use of metabolic cages. For the batch culture incubations, 2c was cultured with fecal slurries obtained from 6 human donors. Incubated samples were collected at various time points (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h). Metabolites were identified via HPLC with electrochemical detection and LC with electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. To investigate whether 2c metabolites retain the biological effects of 2c, we compared their effects on the growth of and induction of apoptosis in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells.Eight metabolites were detected from the 2c-treated mouse urine samples. They were identified as 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (M1), dihydrocaffeic acid (), caffeic acid (M3), dihydroferulic acid (M4), ferulic acid (M5), dihydroavenanthramide-C (M6), dihydroavenanthramide-B (M7), and avenanthramide-B (M8) via analysis of their MS(n) (n = 1-3) spectra. We found that the reduction of 2c's C7'-C8' double bond and the cleavage of its amide bond were the major metabolic routes. In the human  study, 2c was converted into M1-M3 and M6. Moreover, interindividual differences in 2c metabolism were observed among the 6 human subjects. Subjects B, C, E, and F could rapidly metabolize 2c to M6, whereas subject D metabolized little 2c, even up to 120 h. In addition, only subjects A, B, and F could cleave the amide bond of 2c or M6 to form the cleaved metabolites. Furthermore, we showed that 2c and its major metabolite M6 are bioactive compounds against human colon cancer cells. M6 was more active than 2c with the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 158 μM and could induce apoptosis at 200 μM.To our knowledge, the current study demonstrates for the first time that avenanthramide-C can be extensively metabolized by mice and the human  to generate bioactive metabolites.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30312395>Diversity of fungi and bacteria in species-rich grasslands increases with plant diversity in shoots but not in roots and soil.</a></h2><p>Microbial communities in roots and shoots of plants and in soil are important for plant growth and health and take part in important ecosystem processes. Therefore, understanding the factors that affect their diversity is important. We have analyzed fungal and bacterial communities associated with plant shoots, roots and soil over a 1 km2 area in a semi-natural temperate grassland with 1-43 plant species per 0.1 , to describe the relationships between plant and microbial diversity and to identify the drivers of bacterial and fungal community composition. Microbial community composition differed between shoots, roots and soil. While both fungal and bacterial species richness in shoots increased with plant species richness, no correlation was found between plant and microbial diversity in roots and soil. Chemistry was a significant predictor of bacterial and fungal community composition in soil as was also the spatial location of the sampled site. In this species-rich grassland, the effects of plants on the  composition seemed to be restricted to the shoot-associated taxa; in contrast, the microbiomes of roots or soil were not affected. The results support our hypothesis that the effect of plants on the  composition decreases from shoots to roots and soil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25719336>Obesity and cancer.</a></h2><p>The incidence of obesity in the Western world has increased dramatically during the recent decades. Epidemiological data suggest that obesity is associated with an increased risk of several but not all types of cancers, with clear sex-specific differences. The underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate. In this review, we discuss the potential factors linking obesity to cancer, with a focus on hormone-dependent cancer types. Current experimental evidence suggests that insulin resistance and a chronic, subclinical inflammation in the visceral fat are the major metabolic events, causing alterations in the levels of insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, insulin-like growth factor-1 and -2, adipose tissue-derived proinflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, -6, -12, and -23), and other bioactive molecules such as adipokines (adiponectin and leptin), vascular endothelial growth factor, sex hormones, gut , and secondary bile acids. All these factors may act directly or indirectly on the tumor microenvironment to drive tumor progression via the stimulation of cell survival/antiapoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion/metastasis of cancer cells. Therapeutic strategies (including bariatric surgery) that target dysfunctional or inflamed fat have been shown to benefit patients, whereas other cell- or hormone-directed interventions (such as the conversion of visceral fat macrophages to an anti-inflammatory  phenotype or the pharmacological modulation of serum adipokine levels) are still theoretical and need to be clinically evaluated for their ability to successfully treat or prevent obesity-related cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27761147>The Rhizome Mixture of  and  Attenuates Mesalazine-Resistant Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of DWac on the gut  composition in mice with 2,3,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid- (TNBS-) induced colitis. Treatment with DWac restored TNBS-disturbed gut  composition and attenuated TNBS-induced colitis. Moreover, we examined the effect of DWac in mice with mesalazine-resistant colitis (MRC). Intrarectal injection of TNBS in MRC mice caused severe colitis, as well as colon shortening, edema, and increased myeloperoxidase activity. Treatment with mesalazine (30 mg/kg) did not attenuate TNBS-induced colitis in MRC mice, whereas treatment with DWac (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated TNBS-induced colitis. Moreover, treatment with the mixture of mesalazine (15 mg/kg) and DWac (15 mg/kg) additively attenuated colitis in MRC mice. Treatment with DWac and its mixture with mesalazine inhibited TNBS-induced activation of NF-B and expression of M1 macrophage markers but increased TNBS-suppressed expression of  macrophage markers. Furthermore, these inhibited TNBS-induced T-bet, RORt, TNF-, and IL-17 expression but increased TNBS-suppressed Foxp3 and IL-10 expression. However, Th2 cell differentiation and GATA3 and IL-5 expression were not affected. These findings suggest that DWac can ameliorate MRC by increasing the polarization of  macrophage and correcting the disturbance of gut  and Th1/Th17/Treg, as well as additively attenuating MRC along with mesalazine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29726951>Walnut Consumption Alters the Gastrointestinal , Microbially Derived Secondary Bile Acids, and Health Markers in Healthy Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Epidemiologic data suggest that diets rich in nuts have beneficial health effects, including reducing total and cause-specific mortality from cancer and heart disease. Although there is accumulating preclinical evidence that walnuts beneficially affect the gastrointestinal  and gut and metabolic health, these relations have not been investigated in humans.We aimed to assess the impact of walnut consumption on the human gastrointestinal  and metabolic markers of health.A controlled-feeding, randomized crossover study was undertaken in healthy men and women [n = 18; mean age = 53.1 y; body mass index (kg/): 28.8]. Study participants received isocaloric diets containing 0 or 42 g walnuts/d for two 3-wk periods, with a 1-wk washout between diet periods. Fecal and blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each period to assess secondary outcomes of the study, including effects of walnut consumption on fecal  and bile acids and metabolic markers of health.Compared with after the control period, walnut consumption resulted in a 49-160% higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Dialister, and Roseburia and 16-38% lower relative abundances of Ruminococcus, Dorea, Oscillospira, and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). Fecal secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, were 25% and 45% lower, respectively, after the walnut treatment compared with the control treatment (P < 0.05). Serum LDL cholesterol and the noncholesterol sterol campesterol concentrations were 7% and 6% lower, respectively, after walnut consumption compared with after the control treatment (P < 0.01).Walnut consumption affected the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal , increasing the relative abundances of Firmicutes species in butyrate-producing Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and reducing microbially derived, proinflammatory secondary bile acids and LDL cholesterol. These results suggest that the gastrointestinal  may contribute to the underlying mechanisms of the beneficial health effects of walnut consumption.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the gut  composition, the lipopolysaccharide levels and the metabolic profile in obese and normal-weight young subjects.We studied 32 obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/) and 32 normal-weight subjects (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/), aged 18-25 years. Quantification of intestinal bacteria was performed by real-time PCR. Endotoxin units were determined with the test QCL-1000, and biochemical profile was performed under a standard protocol of Spinreact.Obese individuals had a BMI of 34.5 (32.9-36.45) kg/, increased triglycerides (123 vs. 70 mg/dl), total cholesterol (168 vs. 142 mg/dl), and LDL-cholesterol (114 vs. 96.5 mg/dl). In obese subjects body temperature was higher than in normal-weight subjects. We found a greater number of Clostridum leptum and Lactobacillus (p < 0.001) and lower numbers of Prevotella and Escherichia coli (p < 0.001) in the obese group. A decrease of E. coli was associated with an increased risk of lipopolysaccharide levels ranging from 1 to 1.3 EU/ml. A positive correlation was found between serum lipopolysaccharides and BMI (r = 0.46, p = 0.008), triglyceride levels (r = 0.44, p = 0.011) as well as waist circumference (r = 0.34, p = 0.040), being more evident in young obese females.Subclinical metabolic endotoxemia determined by serum concentration of lipopolysaccharides was related to the smallest amount of E. coli, high triglyceride levels, and central adiposity in obese young persons.© 2016 S.

Fructus Corni, a traditional herb medicine, has been clinically used to cure chronic nephropathy for thousands of years. It could be converted by gut microflora in vivo to shape its pharmacological profiles. Thus, metabolic profiles of major active constituents in Fructus Corni extracts by gut microflora from rats in healthy and nephropathy state were firstly investigated in vitro by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) in this study. According to the features of protonated ions, five metabolites (M1, , M3, M5 and M6) were found and preliminarily authenticated. Intestinal bacteria were capable of converting N0 (loganin) to its aglycone M1 (loganetin). The latter was further hydrogenated to the corresponding  (hydrogenated loganetin) and subsequently to M3 (hydrogenated and demethylated loganetin) by demethylation; While M5 (demethylated morronisid aglycone) and M6 (dehydroxylated morronisid aglycone) were identified as the two metabolites of N4 (morronisid) through demethylation and dehydroxylation. Gut microflora from healthy and nephropathy rats could degrade loganin and morronisid to the above metabolites. However, healthy rat intestinal bacteria showed more powerful degradation and much more amounts of M1 and M6 were obtained in their samples. Additionally, this work demonstrated that UPLC-Q-TOF/MS approach connected with MetaboLynx™ analysis software was rapid and reliable for screening and authentication of natural product metabolites.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The human intestinal  might have an important impact on drug metabolism and ultimately on the drug oral bioavailability. However, the interaction of the buddleoside with human intestinal bacteria remains unknown. In this study, the conversion of buddleoside by different bacteria from human feces was firstly investigated. A reliable, sensitive and rapid analytical method, ultra performance liquid chromatography was established and successfully applied to investigate the metabolites and metabolic profile of buddleoside by human intestinal bacteria. Among the isolated bacteria, four strains including Escherichia sp. 4, Escherichia sp. 34, Enterococcus sp. 45 and Bacillus sp. 46 showed more powerful conversion capability. Based on the accurate mass data and the characteristic MS(n) product ions, the parent and six metabolites were detected and tentatively identified compared with blank samples. The metabolites were produced by four main metabolic pathways including deglycosylation, acetylation, methylation and hydroxylation. Buddleoside could be firstly converted to its aglycon acacetin () by the majority of the isolated intestinal bacteria. Subsequently,  was further metabolize to its methylated (M3), acetylated (M4), hydroxylated (M5) and hydrogenated product (M6). However, acacetin-7-glucosid (M1) was obtained only from the minor bacterial samples like Bacillus sp. 46. To further explain the metabolism of buddleoside, the β-d-glucosidase and α-l-rhamnosidase activities of four strains were analyzed. Bacillus sp. 46 could only produce α-l-rhamnosidase, while the other three strains showed two kinds of enzyme activities. Furthermore, the activities of α-l-rhamnosidase and β-d-glucosidase reached the highest level at 12-18h and 10-12h, respectively. The metabolic routes and metabolites of buddleoside produced by human intestinal microflora were firstly reported in this paper. The results will be very helpful for the further investigation of the pharmacokinetic research of buddleoside and to unravel how it works in vivo.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Among the catechin metabolites, 1-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol (EGC-), 4-hydroxy-5-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid (EGC-M7), and 5-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid (EGC-M9) were found to show inhibitory activity on HeLa cell proliferation as compared with control. The results suggested that three adjacent hydroxyl groups in the phenyl moiety may play an important role in the inhibitory activity. In addition, the inhibitory activity was also examined with four (-)-epicatechin (EC) metabolites possessing two adjacent hydroxyl groups in the phenyl moiety. Only 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid (EC-M9) showed inhibitory activity and therefore valeric acid moiety likely contributes to the inhibitory activity.

In the present study, the effect of gut  on the association between GI motility, and 5‑HT expression and macrophage abundance in the GI tract was examined. Germ‑free (GF) mice (6 weeks old) were orally administered a fecal bacterial suspension prepared from specific pathogen‑free mice and their GI tissues were evaluated 4 weeks later. The expression of 5‑HT and mannose receptor (MR) was examined by immunohistochemistry, and GI transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine red solution. The numbers of 5‑HT‑positive endocrine cells and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages were significantly increased in the upper GI and colon of GF mice subjected to fecal transplantation (FT) compared with control GF mice without FT. GITT was significantly decreased in GF mice subjected to FT compared with GF mice without FT, and negatively correlated with the numbers of 5‑HT‑positive cells in the upper GI and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages throughout the GI tract. The numbers of 5‑HT‑positive endocrine cells and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages were significantly correlated throughout the GI tract.

Recently, using two different experimental models, we demonstrated that hCTS-treated mice develop less severe acute colitis. We have also shown the implication of the macrophages in this effect. The aims of this study were to determine (1) whether hCTS treatment could attenuate the reactivation of inflammation in adult mice with previously established chronic colitis; (2) whether this effect is mediated through macrophages or the gut . Quiescent colitis was induced in 7-8-week-old C57BL6 mice using four cycles (2-4%) of dextran sulfate sodium. hCTS (1.5 mg/kg/day) treatment or vehicle started 2 days before the last induction of colitis and continuing for 7 days. At sacrifice, macro- and microscopic scores were determined. Colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and TNF- α], anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF- β), classically activated (M1) (), and alternatively activated () () macrophages markers were studied using ELISA and/or RT-qPCR. , peritoneal macrophages isolated from naïve mice and treated with hCTS (10 M, 12 h) were exposed to either lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml, 12 h) to polarize M1 macrophages or to IL-4/IL-13 (20 ng/ml) to polarize  macrophages. M1/ macrophage markers along with cytokine gene expression were determined using RT-qPCR. Feces and mucosa-associated  (MAM) samples were collected, and the V4 region of 16 s rRNA was sequenced. Micro- and macroscopic scores, colonic IL-6, IL-1β, TNF- α, and M1 macrophages markers were significantly decreased in the hCTS-treated group. Treatment did not have any effect on colonic IL-10, TGF-β, and  markers nor modified the bacterial richness, diversity, or the major phyla in colitic fecal and MAM samples. , pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, as well as their gene expression, were significantly reduced in hCTS-treated M1 macrophages. hCTS treatment did not affect  macrophage markers. These findings suggest that hCTS treatment attenuates the severity of inflammatory relapse through the modulation of the M1 macrophages and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299489>Lipid production by a mixed culture of oleaginous yeast and microalga from distillery and domestic mixed wastewater.</a></h2><p>Lipid productivity by mixed culture of Rhodosporidium toruloides and Chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied using 1:1 mixed real wastewater from distillery and local municipal wastewater treatment plant with initial soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) around 25,000 mg/L, initial cell density of 2×10(7) cells/mL (yeast) and 5×10(6) cells/mL (microalga), at 30 °C and 2.93 W/ (2000 lux, 12:12 h light and dark cycles). Lipid content and lipid yield achieved were 63.45±2.58% and 4.60±0.36 g/L with the associated removal efficiencies for SCOD, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) at 95.34±0.07%, 51.18±2.17%, and 89.29±4.91%, respectively, after 5 days of cultivation without the pH adjustment. Inoculation of microalgae at 40 h of the initial yeast cultivation and harvesting part of inactive biomass at 72 h by sedimentation could improve both lipid production and wastewater treatment efficiency under non-sterile conditions.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Catalpol, an iridoid glucoside, abundantly found in the root of the common used herb medicine Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, has been reported to show various biological effects and pharmacological activities. After oral administration, the active ingredient might have interactions with the intestinal bacteria, which could help unravel how the medicine was processed in vivo. In this work, different pure bacteria from healthy human feces were isolated and used to bioconvert catalpol. Ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) technique combined with Metabolynx(™) software was applied to analyze catalpol metabolites. Compared with blank samples, parent compound (M0) and four metabolites (M1-M4) were detected and tentatively identified based on the characteristics of their protonated ions. The metabolites were likely to be: catalpol aglycone (M1), acetylated catalpol (), dimethylated and hydroxylated catalpol aglycone (M3), nitrogen-containing catalpol aglycone (M4). M1 and M4 were generated in the majority of the samples like Bacteroides sp. 45. M3 was obtained in several bacterial samples like Enterococcus sp. 8-2 and  was detected only in the sample of Enterococcus sp. 43-1. To our knowledge, the metabolic routes and metabolites of catalpol produced by human intestinal bacteria were all firstly reported.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
