The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial  integrity and ). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with 5, 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of SCFA receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461548>Cosmetic benefits of a novel biomimetic lamellar formulation containing niacinamide in healthy females with oily, blemish-prone skin in a randomised proof-of-concept study.</a></h1><p>A randomised study was designed to evaluate the potential cosmetic benefit of a biomimetic, niacinamide-containing moisturising cream in oily, blemish-prone skin.Healthy adult women with oily, blemish-prone skin were randomised to one of three treatment groups: test, control, or positive control. In the test group, subjects used the test product (containing 4% niacinamide), plus the standard cleanser (Simple® Kind to Skin Moisturizing Facial Wash). In the control group, subjects received no moisturiser but used the standard cleanser. In the positive control group, subjects used Vivatinell Acnecinamide® Gel Cream (containing 4% niacinamide) as a moisturiser and Neutrogena Visibly Clear® Spot Clearing Facial Wash (containing 2% salicylic ) as a cleanser. The positive control regimen was included to provide a comparison for estimates of effect size. The primary objective was to evaluate skin moisturisation as a change from baseline in corneometer values at 8 hours for the test regimen versus the control regimen. Analysis of covariance was applied for the primary efficacy analysis.A total of 132 subjects were randomised with 44 included in each treatment group. A significant difference was observed in the primary endpoint for the test regimen compared with the control regimen (least squares mean difference [95% CI]: 3.12 [0.68, 5.56], p=0.0128). A trend was observed in favour of the positive control regimen compared with the control regimen. Secondary measurements of moisturisation supported the primary efficacy outcome. Assessment of blemishes showed a significant difference between the test regimen versus the control regimen for change from baseline in mean total blemish count at Week 8 (least squares mean difference [95% CI]: -1.80 [-3.41, -0.19], p=0.0290). No statistical comparisons between the positive control group and the test group were performed.This study provides proof-of-concept evidence that a novel lamellar lipid moisturiser containing niacinamide, in combination with a standard cleanser, can help moisturise the skin and provide an overall improvement in the complexion appearance of people with blemish-prone skin..This article is protected by copyright.

Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) has been widely used for suppression of sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system in the clinical practice. However, whether SGB improves intestinal   after hemorrhagic shock remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that the implementation of SGB restores intestinal   and reduces gut injury.Male rats received the SGB pretreatment and underwent hemorrhagic shock followed by resuscitation. The 96-h survival rate, intestinal permeability and morphology, D-lactic  concentration and diamine oxidase activity in plasma, and expressions of F-actin, Claudin-1, and E-cadherin in intestinal tissues were observed.Pretreatment with SGB significantly enhances the 96-h survival rate in rats subjected to hemorrhagic shock (from 8.3% to 66.7%). Hemorrhagic shock reduced the coverage scale of intestinal mucus and intestinal villus width and height, enhanced the intestinal permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 and D-lactic  concentration in plasma, and decreased the expressions of F-actin, Claudin-1, and E-Cadherin in intestinal tissue. These hemorrhagic shock-induced adverse effects were abolished by SGB treatment.SGB treatment has a beneficial effect during hemorrhagic shock, which is associated with the improvement of intestine  . SGB may be considered as a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of hemorrhagic shock.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Plasma endotoxin was assayed by LAL test and plasma zinc was measured by flame atomic spectrophotometer. Gut mucosal permeability was determined by plasma FITC-dextran. Zinc content and ZIP14 mRNA in gut mucosa were assayed by spectrophotometer and qRT-PCR, respectively. Tight junction integrity of Caco-2 was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Tight junction (TJ) protein expression was detected by Western blotting.Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment to CLP rats improved survival rate, reduced plasma endotoxin level, alleviated hypozincemia, increased zinc accumulation and ZIP14 mRNA expression in the intestinal mucosa. Berberine and zinc gluconate pretreatment decreased CLP-elicited intestinal hyperpermeability to FITC-dextran. These effects of berberine in vivo were abolished by AG1024. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) repressed zinc transfer into Caco-2 cells exposed to zinc gluconate. Berberine and IGF-I treatment increased ZIP14 protein expression and promoted zinc transfer into Caco-2 cells exposed to zinc gluconate plus LPS. Berberine treatment induced TJ protein (claudin-1 and occludin) and raised TEER in LPS-treated Caco-2 cells. These effects of berberine in vitro were partially inhibited by ZIP14 siRNA.The present study reveals that berberine induces ZIP14 expression and affects zinc re- distribution to protect intestinal  in sepsis, which is partially linked with the activation of IGF-I signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The brain lipidome, generally characterized over half a century ago, is comprised of thousands of biochemical structures expressed differentially as a  of brain region, structure, cell type and subcellular compartment. Lipids play diverse structural and functional roles in the brain, not only due to their chemical diversity but also due to the unique hydrophobic environment that they create. This lipophilic milieu promotes interactions involving reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that may not occur, at least at a similar extent, in aqueous environments.In the present chapter, we have focused on 3 distinct types of bioactive lipids and the roles played in brain  and pathology: nitrated fatty , cholesterol and endocannabinoids. These lipids are diverse in origin and bioactivity: (1) nitrated fatty  result from biochemical modification of dietary fatty  by nutrients and are proposed to play diverse physiological roles, namely by modulating NF-kB and Nfr2-dependent signaling cascades and post-translational modification of proteins. Produced in the gastric compartment, they are absorbed into circulation and can cross the blood-brain , providing a new route for the interaction between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain; (2) cholesterol, synthetized de novo in the brain, not only regulates the biophysical properties of cellular membranes, but can also physically interact with neurotransmitter receptors and other membrane proteins and enzymes such as those involved in the processing and trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aß peptide; (3) endocannabinoids, a class of neuromodulators derived from fatty  that are synthetized and released upon demand and incite cellular responses by binding to specific membrane receptors.Being one of the most important and adjustable determinants of human health, our goal is to highlight the impact of diet on the bioactivity of lipids in the brain, discussing novel and provocative findings that advocate that lipids may modulate the gut-brain axis and therefore higher cortical functions such as motor , learning and memory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178173>Antioxidative effect of Lactobacillus plantarum Y44 on 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (ABAP)-damaged Caco-2 cells.</a></h1><p>Some Lactobacillus strains have been reported to have antioxidative activity. In our previous work, we screened Lactobacillus plantarum Y44 for its antioxidative activity. In this study, we further studied the antioxidative activities of L. plantarum Y44 using chemical antioxidant methods, including the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic ) free radical scavenging assays, the ferric reducing antioxidant power test, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity test, and we assessed damage caused by 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (ABAP) in a Caco-2 cell model. The results of the chemical antioxidant assays confirmed the antioxidative activity of L. plantarum Y44, which was consistent with the protection of Caco-2 cells against ABAP injury by L. plantarum Y44. We also found that L. plantarum Y44 significantly promoted expression of Nrf2 pathway-associated proteins, downregulated expression of inflammatory-related cytokines IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α in ABAP-damaged Caco-2 cells, and enhanced expression of the tight junction proteins β-catenin and E-cadherin. We determined that L. plantarum Y44 exerted antioxidative effects by quenching oxygen free radicals and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway in Caco-2 cells.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut  .  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut  integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted  was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut  integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut  dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty  binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut   and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607066>[New exploration of treatment target for proliferative diabetic retinopathy based on iTRAQ LC-MS/MS Proteomics].</a></h1><p> To identify differentially expressed proteins between the patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and vitreous floaters, and explore treatment target for PDR based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) LC-MS/MS Proteomics.  Vitreous samples were collected from 28 eyes of patients with PDR and 4 eyes with vitreous floaters, which served as controls. For quantitative proteomics, vitreous samples were combined and proteins extracted and labeled with iTRAQ peptide-tagging reagents. Samples were fractionated by liquid chromatography (LC), analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses performed on differentially expressed proteins identified in the PDR samples.  In the PDR vitreous, 26 proteins were identified that were differentially expressed when compared to the controls. Of these, 7 showed a significant increase (0.05) and 19 a significant decrease (0.05)in expression in PDR patients. These included some high abundance proteins including Retinoic  receptor reactive protein 2 (PDR 1=85.0, PDR 2=83.0, Control 1=119.6, Control 2=120.2, FC=0.710, 0.001), Semaphorin-4B(PDR 1=64.4, PDR 2=68.8, Control 1=135.4, Control 2=146.0, FC=0.473, 0.023), Apolipoprotein B (PDR 1=104.4, PDR 2=106.6, Control 1=89.0, Control 2=85.3, FC=1.211, 0.024), and Heat shock protein 70 (PDR 1=69.3, PDR 2=75.0, Control 1=137.7, Control 2=138.3, FC=0.523, 0.026), which are closely related to the pathological mechanism of PDR. GO analysis clustered the differentially expressed genes into three major functional domains: Biological Processes, Molecular  and Cellular Component. Differential gene expression was found in the categories of cellular metabolism, organonitrogen compound and carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes, transferase activity and transmembrane signaling receptor activity. KEGG Pathway analysis indicate that Chemerin signaling through Akt, Sema4B signaling via PI3K, and HIF-1α signal pathways were all altered in the PDR samples.  In this study we identified variations in expression of genes extensively involved in key biological processes in the retina including neovascularization, cellular metabolism and transmembrane signaling, which provide new insights into the pathophysiology of PDR. Extracellular matrix was degraded and endothelial cell migration was induced by Chemerin, in addition, the destruction of blood-retinal  and neuronal apoptosis were induced by ApoB. Chemerin and ApoB accelerated the development of PDR. Sema 4B participated in vascular protection, HSP70 conducted anti-apoptosis. These two cytokines protected the retinal neurovascular in PDR patients. Therefore, Chemerin, Sema 4B, ApoB and HSP70 may be the treatment target for PDR. .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626902>In vitro effects of glyphosate and Roundup on Sertoli cell .</a></h1><p>Roundup (R), a formulation that contains glyphosate (G) as the active ingredient, is a commonly used nonselective herbicide that has been proposed to affect male fertility. It is well known that an adequate Sertoli cell  is essential to maintain germ cell development. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether G and R are able to affect Sertoli cell functions, such as energy metabolism and blood-testis  (BTB) integrity. Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old rats were exposed to 10 and 100 ppm of G or R, doses which do not decrease cell viability. Neither G nor R caused impairment in lactate production or fatty  oxidation. G and R decreased Transepithelial Electrical Resistance, which indicates the establishment of a Sertoli cell junction . However, neither G nor R modified the expression of claudin11, ZO1 and occludin, proteins that constitute the BTB. Analysis of cellular distribution of claudin11 by immunofluorescence showed that G and R induced a delocalization of the signal from membrane to the cytoplasm. The results suggest that G and R could alter an important  of Sertoli cell such as BTB integrity and thus they could compromise the normal development of spermatogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was aimed to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota and   in burned mice to further comprehend the mechanisms of burn-induced intestinal  dysfunction.Samples were from mice inflicted with 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burns. The intestinal permeability, tight junction proteins expressions, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) localization, inflammatory cytokines expressions, and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents were determined. The microbial community was assessed via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing.The intestinal permeability was increased after severe burn injury, peaking at 6 h post-burn, with approximately 20-folds of the control ( < 0.001). The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2) was significantly altered ( < 0.05). The ZO-1 morphology was dramatically changed following burn injury. The fecal SCFAs' contents (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were noticeably declined after burn injury ( < 0.05). The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) in ileal mucosa were increased, whereas the expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) were decreased following burn injury ( < 0.05).

Acylceramide is an essential lipid for skin  formation, and CYP4F22 is a fatty  ω-hydroxylase involved in its synthesis. Mutations in CYP4F22 cause autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, although the symptoms vary among mutation sites and types. Here, we generated knockout mice deficient in Cyp4f39, the mouse ortholog of human CYP4F22, to investigate the effects of completely abrogating the  of the fatty  ω-hydroxylase involved in acylceramide production on skin  formation. Cyp4f39 knockout mice died within 8 hours of birth. Large increases in transepidermal water loss and penetration of a dye from outside the body were observed, indicating severe skin  dysfunction. Histologic analyses of the epidermis revealed impairment of lipid lamella formation, accumulation of corneodesmosomes in the stratum corneum, and persistence of periderm. In addition, lipid analyses by mass spectrometry showed almost complete loss of acylceramide and its precursor ω-hydroxy ceramide. In conclusion, our findings provide clues to the molecular mechanisms of skin  abnormalities and the pathogenesis of ichthyosis caused by Cyp4f39 and CYP4F22 by association.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Modulating and harnessing microbiota-host interactions is a promising way to promote poultry health and production efficiencies without antibiotics. In poultry, the microbiome is influenced by many host and external factors including host species, age, gut compartment, diet, and environmental exposure to microbes. Because so many factors contribute to the microbiota composition, specific knowledge is needed to predict how the microbiome will respond to interventions. The effects of antibiotics on microbiomes have been well documented, with different classes of antibiotics having distinctive, specific outcomes on bacterial functions and membership. Non-antibiotic interventions, such as probiotics and prebiotics, target specific bacterial taxa or  to enhance beneficial properties of microbes in the gut. Beneficial bacteria provide a benefit by displacing pathogens and/or producing metabolites (e.g., short chain fatty  or tryptophan metabolites) that promote poultry health by improving mucosal   or immune . Microbiota modulation has been used as a tool to reduce pathogen carriage, improve growth, and modulate the immune system. An increased understanding of how the microbiota interacts with animal hosts will improve microbiome intervention strategies to mitigate production losses without the need for antibiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318548>QM/MM Study of the Uracil DNA Glycosylase Reaction Mechanism: A Competition between Asp145 and His148.</a></h1><p>Uracil DNA glycosylase catalyzes the -glycosidic bond cleavage of uracil, thereby initiating the base excision repair mechanism for this DNA lesion.

In this article, in vitro and in vivo studies of argan (Argania spinosa), avocado (Persea americana), black cumin (Nigella sativa), calophyllum (Calophyllum inophyllum), coconut (Cocos nucifera), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), grape (Vitis vinifera), green coffee (Coffea arabica), lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus), linseed (Linum usitatissimum), lucuma (Pouteria lucuma), mango (Mangifera indica), olive (Olea europaea), pomegranate (Punica granatum), pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), rapeseed (Brassica napus), sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oils were reviewed. In many cases, vegetable oils proved to be more effective than synthetic wound-healing compounds used as controls. The fatty- components of vegetable oils are assumed to play a major role in the wound-healing process, in particular polyunsaturated fatty  such as linoleic .

Changes in the passage of large neutral amino  (LNAAs) across the blood-brain  (BBB) with an increased cerebral influx of aromatic amino  into the brain may concurrently be present and also contribute to encephalopathy, but it has not been established whether hypoxaemia  may trigger such changes. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 11 healthy men using the Kety-Schmidt technique and obtained paired arterial and jugular-venous blood samples for the determination of LNAAs by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline and after 9 hours of poikilocapnic normobaric hypoxia (12% O). Transcerebral net exchange was determined by the Fick principle, and transport of LNAAs across the BBB was determined mathematically. Hypoxia increased both the systemic and corresponding cerebral delivery of the aromatic amino  phenylalanine, and the branched-chain amino  leucine and isoleucine. Despite this, the transcerebral net exchange values and mathematically derived brain extracellular concentrations for all LNAAs were unaffected. In conclusion, the observed changes in circulating LNAAs triggered by hypoxaemia do not affect the transcerebral exchange kinetics of LNAAs to such an extent that their brain extracellular concentrations are affected.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504110>Tryptophan, glutamine, leucine, and micronutrient supplementation improves environmental enteropathy in Zambian adults: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Environmental enteropathy (EE) refers to villus blunting, reduced absorption, and microbial translocation in children and adults in tropical or deprived residential areas. In previous work we observed an effect of micronutrients on villus height (VH).We aimed to determine, in a randomized controlled trial, if amino  (AA) or multiple micronutrient (MM) supplementation can improve intestinal structure or  dysfunction in Zambian adults with EE.AA (tryptophan, leucine, and glutamine) and/or MM supplements were given for 16 wk in a 2 × 2 factorial comparison against placebo. Primary outcomes were changes in VH, in vivo small intestinal  dysfunction assessed by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), and mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) nutrient responsiveness in lamina propria CD4+ lymphocytes.Over 16 wk AA, but not MM, supplementation increased VH by 16% (34.5 μm) compared with placebo (P = 0.04). Fluorescein leak, measured by CLE, improved only in those allocated to both AA and MM supplementation. No effect was seen on MTORC1 activation, but posttreatment MTORC1 and VH were correlated (ρ = 0.51; P = 0.001), and change in MTORC1 was correlated with change in VH in the placebo group (ρ = 0.63; P = 0.03). In secondary analyses no effect was observed on biomarkers of microbial translocation. Metabolomic analyses suggest alterations in a number of microbial- and host-derived metabolites including the leucine metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, which was increased by AA supplementation and correlated with VH.In this phase 2 trial, AA supplementation protected against a decline in VH over the supplementation period, and improved   when combined with micronutrients.

Fiber-rich common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) promote intestinal health (microbiota and host epithelial  integrity) in lean mice. The objective was to assess the intestinal health promoting effects of navy bean supplementation during high-fat (HF)diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet (60% of kcal from fat) or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with 15.7% (by weight) cooked navy bean powder (HF+B) for 12 weeks. Compared to HF, the HF+B diet altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA gene sequencing), most notably increasing abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (+19-fold), whose abundance typically decreases in obese humans and rodents. Additionally, HF+B fecal abundance of carbohydrate fermenting, short chain fatty  (SCFA) producing Prevotella (+332-fold) and S24-7 (+1.6-fold) and fecal SCFA levels were increased. HF+B improved intestinal health and epithelial  integrity versus HF, evidenced by reduced serum fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran concentration in an in vivo gut permeability test, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of tight junction components (ZO-1, occludin), anti-microbial defenses (Reg3γ, IgA, Defα5, Defβ2) and mucins (Muc2). Additionally, HF+B improved the systemic obese phenotype via reduced serum HOMA-IR and leptin:adiponectin ratio, and locally via attenuation of epididymal adipose tissue crown-like structure formation, adipocyte size, and inflammatory transcription factor (NFκBp65 and STAT3) activation. Therefore, navy bean supplementation improved obese intestinal health (microbiota and epithelial  integrity) and attenuated the severity of the obese phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the effect of raw potato starch (RPS), a widely adopted RS material, on microbial composition and   of cecum for meat ducks was determined. Cherry Valley male ducks, 360,1-day-old, were randomly divided and fed diets with 0% (control), 12%, or 24% RPS for 35 d. Diets Supplemented with RPS significantly elevated villus height and villus height: crypt depth ratio in the cecum. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that the diet with 12% RPS had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and the butyrate-producing bacteria Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Erysipelatoclostridium were enriched among all diets. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly increased in the 24% RPS diet vs. the control diet.

State-of-the-art therapeutic approaches focus on alleviating the symptoms of this disease by non-invasive and simple-to-use methods. Nasal irrigation is one of the most accepted approaches to ease nasal congestion which, if left untreated, has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients.In this study, the safety and efficacy of a novel hypertonic seawater solution for nasal lavage enriched with hyaluronic , eucalyptus oil, copper, and manganese salts (Stérimar Stop & Protect Cold and Flu; SSPCF) have been investigated in vitro.An in vitro 3D reconstituted human nasal epithelium tissue model, MucilAir™, has been used in this study to investigate the safety of SSPCF on nasal epithelium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. The efficacy of SSPCF was measured by mucociliary clearance (MCC), ATP release, Alcian blue and aquaporin (AQP3) stainings.SSPCF treatment respected nasal epithelium tissue integrity and enhanced   without inducing a cytotoxic response. Secreted LDH and IL-8 levels were similar to untreated controls. MCC rate was increased 2.5-fold and ATP release decreased 87% upon SSPCF treatment, indicating improved decongestion activity. SSPCF treatment after hypotonic stress helped recover cellular organization, as shown by Alcian blue and AQP3 staining assays.SSPCF appears as a safe and effective nasal irrigation formula that may alleviate the symptoms associated with common cold such as nasal congestion.© 2019 Huang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454490>Astrocyte-derived fatty -binding protein 7 protects blood-brain  integrity through a caveolin-1/MMP signaling pathway following traumatic brain injury.</a></h1><p>The astrocyte-endothelial cell interaction is crucial for normal brain homeostasis and blood-brain  (BBB) disruption in pathological conditions. However, the mechanism by which astrocytes control BBB integrity, especially after traumatic brain injury (TBI), remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that astrocyte-derived fatty -binding protein 7 (FABP7), a differentiation- and migration-associated molecule, may  as a modulator of BBB permeability in a rat weight-drop model of TBI. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBI induced increased expression of FABP7 in astrocytes, accompanied by caveolin-1 (Cav-1) upregulation in endothelial cells. Administration of recombinant FABP7 significantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB permeability, concomitant with upregulation of endothelial Cav-1 and tight junction protein expression, while FABP7 knockdown resulted in the opposite effects. Furthermore, pretreatment with daidzein, a specific inhibitor of Cav-1, reversed the inhibitory effects of recombinant FABP7 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 expression and abolished its BBB protection after TBI. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocyte-derived FABP7 upregulation may represent an endogenous protective response to BBB disruption partly mediated through a Cav-1/MMP signaling pathway following TBI.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, biogenic synthesis of AgNPs has emerged although the extent of effects from exposure, oral exposure in particular, to nanomaterials synthesized in such a manner remains elusive. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral administration of a dose of 50 mg/Kg body weight AgNPs biosynthesized in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) over a period of eight weeks on the reproductive performance and the possibility of a protective effect through co-administration of morin. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in four experimental groups (control, morin-treated group, AgNP-treated, and AgNP + morin co-treatment). AgNPs produced no significant alteration in daily food intake or body weight. Both the absolute and relative testicular weights were significantly reduced but not the epididymal weight. Also, serum levels of urea, creatinine, uric , and liver enzymes were significantly elevated. Furthermore, AgNPs significantly downregulated the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This corresponds to lower motility and viability percent, reduced sperm concentration, and a higher abnormality ratio as well as a prominent alteration in the blood-testis  (BTB) and testicular histology and induction of testicular apoptosis and oxidative stress. The supplementation of morin evidently restored most of the reproductive characters to its physiological range. We can conclude that exposure to the biologically synthesized AgNPs for an extended period of time has proven to be a health risk that can be ameliorated via oral administration of some bioactive agents including morin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31226937>Does long-term cadmium exposure influence the composition of pectic polysaccharides in the cell wall of Medicago sativa stems?</a></h1><p>The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) accumulates in the environment due to anthropogenic influences. It is unessential and harmful to all life forms. The plant cell wall forms a physical  against environmental stress and changes in the cell wall structure have been observed upon Cd exposure. In the current study, changes in the cell wall composition and structure of Medicago sativa stems were investigated after long-term exposure to Cd. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for quantitative protein analysis was complemented with targeted gene expression analysis and combined with analyses of the cell wall composition.Several proteins determining for the cell wall structure changed in abundance. Structural changes mainly appeared in the composition of pectic polysaccharides and data indicate an increased presence of xylogalacturonan in response to Cd. Although a higher abundance and enzymatic activity of pectin methylesterase was detected, the total pectin methylation was not affected.An increased abundance of xylogalacturonan might hinder Cd binding in the cell wall due to the methylation of its galacturonic  backbone. Probably, the exclusion of Cd from the cell wall and apoplast limits the entry of the heavy metal into the symplast and is an important factor during tolerance acquisition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410589>Aminooxyacetic  (АОА), inhibitor of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxilic  (AСС) synthesis, suppresses self-incompatibility-induced programmed cell death in self-incompatible Petunia hybrida L. pollen tubes.</a></h1><p>Self-incompatibility (SI) is genetically determined reproductive  preventing inbreeding and thereby providing the maintenance of plant species diversity. At present, active studies of molecular bases of SI mechanisms are underway. S-RNAse-based SI in Petunia hybrida L. is a self-/non-self recognition system that allows the pistil to reject self pollen and to accept non-self pollen for outcrossing. In the present work, using fluorescent methods including the TUNEL method allowed us to reveal the presence of markers of programmed cell death (PCD), such as DNA fragmentation, in growing in vivo petunia pollen tubes during the passage of the SI reaction. The results of statistical analysis reliably proved that PCD is the factor of S-RNAse-based SI. It was found that preliminary treatment before self-pollination of stigmas of petunia self-incompatible line with aminooxyacetic  (AOA), inhibitor of ACC synthesis, led to stimulation of pollen tubes growth when the latter did not exhibit any hallmarks of PCD. These data argue in favor of assumption that ethylene controls the passage of PCD in incompatible pollen tubes in the course of S-RNAse-based SI functioning.

A total of five hundred and four 21-wk-old layers were randomly allotted into 4 groups consisting of 7 replicates with 18 birds per replicate. The birds were fed a basic diet (CON) or diets with EOA at 150 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, and 450 mg/kg in the other 3 groups, respectively. Compared to the CON group, the addition of 150 mg/kg EOA significantly increased laying rate (P < 0.05) of hens from week 21 to 25. A linear increasing (linear, P < 0.01) in ileal villus height of laying hens fed EOA from 150 to 300 mg/kg was observed at week 30. At week 25, the supplementation of 300 mg/kg EOA significantly increased (P < 0.05) mRNA relative expression of aminopeptidase, sodium-glucose cotransporter 1, and Na+-independent neutral amino  transporter in duodenum and glucose transporter 2 in jejunum of laying hens compared to the CON groups. Meanwhile, the relative expression of glucose transporter 2 mRNA in the jejunum was upregulated with increasing concentration of EOA in diets (linear, P < 0.05). Hens in EOA 300 group had higher mRNA relative expression of mucin-2 in ileum (P < 0.05) than hens in CON group. Additionally, the secretory immunoglobulin in ileum A were linear decreased (linear, P < 0.01) with the increasing supplement of EOA.

Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell .

The goal of this study was to evaluate food designed to improve skin   and lower inflammation to reduce pruritus and clinical severity in client-owned atopic dogs. The food contained an antioxidant blend to reduce oxidative stress, plant polyphenols to stabilize mast cells, and polyunsaturated fatty  to improve skin health and reduce inflammation.Seventeen dogs were included in the analysis. Initially 48 adult atopic dogs were enrolled and exclusively fed a dermatologic food for 8 weeks in a non-controlled, open-label study. Thirty-one dogs were excluded for the following reasons: oral and topical medication changes (n = 17), missing data (n = 4), fatty  supplementation (n = 3), food refusal (n = 3), dropped out (n = 3), and owner concerns (n = 1). Using a scale from 0 (normal) - 4 (severe), veterinarians evaluated the presence and severity of clinical signs of atopy at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Pet owners also rated their pet's clinical signs of atopy on a scale from 0 (not present) - 10 (present continuously) at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Compared with initial baseline scores (median 19, range 3-69), the total veterinarian scores were significantly lower at weeks 4 (median 11, range 1-15) and 8 (median 7, range 3-46) (p < 0.05). Similarly, owner assessments showed significant improvements in the least squares mean (LSM) from baseline to 4 weeks (itching, redness, licking, and scratching) continuing to 8 weeks (itching, redness, and scratching) (p < 0.05).In this open, non-controlled study evaluating a dermatologic diet in seventeen client-owned dogs, owner and veterinarian assessments showed statistically significant reductions in clinical scores designed to measure severity of atopic dermatitis.

In consequence, PIN has great potential in preventing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) while scant information is available. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rats ulcerative colitis model (3.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days) was applied to explore the protective effects of PIN on macroscopic colitis symptoms, inflammation, intestinal epithelial  , and gut microbiota homeostasis. While DSS-treated rats showed severe colitis clinical symptoms and histological changes (colonic pathological damages and intestinal goblet cells loss), pre-administration of PIN (5 and 10 mg/kg, ) for a week alleviated these symptoms. Pre-administration of PIN also suppressed the pro-inflammatory gene expressions and improved tight junction functions of colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, PIN administration reversed DSS-induced short chain fatty  loss, and improved the gut microbial diversity assessed by 16S rRNA phylogenetic sequencing.

According to the broad investigations, it is widely assumed that the contribution of inflammatory mediators is strongly involved in its pathogenesis. Hence, it seems that stroke treatment needs more efficient and inflammatory-targeted compounds to modulate inflammatory-related pathways. Such strategies paved the way to achieve better clinical outcomes along with conventional therapies. Boswellic  (BAs), the main bioactive compounds of Boswellia sp. resin; are triterpenoids with well-documented anti-inflammatory properties. Compared with NSAIDs, BAs cross blood-brain  yet they do not cause serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Considering BAs anti-inflammatory features, we conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial of these compounds as a supplementary therapy. This trial randomized 80 ischaemic stroke patients (40-80-years old) with a 4-20 score according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), within 72 h of neurological sign onset, in 1-month follow-up period. We assessed NIHSS as primary and plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, 8-isoprostane, and PGE2 as secondary outcomes. According to NIHSS evaluation, patients who were allocated to BA group had a significant recovery in neurological  during the 1-month follow-up, compared with the placebo. The levels of plasma inflammatory markers were significantly decreased in BA group after 7 days of intervention in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and PGE2. As a preliminary controlled trial in ischaemic stroke, BAs could improve clinical outcome in the early phases of stroke along with promising changes in plasma inflammatory factors.Clinical trial registration https://www.irct.ir Unique identifier: IRCT20170315033086N5.

We have previously shown that the ablation of pharmacoresistant voltage-gated Ca channels with Ca2.3 as central ion-conducting pore (R-type Ca channel) reduces the sensitivity towards KA-induced epilepsy in mice. In vivo, Ca2.3 channels are thought to be under tight allosteric control by endogenous loosely bound trace metal cations (Zn and Cu) that suppress channel gating via a high-affinity trace metal-binding site. Metal dyshomeostasis in the brain, which is a common feature of (KA-induced) seizures, could therefore alter the normal  of Ca2.3 channels and may shift hippocampal and neocortical signaling towards hyperexcitation. To investigate the role of loosely bound metal ions for KA-induced hyperexcitation in vivo, we examined the effects of manipulating brain trace metal homeostasis in mice. To this end, we developed a murine system for intracerebroventricular administration of trace metal ions and/or histidine (His), which can bind Zn and Cu and is involved in their transendothelial transport at the blood-brain . Unexpectedly, our preliminary findings indicate that application of His alone but not in the presence of Zn has substantial beneficial effects on the outcome of KA-induced epilepsy in mice. As such, our results emphasize previous findings on the complex, two-sided role of loosely bound metal ions with regard to neuronal excitation and degeneration under pathophysiological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282475>LAT1 (SLC7A5) and CD98hc (SLC3A2) complex dynamics revealed by single-particle cryo-EM.</a></h1><p>Solute carriers are a large class of transporters that play key roles in normal and disease .

Here, these structures are analyzed together with our lower resolution cryo-EM structure, and multibody 3D auto-refinement against single-particle cryo-EM data was used to characterize the dynamics of the interaction of CD98hc and LAT1. It is shown that the CD98hc ectodomain and the LAT1 extracellular surface share no substantial interface. This allows the CD98hc ectodomain to have a high degree of movement within the extracellular space.

Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS) was applied to identify crucial proteins involved in HE infection. A total of 938 proteins were identified and used to generate a reference library for SWATH-MS analysis. In total, 523 proteins were reliably quantified, and 64 proteins were found to be differentially expressed, including 49 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated proteins between healthy and HE-affected intestinal mucosa. Functional analysis suggested that these proteins were involved in the following categories of cellular pathways and metabolisms: 1) energy pathways; 2) intestine lipid and amino  metabolism; 3) oxidative stress; 4) intestinal immune response. Major findings of this study demonstrated that natural HE infection is related to the changes in abundance of several proteins involved in cell-intrinsic immune defense against viral invasion, systemic inflammation, modulation of excessive inflammation, B and T cell development and  and antigen presentation. mRNA quantitative expression demonstrated that most of the proteins involved in innate immunity that were found to be differentially abundant were produced by intestinal mucosa, suggesting its direct involvement in immune defences against HE infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In an ideal case, hemoadsorption results in immediate recovery of microvascular endothelial cells' (mEC)  and rapid recovery from catecholamine-dependency and septic shock. We here tested a single device, which consists of polystyrene-divinylbenzene core particles of 450 μm diameter with a high affinity for hydrophobic compounds. The current study aimed at the proof of concept that endothelial-specific damage mediators are adsorbed and can be recovered from hemoadsorption devices. Because of excellent clinical experience, we tested protein fractions released from a hemoadsorber in a novel endothelial bioassay. Video-based, long-term imaging of mEC proliferation and cell death were evaluated and combined with apoptosis and ATP measurements. Out of a total of 39 fractions recovered from column fractionation, we identified 3 fractions that caused i) inhibition of mEC proliferation, ii) increased cell death and iii) induction of apoptosis in mEC. When adding these 3 fractions to mEC, their ATP contents were reduced. These fractions contained proteins of approximately 15 kDa, and high amounts of nucleic , which was at least in part oxidized. The efficacy for endothelial cell damage prevention by hemoadsorption can be addressed by a novel endothelial bioassay and long-term video observation procedures. Protein fractionation of the hemoadsorption devices used is feasible to study and define endothelial damage ligands on a molecular level. The results suggest a significant effect by circulating nucleic  - bound to an as yet undefined protein, which may constitute a major danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in the exacerbation of inflammation when patients experience septic shock.

Due to their physico-chemical properties, nanoparticles (NP) can cross the BBB and accumulate in different areas of the central nervous system (CNS), thus are potential tools to carry drugs and treat brain disorders. In vitro systems and animal models have demonstrated that some NP types promote neurotoxic effects such as neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the CNS. Thus, risk assessment of the NP is required, but current 2D cell cultures fail to mimic complex in vivo cellular interactions, while animal models do not necessarily reflect human effects due to physiological and species differences.We evaluated the suitability of in vitro models that mimic the human CNS , studying the effects of metallic gold NP (AuNP) functionalized with sodium citrate (Au-SC), or polyethylene glycol (Au-PEG), and polymeric polylactic  NP (PLA-NP). Two different 3D neural models were used (i) human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from the LUHMES cell line (3D LUHMES) and (ii) human iPSC-derived brain spheroids (BrainSpheres).

NP were efficiently taken up by spheroids, especially when PEGylated and in presence of glia. AuNP, especially PEGylated AuNP, effected mitochondria and anti-oxidative defense.

The use of messengerRNA (mRNA) to transiently overexpress a specific factor could compensate for this imbalance. However, a critical challenge of this approach lies in the ability to efficiently deliver mRNA molecules to the retinal target cells. In this study we found that intravitreal (IVT) injection is an attractive approach to deliver mRNA to the retina, providing two critical barriers can be overcome: the vitreous and the inner limiting membrane (ILM). We demonstrated that the vitreous is indeed a major hurdle in the delivery of the cationic mRNA-complexes to retinal cells, both in terms of vitreal mobility and cellular uptake. To improve their intravitreal mobility and avoid unwanted extracellular interactions, we evaluated the use of hyaluronic  (HA) as an electrostatic coating strategy. This HA-coating provided the complexes with a negative surface charge, markedly enhancing their mobility in the vitreous humor, without reducing their cellular internalization and transfection efficiency. However, although this coating strategy allows the mRNA-complexes to successfully overcome the vitreal , the majority of the particles accumulated at the ILM. This study therefore underscores the crucial   of the ILM toward non-viral retinal gene delivery and the need to smartly design mRNA-carriers able to surmount the vitreous as well as the ILM.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Besides neurological defects, peroxisomal dysfunction can also lead to testicular abnormalities. However, underlying alterations in the testes due to a peroxisomal defect are not well characterized yet.

Due to a different cellular content in the germinal epithelium of Pex13 KO testes compared to control, whole testes biopsies were used for the analyses. Thus, differences in lipid composition and gene expression are only shown for whole testicular tissue but cannot be limited to single cells. Gas chromatography revealed an increase of shorter fatty  and a decrease of n-6 docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6) and n-3 docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3), the main components of sperm plasma membranes. Representative genes of the metabolite transport and peroxisomal β-oxidation were strongly down-regulated. In addition, structural components of the blood-testis  (BTB) were altered. To conclude, defects in the peroxisomal compartment interfere with normal spermatogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492955>L-Type Amino  Transporter 1 (LAT1/Lat1)-Utilizing Prodrugs Can Improve the Delivery of Drugs into Neurons, Astrocytes and Microglia.</a></h1><p>L-Type Amino  Transporter 1 (LAT1/Lat1) is responsible for carrying large, neutral L-amino  as well as several drugs and prodrugs across the blood-brain  (BBB). However, the BBB is not the only  that hinders drugs acting effectively within the brain; the brain parenchymal cell membranes represent a secondary  for the drugs with intracellular target sites. In this study, expression and  of Lat1 was quantified in mouse primary neuron, astrocyte and immortalized microglia (BV2) cultures. Moreover, ability of Lat1 to carry prodrugs inside these brain cells was evaluated. The results showed that Lat1 was localized at the similar level in all studied cells (3.07 ± 0.92-3.77 ± 0.91 fmol/µg protein). The transporter was also functional in all three cell types, astrocytes having the highest transport capacity and affinity for the LAT1/Lat1-substrate, [C]-L-leucine, followed by neurons and microglia. The designed prodrugs (1-6) were able to utilize Lat1 for their cellular uptake and it was mainly much higher than the one of their parent drugs. Interestingly, improved cellular uptake was also achieved in cells representing Alzheimer's Disease phenotype. Therefore, improved delivery and intra-brain targeting of drugs can be attained by utilizing LAT1/Lat1 and prodrug approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159179>Towards a Food Pharmacy: Immunologic Modulation through Diet.</a></h1><p>Patients frequently wonder whether their dietary pattern influences the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many patients even avoid certain foods that aggravate their symptoms. Although interest in nutritional interventions is rising among physicians, the current application of nutritional interventions in the IBD population is limited due to the lack of scientific evidence from clinical trials. Several studies, however, have identified associations between diet, gut microbiota, intestinal epithelial integrity, and mucosal immune responses. In patients consuming predominantly a Western diet high in n-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  (PUFAs), sugars, and meat, and low in fruits and vegetables, an impaired gut epithelial  and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota have been observed, resulting in a chronic mucosal inflammation. An anti-inflammatory diet may restore this disbalance.

A dense array of complex and diverse glycoconjugates is present on essentially all animal cell surfaces. Sialic  are widely allocated at the outermost ends of glycan chains, attached to membrane proteins and lipids below. Due to their abundance and their terminal position in glycans, sialic  are implicated in many physiological and pathological functions. Although the composition of lung epithelial cell-surface glycans has been studied over the years, it is not yet completely understood. In the present work, we aimed to histochemically localize N-acetylneuraminic  (Neu5Ac)>N-glycolylneuraminic  (Neu5Gc) residues on rat bronchioloalveolar epithelial cell surfaces using light microscopy (LM) methods. In lung membranes isolated from adult rat lung homogenates, we also separated, identified and quantified Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and systematically described the optimized HPLC methods used. Sialic  residues were localized on the surface coat of bronchioloalveolar cells, and the mean quantification of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc in the adult rat lung homogenates was 12,26 and 2,73 μg/mg prot., respectively, revealing a manifest preponderance of Neu5Ac. A coefficient of variation (CV) of 4,98% and 4,40%, respectively was obtained and an optimal dispersion variability expressed by the SD and the CV was also reported, confirming the efficiency of the methodology. To the best of our knowledge, our group was the first to identify, separate and quantify sialic  in purified lung membranes. The presence of these residues contributes to a strong anionic shield and may provide an hydrating and protective  as well as a repulsive structure that is crucial to lung .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supplementing a novel specific low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) dietary fiber in preventing T1D development. Female NOD mice were weaned onto control or 5% (wt/wt) LMP supplemented diets for up to 40 weeks of age, overt diabetes incidence and blood glucose were monitored. Then broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) treatment per os for 7 days followed by gut microbiota transfer was performed to demonstrate gut microbiota-dependent effects. Next-generation sequencing was used for analyzing the composition of microbiota in caecum. Concentration of short chain fatty  were determined by GC-MS. The  reinforcing tight junction proteins zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), claudin-1 and NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation were determined by Western blot. The proportion of CD25Foxp3CD4 regulatory T cell (Foxp3 Treg) in the pancreas, pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that LMP supplementation ameliorated T1D development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as evidenced by decreasing diabetes incidence and fasting glucose levels in LMP fed NOD mice. Further microbiota analysis revealed that LMP supplementation prevented T1D-associated caecal dysbiosis and selectively enriched caecal bacterial species to produce more SCFAs. The LMP-mediated microbial balance further enhanced caecal   and shaped gut-pancreatic immune environment, as characterized by higher expression of tight junction proteins claudin-1, ZO-2 in caecum, increased Foxp3 Treg population and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas. The microbiota-dependent beneficial effect of LMP on T1D was further proven by the fact that aberration of caecal microbiota by ABX treatment worsened T1D autoimmunity and could be restored with transfer of feces of LMP-fed NOD mice. These data demonstrate that this novel LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment. This finding opens a realistic option for gut microbiota manipulation and prevention of T1D in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507190>The involvement of the substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor system in viral infection: focus on the gp120 fusion protein and homologous dipeptide domains.</a></h1><p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope, via a key extracellular amino  sequence, may simulate the functionality of native undecapeptide substance P (SP) acting through the host's neurokinin 1 (SP preferring) receptor (NK-1R).

Although co-incubation with docosahexaenoic  (DHA) exerts a positive effect on deficient skin models, no studies have investigated the effects of topical treatment with DHA in an inflammatory reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model. The effects of DHA on monolayer normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) cells were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The skin-related   was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Western blot (WB), immunohistofluorescence (IF), and ELISA in normal and inflammatory RHE models. Docosahexaenoic  upregulated filaggrin and loricrin expression at mRNA levels in addition to suppressing overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-α (IL-1α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulated by polyinosinic-polycytidylic  (poly I:C) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (stimulation cocktail) in cultured NHEK cells. After topical treatment with DHA, cocktail-induced inflammatory characteristics of skin diseases, including  morphology, differentiation proteins, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) secretion, were alleviated in RHE models.

HS is synthesized from L-cysteine and/or L-homocysteine by cystathionine β-synthase, cystathionine γ-lyase, and cysteine aminotransferase together with 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In addition, HS is enzymatically metabolized in mitochondria by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase, and sulfite oxidase to thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfate which enables to regulate its level by factors such as oxygen pressure, mitochondria density, or efficacy of mitochondrial electron transport. HS modifies protein structure and  through the so-called sulfuration or persulfidation, that is, conversion of cysteine thiol (-SH) to persulfide (-SSH) groups. This, as well as other signaling mechanisms, is partially mediated by more oxidized HS-derived species, polysulfides (HS). In addition, HS is able to react with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to form other signaling molecules such as thionitrous  (HSNO), nitrosopersulfide (SSNO), and nitroxyl (HNO). All HS-synthesizing enzymes are expressed in the vascular wall, and HS has been demonstrated to regulate vascular tone, endothelial  permeability, angiogenesis, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, and inflammatory reaction. HS-modifying therapies are promising approach for diseases such as arterial hypertension, diabetic angiopathy, and atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255699>Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Oat1 and Oat3 transporters and their interaction with physiological compounds.</a></h1><p>Organic anion transporters (OATs) are membrane proteins within the Solute carrier family 22 (SLC22). They play important roles in cellular uptake of various organic compounds, and due to their expression in  tissues of major excretory and non-excretory organs are considered as crucial elements in absorption and distribution of a wide range of endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds. Based on our previous work and initial insights on SLC22 members in zebrafish (Danio rerio), in this study we aimed at in vitro characterization of Oat1 and Oat3 transporters and understanding of their interaction with potential physiological substrates. We first performed synteny analysis to describe in more detail orthological relationship of zebrafish oat1 and oat3 genes. We then developed stable cell lines overexpressing Oat1 and Oat3, and identified Lucifer yellow as Oat1 model fluorescent substrate (Km = 11.4 μM) and 6-carboxyfluorescein as Oat3 model substrate (Km = 5.8 μM). Initial identification performed using the developed assays revealed Kreb's cycle intermediates, bilirubin, bile salts and steroid hormones as the most potent of Oat1 and Oat3 interactors, with IC50 values in micromolar range. Finally, we showed that bilirubin, deoxycholic , α-ketoglutarate, pregnenolone, estrone-3-sulfate and corticosterone are in vitro substrates of zebrafish Oat1, and bilirubin and deoxycholic  are Oat3 substrates. In conclusion, using the approach described, structural and functional similarities of both transporters to human and mammalian orthologs are revealed, their broad ligand selectivity confirmed, potent interactors among endobiotic compounds identified, and first indications of their potential physiological role(s) in zebrafish obtained.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Changes in jejunal morphology, mucosal  , microbial populations, and fermentation in the piglets were determined. Data showed that β-glucan prevented body weight loss in LPS challenged piglets. Supplementation with both β-glucan fractions improved jejunal morphology. Compared to low MW, β-glucan of high MW generally up-regulated transcripts of , , and  and concentration of butyrate emerged after feeding β-glucan with high MW.

Previously we have shown that endothelial activation induced by inflammation and hyperglycemia results in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated intercellular junction alterations accompanied by visual deficits in a tie2-TNF-α transgenic mouse model. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increased ER stress via O-GlcNAcylation of VE-Cadherin likely contribute to endothelial permeability. We show that ER stress leads to GRP78 translocation to the plasma membrane, increased O-GlcNAcylation of proteins, particularly VE-Cadherin resulting in a defective complex partnering leading to the loss of retinal endothelial  integrity and increased transendothelial migration of monocytes. We further show an association of GRP78 with the VE-Cadherin under these conditions. Interestingly, cells exposed to ER stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic  partially mitigated all these effects. Our findings suggest an essential role for ER stress and O-GlcNAcylation in altering the endothelial   and reveal a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of DR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176417>Changes in the small intestine mucosal immune  in Muscovy ducklings infected with Muscovy duck reovirus.</a></h1><p>Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV) causes serious immunodeficiency in the intestinal mucosa, although the underlying histopathological mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, we investigated the impact of MDRV infection on intestinal morphology using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Immune-related cells were also quantified by staining with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and periodic -Schiff stain, or by immunohistochemistry and cytochemistry for lectin. Similarly, CD4 and CD8 cells were quantified by flow cytometry, and the expression of several immune-related molecules was quantified by radioimmunoassay. We found that MDRV clearly damaged the intestinal mucosa, based on tissue morphology, villus length, villus width, intestinal thickness, villus height/crypt depth ratio, and villus surface area. MDRV also altered the density or distribution of lymphocytes, mastocytes, and goblet cells in the small intestinal mucosa, as well as microfold cells in Peyer's patches. In addition, MDRV markedly depleted CD4 cells from the intestinal mucosa and lowered the CD4:CD8 ratio in peripheral blood. Moreover, MDRV diminished the levels of secretory IgA and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (p < 0.01), but elevated those of histamine and nitric oxide (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). Finally, MDRV significantly suppressed IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-8 levels (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) mid-infection. Collectively, our data suggest that MDRV severely damages the structure and  of the intestinal mucosa by modulating immune cells and immune-related factors, thus leading to local immunodeficiency. Our findings lay the foundation for further research on the pathogenesis of MDRV.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike most members from the amidohydrolase superfamily it does not require a metal ion. Here, we use multiscale computational enzymology to investigate the catalytic mechanism, substrate binding, oxyanion hole, and roles of key active site residues of NicF from . In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and QTAIM methods have been applied. The mechanism of the NicF-catalyzed reaction proceeds by a nucleophilic addition-elimination sequence involving the formation of a thioester enzyme intermediate ( in stage 1) followed by hydrolysis of the thioester bond to form the products (stage 2). Consequently, the formation of  in stage 1 is the rate-limiting step with a  of 88.8 kJ·mol relative to the reactant complex, . Comparisons with related metal-dependent enzymes, particularly the zinc-dependent nicotinamidase from  (SpNic), have also been made to further illustrate unique features of the present mechanism. Along with -NH- donor groups of the oxyanion hole (i.e., HN-Thr146, HN-Cys150), the active site β-hydroxyl of threonine (HO-βThr146) is concluded to play a role in stabilizing the carbonyl oxygen of maleamate during the mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602443>Altered short chain fatty  profiles induced by dietary fiber intervention regulate AMPK levels and intestinal homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary intervention on intestinal microbiota-mediated change in short chain fatty  (SCFA) profile and intestinal homeostasis. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA of gut bacteria, metagenomics, intestinal epithelial transcriptomics, and metabonomics were conducted. Results showed that the dietary interventions altered the microbiota composition of cecal digesta, microbiota-mediated metabolism, and the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells. Compared with red meat-diet-fed mice, fiber-diet-fed mice presented a shift in the gut microbiome toward increased production of butanoate, which was accompanied by up-regulation of microbiota- and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent gene expression and decrease in serum concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), triglyceride (TG) and glucose (GLU).

However, an increasing number of studies have recently authenticated its biotoxicological effects. In this study, for evaluating the gut toxicity of F-53B in mammals, both female and male mice were orally exposed to 0, 1, 3, or 10 μg/L F-53B for 10 weeks. Our results showed that F-53B significantly accumulated in the colon, ileum and serum when exposed to 10 μg/L F-53B for 10 weeks. F-53B exposure not only increased the transcriptional levels of ion transport-related genes but could also interact with the CFTR protein directly. Interestingly, subchronic F-53B exposure also increased the transcription of mucus secretion-related genes, but the protein level of Muc2 decreased after F-53B exposure, indicating that there was a compensatory phenomenon after mucus  injury. Furthermore, F-53B exposure also induced colonic inflammation associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis in the colon. Taken together, our results indicated that the potential gut toxicity of F-53B and almost all of the changed parameters were significantly affected in both female and male mice, suggesting that F-53B could disturb the gut  without sex dependence in mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, ameliorating oxidative-stress-induced senescence is expected to prevent chronic diseases. The beneficial effects of bilberry anthocyanin (BA) on healthy aging were evaluated using 12 month old, aging female SD rats in this study. The experimental results suggested that consumption of a middle-dose of BA (MBA) appreciably increased the relative liver mass by 7.34% when compared with that of the AC group. Furthermore, BA significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity, total superoxide dismutase activity, and catalase activities; decreased malondialdehyde, serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), serum total cholesterol (TC), serum triglyceride (TG), and glycated serum protein (GSP) levels; and reduced TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios. In addition, MBA decreased the activity of fecal bacterial enzymes and increased the content of fecal short-chain fatty . The Western blot results showed that MBA significantly upregulated the expression of OCLN, ZO-1, and autophagy-related proteins (ATP6 V0C, ATG4D, and CTSB) in aging rats. Moreover, it also showed that MBA induced the phosphorylation of AMPK and FOXO3a and inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR, which indicated that bilberry anthocyanin induced autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of grape peel powder (GPP) and its bioactive rich-fractions on the   and colonic injury in a model of colitis induced by 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS). Wistar rats received diets supplemented with either GPP (8%), extractable polyphenols (EP), non-extractable polyphenols-rich fraction (NEP-F), or polyphenols-poor, fiber-rich fraction (F) from grapes at amounts equivalent to the GPP group during 15 days before and for 7 days after colitis induction. NEP-F has decreased the extension of colonic lesion but the other grape peel bioactive fractions did not protect against macroscopic or microscopic colonic damage, EP diet increased macroscopic colonic damage. GPP, EP, and NEP-F reduced claudin-2 mRNA expression, whereas GPP and F fraction increased occludin and ZO-1 mRNA expression. All experimental diets reduced the colitis-triggered increase of MMP-9 mRNA expression. Colitis reduced by 30% the production of cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA). GPP and NEP-F completely protected against this effect, whereas F fraction was ineffective. Only GPP and NEP-F were able to decrease the upregulation of GRP94 mRNA triggered by colitis. Dietary fiber seems to reestablish the intestinal  , whereas fiber-bound phenolics were able to restore cecal metabolism to produce beneficial metabolites like SCFA and to reduce the activation of the unfolded protein response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent evidence suggests that intestinal mucosal  damage and intestinal dysbiosis occur in mice with hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 or bile duct ligation. Another study showed that ursolic  (UA) attenuates experimental colitis via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of UA on the intestinal mucosal  in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats and identify its associated mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following 3 groups ( = 10/group): the control, CCl4 model and UA treatment groups. Rats were sacrificed at 72 h after the hepatic fibrosis model was established and assessed for liver fibrosis, intestinal injury, enterocyte apoptosis, bacterial translocation, system inflammation, intestinal oxidative stress, and tight junction protein and NOX protein expression. The results demonstrated that UA attenuated the following: (i) liver and intestinal pathological injury; (ii) cleaved caspase-3 expression in the ileal epithelial cells; (iii) serum lipopolysaccharide and procalcitonin levels; (iv) intestinal malondialdehyde levels; and (v) the expression of the NOX protein components NOX2 and P67phox in ileal tissues. Furthermore, our results suggested that UA improved intestinal dysbiosis and the expression of the tight junction proteins Claudin 1 and Occludin in the ileum of rats. These results indicate that UA has protective effects on the intestinal mucosal  in rats with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by inhibiting intestinal NOX-mediated oxidative stress.

To achieve this objective, overlapping actions of complex cellular processes, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation, are required. These events are longitudinally and tightly controlled by numerous factors including a wide range of distinct regulatory proteins. However, the sequence of events associated with colon mucosal repair after colitis and the evolution of the luminal content characteristics during this process have been little studied.To document the evolution of colon mucosal characteristics during mucosal healing using a mouse model with chemically-induced colitis.C57BL/6 male mice were given 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5 d. They were euthanized 2 (day 7), 5 (day 10), 8 (day 13), and 23 (day 28) d after DSS removal. The colonic luminal environment and epithelial repair processes during the inflammatory flare and colitis resolution were analyzed with reference to a non-DSS treated control group, euthanized at day 0. Epithelial repair events were assessed histo-morphologically in combination with functional permeability tests, expression of key inflammatory and repairing factors, and evaluation of colon mucosa-adherent microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing.The maximal intensity of colitis was concomitant with maximal alterations of intestinal   and histological damage associated with goblet cell depletion in colon mucosa. It was recorded 2 d after termination of the DSS-treatment, followed by a progressive return to values similar to those of control mice. Although signs of colitis were severe (inflammatory cell infiltrate, crypt disarray, increased permeability) and associated with colonic luminal alterations (hyperosmolarity, dysbiosis, decrease in short-chain fatty  content), epithelial healing processes were launched early during the inflammatory flare with increased gene expression of certain key epithelial repair modulators, including transforming growth factor-β, interleukin (Il)-15, Il-22, Il-33, and serum amyloid A. Whereas signs of inflammation progressively diminished, luminal colonic environment alterations and microscopic abnormalities of colon mucosa persisted long after colitis induction.This study shows that colon repair can be initiated in the context of inflamed mucosa associated with alterations of the luminal environment and highlights the longitudinal involvement of key modulators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198147>[Preventive oral rehydration salts III could protect intestinal  in rats with exertional heatstroke].</a></h1><p>To observe the damage of various organs of rats with exertional heatstroke (EHS), and to investigate the protective effect of oral rehydration salts III (ORS III) on multi-organ  in rats with EHS.Fifty-one male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups by random digit table: normal control group (n = 13), EHS group (n = 13), EHS+water group (n = 12), and EHS+ORS III group (n = 13).

Six hours later, blood of inferior vena cava was collected, and the levels of serum MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum potassium, serum sodium and serum chloride were determined by automatic chemical analyzer. Serum intestinal fatty -binding protein (I-FABP) was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The levels of LDH, ALT, AST, BUN, serum sodium and serum chloride in the EHS group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group [LDH (U/L): 1 220±427 vs. 837±485, ALT (U/L): 138 (97, 164) vs. 37 (33, 42), AST (U/L): 409 (380, 566) vs. 86 (78, 104), BUN (mmol/L): 11.7 (9.6, 13.2) vs. 5.9 (5.5, 6.1), serum sodium (mmol/L): 148.0 (143.5, 154.5) vs. 139.0 (138.0, 140.5), serum chloride (mmol/L): 100.9±2.3 vs. 97.3±1.4, all P < 0.05], but no significant difference in CK-MB, SCr or serum potassium could be found [CK-MB (U/L): 1 280±373 vs. 1 379±480, SCr (μmol/L): 38.2±7.5 vs. 35.5±6.3, serum potassium (mmol/L): 5.5 (4.4, 6.2) vs. 4.7 (4.4, 4.9), all P > 0.05]. In the EHS+ORS III group, only serum potassium level was significantly lower than that in the EHS group [mmol/L: 4.0 (3.7, 4.4) vs. 5.5 (4.4, 6.2), P < 0.01], while no significant difference in other parameters was found between the EHS+ORS III group and the EHS group as well as the EHS+water group. Serum I-FABP level in the EHS group was significantly higher than that in the normal control group [μg/L: 36.90 (29.10, 45.00) vs. 11.39 (0.31, 20.80), P < 0.01]. Serum I-FABP level in the EHS+water and EHS+ORS III groups were notably lower than that in the EHS group [μg/L: 24.19 (20.00, 28.36), 0.31 (0.31, 5.58) vs. 36.90 (29.10, 45.00), both P < 0.01], additionally, I-FABP level was much lower in the EHS+ORS III group (P < 0.01).EHS could lead to liver, intestinal  dysfunction and electrolyte disturbance. Pre-treatment of ORS III could alleviate the intestinal dysfunction and electrolyte disorder caused by EHS in rats. It can lower the serum potassium to some extent. However, ORS III failed to protect liver from EHS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545258>Propolis modulates the gut microbiota and improves the intestinal mucosal   in diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is associated with gut microbiota disturbance and intestinal mucosal injuries. This study investigated the influence of propolis on the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa in rats with diabetes.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to the control group, model group, and three propolis groups (supplemented with 80, 160, and 240 mg/kg·bw propolis, respectively). A high-fat diet combined with a streptozotocin (STZ) abdominal injection were used to induce diabetes in the rats. After 4 weeks, the intestinal histopathological analysis of the ileum was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), plasma insulin, glucose tolerance (OGTT) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the ileum was measured using western blotting. The molecular ecology of the fecal gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The contents of the short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in feces were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).After propolis treatment, compared to the model group, FBG and HbA1c levels declined, while the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) increased. The levels of TJ proteins in the ileum increased in the propolis groups. The tight junctions and gap junctions of the intestinal epithelium were also improved in the propolis groups. The contents of the feces acetic , propionic  and butyrate were increased in the propolis groups. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota of rats in the propolis supplement group was significantly improved.Compared to the model group, propolis exerted hypoglycemic effects in diabetic rats, and it repaired intestinal mucosal damage, benefited the communities of the gut microbiota and increased SCFA levels in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The contribution of media supplementation with n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) to the development of the skin   of in vitro skin models remains incompletely understood. To investigate whether PUFAs, alpha-linolenic  (ALA, n-3 PUFA) and linoleic  (LA, n-6 PUFA), could enhance the impermeability of a three-dimensional reconstructed human skin model, skin substitutes were produced according to the self-assembly method using culture media supplemented with either 10 μM ALA or 10 μM LA. The impact of PUFAs on skin permeability was studied by using a Franz cell diffusion system to assess the percutaneous absorption of testosterone and benzoic . Our findings showed that ALA supplementation induced a decrease in the absorption of testosterone, while LA supplementation did not significantly influence the penetration of testosterone and benzoic  under present experimental conditions. Both ALA and LA were incorporated into phospholipids of the skin substitutes, resulting in an increase in n-3 total PUFAs or n-6 total PUFAs. Collectively, these results revealed the under-estimated impact of n-3 PUFA supplementation as well as the importance of the n-6 to n-3 ratio on the formation of the skin  of in vitro reconstructed human skin models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328774>Performance, intestinal permeability, and gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in broiler chickens fed reduced protein diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, and glycine subjected to a leaky gut model.</a></h1><p>Changing dietary protein and amino  may impact intestinal  . Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed 5 dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg Gly; 5) RP diet supplemented with 5 g/kg L-Arg. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce leaky gut. Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected tight junction proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP. Gly had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of Arg improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2, Arg tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher Arg (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the Arg diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and Gly had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary Arg by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal   of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, whether methionine (Met) or a methionine hydroxyl analogue (2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic  (HMB)) can alleviate deoxynivalenol (DON)-induced intestinal injury remains unknown. Mice were treated orally with Met or HMB on days 1-11 and with DON on days 4-8. On day 12, the mice were sacrificed, and the jejunum was collected for crypt isolation and culture. Mouse enteroids were treated with DON and Met or HMB ex vivo. The results showed that Met and HMB increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the mice. Met and HMB also improved the jejunal structure and  integrity and promoted ISC expansion, as indicated by the increased enteroid formation efficiency and area, under DON-induced injury conditions. In addition, DON-induced decreases in ISC activity were rescued Wnt/β-catenin signaling reactivation by Met or HMB in vivo and ex vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal that Met and HMB alleviated DON-induced intestinal injury by improving ISC expansion and reactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

The farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  (OCA) ameliorates the histological features of NASH; satisfactory antifibrotic effects have not yet been reported. Here, we investigated the combined effects of OCA + a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fifty Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino--defined (CDAA) diet for 12 weeks. The in vitro and in vivo effects of OCA + sitagliptin were assessed along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade and intestinal  . Direct inhibitory effects of OCA + sitagliptin on activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSCs) were assessed in vitro.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin potentially inhibited hepatic fibrogenesis along with Ac-HSC proliferation and hepatic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, α1(I)-procollagen, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) mRNA expression and hydroxyproline levels. Obeticholic  inhibited hepatic TLR4 expression and increased hepatic matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. Obeticholic  decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating CDAA diet-induced zonula occludens-1 disruption, whereas sitagliptin directly inhibited Ac-HSC proliferation. The in vitro suppressive effects of OCA + sitagliptin on TGF-β1 and α1(I)-procollagen mRNA expression and p38 phosphorylation in Ac-HSCs were almost consistent. Sitagliptin directly inhibited the regulation of Ac-HSC.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin synergistically affected hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting endotoxemia induced by intestinal  dysfunction and suppressing Ac-HSC proliferation. Thus, OCA + sitagliptin could be a promising therapeutic strategy for NASH.© 2019 The Japan Society of Hepatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321778>Synergistic effects of ascorbic  and plant-derived ceramide to enhance storability and boost antioxidant systems of postharvest strawberries.</a></h1><p>Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) may attack biological macromolecules and induce oxidative stress.

However, there are few reports about the effects of ceramide-AsA interactions to enhance storability and boost antioxidant systems in fruits during storage. This study was conducted to study the synergistic effects of AsA in combination with ceramide on the quality of postharvest strawberry (Fragaria anannasa cv.

Also, treatment with 100 mg L AsA plus 1.2 mmol L ceramide significantly increased the activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) but inhibited the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO).It is suggested that treatment with 100 mg L AsA plus 1.2 mmol L ceramide could significantly reduce the oxidative damage and maintain the storage quality of strawberries during storage by enhancing the antioxidant systems. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361361>A Near-Infrared-Controllable Artificial Metalloprotease Used for Degrading Amyloid-β Monomers and Aggregates.</a></h1><p>Proteolysis of amyloid-β (Aβ) is a promising approach against Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not feasible to employ natural hydrolases directly because of their cumbersome preparation and purification, poor stability, and hazardous immunogenicity. Therefore, artificial enzymes have been developed as potential alternatives to natural hydrolases. Since specific cleavage sites of Aβ are usually embedded inside the β-sheet structures that restrict access by artificial enzymes, this strongly hinders their efficiency for practical applications. Herein, we construct a NIR (near-IR) controllable artificial metalloprotease (MoS -Co) using a molybdenum disulfide nanosheet (MoS ) and a cobalt complex of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic  (Codota). Evidenced by detailed experimental and theoretical studies, the NIR-enhanced MoS -Co can circumvent the restriction by simultaneously inhibition of β-sheet formation and destroying β-sheet structures of the preformed Aβ aggregates in living cell. Furthermore, our designed MoS -Co is an easy to graft Aβ-target agent that prevents misdirected or undesirable hydrolysis reactions, and has been demonstrated to cross the blood brain . This method can be adapted for hydrolysis of other kinds of amyloids.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, it is unclear if such routines lead to increased uptake of applied substances such as drugs or formulation compounds, potentially resulting in skin irritation or sensitization. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of common depilation and epilation methods on skin penetration of two surfactants and four model drugs of different physicochemical properties using the porcine ear model. It should be elucidated whether the substances' skin penetration behavior would be affected by hair removal procedures and if potential effects would be related to their polarity. Confocal Raman spectroscopy revealed no effect of hair removal on total penetration depths of SDS and sulfathiazole. Significantly higher relative penetrated amounts within 0-6 µm of stratum corneum depth were found for SDS after dry shaving, depilatory cream and waxing and for sulfathiazole after all depilation methods and partly after epilation. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed no effect of hair removal on the penetration depth of lecithin LPC80, but higher relative amounts at the skin surface after wet shaving and electric epilation. Diffusion cell experiments using a lecithin-based microemulsion as carrier system for fluconazole, fludrocortisone acetate and flufenamic  showed higher cumulative amounts, higher drug fluxes and shorter lag times for the more lipophilic drugs for some of the methods, but only shorter lag times in some cases for fluconazole. In summary, the observed effects appeared to depend on drug polarity and experimental setup.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, early studies employing DHA dietary restriction documented reduced light sensitivity by DHA-deprived retinas. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a major route of DHA entry in the retina is the delivery across the blood-retina  by the sodium-dependent lipid transporter, Mfsd2a. This discovery opened a unique opportunity to analyze photoreceptor health and  in DHA-deprived retinas using the  knockout mouse as animal model. Our lipidome analyses of  retinas and outer segment membranes corroborated the previously reported decrease in the fraction of DHA-containing phospholipids and a compensatory increase in phospholipids containing arachidonic . We also revealed an increase in the retinal content of monounsaturated fatty  and a reduction in very long chain fatty . These changes could be explained by a combination of reduced DHA supply to the retina and a concomitant upregulation of several fatty  desaturases controlled by sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factors, which are upregulated in  retinas.  retinas undergo slow progressive degeneration, with ∼30% of photoreceptor cells lost by the age of 6 months. Despite this pathology, the ultrastructure  photoreceptors and their ability to produce light responses were essentially normal. These data demonstrate that, whereas maintaining the LPC route of DHA supply to the retina is essential for long-term photoreceptor survival, it is not important for supporting normal phototransduction.Phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are greatly enriched in the nervous system, with the highest concentration found in the light-sensitive membranes of photoreceptor cells. In this study, we analyzed the consequences of impaired DHA transport across the blood-retina . We have found that, in addition to a predictable reduction in the DHA level, the affected retinas undergo a complex, transcriptionally-driven rebuilding of their membrane lipidome in a pattern preserving the overall saturation/desaturation balance of retinal phospholipids. Remarkably, these changes do not affect the ability of photoreceptors to produce responses to light but are detrimental for the long-term survival of these cells.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319027>Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) Protects against the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Impairment of the Intestinal Epithelial   via the FXR-MLCK Pathway.</a></h1><p>Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a primary bile , has been demonstrated to play important roles as a signaling molecule in various  functions. However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal   remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial   and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in tight junction protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor 5 was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial   impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of tight junction protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal  impairment.

Weaning stress impairs piglet intestinal epithelium structural and functional integrities, which results in reduced feed intake, growth rates and increased morbidity and mortality. Several measures are needed to maintain swine gut development and growth performance after weaning stress. A large body of evidence indicates that, in weaning piglets, glutamine, a functional amino , may improve growth performance and intestinal morphology, reduce oxidative damage, stimulate enterocyte proliferation, modulate cell survival and death and enhance intestinal paracellular permeability.

Nanotechnology-based drug delivery for targeting renal tubules offers a new strategy for AKI treatment but remains challenging due to the glomerular filtration . To tackle this challenge, here we demonstrate that poly (lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) of 100 nm diameter could selectively accumulate in mouse injury kidneys in correlation to the degree of kidney injury and administration time during the initial phase of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The NPs were located in renal tubular epithelial cells confirmed by immunofluorescence, which is critical for the progression of AKI. Taking advantage of the high accumulation and renal tubule targeting of the PLGA NPs in the ischemia-reperfusion (IR) kidney, we designed PLGA NPs loaded with Oltipraz (PLGA-Oltipraz NPs) to treat IR-induced AKI and renal fibrosis. In vitro results showed that compared to free Oltipraz, PLGA-Oltipraz NPs displayed a higher antioxidation effect with improved cell viability, lower contents of malondialdehyde, and higher activity of superoxide dismutase. The therapeutic efficacy of PLGA-Oltipraz NPs was further investigated in vivo. Mice with AKI treated with PLGA-Oltipraz NPs exhibited significantly reduced tubular necrosis, less collagen deposition, and better renal  at the initial phase as well as improved renal fibrosis at the recovery phase.

Twenty-four weaned pigs were allotted to two groups and fed with a basal diet or a basal diet containing 1000 mg/kg CGA. Results showed that CGA significantly increased the length of the small intestine (P < 0.05) and enhanced the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO) and the concentration of MHC-II in the jejunal and ileal mucosa (P < 0.05). Moreover, the acetate concentration in ileum and cecum digesta, and the propionate and butyrate concentrations in the cecum digesta, were significantly elevated by CGA (P < 0.05). Interestingly, CGA significantly increased the total 16S rRNA gene copies and bacterial alpha diversity in the cecum (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of bacteria from phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was increased in the cecum digesta (P < 0.05), whereas the abundance of bacteria from phylum Protebacteria was decreased by CGA (P < 0.05).

Because of its wide use, OBS is detectable in the environment. However, knowledge about the biological toxicity of OBS to animals is very limited. Here, male mice were exposed to 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 μg/L of OBS for 6 weeks via drinking water. It was demonstrated that OBS was highly bioaccumulated both in the liver and gut in the mice after low doses of OBS exposure. Curiously, a low dose of OBS exposure also caused gut  dysfunction by decreasing mucus secretion and altering Ionic transport in the gut via the CFTR pathway. In addition, liver  was influenced by OBS at both the histopathological and physiological levels. Hepatic transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis showed a total of 1157 genes, and multiple metabolites changed significantly in the livers of mice exposed to low-dose OBS for 6 weeks. The functions of these changed genes and metabolites are tightly related to glycolysis, fatty  synthesis, fatty  transport, and β-oxidation. All these results indicate that the liver and gut are important target tissues for OBS exposure. Importantly, it is possible that high levels of bioaccumulation of OBS in the gut and liver might directly cause gut  dysfunction and hepatic metabolism disorder in mice.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

First, amino  residues of the binding sites of degrading enzymes for the target fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR) and ofloxacin (OFL) were analysed by the molecular docking method. The hydrophobic amino  residues within 5 Å of the target fluoroquinolone molecules were selected as the modification sites. The hydrophobic amino  residues at the modified sites were replaced by the hydrophilic amino  residues, and 150 amino  sequence modification schemes of the degrading enzymes were designed. Subsequently, a reconstruction scheme of the degrading enzyme amino  sequence reconstruction scheme was submitted to the SWISS-MODEL server and a selected homology modelling method was used to build a new structure of the degrading enzyme. At the same time, the binding affinities between the novel degrading enzymes and the target fluoroquinolones (represented by the docking scoring ) were evaluated by the molecular docking method. It was found that the novel enzymes can simultaneously improve the binding affinities for the three target fluoroquinolones, and the degradation ability of the six modification schemes was increased by more than 50% at the same time. Among the novel enzymes, the affinity effect of the novel anaerobic enzyme (6-1) with CIP, NOR and OFL was significantly increased, with increases of 129.24%, 165.06% and 169.59%, respectively, followed by the facultative enzyme and aerobic enzyme. In addition, the designed degrading enzymes had certain selectivity for the degradation of the target quinolone. Among the novel enzymes, the binding affinities of the novel anaerobic enzyme (6-3) and CIP, the novel aerobic enzyme (3-6) and NOR, and the novel facultative enzyme (13-6) and OFL were increased by 149.71%, 178.57% and 297.12% respectively. Calculations using the Gaussian09 software revealed that the degradation reaction  of the novel degrading enzyme (7-1) and CIP NOR and OFL decreased by 37.65 kcal·mol, 6.28 kcal·mol and 6.28 kcal·mol, respectively, which would result in efficient degradation of the target fluoroquinolone molecules. By analysing the binding affinity of the degrading enzymes before and after the modification with methanol, it was further speculated that the degradation effect of the modified aerobic degrading enzymes on organic matter was lower than that before the modification, and the increase or decrease in the degradation effect was less than 10%. The mechanism analysis found that the interaction between the modified amino  residues of the degrading enzymes and the fluoroquinolone molecules increased. The average distance between the amino  residues and the fluoroquinolone molecules represented a comprehensive affinity effect, and its value was positively correlated with the degradation effect of the novel degrading enzymes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260531>Gcn5-mediated acetylation at MBF-regulated promoters induces the G1/S transcriptional wave.</a></h1><p>In fission yeast, MBF-dependent transcription is inactivated at the end of S phase through a negative feedback loop that involves the co-repressors, Yox1 and Nrm1. Although this repression system is well known, the molecular mechanisms involved in MBF activation remain largely unknown. Compacted chromatin constitutes a  to activators accessing promoters. Here, we show that chromatin regulation plays a key role in activating MBF-dependent transcription. Gcn5, a part of the SAGA complex, binds to MBF-regulated promoters through the MBF co-activator Rep2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in a reverse correlation to the binding of the MBF co-repressors, Nrm1 or Yox1. We propose that the co-repressors  as physical barriers to SAGA recruitment onto MBF promoters. We also show that Gcn5 acetylates specific lysine residues on histone H3 in a cell cycle-regulated manner. Furthermore, either in a gcn5 mutant or in a strain in which histone H3 is kept in an unacetylated form, MBF-dependent transcription is downregulated. In summary, Gcn5 is required for the full activation and correct timing of MBF-regulated gene transcription.© The Author(s) 2019.

An estimated 10-16% of breast cancer patients are suffering from brain metastasis, and the diagnostic cases of breast cancer brain metastasis are increasing. Nevertheless, the mechanisms behind this process are still unclear. Aberrant glycosylation has been proved to be related to many diseases and cancer metastasis. However, studies of N-glycan isomer  in breast cancer brain metastasis are limited. In this study, the expressions of N-glycan isomers derived from five breast cancer cell lines and one brain cancer cell line were investigated and compared to a brain-seeking cell line, 231BR, to acquire a better understanding of the role glycan isomers play in breast cancer brain metastasis. The high temperature nanoPGC-LC-MS/MS achieved an efficient isomeric separation and permitted the identification and quantitation of 144 isomers from 50 N-glycan compositions. There were significant expression alterations of these glycan isomers among the different breast cancer cell lines. The increase of total glycan abundance and sialylation level were observed to be associated with breast cancer invasion. With regard to individual isomers, the greatest number of sialylated isomers was observed along with significant expression alterations in 231BR, suggesting a relationship between glycan sialylation and breast cancer brain metastasis. Furthermore, the increase of the α2,6-sialylation level in 231BR likely contributes to the passage of breast cancer cells through the blood-brain , thus facilitating breast cancer brain metastasis. Meanwhile, the upregulation of highly sialylated glycan isomers with α2,6-linked sialic  were found to be associated with breast cancer metastasis. This investigation of glycan isomer expressions, especially the unique isomeric expression in brain-seeking cell line 231BR, provides new information toward understanding the potential roles glycan isomers play during breast cancer metastasis and more clues for a deeper insight of this bioprocess.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649553>Induction of Secretagogue Independent Gastric  Secretion  a Novel Aspirin-Activated Pathway.</a></h1><p>Aspirin has been widely recommended for acute and chronic conditions for over 2,000 years. Either single or repetitive doses are commonly used for analgesic and antipyretic reasons and to prevent heart attacks, stroke, and blood clot formation. Recent studies show that it can also be used chronically to dramatically reduce the risk of a variety of cancers. However, prolonged usage of aspirin can cause severe damage to the mucosal , increasing the risk of ulcer formation and GI-bleeding events. In the present study, we show the effects of acute low-dose aspirin exposure as an active secretagogue-inducing gastric  secretion. Studies were carried out with isolated gastric glands using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF-AM to assess  secretion. The non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME (30 μM), or the specific inhibitor ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) was applied while monitoring intracellular pH. The effects of basolateral exposure to aspirin (acetylsalicylic , ASA) caused activation of gastric  secretion  the H, K-ATPase. Our data suggest that aspirin increases nitric oxide (NO) production, which in turn activates  secretion. Exposure of gastric glands to either the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME, and the highly selective, soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) effectively inhibited aspirin-dependent gastric  secretion. Aspirin can be considered as a novel secretagogue, in the way that it activates the H, K-ATPase. With increased daily aspirin consumption, our findings have important implications for all individuals consuming aspirin even in low doses and the potential risks for increased  secretion.Copyright © 2019 Kitay, Ferstl, Link and Geibel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289543>Effects of preoperative oral administration of glucose solution combined with postoperative probiotics on inflammation and intestinal   in patients after colorectal cancer surgery.</a></h1><p>The effects of preoperative oral administration of glucose solution combined with postoperative probiotics on inflammation and intestinal   in patients after colorectal cancer surgery were observed. Sixty patients treated and scheduled to undergo radical resection of colorectal cancer in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from March 2017 to December 2017 were selected and randomly divided into the glucose solution group (n=30) and combined probiotics group (n=30). Patients in both groups took orally 12.5% glucose solution before surgery, and those in the combined probiotics group received bifidus-triple viable preparation every day for 7 consecutive days. Changes in endotoxin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentration, white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-lactic  and urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) were detected before surgery and at 1, 3 and 7 days after surgery. The general condition was observed and changes in intestinal florae were compared between the two groups. The body temperature was measured every 4 h with an electronic thermometer, and the duration of fever was recorded (from the first day after operation to the time with normal body temperature after operation, axillary temperature <37.4°C), and the average heart rate was recorded by the ECG monitor. In addition, the time of the first anal exsufflation (the time from the beginning of the operation to the first anal exsufflation) was recorded. In the combined probiotics group, the plasma endotoxin, IGF-I concentration, D-lactic  and urinary L/M levels were significantly lower than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Moreover, the duration of postoperative fever, average heart rate at 7 days after surgery as well as WBC and CRP clinical indexes were obviously shorter and lower in the combined probiotics group than those in the glucose solution group (P<0.05). Therefore, the combined application of probiotics after surgery can effectively improve the imbalance of intestinal flora. In conclusion, preoperative oral administration of glucose solution combined with postoperative probiotics can improve the intestinal   after colorectal cancer surgery, and benefit the recovery of early inflammatory response after surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31372901>Anti-inflammatory and Anti-osteoporotic Potential of Lactobacillus plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 as Probiotics.</a></h1><p>This study involves an investigation on the probiotic properties of lactic  bacteria and their potential applications in an in vitro model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation and dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis. Nine strains were pre-screened from 485 lactic  bacteria based on their survival at a low pH and in a solution containing bile salts. All candidates were capable of surviving in an environment with low pH and with bile salts and could successfully colonize the intestine. Furthermore, their functional properties, such as anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation, were evaluated. Of the nine probiotic candidates, Lactobacillus plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 exhibited the highest anti-oxidative capacity. Moreover, only L. plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 could increase gut   by upregulating the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins and inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators induced by LPS-stimulated inflammation. Interestingly, these two strains were also capable of regulating several bone metabolism-related markers playing a role in bone homeostasis and osteoblast differentiation. In brief, L. plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 exhibited high probiotic potential and potentially impact immune-related bone health by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and bone metabolism-related markers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213870>Skin protective effects of an antipollution, antioxidant serum containing  extract, ferulic  and vitamin C: a controlled single-blind, prospective trial in women living in urbanized, high air pollution area.</a></h1><p> Air pollution causes skin damage and favors skin aging processes such as dark spots and wrinkles, through oxidative stress. Pollutant substances accelerate skin aging through a specific activation of intracellular receptors called AhR (aryl-hydrocarbon receptors).  aqueous extract (DAE) has shown to counteract the pollutant-induced AhR activation. Ferulic  (FA) and vitamin C (VC) are potent antioxidant substances. A serum containing DAE/FA/VC has been recently developed. So far, no clinical data are available regarding the protective actions of this serum against the detrimental effects of air pollution on the skin.  We conducted a prospective, single-blind, 28-day study to assess efficacy and protective effects against air pollution skin damage of a new serum containing  extract.  Twenty, photo type I-III, women (mean age 42 years) with at least three dark spots on the face, living in a homogenous urbanized, high pollution area (Rome) were evaluated. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the effects of treatment on skin  , assessed by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement (Tewameter), the effect on dark spots, evaluated by means of colorimetry (Colorimeter CL 400), and the effect on squalene peroxide (SQOOH)/squalene (SQ) skin ratio assessed with face swabs.  The trial was conducted between November 20 and December 19, 2018. In comparison with baseline, the product induced a significant improvement of skin hydration (-19% of TEWL), a significant improvement of dark spots (+7%) and a significant improvement of SQOOH/SQ ratio (-16%). The product was evaluated very well by >90% of the treated subjects regarding cosmetic acceptability.

Here, we investigate the intersection between light-sensing (Period 2 [PER2]) and oxygen-sensing (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF1A]) pathways in cellular adaptation to myocardial ischemia. We demonstrate that intense light is cardioprotective via circadian PER2 amplitude enhancement, mimicking hypoxia-elicited adenosine- and HIF1A-metabolic adaptation to myocardial ischemia under normoxic conditions. Whole-genome array from intense light-exposed wild-type or Per2 mice and myocardial ischemia in endothelial-specific PER2-deficient mice uncover a critical role for intense light in maintaining endothelial   via light-enhanced HIF1A transcription. A proteomics screen in human endothelia reveals a dominant role for PER2 in metabolic reprogramming to hypoxia via mitochondrial translocation, tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle enzyme activity regulation, and HIF1A transcriptional adaption to hypoxia. Translational investigation of intense light in human subjects identifies similar PER2 mechanisms, implicating the use of intense light for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We designed hybrid terpene-amino  enhancers by conjugating natural terpenes (citronellol, geraniol, nerol, farnesol, linalool, perillyl alcohol, menthol, borneol, carveol) or cinnamyl alcohol with 6-(dimethylamino)hexanoic  through a biodegradable ester linker. The compounds were screened for their ability to increase the delivery of theophylline and hydrocortisone through and into human skin ex vivo. The citronellyl, bornyl and cinnamyl esters showed exceptional permeation-enhancing properties (enhancement ratios up to 82) while having low cellular toxicities. The   of enhancer-treated skin (assessed by transepidermal water loss and electrical impedance) recovered within 24 h. Infrared spectroscopy suggested that these esters fluidized the stratum corneum lipids. Furthermore, the citronellyl ester increased the epidermal concentration of topically applied cidofovir, which is a potent antiviral and anticancer drug, by 15-fold. In conclusion, citronellyl 6-(dimethylamino)hexanoate is an outstanding enhancer with an advantageous combination of properties, which may improve the delivery of drugs that have a limited ability to cross biological barriers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510101>Microbiota, Microbial Metabolites, and   in A Patient with Anorexia Nervosa after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.</a></h1><p>The change in the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites in a patient suffering from severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (AN) and diagnosed with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBO) was investigated. Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut  , microbiota composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut  , which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement. The need for an in-depth analysis of the donor´s stool and correct selection pre-FMT is evident.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453986>Protective effects of plasma products on the endothelial-glycocalyx  following trauma-hemorrhagic shock: Is sphingosine-1 phosphate responsible?</a></h1><p>Plasma is an important component of resuscitation after trauma and hemorrhagic shock (T/HS). The specific plasma proteins and the impact of storage conditions are uncertain. Utilizing a microfluidic device system, we studied the effect of various types of plasma on the endothelial   following T/HS.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in microfluidic plates. The microfluidic plates were subjected to control or shock conditions (hypoxia/reoxygenation + epinephrine, 10 μM). Fresh plasma, 1 day thawed plasma, 5-day thawed plasma and lyophilized plasma were then added. Supplementation of sphingosine-1 phosphate (S-1P) was done in a subset of experiments. Effect on the endothelial glycocalyx was indexed by shedding of syndecan-1 and hyaluronic . Endothelial injury/activation was indexed by soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Vascular permeability determined by the ratio of angiopoietin-2 to angiopoietin-1. Concentration of S-1P and adiponectin in the different plasma groups was measured.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to shock conditions increased shedding of syndecan-1 and hyaluronic . Administration of the various types of plasma decreased shedding, except for 5-day thawed plasma. Shocked HUVEC cells demonstrated a profibrinolytic phenotype, this normalized with all plasma types except for 5-day thawed plasma. The concentration of S-1P was significantly less in the 5-day thawed plasma compared with the other plasma types. Addition of S-1P to 5-day thawed plasma returned the benefits lost with storage.A biomimetic model of the microcirculation following T/HS demonstrated endothelial glycocalyx and endothelial cellular injury/activation as well as a profibrinolytic phenotype. These effects were abrogated by all plasma products except the 5-day thawed plasma. Plasma thawed longer than 5 days had diminished S1-P concentrations. Our data suggest that S1-P protein is critical to the protective effect of plasma products on the endothelial-glycocalyx  following T/HS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624591>Low-protein diets supplemented with casein hydrolysate favor the microbiota and enhance the mucosal humoral immunity in the colon of pigs.</a></h1><p>High-protein diets can increase the colonic health risks. A moderate reduction of dietary crude-protein (CP) level can improve the colonic bacterial community and mucosal immunity of pigs. However, greatly reducing the dietary CP level, even supplemented with all amino  (AAs), detrimentally affects the colonic health, which may be due to the lack of protein-derived peptides. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of supplementation of casein hydrolysate (peptide source) in low-protein (LP) diets, in comparison with AAs supplementation, on the colonic microbiota, microbial metabolites and mucosal immunity in pigs, aiming to determine whether a supplementation of casein hydrolysate can improve colonic health under very LP level. Twenty-one pigs (initial BW 19.90 ± 1.00 kg, 63 ± 1 days of age) were assigned to three groups and fed with control diet (16% CP), LP diets (13% CP) supplemented with free AAs (LPA) or casein hydrolysate (LPC) for 4 weeks.Compared with control diet, LPA and LPC diet decreased the relative abundance of  and , and LPC diet further decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria. LPC diet also increased the relative abundance of . Both LP diets decreased concentrations of ammonia and cadaverine, and LPC diet also reduced concentrations of putrescine, phenol and indole. Moreover, LPC diet increased total short-chain fatty  concentration. In comparison with control diet, both LP diets decreased protein expressions of Toll-like receptor-4, nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and LPC diet further decreased protein expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-1 and interferon-γ. LPC diet also increased protein expressions of G-protein coupled receptor-43, interleukin-4, transforming growth factor-β, immunoglobulin A and mucin-4, which are indicators for mucosal defense activity.The results showed that supplementing casein hydrolysate showed beneficial effects on the colonic microbiota and mucosal immunity and   in comparison with supplementing free AAs in LP diets.

Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) are one of the most important biomarkers of intestinal metabolites. SCFAs may affect the occurrence and development of FA. Currently, no studies have been reported on the mechanism of FA in response to SCFAs. In this study, the common food allergen ovalbumin (OVA) was used for intestinal sensitization in Balb/c mice to study the effect of FA on intestinal   and regulatory T cells in mice, thus providing a new target for the prevention and treatment of FA.Twenty BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the experimental group and control group. The experimental group was given OVA, and the control group was given an equal amount of physiological saline. On the 31st day of modeling, the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and serum total IgE and diamine oxidase (DAO) were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). At the same time, after in vitro stimulation with different concentrations of SCFAs and histone acetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), the frequency and  of Treg in OVA-sensitized mice were detected by flow cytometry.Different concentrations of SCFAs and TSA selectively proliferate Treg cells in a dose-dependent manner. SCFAs and TSA-pretreated PBMCs that were injected intravenously into the OVA-sensitized mice through the tail vein can significantly reduce the expression of IgE, DAO, and sIgA.SCFAs and TSA can selectively proliferate Tregs and upregulate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby suppressing allergic reactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229530>Optimisation of glutathione conjugation to liposomes quantified with a validated HPLC assay.</a></h1><p>Glutathione (GSH) grafted onto nanoliposomes (GSH-liposomes) have the potential to enhance drug delivery into the brain. GSH is known to be an unstable tripeptide, however, despite widespread use to promote active transport its stability has been largely ignored to date. Therefore this study focuses on the optimisation of GSH conjugation with liposomes, supported with a validated HPLC assay for GSH. An isocratic stability-indicating HPLC assay of GSH was developed after derivatisation of GSH with 5,5'-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic  and applied for efficient conjugation of GSH to DSPE-PEG2000-maleimide lipid, either in solution or in preformed liposomes (4% molar ratio) at pH 7.4. The conjugation rate was monitored by the HPLC assay to optimise the conjugation conditions, including GSH concentration, GSH:lipid ratio, reaction time, temperature and medium. The physiochemical properties of the resulting GSH-liposomes and their GSH densities were characterised. The HPLC method was linear in the range of 0.05-50 µg/ml, highly sensitive (limit of quantification 50 ng/ml), and accurate (98-102% recoveries) with less than 4% intra-day and inter-day variability. Interestingly, enhanced GSH stability was observed at higher GSH concentrations ≥2 mg/ml and mass spectroscopy confirmed that GSH degradation occurred predominantly by oxidation. Both the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectra and HPLC analysis of GSH concentrations confirmed the formation of GSH-PEG-DSPE conjugate. Under the optimal conditions, complete conjugation was attained either by post-insertion or direct conjugation methods with the resulting GSH-liposomes attaining a GSH density of 4% with similar size (120 nm) and zeta potential (-26.7 ± 0.9 mV or -29.8 ± 1.5 mV). The study provides useful information on GSH stability for the optimisation of its conjugation in liposomal formulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), autoimmune responses against neural self-antigens find expression in neurological and cognitive alterations. SLE autoantibodies often target nucleic , including RNAs and specifically RNA domains with higher-order structural content. We report that autoantibodies directed against neuronal regulatory brain cytoplasmic (BC) RNAs were generated in a subset of SLE patients. By contrast, anti-BC RNA autoantibodies (anti-BC abs) were not detected in sera from patients with autoimmune diseases other than SLE (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis) or in sera from healthy subjects with no evidence of disease. SLE anti-BC abs belong to the IgG class of immunoglobulins and target both primate BC200 RNA and rodent BC1 RNA. They are specifically directed at architectural motifs in BC RNA 5' stem-loop domains that serve as dendritic targeting elements (DTEs). SLE anti-BC abs effectively compete with RNA transport factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2) for DTE access and significantly diminish BC RNA delivery to synapto-dendritic sites of .  experiments with male BALB/c mice indicate that, upon lipopolysaccharide-induced opening of the blood-brain , SLE anti-BC abs are taken up by CNS neurons where they significantly impede localization of endogenous BC1 RNA to synapto-dendritic domains. Lack of BC1 RNA causes phenotypic abnormalities including epileptogenic responses and cognitive dysfunction. The combined data indicate a role for anti-BC RNA autoimmunity in SLE and its neuropsychiatric manifestations. Although clinical manifestations of neuropsychiatric lupus are well recognized, the underlying molecular-cellular alterations have been difficult to determine. We report that sera of a subset of lupus patients contain autoantibodies directed at regulatory brain cytoplasmic (BC) RNAs. These antibodies, which we call anti-BC abs, target the BC RNA 5' domain noncanonical motif structures that specify dendritic delivery. Lupus anti-BC abs effectively compete with RNA transport factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2) for access to BC RNAs. As a result, hnRNP A2 is displaced, and BC RNAs are impaired in their ability to reach synapto-dendritic sites of . The results reveal an unexpected link between BC RNA autoantibody recognition and dendritic RNA targeting. Cellular RNA dysregulation may thus be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric lupus.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385779>Evaluation of LAMP-based assays for carbapenemase genes.</a></h1><p>. Rapid and accurate detection of carbapenem resistance is a critical requirement for the selection of appropriate therapy and initiation of infection control measures.

Phenotypic tests are lengthy, have variable sensitivity and specificity and do not generally identify the carbapenemase. Molecular assays overcome many of these issues but cost can be a  to adoption, particularly in low-resource settings.

Recent studies have reported altered fecal microbiota composition together with increased IP and inflammation in individuals consuming military food rations in austere environments, but could not isolate effects of the diet from environmental factors. To determine how the U.S. Meal, Ready-to-Eat food ration affects fecal microbiota composition, IP and inflammation, 60 adults (95% male,18-61 years) were randomized to consume their usual ad libitum diet for 31 days (CON) or a strictly controlled Meal, Ready-to-Eat-only diet for 21 days followed by their usual diet for 10 days (MRE).

The genera making the strongest contribution to that prediction accuracy included multiple lactic  bacteria (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc), which demonstrated lower relative abundance in MRE, and several genera known to dominate the ileal microbiota (Streptococcus, Veillonella, Clostridium), the latter two demonstrating higher relative abundance in MRE. IP and hsCRP were both lower (34% and 41%, respectively) in MRE relative to CON on day 21 (P<.05) but did not differ otherwise. Findings demonstrate that a Meal, Ready-to-Eat ration diet alters fecal microbiota composition and does not increase IP or inflammation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h1><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving lipid metabolism is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty  in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut   to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We previously demonstrated that H O -induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and excessive NO production contribute to vascular cell injury and increases in microvessel permeability. However, the mechanisms of excessive NO-mediated vascular injury and hyperpermeability remain unknown. This study aims to examine the functional role of NO-derived peroxynitrite (ONOO ) in H O -induced vascular  dysfunction by elucidating the interrelationships between H O -induced NO, superoxide, ONOO , and changes in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel permeability. Experiments were conducted on intact rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca ] , NO, and O  were assessed with fluorescence imaging. Perfusion of vessels with H O (10 µmol/L) induced marked productions of NO and O  , resulting in extensive protein tyrosine nitration, a biomarker of ONOO . The formation of ONOO was abolished by inhibition of NOS with N -Methyl-L-arginine. Blocking NO production or scavenging ONOO by uric  prevented H O -induced increases in endothelial [Ca ] and Lp. Additionally, the application of exogenous ONOO to microvessels induced delayed and progressive increases in endothelial [Ca ] and microvessel Lp, a pattern similar to that observed in H O -perfused vessels. Importantly, ONOO caused further activation of eNOS with amplified NO production. We conclude that the augmentation of NO-derived ONOO is essential for H O -induced endothelial Ca overload and progressively increased microvessel permeability, which is achieved by self-promoted amplifications of NO-dependent signaling cascades. This novel mechanism provides new insight into the reactive oxygen and/or reactive nitrogen species-mediated vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Rat diets were supplemented with α-lactalbumin replacing 50% of dietary protein. After consuming α-lactalbumin for one week, rats were intraperitoneally injected with TAA twice a week for 14 weeks. The α-lactalbumin-enriched diet significantly inhibited the elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and hyaluronic . The supplement significantly reduced plasma lipopolysaccharide levels and increased occludin mRNA level. Hepatic fibrosis and regenerative nodules was developed and intestinal villi were shortened by TAA; α-Lactalbumin attenuated these histopathological changes. These results indicated that α-lactalbumin improved intestinal  , suppressing endotoxin levels. These data also suggested that α-lactalbumin ameliorated the impairment of the gut-liver axis by TAA, inhibiting the development of liver cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287580>A randomized controlled trial of an emollient with ceramide and filaggrin-associated amino  for the primary prevention of atopic dermatitis in high-risk infants.</a></h1><p>Skin  dysfunction may precede infantile development of clinical atopic dermatitis (AD). Early-life emollient therapy to enhance   may prevent or modify AD development in high-risk infants.(a) To determine whether daily full-body application of an emollient with ceramide and amino  (study emollient) can reduce the cumulative AD incidence compared to standard skin care at 1 year of age. (b) To evaluate the study emollient's effect on skin  , natural moisturizing factor and the microbiome using non-invasive biophysical and biochemical techniques.We performed a single-centre, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial enrolling infants at high risk for AD development determined by family history. The intervention was full-body once-daily application of the study emollient. The control arm was asked to not apply full-body emollient regularly and only use an emollient of their choice for dry skin. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of AD diagnosed at 12 months by a blinded investigator.Less than half the target sample size was enrolled (n = 100, goal sample was 208) with 28% lost to follow-up. Across all clinical end points, a numerical trend was observed in favour of the intervention, although not statistically significant likely due to lack of power from under-enrolment. AD was diagnosed in 13.2% vs. 25.0% at 12 months (P = 0.204) and 19.4% vs. 31.0% at 2 years (P = 0.296) in intervention vs. control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups in skin  or microbiome assessments. While there were no serious adverse events, there were more cases of reported contact dermatitis in the intervention vs. control arms, 9.3% vs. 4.3%, respectively; however, these events were not related to the study emollient and most mild in severity.The observed trends suggest a protective effect of daily study emollient therapy compared to control.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628816>Hyperglycemia-induced Ubiquitination and Degradation of β-catenin with the Loss of Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in Retinal Endothelial Cells.</a></h1><p>Increased retinal vascular permeability is one of the earliest manifestations of diabetic retinopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of hyperglycemia-induced platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule -1 (PECAM-1) loss on retinal vascular permeability via the β-catenin pathway.Type I diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats using streptozotocin (STZ) injections, with age-matched non-diabetic rats as controls.

Rapid clearance, mucosal coating, and tight epithelium create strong natural barriers that reduce the effectiveness of many pharmacological interventions in the bladder. Intravesical drug delivery (IDD) is the administration of therapeutic compounds or devices to the urinary bladder via a urethral catheter. Previous work in improving IDD for IC has focused on the sustained delivery of analgesics within the bladder and other small molecule drugs which do not address underlying inflammation and bladder damage. Therapeutic glycosaminoglycans (GAG)  by restoring the mucosal  within the bladder, promoting healing responses, and preventing irritating solutes from reaching the bladder wall. There is an unmet medical need for a therapy that provides both acute relief of symptoms while alleviating underlying physiological sources of inflammation and promoting healing within the urothelium. Semi-synthetic glycosaminoglycan ethers (SAGE) are an emerging class of therapeutic GAG with intrinsic anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. To reduce SAGE clearance and enhance its accumulation in the bladder, we developed a silk-elastinlike protein polymer (SELP) based system to enhance SAGE IDD. We evaluated in vitro release kinetics, rheological properties, impact on bladder , pain response, and bladder inflammation and compared their effectiveness to other temperature-responsive polymers including Poloxamer 407 and poly(lactic-co-glycolic )-poly(ethylene glycol). SAGE delivered via SELP-enhanced intravesical delivery substantially improved SAGE accumulation in the urothelium, provided a sustained analgesic effect 24 h after administration, and reduced inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to screen and evaluate the efficacy of different formulas on relieving of atopic dermatitis clinical symptoms by developing an eczema-like reconstructed human skin equivalent in vitro.Some research has reported that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. We developed an eczema-like in vitro skin equivalent by coculturing the cocktails polyinosinic-polycytidylic  sodium salt (poly(I:C)) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The eczema-like skin equivalent was characterized by overexpression of TSLP and impaired skin  . Three cosmetic formulas with the potential of anti-inflammation and skin  promotion were topically applied onto the eczema-like skin equivalent, mimicking in vivo application. The inhibitory effect on TSLP was examined by ELISA. Effects on tissue viability and skin   were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method.The results show that eczema-like skin equivalent induced by cocktails of poly(I:C) and LPS can mimic the skin characters of the atopic dermatitis. The cocktails can induce high TSLP expression, impaired cell viability, and skin  . The cosmetic formulas with the potential of anti-inflammation and skin  promotion were evaluated to be helpful to decrease and relieve the impact of AD with the decreased TSLP and the higher tissue viability than the eczema-like skin equivalent without any cosmetic application.

Several innovations shifted the trajectory of improvement or resolved significant production limitations. Each is being integrated into practice, with the exception being gene editing technology, which is undergoing the federal approval process. Advances in molecular genomics have been applied to gene editing for control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and to identify piglet genome contributions from each parent. Post-cervical artificial insemination technology is not novel, but this technology is now used extensively to accelerate the rate of genetic progress. A milestone was achieved with the discovery that dietary essential fatty , during lactation, were limiting reproduction. Their provision resulted in a dose-related response for pregnancy, pregnancy maintenance and litter size, especially in maturing sows and ultimately resolved seasonal infertility. The benefit of segregated early weaning (12 to 14 days of age) was realized for specific pathogen removal for genetic nucleus and multiplication. Application was premature for commercial practice, as piglet mortality and morbidity increased. Early weaning impairs intestinal  and mucosal innate immune development, which coincides with diminished resilience to pathogens and viability later in life. Two important milestones were achieved to improve precision nutrition for growing pigs. The first involved the updated publication of the National Research Council nutrient requirements for pigs, a collaboration between scientists from America and Canada. Precision nutrition advanced further when ingredient description, for metabolically available amino  and net energy (by source plant), became a private sector nutrition product. The past decade also led to fortuitous discoveries of health-improving components in ingredients (xylanase, soybeans). Finally, two technologies converged to facilitate timely detection of multiple pathogens in a population: oral fluids sampling and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for pathogen analysis. Most critical diseases in North America are now routinely monitored by oral fluid sampling and prepared for analysis using PCR methods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565748>Intestinal permeability and inflammation mediate the association between nutrient density of complementary foods and biochemical measures of micronutrient status in young children: results from the MAL-ED study.</a></h1><p>Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is thought to increase the risk of micronutrient deficiencies, but few studies adjust for dietary intakes and systemic inflammation.We tested whether EED is associated with micronutrient deficiency risk independent of diet and systemic inflammation, and whether it mediates the relation between intake and micronutrient status.Using data from 1283 children in the MAL-ED (Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health) birth cohort we evaluated the risk of anemia, low retinol, zinc, and ferritin, and high transferrin receptor (TfR) at 15 mo. We characterized gut inflammation and permeability by myeloperoxidase (MPO), neopterin (NEO), and α-1-antitrypsin (AAT) concentrations from asymptomatic fecal samples averaged from 9 to 15 mo, and averaged the lactulose:mannitol ratio z-score (LMZ) at 9 and 15 mo. Nutrient intakes from complementary foods were quantified monthly from 9 to 15 mo and densities were averaged for analyses. α-1- glycoprotein at 15 mo characterized systemic inflammation. Relations between variables were modeled using a Bayesian network.A greater risk of anemia was associated with LMZ [1.15 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.31)] and MPO [1.16 (1.01, 1.34)]. A greater risk of low ferritin was associated with AAT [1.19 (1.03, 1.37)] and NEO [1.22 (1.04, 1.44)]. A greater risk of low retinol was associated with LMZ [1.24 (1.08, 1.45)]. However, MPO was associated with a lower risk of high transferrin receptor [0.86 (0.74, 0.98)], NEO with a lower risk of low retinol [0.75 (0.62, 0.89)], and AAT with a lower risk of low plasma zinc [0.83 (0.70, 0.99)]. Greater nutrient intake densities (vitamins A and B6, calcium, protein, and zinc) were negatively associated with EED. Inverse associations between nutrient densities and micronutrient deficiency largely disappeared after adjustment for EED, suggesting that EED mediates these associations.EED is independently associated with an increased risk of low ferritin, low retinol, and anemia. Greater nutrient density from complementary foods may reduce EED, and the control of micronutrient deficiencies may require control of EED.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540325>Succinate Modulates Intestinal   and Inflammation Response in Pigs.</a></h1><p>Succinate is a metabolic intermediate of the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle in all aerobic organisms, and is also a vital microbial metabolite in the gut. Although succinate is known to regulate intestinal metabolism and immune , its role in the protection of the intestinal epithelial   and inflammation is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of succinate on intestinal epithelial   and inflammation in pigs. Twenty-four growing pigs were distributed into three groups ( = 8) and received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet supplemented with 0.1% succinate or 1% succinate. The diet supplemented with 1% succinate led to alterations in the intestinal morphology. We confirmed in vitro that 5 mM succinate treatment modulated intestinal epithelial permeability by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in intestinal porcine epithelial cell (IPEC)-J2 cells. Furthermore, succinate treatment increased the abundance of tight junction proteins claudin-1, zona occluden (ZO)-1, and ZO-2 in the jejunum in vivo and in vitro. In addition, dietary succinate supplementation promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-25, IL-10, IL-8, and IL-18 in the jejunum. Taken together, these data identify a novel role of succinate in the modulation of intestinal epithelial  , which may be a nutritional target to improve gut health in animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180686>Mechanistic Study on the Use of the l-Type Amino  Transporter 1 for Brain Intracellular Delivery of Ketoprofen via Prodrug: A Novel Approach Supporting the Development of Prodrugs for Intracellular Targets.</a></h1><p>l-Type amino  transporter 1 (LAT1), selectively expressed at the blood-brain  (BBB) and brain parenchymal cells, mediates brain delivery of drugs and prodrugs such as l-dopa and gabapentin. Although knowledge about BBB transport of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs is available, there is a lack of quantitative information about brain intracellular delivery and influence of prodrugs on the transporter's physiological state. We studied the LAT1-mediated intrabrain distribution of a recently developed prodrug of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ketoprofen as well as its impact on transporter protein expression and  (i.e., amino  exchange) using brain slice method in mice and rats. The intrabrain distribution of the prodrug was 16 times higher than that of ketoprofen. LAT1 involvement in brain cellular  uptake of the prodrug was confirmed, reflected by a higher unbound brain intracellular compared to brain extracellular fluid concentration. The prodrug did not alter LAT1 protein expression and amino  exchange. Integration of derived parameters with previously performed in vivo pharmacokinetic study using the Combinatory Mapping Approach allowed to estimate the brain extra- and intracellular levels of unbound ketoprofen, prodrug, and released parent drug. The overall efficiency of plasma to brain intracellular delivery of prodrug-released ketoprofen was 11 times higher than after ketoprofen dosing. In summary, this study provides quantitative information supporting the use of the LAT1-mediated prodrug approach for enhanced brain delivery of drugs with intracellular targets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576457>Asymmetric dimethylarginine aggravates blood-retinal  breakdown of diabetic retinopathy via inhibition of intercellular communication in retinal pericytes.</a></h1><p>Blood-retinal  breakdown is the main pathological characteristics of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) was reported to be elevated in DR patients. In this study, we observed the dynamic profile of ADMA, retinal morphology and permeability of BRB at 2, 4 or 8 week of diabetic rats induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (60 mg/kg) and in cultured rat retinal pericytes pretreated with D-glucose (30 mM) for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days or ADMA (3, 10, 30 μM) for 24, 48 and 72 h, trying to explore the effects of ADMA on blood-retinal  in DR.

Three isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to contain 0 (FM), 40 (D.40) and 400 (D.400) mg kg daidzein, respectively. Fish fed D.400 had significantly lower growth performance than fish fed D.40. Dietary daidzein significantly increased the feed efficiency, while significantly decreased the feed intake. Daidzein supplementation increased the activity of total anti-oxidative capacity and the gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-β1, Mucin-2 and tight junction proteins (Tricellulin, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant 1, Zonula occludens-1 transcript variant 2 and Claudin-like and Occludin), and down-regulated the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the intestine of turbot. Dietary daidzein increased intestinal microbial diversities, the abundance of several short chain fatty  producers, and decreased the abundance of some potential pathogenic bacteria. However, D.400 had dual effects on lactic  bacteria and increased the abundance of potential harmful bacterium Prevotella copri. Collectively, dietary daidzein at the levels of 40 and 400 mg kg could enhance the intestinal mucosal   and alter the intestinal microbiota of turbot. However, high dose of daidzein must be treated with caution for its unclear effects on intestinal microbiota of turbot in the present study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is quoted in almost all known medical treatises, from Antiquity up to modern era, such as Corpus Hippocraticum, Dioscorides' De Materia Medica and later on in medieval medical manuscripts and Pharmacopoeias. Actually, it is widely used as herbal medicine for the relief of mild symptoms of mental stress, to aid sleep and for symptomatic treatment of mild gastrointestinal complaints including bloating and flatulence. In Greece, the empirical physicians "vikoyiatroi" recommended the decoction of dry flowers and leaves to treat tracheobronchitis, hysteria, epilepsy, heart arrhythmias, as hypnotic and against skin disorders.The present study was conducted to investigate the potential beneficial effects in psoriasis in mice of M. officinalis ssp. altissima and to carry out the chemical analysis in order to reveal its main bioactive secondary metabolites.Non polar and polar extracts of M. officinalis ssp. altissima aerial parts were prepared by using dichloromethane and methanol, successively; in addition a decoction was made upon oral information by local users in Crete, where the plant was collected. All three preparations were chemically analyzed in order to isolate their main constituents. Chemical structures of all isolated compounds were determined by 1D, 2D-NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Furthermore, the antioxidant potential of extracts and decoction was evaluated through DPPH radical scavenging capability. The in vivo in mice anti-psoriatic efficacy of all preparations was estimated through clinical and histopathological assessment and measurements of TEWL and hydration.The dichloromethane extract yielded ursolic , 2α-hydroxy-ursolic , pomolic , 3β-stearyloxy-urs-12-ene, oleanolic , noropacursane and campesterol; the methanol extract afforded rosmarinic  and methyl rosmarinate, while from the decoction caffeic , 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)lactic  and rosmarinic  were isolated. The psoriasis evaluation, based on PASI score, photodocumentation and histopathological estimation showed that the decoction primarily and the dichloromethane extract secondly could significantly contribute to psoriasis treatment. The decoction seems able to reestablish skin  by decreasing dryness and enhancing skin  . Moreover, the decoction showed the best antioxidant activity, while the dichloromethane extract the weakest.The triterpene derivatives of the dichloromethane extract are likely to be responsible for its anti-psoriatic activity. The abundant polyphenolic load of the decoction contributes to its high antioxidant activity and the most effective results against psoriasis. The anti-psoriatic activity of the decoction confirmed the traditional use of this plant as antioxidant, wound healing and skin  repair agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although essential amino , fatty , and available phosphorus had been balanced according to the nutrient requirement of sturgeon, compared with the fish of P0 and P50, the full plant protein diet (P100) significantly reduced growth performance and survival, and accompanied with serious spiral valve intestinal (SVI) damage. The increased tissue necrosis and failed responses in anti-oxidation, programming apoptosis, autophagy and cell proliferation system were regulated by inhibiting ERK1 phosphorylation, which indicated that SVI hypoimmunity and functional degradation were the main reasons for the high mortality and low utilization ability of plant protein in Amur sturgeon.Copyright © 2019.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  . In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal   through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Alteration of the intestinal  is associated with enhanced intestinal permeability and development of numerous pathological diseases including gastrointestinal and cardiometabolic diseases. Among the metabolites that play an important role within intestinal health, L Tryptophan (Trp) is one of the nine essential amino  supplied by diet, whose metabolism appears as a key modulator of gut microbiota, with major impacts on physiological, and pathological pathways. Recently, emerging evidence showed that the Trp catabolism through one major enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expressed by the host affects Trp metabolism by gut microbiota to generate indole metabolites, thereby altering gut  and health in mice and humans. In this mini review, I summarize the most recent advances concerning the role of Trp metabolism in host-microbiota cross-talk in health, and metabolic diseases.

Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) plays a protective role in hypothermia. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of CIRBP on intestinal  during DHCA.Sprague-Dawley (wild type, n = 13) and knockout of Cirbp (Cirbp-/-, n = 8) rats were used in the model of DHCA. The histomorphology of the epithelial  was evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin, Chiu's scores, Gram's stain and Ki67. The  of the intestinal  was evaluated by serum intestinal fatty -binding protein, diamine oxidase and d-lactate. The structure of the epithelial , phosphocreatine-creatine kinase system and adenosine triphosphate were assessed in the intestine.The expression of CIRBP significantly increased in the intestine during DHCA. Cirbp-/- rats showed obvious destruction of intestinal  after DHCA. Chiu's scores, intestinal fatty -binding protein, diamine oxidase and d-lactate significantly increased in the Cirbp-/- group. Ki67 showed that cell proliferation decreased in the Cirbp-/- rats. In the Cirbp-/- group, zonula occludens-1, E-cadherin and occludin levels were significantly decreased, and these proteins either disappeared or redistributed in the monolayer. Besides, Cirbp-/- resulted in decreased levels of creatine kinase B, glycine amidinotransferase, adenosine triphosphate and creatine contents in the intestine, affecting energy metabolism and balance, which is associated with the maintenance of epithelial  during acute injury.CIRBP is related to the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial  during DHCA, which is expected to be a new target for the prevention of intestinal injury.© The Author(s) 2019.

The EVB simulations model the observed effect of the P166A mutation on protein structure. The E97A, E97Q, and E97D mutations of the conserved E97 side chain result in ≤1.0 kcal mol decreases in the activation  for substrate deprotonation. The agreement between experimental and computed activation barriers is within ±1 kcal mol, with a strong linear correlation between Δ and Δ for all 11 variants, with slopes β = 0.73 ( = 0.994) and β = 0.74 ( = 0.995) for the deprotonation of DHAP and GAP, respectively. These Brønsted-type correlations show that the amino  side chains examined in this study  to reduce the standard-state Gibbs free energy of reaction for deprotonation of the weak α-carbonyl carbon  substrate to form the enediolate phosphate reaction intermediate. TIM utilizes the cationic side chain of K12 to provide direct electrostatic stabilization of the enolate oxyanion, and the nonpolar side chains of P166, I170, and L230 are utilized for the construction of an active-site cavity that provides optimal stabilization of the enediolate phosphate intermediate relative to the carbon  substrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582652>Role of Aquaporin-3 in Intestinal Injury Induced by Sepsis.</a></h1><p>Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is expressed in various parts of the intestine, where it regulates the proliferation and migration of intestinal epithelial cells and the transport of glycerol and hydrogen peroxide. Our study aimed to investigate the effect on the expression of AQP3 of intestinal injury in septic mice and whether oral administration of glycerol can reduce intestinal epithelial injury and  disorder by acting as a partial substitute for the  of AQP3. We established a sepsis model by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) in mice. Sepsis induced intestinal injury, as demonstrated by the disordered destruction of the morphology of the intestinal mucosa, time-dependent increases in Chiu's score (p < 0.05), significantly increased (p < 0.05) plasma concentrations of determination of the levels of diamine oxidase (DAO) and intestinal fatty -binding protein 2 (FABP2), and time-dependent downregulation of the expression of AQP3 and occluding (p < 0.05). While the administration of oral glycerol partially ameliorated the sepsis-induced injury of the intestinal mucosa, as shown by the partial recovery of the morphological structure, with decreased Chiu's score, decreased plasma concentrations of DAO and intestinal-type FABP2, upregulated expression of occludin and decreased mortality rate (Sepsis vs. Sepsis + Glycerol, p < 0.05). The results showed that the expression levels of AQP3 and occludin were downregulated after septic intestinal injury, while treatment with glycerol, which acts as a substitute for AQP3, partly ameliorated intestinal injury and improved the survival rate. This preliminary experiment suggests that AQP3 may protect the intestinal tract against the effects of sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161702>Effects of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 producing fusion proteins of bovine lactoferricin-lactoferrampin on growth, intestinal morphology and immune  in weaned piglet.</a></h1><p>We developed a strategy for localized delivery of the LFCA (lactoferricinlactoferrampin), which is actively synthesized in situ by Lactococcus lactis (pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363), and explored the possibility of using pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 as an alternative additive diet to antibiotics.The antimicrobial activities of the LFCA derived from pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 were tested in vitro. The results showed that LFCA had an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. Then, the pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 was used as an additive diet for piglets. Our data demonstrated that oral administration of pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 significantly improved the average daily gain, feed-to-gain ratio, intestinal mucosal integrity and decreased the serum endotoxin and d-lactic  levels. The mRNA expression levels of intestinal tight junction proteins (including occludin, Claudin-1 and ZO-1) were significantly upregulated by pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 administration. The serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels, IL-2, IL-10 and TGF-β levels were significantly increased by pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363. Furthermore, our data revealed that oral administration of pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 significantly increased the number of general Lactobacillus, and decreased the total viable E. coli counts in the ileum and cecum contents.We developed a novel pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363 secreting LFCA, which had probiotic effects on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, intestinal   and immunological indices of weaned piglets.pAMJ399-LFCA/LLMG1363, with probiotic effects on the health of weaned piglets, may be a promising feed additive for weaned piglets.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31320686>Identification of a missense variant in CLDN2 in obstructive azoospermia.</a></h1><p>Obstructive azoospermia (OA), defined as an obstruction in any region of the male genital tract, accounts for 40% of all azoospermia cases. Of all OA cases, ~30% are thought to have a genetic origin, however, hitherto, the underlying genetic etiology of the majority of these cases remain unknown. To address this, we took a family-based whole-exome sequencing approach to identify causal variants of OA in a multiplex family with epidydimal obstruction. A novel gain-of- missense variant in CLDN2 (c.481G>C; p.Gly161Arg) was found to co-segregate with the phenotype, consistent with the X-linked inheritance pattern observed in the pedigree. To assess the pathogenicity of this variant, the wild and mutant protein structures were modeled and their potential for strand formation in multimeric form was assessed and compared. The results showed that dimeric and tetrameric arrangements of Claudin-2 were not only reduced, but were also significantly altered by this single residue change. We, therefore, envisage that this amino  change likely forms a polymeric discontinuous strand, which may lead to the disruption of tight junctions among epithelial cells. This missense variant is thus likely to be responsible for the disruption of the blood-epididymis , causing dislodged epithelial cells to clog the genital tract, hence causing OA. This study not only sheds light on the underlying pathobiology of OA, but also provides a basis for more efficient diagnosis in the clinical setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434495>Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Human Adipose Tissue Vasculature Alters the Particulate Secretome and Induces Endothelial Dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Endothelial cells (EC) in obese adipose tissue (AT) are exposed to a chronic proinflammatory environment that may induce a mesenchymal-like phenotype and altered . The objective of this study was to establish whether endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) is present in human AT in obesity and to investigate the effect of such transition on endothelial  and the endothelial particulate secretome represented by extracellular vesicles (EV). Approach and Results: We identified EndoMT in obese human AT depots by immunohistochemical co-localization of CD31 or vWF and α-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin). We showed that AT EC exposed in vitro to TGF-β (tumor growth factor-β), TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), and IFN-γ (interferon-γ) undergo EndoMT with progressive loss of endothelial markers. The phenotypic change results in failure to maintain a tight  in culture, increased migration, and reduced angiogenesis. EndoMT also reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic capacity of EC. EVs produced by EC that underwent EndoMT dramatically reduced angiogenic capacity of the recipient naïve ECs without affecting their migration or proliferation. Proteomic analysis of EV produced by EC in the proinflammatory conditions showed presence of several pro-inflammatory and immune proteins along with an enrichment in angiogenic receptors.We demonstrated the presence of EndoMT in human AT in obesity. EndoMT in vitro resulted in production of EV that transferred some of the functional and metabolic features to recipient naïve EC. This result suggests that functional and molecular features of EC that underwent EndoMT in vivo can be disseminated in a paracrine or endocrine fashion and may induce endothelial dysfunction in distant vascular beds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435172>Beneficial effects of nutritional supplements on intestinal epithelial  functions in experimental colitis models .</a></h1><p>Acute and chronic colitis affect a huge proportion of the population world-wide. The etiology of colitis cases can be manifold, and diet can significantly affect onset and outcome of colitis. While many forms of acute colitis are easily treatable, chronic forms of colitis such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (summarized as inflammatory bowel diseases) are multifactorial with poorly understood pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by exacerbated immune responses causing epithelial dysfunction and bacterial translocation. There is no cure and therapies aim at reducing inflammation and restoring intestinal  . Unfortunately, most drugs can have severe side effects. Changes in diet and inclusion of nutritional supplements have been extensively studied in cell culture and animal models, and some supplements have shown promising results in clinical studies. Most of these nutritional supplements including vitamins, fatty  and phytochemicals reduce oxidative stress and inflammation and have shown beneficial effects during experimental colitis in rodents induced by dextran sulphate sodium or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic , which remain the gold standard in pre-clinical colitis research. Here, we summarize the mechanisms through which such nutritional supplements contribute to epithelial  stabilization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208043>Dietary Fiber in Bilberry Ameliorates Pre-Obesity Events in Rats by Regulating Lipid Depot, Cecal Short-Chain Fatty  Formation and Microbiota Composition.</a></h1><p>Obesity is linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors associated to metabolic syndrome. Bilberry () that contains easily fermentable fiber may strengthen the intestinal  , attenuate inflammation and modulate gut microbiota composition, thereby prevent obesity development. In the current study, liver lipid metabolism, fat depot, cecal and serum short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) and gut microbiome were evaluated in rats fed bilberries in a high-fat (HFD + BB) or low-fat (LFD + BB) setting for 8 weeks and compared with diets containing equal amount of fiber resistant to fermentation (cellulose, HFD and LFD). HFD fed rats did not obtain an obese phenotype but underwent pre-obesity events including increased liver index, lipid accumulation and increased serum cholesterol levels. This was linked to shifts of cecal bacterial community and reduction of major SCFAs. Bilberry inclusion improved liver metabolism and serum lipid levels. Bilberry inclusion under either LFD or HFD, maintained microbiota homeostasis, stimulated interscapular-brown adipose tissue depot associated with increased mRNA expression of uncoupling protein-1; enhanced SCFAs in the cecum and circulation; and promoted butyric  and butyrate-producing bacteria. These findings suggest that bilberry may serve as a preventative dietary measure to optimize microbiome and associated lipid metabolism during or prior to HFD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31432190>Impaired intestinal   in a mouse model of hyperuricemia.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of hyperuricemia on the damage to target organs, including the kidneys, joints and the heart. However, it is unclear whether hyperuricemia results in damage to the intestines. The aim of the present study was to investigate intestinal  dysfunction in a mouse model of hyperuricemia constructed by knocking out the urate oxidase (Uox) gene. The morphology of the intestine was assessed via hematoxylin and eosin, and alcian blue staining. The serum and intestinal tissue levels of uric , tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑6, in addition to the presence of uremic toxins in the serum, were assessed. The levels of diamine oxidase (DAO), D‑lactate (D‑LAC) and endotoxins in the serum, which are markers of the intestinal permeability, were measured using ELISA. The expression of the intestinal tight junction proteins zona occludens‑1 (ZO‑1) and occludin were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. The Uox‑knockout mice spontaneously developed hyperuricemia. Histopathological analysis indicated notable intestinal defects including sparse villi, mucosal edema and a declining mucus layer in hyperuricemic mice. The expression levels of ZO‑1 and occludin in the intestines were downregulated, and the serum levels of DAO, D‑LAC and endotoxins were higher in the hyperuricemic mice, compared with control mice. The serum and intestinal tissue levels of IL‑6 and TNF‑α were significantly increased. Additionally, the expression levels of the serum uremic toxins, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen were significantly increased in hyperuricemic mice compared with the control mice, while only a marked increase in indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p‑cresol sulfate was reported. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that intestinal  dysfunction and subsequent enhanced intestinal permeability may occur as a result of hyperuricemia in mice. Furthermore, we proposed that the loss of intestinal epithelium   may be associated with uric ‑induced inflammatory responses; however, further investigation is required.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158745>Synthesis and bioevaluation of technetium-99 m / rhenium labeled phenylquinoxaline derivatives as Tau imaging probes.</a></h1><p>Based on our previous research on the fluorinated phenylquinoxaline scaffold, in this study, different positions of N,N-dimethyl amino group, and alkyl linkers with various lengths were introduced into this scaffold to regulate their lipophilicity and binding affinity to Tau. Four novel Tc/Re complexes with diethyl iminodiacetate chelator were synthesized and evaluated as Tau imaging tracers in the brain of Alzheimer's disease. Their specific binding to neurofibrillary tangles was verified by in vitro fluorescence staining and further confirmed by the results of immunofluorescence staining on the same brain sections from AD patient and Tg-tau mice. From in vitro binding assay using recombinant Tau aggregates, complex 4.2 with 6-N(CH) and longer carbon chain (n = 4) displayed the highest affinity (K = 59.95 nM). [Tc]4.2 was achieved by the ligand exchange reaction between dicarboxylic precursor and [Tc(CO)(HO)] intermediate with radiochemical yield over 45%. Ex vivo biodistribution studies on normal ICR mice revealed that [Tc]4.2 exhibited moderate initial brain uptake (0.61% ID/g) and more structure optimizations are still required to improve the blood-brain  permeability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To meet this need, hyaluronic  (HA)/ibuprofen (IBU) (HAI) NFMs were prepared by electrospinning, followed by dual ionic crosslinking with FeCl (HAIF NFMs) and covalent crosslinking with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to produce HAIFB NFMs. It is expected that the multi-functional NFMs will act as a physical  to prevent fibroblast penetration, HA will reduce fibroblast attachment and impart a lubrication effect for tendon gliding, while IBU will  as an anti-inflammation drug. For this purpose, we successfully fabricated HAIFB NFMs containing 20% (HAI20FB), 30% (HAI30FB), and 40% (HAI40FB) IBU and characterized their physico-chemical properties by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and mechanical testing. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that all NFMs except HAI40FB possessed excellent effects in preventing fibroblast attachment and penetration while preserving high biocompatibility without influencing cell proliferation. Although showing significant improvement in mechanical properties over other NFMs, the HAI40FB NFM exhibited cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts due to the higher percentage and concentration of IBU released form the membrane. In vivo studies in a rabbit flexor tendon rupture model demonstrated the efficacy of IBU-loaded NFMs (HAI30FB) over Seprafilm and NFMs without IBU (HAFB) in reducing local inflammation and preventing tendon adhesion based on gross observation, histological analyses, and biomechanical functional assays. We concluded that an HAI30FB NFM will act as a multi-functional  membrane to prevent peritendinous adhesion after tendon surgery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376617>Antimicrobial packaging based on a LAE containing zein coating to control foodborne pathogens in chicken soup.</a></h1><p>In this study, zein coatings containing Lauroyl-l-arginine ethyl ester monohydrochloride (LAE) were developed to be applied on polypropylene films and manufacture an active food packaging. The concentration of LAE and the addition of a suitable plasticizer (glycerol or oleic  (OA)) were the main variables considered. Active plasticized zein films, with glycerol or oleic  were characterized in terms of release kinetics, mechanical, , optical, and antimicrobial properties. Results showed that active agent concentration, (5 and 10%), had no-significant effect on mechanical and WVP properties of the plasticized films. Films plasticized with OA presented greater water resistance, UV-light opacity, and water  properties than glycerol-plasticized films. On the contrary, the latter had better antimicrobial properties. The analysis of LAE release kinetics from films to different food simulants revealed different behaviours, depending on both film formulation and food simulant. Despite the lower water resistance of coatings containing glycerol, bags based on polypropylene/glycerol plasticized zein containing 10% of LAE presented a great antimicrobial activity in tests with chicken soup (real food system) contaminated with pathogen bacteria, concretely, the films showed 3.21 Log reduction against Listeria monocytogenes and 3.07 log reductions against Escherichia coli. These results suggest a promising strategy on the use of LAE-containing zein in active food packaging to control foodborne pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of individual SCFAs, such as propionate, on intestinal development is still unclear. In the present study, sixteen barrows fitted with a cecal fistula were randomly divided into two groups for cecal infusion of either saline (control group) or sodium propionate (propionate group). After 28 days, the length and the relative weight of intestinal segments were calculated, the intestinal morphology was assessed, and the expression of tight junction protein was measured using qPCR and Western blotting. Compared to the saline group, the length of the colon was significantly increased in the propionate group ( < 0.05). The jejunal villi length and villi/crypt ratio in the propionate group were significantly higher than in the saline group ( < 0.05). Furthermore, propionate infusion significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of  and the expression of Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Occludin protein in the jejunal mucosa ( < 0.05).

Water contact angles of the resulting films could be tuned from <5° (superhydrophilic) to >135° (very hydrophobic) by adjusting the AA/PMA feed ratio and/or via postdeposition exposure of films to an Ar/O plasma treatment. Coatings could be applied to any surface and were seen to be water stable, due in large part to cross-linking induced from the reactivity of the PMA pendant groups. Hybrid hydrophilic/phobic patterns at submillimeter length scales, and philic/phobic/philic laminates were produced using a shadow mask and sequential deposition, respectively. Chemical heterogeneity of films was assessed using XPS, SIMS, and micro-IR imaging and suggest that localization of COOH and OH groups are primarily responsible for hydrophilicity.

A previous study suggested that  MR-1 utilizes a small, polar, redox active molecule that serves as an electron shuttle between the bacteria and insoluble acceptors, but the shuttle itself has never been identified. Through isolation and synthesis, we identify it as ACNQ (2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), a soluble analog of menaquinone. ACNQ is derived from DHNA (1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic ) in a non-enzymatic process that frustrated genetic approaches to identify the shuttle. Both ACNQ and DHNA restore reduction of AQDS under anaerobic growth in menaquinone-deficient mutants. Bioelectrochemistry analyses reveal that ACNQ (-0.32 V) contributes to the extracellular electron transfer (EET) as an electron shuttle, without altering menaquinone generation or EET related cytochrome c expression.© 2019, Mevers et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379865>Cathelicidin-WA Facilitated Intestinal Fatty  Absorption Through Enhancing PPAR-γ Dependent  .</a></h1><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular uptake of long-chain fatty  and the regulation of this process have been debated in recent decades. Here, we established an intestinal  dysfunction model in mice and Caco2 cell line by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and evaluated the fatty  uptake capacity of the intestine. We found that LPS stimulation restricted the absorption of long chain fatty  (LCFA), while Cathelicidin-WA (CWA) pretreatment facilitated this physiological process. At the molecular level, our results demonstrated that the stimulatory effects of CWA on intestinal lipid absorption were dependent on cluster determinant 36 and fatty  transport protein 4, but not fatty -binding protein. Further, an enhanced intestinal  was observed  and  when CWA alleviated the fatty  absorption disorder induced by LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) signaling was considered as a key pathway for CWA to enhance LCFA absorption and  . Treatment with a PPAR-γ inhibitor led to impaired intestinal   and suppressed LCFA uptake. Moreover, once PPAR-γ signaling was blocked, CWA pretreatment could not maintain the stability of the intestinal epithelial cell  or LCFA uptake after LPS stimulation. Collectively, these findings suggested that PPAR-γ may serve as a target for specific therapies aimed at alleviating fatty  uptake disorder, and CWA showed considerable potential as a new PPAR-γ agonist to strengthen intestinal   against fatty  malabsorption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594750>Gut microbiota from colorectal cancer patients enhances the progression of intestinal adenoma in Apc mice.</a></h1><p>Accumulating evidence points to a close relationship between gut dysbiosis and colorectal cancer (CRC).

It is a naturally occurring amino , abundantly found in the retina. It has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, neuroprotective, and osmoregulatory functions in the retina. We used conditionally immortalized rat retinal capillary endothelial cells (TR-iBRB), in vitro, to investigate the effects of oxidative stress, high glucose (HG) and hypertonic conditions on taurine transport. TR-iBRB cells pre-treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) showed a significant increase in [H]taurine uptake rate, which, however, decreased when treated with taurine (50 mM). Addition of paeonol and propranolol to TNF-α pre-treated cells had no significant effect on [H]taurine uptake, but the addition of 10 mM taurine caused a reduction. The uptake rate decreased under HG conditions, in contrast to that under hypertonic conditions. [H]Taurine uptake increased with pre-incubation time. Additionally, uptake of [H]taurine and mRNA expression of taurine transporter (TauT) decreased significantly under hypertonic and HG conditions, following pre-incubation with 10 mM taurine, 1 mM paeonol, and 0.1 mM propranolol. [H]Taurine uptake was significantly inhibited in the presence of taurine transporters such as taurine and β-alanine. Results indicate that oxidative stress and hypertonic conditions increased taurine uptake in iBRB cell lines, whereas HG conditions reduced the uptake rate. Taurine may be useful in stabilizing the microenvironment in cells affected by oxidative stress as well as hypertonic and HG conditions. Moreover, taurine may play a key role in maintaining taurine concentrations in the taurine transporter system of retinal cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376820>The role of large neutral amino  transporter (LAT1) in cancer.</a></h1><p>The solute carrier family 7 (SLC7) family can be categorically divided into two subfamilies, the L-type amino  transporters (LATs) including SLC7A5-13, and SLC7A15, and the cationic amino  transporters (CATs) including SLC7A1-4 and SLC7A14. Members of the CAT family transport predominantly cationic amino  by facilitated diffusion with intracellular substrates. LAT1 (also known as SLC7A5), is defined as heteromeric amino  transporter (HAT) interacting with the glycoprotein CD98 (SLC3A2) through a conserved disulfide to uptake not only large neutral amino , but also several pharmaceutical drugs to cells.In this review, we provide an overview of the interaction of the structure- of LAT1 and its essential role in cancer. Specifically, its role at the blood-brain  (BBB) to facilitate the transport of thyroid hormones, pharmaceuticals (e.g.,I-DOPA, gabapentin), and metabolites into the brain.LAT1 expression increases as cancers progress, leading to higher expression levels in high-grade tumors and metastases. In addition, LAT1 plays a crucial role in cancer-associated reprogrammed metabolic networks by supplying tumor cells with essential amino .The increasing understanding of the role of LAT1 in cancer has led to an increase in interest surrounding its potential as a drug target for cancer treatment.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218691>Dielectric  Discharge High Voltage Cold Atmospheric Plasma: An Innovative Nonthermal Technology for Extending the Shelf-Life of Asian Sea Bass Slices.</a></h1><p>Impact of dielectric  discharge high-voltage cold atmospheric plasma (DBD-HVCAP) generated with the mixture of oxygen and argon (10:90) for various treatment times (2.5 to 10 min) on the qualities of Asian sea bass slices during 4 °C storage was investigated. Microbial load of slices treated with DBD-HVCAP were lower than the control. The efficacy of bacteria reduction by DBD-HVCAP was dependent on the treatment times (P < 0.05). Total viable bacteria count (TVBC) was more than 6.0 Log CFU/g at day 6 for the control kept in air. Slices treated with DBD-HVCAP for all treatment times used had TVBC lower than the limit at day 12. Total volatile nitrogen base content (TVNB) as well as trimethylamine (TMA) content in slices treated with DBD-HVCAP were lower than that of the control throughout the storage. TVNB as well as TMA contents were lower in HVCAP treated slices in a treatment time-dependent manner. Nevertheless, lipid oxidation in samples treated with DBD-HVCAP was higher than that of the control. Polyunsaturated fatty  were decreased in slices treated with DBD-HVCAP for more than 5 min after 12 days of storage. Therefore DBD-HVCAP treatment for 5 min was demonstrated to be potential means for increasing the shelf-life of Asian sea bass slices with minimal negative effect on chemical and sensory properties, in which they could be stored longer than 12 days at 4 °C. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Microbial inactivation capacity of dielectric  discharge high-voltage cold atmospheric plasma (DBD-HVCAP) has been documented with limited information on its application in extending the shelf-life of foods. DBD-HVCAP was demonstrated as an innovative technology for extending the shelf-life of Asian sea bass slices, which could be implemented in seafood industries for assuring safety and extending shelf-life of products. The shelf-life of the slices treated with DBD-HVCAP was extended to 12 days of storage at 4 °C as compared to the 6 days of the untreated counterpart.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31468461>Taurine Regulation of Neuroendocrine .</a></h1><p>Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic ) is a sulfur-containing amino . It is one of the most abundant free amino  in many excitable tissues, including the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscles. Physiological actions of taurine are widespread and include regulation of plasma glucose levels, bile  conjugation, detoxification, membrane stabilization, blood pressure regulation, osmoregulation, neurotransmission, and modulation of mitochondria  and cellular calcium levels. Taurine plays an important role in modulating glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and prevents excitotoxicity in vitro primarily through modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Taurine supplementation prevents age-dependent decline of cognitive functions. Because of the wide spread actions of taurine, its levels are highly regulated through enzymatic biosynthesis or dietary intake. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous or dietary supplementation of exogenous taurine have been shown to induce wide spread actions on multiple organs. Cysteine sulfonic  decarboxylase (CSAD) was first identified in the liver and is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in taurine biosynthesis. CSAD mRNA is expressed in the brain in astrocytes. Homozygous knockout mice lacking CSAD (CSAD-KO) have very reduced taurine content and show severe functional histopathology in the visual system, skeletal system, heart, pancreas and brain. Conversely, dietary supplementation of taurine results in significant health benefits acting through the same organ systems. Fluctuation of taurine bioavailability lead to changes in the expression levels of taurine transporters in neuronal plasma membranes, endothelial cells forming the blood-brain  and proximal cells of the kidneys. Suggesting a highly regulated mechanism for maintaining taurine homeostasis and organ systems . Here we show how alterations in taurine levels directly affect the  of one organ system and through functional interaction and compensatory adaptation; these effects extend to another organ systems with focus on the nervous system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175943>Long-term exposure to fluoride as a factor promoting changes in the expression and activity of cyclooxygenases (COX1 and COX2) in various rat brain structures.</a></h1><p>Sixty percent of the mammalian brain is composed of lipids including arachidonic  (AA). AA released from cell membranes is metabolised in the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway to prostanoids - biologically active substances involved in the regulation of many processes including inflammation. It has been shown that long-term exposure to fluoride in pre and neonatal period is dangerous because this element is able to penetrate through the placenta and to cross the blood-brain . Exposure to fluoride during the development affects metabolism and  of neurons and glia which results in the impairment of cognitive functions but the exact mechanisms of fluoride neurotoxicity are not clearly defined.The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure to fluoride during the development affects COXes activity and the synthesis of prostanoids.Pre- and postnatal toxicity model in Wistar rats was used. Experimental animals received 50 mg/L of NaF in drinking water ad libitum, while control animals received tap water. In cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum were measured fluoride concentration, COX1 and COX2 genes expression, immunolocalization of the enzymatic proteins and concentration of PGE2 and TXB2.of this study showed statistically significant changes in the concentration of fluoride in brain structures between study group and control animals. Moreover, significant changes in the expression level of COX1 and COX2, and in the concentration of PGE2 and TXB2 were observed.Exposure to fluoride in the prenatal and neonatal period result in the increase in COX2 activity and increase in PGE2 concentration in rats brain, which may lead to disturbances in central nervous system homeostasis.‬‬.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Serum/plasma concentrations of zonulin (a regulator of enterocyte tight junctions), tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), intestinal fatty  binding protein (IFABP)/ileal bile  binding protein (IBABP), D-lactate, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein were measured.Zonulin concentrations were significantly higher when a concurrent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of blood-brain  (BBB) disruption (Gad+ RRMS) and were correlated with tight junction proteins. IBABP and D-lactate were elevated in people with RRMS compared to controls, but did not discriminate between Gad+ and Gad- subgroups. Baseline zonulin concentrations were associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS.People with MS have altered biomarkers of intestinal  integrity. Zonulin concentrations are associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS and closely mirror BBB breakdown in RRMS. Zonulin may mediate breakdown of both the intestinal  and the BBB in gut dysbiosis through the regulation of tight junctions. This could explain how the gut-brain axis modulates neuroinflammation in MS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370115>Development of a New Type of Recombinant Hyaluronidase Using a Hexahistidine; Possibilities and Challenges in Commercialization.</a></h1><p>Hyaluronidases enhance therapeutic drug transport by breaking down the hyaluronan  to lymphatic and capillary vessels, facilitating their tissue absorption. Commercially available hyaluronidases are bovine in origin; however, they pose risks such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The present study aimed to develop a novel, highly active hyaluronidase and assess its . Therefore, in order to find the most efficient active hyaluronidase, we produced several shortened hyaluronidases with partial removal of the N- or C-terminal regions. Moreover, we created an enzyme that connected six histidines onto the end of the hyaluronidase C-terminus. This simplified subsequent purification using Ni affinity chromatography, making it feasible to industrialize this highly active recombinant hyaluronidase which exhibited catalytic activity equal to that of the commercial enzyme. Therefore, this simple and effective isolation method could increase the availability of recombinant hyaluronidase for research and clinical purposes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195653>Characterization of Biofilm Formed by Phenanthrene-Degrading Bacteria on Rice Root Surfaces for Reduction of PAH Contamination in Rice.</a></h1><p>One effective method in to reduce the uptake of organic contaminants by plants is the development of a root . In this study, the characterization of biofilm structure and  by phenanthrene-degrading  sp. JM2-gfp on rice root surfaces were carried out. Our results showed that root surfaces from three rice species, namely 401, , and  all present hydrophobicity and a high initial adhesion of strain JM2-gfp. Matured robust biofilm formation occurred at 48 h on the root surfaces. The biofilm exhibited cell dense aggregates and biomass embedded in the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. EPS composition results showed that the proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic  are produced in the biofilm, while the content varied with rice species. Under the initial concentration of phenanthrene 50 mg·L, the residual phenanthrene in plant roots from '', '' and '401' with biofilm mediated were significantly decreased by 71.9%, 69.3% and 58.7%, respectively, compared to those without biofilm groups after 10 days of exposure. Thus, the biofilm colonized on roots plays an important role of degradation in order to reduce the level of phenanthrene uptake of plants.

Both the basic anatomical structure of the gut (such as epithelial cells) and its luminal microbiota play important roles for maintaining gut health and functions. The interactions between epithelial cells and luminal microbiota have significant impact on host nutrition and health through the metabolism of dietary components. Amino , which are major nutrients for pigs, are not only obligatory for maintaining the intestinal mucosal mass and integrity, but also for supporting the growth of microorganisms in the gut. Dietary amino  are the major fuel of the small intestinal mucosa. Particularly, glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate are the major oxidative fuel of the intestine. Emerging evidence shows that arginine activates the mTOR signaling pathway in the small intestine. Utilization of glycine by the small intestinal mucosa to synthesize glutathione is a very important physiological pathway, and the role of glycine as a powerful cytoprotectant has also been recognized. The major end products of methionine and cysteine metabolism are glutathione, homocysteine and taurine, which play important roles in the intestinal immune and anti-oxidative responses. Threonine is highly utilized by the gut and is particularly important for mucin synthesis and maintenance of gut  integrity. Moreover, either a deficiency or an excess of dietary threonine can reduce the synthesis of intestinal mucosal proteins and mucins in young pigs. Various new functions of amino  on gut health and functions have been discovered in recent years. Thus, this review is to provide some up-to-date knowledge for industry application of dietary amino  in order to enhance swine gut health and functions, and also it is to provide a comprehensive reference for further scientific research in this regard.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636638>Heparanase-Dependent Remodeling of Initial Lymphatic Glycocalyx Regulates Tissue-Fluid Drainage During Acute Inflammation .</a></h1><p>The glycocalyx is a dense layer of carbohydrate chains involved in numerous and fundamental biological processes, such as cellular and tissue homeostasis, inflammation and disease development. Composed of membrane-bound glycoproteins, sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycan side-chains, this structure is particularly essential for blood vascular  functions and leukocyte diapedesis. Interestingly, whilst the glycocalyx of blood vascular endothelium has been extensively studied, little is known about the composition and  of this glycan layer present on tissue-associated lymphatic vessels (LVs). Here, we applied confocal microscopy to characterize the composition of endothelial glycocalyx of initial lymphatic capillaries in murine cremaster muscles during homeostatic and inflamed conditions using an anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibody and a panel of lectins recognizing different glycan moieties of the glycocalyx. Our data show the presence of HS, α-D-galactosyl moieties, α2,3-linked sialic  and, to a lesser extent, N-Acetylglucosamine moieties. A similar expression profile was also observed for LVs of mouse and human skins. Interestingly, inflammation of mouse cremaster tissues or ear skin as induced by TNF-stimulation induced a rapid (within 16 h) remodeling of the LV glycocalyx, as observed by reduced expression of HS and galactosyl moieties, whilst levels of α2,3-linked sialic  remains unchanged. Furthermore, whilst this response was associated with neutrophil recruitment from the blood circulation and their migration into tissue-associated LVs, specific neutrophil depletion did not impact LV glycocalyx remodeling. Mechanistically, treatment with a non-anticoagulant heparanase inhibitor suppressed LV HS degradation without impacting neutrophil migration into LVs. Interestingly however, inhibition of glycocalyx degradation reduced the capacity of initial LVs to drain interstitial fluid during acute inflammation. Collectively, our data suggest that rapid remodeling of endothelial glycocalyx of tissue-associated LVs supports drainage of fluid and macromolecules but has no role in regulating neutrophil trafficking out of inflamed tissues via initial LVs.Copyright © 2019 Arokiasamy, King, Boulaghrasse, Poston, Nourshargh, Wang and Voisin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143767>Identification of Serum Biomarkers for Intestinal Integrity in a Broiler Chicken Malabsorption Model.</a></h1><p>Intestinal health is essential for feed efficiency and growth in animal agriculture and is dependent on  , inflammation and dysbiosis. Our laboratory has published a nutritional model to induce gut inflammation using rye as a source of energy in poultry. More recently, we have used this model as an assessment of a nutritional rehabilitation model for better understanding of childhood undernutrition. The objective of this brief research report was to use a well-establish malabsorption model in broiler chickens using corn and rye as an energy source to identify several intestinal health biomarkers in the serum. To screen for inflammatory biomarkers, seven commercially available tests were used including Griess, superoxide dismutase, thiobarbituric  reactive substances, Total antioxidant capacity, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, Citrulline, and Interferon-ɤ; total IgA from cloacal swab was also measured. In the present study, chickens fed rye had a significant ( < 0.05) reduction in body weight and body weight gain at 10 day when compared with chickens that received the corn diet. In the second phase of the experiment, chickens that remain with the corn diet had significant differences in body weight and body weight gain. No significant differences were observed for any of the four antioxidant biomarkers evaluated in the sera ( > 0.05). However, significant differences were observed in serum citrulline and IFN-ɤ, as well as in cloacal IgA, in broiler chickens fed with rye, suggesting their potential use as biomarkers to study intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280541>[Significance of intestinal fatty  binding protein in evaluation of intestinal  dysfunction of mice at early stage of severe burn injury].</a></h1><p> To investigate the significance of intestinal fatty  binding protein (IFABP) in the evaluation of intestinal  dysfunction of mice at the early stage of severe burn injury.  Thirty-six 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were collected and divided into normal control group (=6) and scald group (=30) according to random number table. Back of each mouse in scald group was placed into hot water of 90 ℃ for 10 s, causing full-thickness scald (hereinafter refer to as burn) of 30% total body surface area, while mice in normal control group were not inflicted with burns. Six mice in normal control group were taken, and 6 mice in scald group at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post injury were taken respectively. The portal vein blood of each mouse was extracted and the plasma was separated to measure intestinal permeability with fluorescin isothiocyanate-dextran fluorescence probe tracing method and plasma IFABP content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The distal ileum tissue of mice in normal control group and scald group at each time point post injury was collected to observe the morphology of the intestinal mucosa tissue by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Data were processed with one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls test, and pearson correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between intestinal permeability and plasma IFABP content of burned mice.  (1) At 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post injury, the intestinal permeability of mice in scald group was 2.7±0.8, 5.4±2.5, 7.3±4.2, 12.4±6.1, 1.4±0.7, respectively, obviously higher than 1.0±0.4 of normal control group (<0.05 or <0.01). The intestinal permeability of mice in scald group showed an increasing trend post injury, reaching the peak at 12 h post injury, and rapidly falling back at 24 h post injury. (2) At 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post injury, the plasma IFABP content of mice in scald group was (64±11), (59±12), (76±18), (111±22), and (66±10) ng/mL, obviously higher than (35±8) ng/mL in normal control group (<0.05 or <0.01). The plasma IFABP content of mice in scald group showed an increasing trend post injury, reaching the peak at 12 h post injury, and rapidly decreasing at 24 h post injury. (3) Uniform thickness of mucosa, intact epithelia, regularly arranged villi, and no inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in ileum of mice in normal control group. In ileum of mice in scald group, shortened villi of mucosa with different degrees, edema of lamina propria, and infiltration of neutrophils were observed at 1 and 2 h post injury; obviously damaged and partially exfoliated ileal mucosa, disorderly arranged and broken villi, degenerated and necrotic epithelial cells, dilated central lacteal, and infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils were observed at 6 and 12 h post injury; the damage of ileal mucosa was alleviated, and basically intact epithelia, dilated central lacteal, and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed at 24 h post injury. (4) There was a significantly positive correlation between the intestinal permeability and the plasma IFABP content of burned mice (=0.841, <0.05).  The plasma IFABP can be used as a good biological indicator for the evaluation of intestinal  dysfunction of mice at the early stage of severe burn injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485104>Effects of Early Enteral Glutamine Supplementation on Intestinal Permeability in Critically Ill Patients.</a></h1><p>Enteral administration of glutamine has been proposed as an effective recovery of intestinal  . This amino  has a modulating effect on the reducing bacterial translocation, which can influence immune functions of the intestine. The objective was to evaluate the effects of early enteral glutamine supplementation on intestinal permeability in critically ill patients.A total of 80 critically ill patients older than 18 years were randomly assigned to one of two groups according to the stratified blocked randomization by age and admission category. Consecutive participants took enteral formula plus 0.3 g/kg/day glutamine powder or enteral formula plus maltodextrin during the ICU stay for a maximum of 10 days. Plasma glutamine, endotoxin, zonulin, and antiendotoxin immunoglobulin (Ig)G/IgM concentrations were measured on days 5 and 10 of intervention.Out of 80 participants, 36 patients in the glutamine group and 34 patients in the control group were included in the analysis of the outcomes. Enteral glutamine significantly reduced plasma zonulin concentration up to 40% during 10 days. This reduction was significantly greater compared with that of the placebo group (<0.001). Endotoxin concentration decreased in both groups; this reduction was significantly greater in the glutamine group ( = 0.014). The antiendotoxin IgM and IgG antibody levels increased in the glutamine group but decreased in the control group ( <0.001).

Since it crosses placental  it can induce warfarin embryopathy (WE), a fetal mortality in neonates characterized by skeletal deformities in addition to brain hemorrhages. Although the effects of warfarin exposure in aquatic off target species were already described, the particular molecular toxicological mechanisms during early development are still unclear. Here, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio) to describe and compare the developmental effects of warfarin exposure (0, 15.13, 75.68 and 378.43 mM) on two distinct early developmental phases (embryos and eleuthero-embryos). Although exposure to both developmental phases induced fish mortality, only embryos exposed to the highest warfarin level exhibited features mimicking mammalian WE, e.g. high mortality, higher incidence of hemorrhages and altered skeletal development, among other effects. To gain insights into the toxic mechanisms underlying warfarin exposure, the transcriptome of embryos exposed to warfarin was explored through RNA-Seq and compared to that of control embryos. 766 differentially expressed (564 up- and 202 down-regulated) genes were identified. Gene Ontology analysis revealed particular cellular components (cytoplasm, extracellular matrix, lysosome and vacuole), biological processes (mainly amino  and lipid metabolism and response to stimulus) and pathways (oxidative stress response and apoptosis signaling pathways) being significantly overrepresented in zebrafish embryos upon warfarin exposure. Protein-protein interaction further evidenced an altered redox system, blood coagulation and vasculogenesis, visual phototransduction and collagen formation upon warfarin exposure. The present study not only describes for the first time the WE in zebrafish, it provides new insights for a better risk assessment, and highlights the need for programming the rat eradication actions outside the fish spawning season to avoid an impact on off target fish community. The urge for the development of more species-specific anticoagulants for rodent pest control is also highlighted.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated the effect of the administration of FMT from highly feed efficient donors early in life on the jejunal and cecal microbiota, visceral organ size, intestinal morphology, permeability, and expression of genes for nutrient transporters,   and innate immune response in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; a metric for FE). Chicks ( = 110) were inoculated with the FMT or control transplant (CT) on 1, 6, and 9 days posthatch (dph), from which 56 chickens were selected on 30 dph as the extremes in RFI, resulting in 15 low and 13 high RFI chickens receiving the FMT and 14 low and 14 high RFI chickens receiving the CT. RFI rank and FMT only caused tendencies for alterations in the jejunal microbiota and only one unclassified  genus in cecal digesta was indicative of high RFI. By contrast, the FMT caused clear differences in the short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile in the crop and cecal microbiota composition compared to the CT, which indicated alterations in amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria such as , , and . Moreover, the FMT caused alterations in intestinal development as indicated by the longer duodenum and shallower crypts in the ceca. From the observed RFI-associated variation, energy-saving mechanisms and moderation of the mucosal immune response were indicated by higher jejunal permeability, shorter villi in the ileum, and enhanced cecal expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine  in low RFI chickens. Relationships obtained from supervised multigroup data integration support that certain bacteria, including , and unclassified -phylotypes, and SCFA in jejunal and cecal digesta modulated expression levels of cytokines, tight-junction protein  and nutrient transporters for glucose and SCFA uptake. In conclusion, results suggest that the intestine only played a moderate role for the RFI-associated variation of the present low and high RFI phenotypes, whereas modulating the early microbial colonization resulted in long-lasting changes in bacterial taxonomic and metabolite composition as well as in host intestinal development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584346>Dietary intake of tryptophan tied emotion-related impulsivity in humans.</a></h1><p>Emotion-related impulsivity, defined as the tendency to say or do things that one later regret during periods of heightened emotion, has been tied to a broad range of psychopathologies. Previous work has suggested that emotion-related impulsivity is tied to an impaired  of the serotonergic system. Central serotonin synthesis relies on the intake of the essential amino , tryptophan and its ability to pass through the blood brain .  The aim of this study was to determine the association between emotion-related impulsivity and tryptophan intake.  Undergraduate participants (N = 25, 16 women, 9 men) completed a self-rated measure of impulsivity (Three Factor Impulsivity Index, TFI) and daily logs of their food intake and exercise. These data were coded using the software NutriNote to evaluate intakes of tryptophan, large neutral amino , vitamins B6/B12, and exercise.  Correlational analyses indicated that higher tryptophan intake was associated with significantly lower scores on two out of three subscales of the TFI, Pervasive Influence of Feelings scores  =  < . and (lack-of) Follow-Through scores,  =  < . Findings provide further evidence that emotion-related impulsivity is correlated to serotonergic indices, even when considering only food habits. It also suggests the need for more research on whether tryptophan supplements might be beneficial for impulsive persons suffering from a psychological disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562628>Systematic Understanding of Bioactive Lipids in Neuro-Immune Interactions: Lessons from an Animal Model of Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h1><p>Bioactive lipids, or lipid mediators, are utilized for intercellular communications. They are rapidly produced in response to various stimuli and exported to extracellular spaces followed by binding to cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or nuclear receptors. Many drugs targeting lipid signaling such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), prostaglandins, and antagonists for lipid GPCRs are in use. For example, the sphingolipid analog, fingolimod (also known as FTY720), was the first oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), whose mechanisms of action (MOA) includes sequestration of pathogenic lymphocytes into secondary lymphoid organs, as well as astrocytic modulation, via down-regulation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor, S1P, by in vivo-phosphorylated fingolimod. Though the cause of MS is still under debate, MS is considered to be an autoimmune demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease. This review summarizes the involvement of bioactive lipids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factors, lysophosphatidic , and S1P) in MS and the animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Genetic ablation, along with pharmacological inhibition, of lipid metabolic enzymes and lipid GPCRs revealed that each bioactive lipid has a unique role in regulating immune and neural functions, including helper T cell (T1 and T17) differentiation and proliferation, immune cell migration, astrocyte responses, endothelium , and microglial phagocytosis. A systematic understanding of bioactive lipids in MS and EAE dredges up information about understudied lipid signaling pathways, which should be clarified in the near future to better understand MS pathology and to develop novel DMTs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446576>Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction () Combined with Lactobacillus Acidophilus Improves Gastrointestinal  of Traumatic Brain-Injured Model Mice.</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects of Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction (DCQD, ) combined with Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) on the recovery of gastrointestinal (GI)  in traumatic brain-injured (TBI) mice.A total of 150 male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into sham-injury, normal saline (NS), DCQD (0.4 mL/day), LA (⩾1 × 10 cfu/day LA), DCQD+LA (LA administration at the same dosage after 4 h of feeding DCQD), and ½ DCQD+LA groups (LA administration at the same dosage after 4 h of feeding ½ DCQD dose) by a random number table, 5-8 mice in each group. The sever TBI model was constructed according to Feeney's enhanced gravitational forces of free falling. On days 1, 3, and 7 post-TBI, plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic  levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Occludin expression in the intestinal epithelium was assessed by Western blot analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphological changes in the network structure of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and change of enteric nervous system-ICC-smooth muscle cell (ENS-ICC-SMC). Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect changes in the network structure of the ICC.Compared with the NS group, occludin expression in the DCQD+LA group significantly increased on Day 1, 3, and 7 post-TBI (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

Plasma fatty  were determined as an indicator of nutritional differences. 310 infants from different age groups, i.e., 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 months were included. Approximately half of each age group was well-nourished (WHO reference values weight-for-height/length Zscore: -0.75 ≤ Z ≤ 0.75) and the other half was moderately undernourished (-3 ≤ Z < -2).Structural maturational differences in the deeper dermis and subcutis regions of the skin and subtle functional changes in the epidermis were observed in moderately undernourished infants without notable clinical symptoms. Reduced skin   or skin hydration were not observed in the undernourished infants, and skin pH shifted to more acidic values in this group.These findings reveal a greater impact of moderate undernutrition on the development of the dermis and subcutis and suggest that critical epidermal functions such as skin  and pH are mostly maintained.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Here, we report on a bile duct-on-a-chip that phenocopies not only the tubular architecture of the bile duct in three dimensions, but also its  functions.We showed that mouse cholangiocytes in the channel of the device became polarized and formed mature tight junctions, that the permeability of the cholangiocyte monolayer was comparable to ex vivo measurements, and that cholangiocytes in the device were mechanosensitive (as demonstrated by changes in calcium flux under applied luminal flow). Permeability decreased significantly when cells formed a compact monolayer with cell densities comparable to those observed in vivo. This device enabled independent access to the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cholangiocyte channel, allowing proof-of-concept toxicity studies with the biliary toxin, biliatresone, and the bile , glycochenodeoxycholic . The cholangiocyte basolateral side was more vulnerable than the apical side to treatment with either agent, suggesting a protective adaptation of the apical surface that is normally exposed to bile. Further studies revealed a protective role of the cholangiocyte apical glycocalyx, wherein disruption of the glycocalyx with neuraminidase increased the permeability of the cholangiocyte monolayer after treatment with glycochenodeoxycholic .This bile duct-on-a-chip captured essential features of a simplified bile duct in structure and organ-level functions and represents an in vitro platform to study the pathophysiology of the bile duct using cholangiocytes from a variety of sources.© 2019 The Authors.

One of these barriers is the poor activity of avian IAV polymerases in human cells. Differences between avian and mammalian ANP32 proteins underlie this host range . Human ANP32A and ANP32B homologues both support  of human-adapted influenza polymerase but do not support efficient activity of avian IAV polymerase which requires avian ANP32A. We show here that the gene currently designated as avian ANP32B is evolutionarily distinct from mammalian ANP32B, and that chicken ANP32B does not support IAV polymerase activity even of human-adapted viruses. Consequently, IAV relies solely on chicken ANP32A to support its replication in chicken cells. Amino  129I and 130N, accounted for the inactivity of chicken ANP32B. Transfer of these residues to chicken ANP32A abolished support of IAV polymerase. Understanding ANP32  will help develop antiviral strategies and aid the design of influenza virus resilient genome edited chickens.© 2019, Long et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461095>Lactobacillus acidophilus alleviates type 2 diabetes by regulating hepatic glucose, lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in mice.</a></h1><p>Diabetes, an endocrine and metabolic disorder, has become the third most non-infectious chronic disease that threatens human health. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic  bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of probiotics has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial  , which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty  synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase B (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut microbiota, increasing short chain fatty -producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 treatment restored the structure of gut microbiota similar to the control group. These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 might be used as a new type of antidiabetic drug candidate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682474>Cdc42 is involved in NC1 peptide-regulated BTB dynamics through actin and microtubule cytoskeletal reorganization.</a></h1><p>Noncollagenous domain 1 (NC1)-peptide is a biologically active peptide derived from the C-terminal region of collagen α3(IV) chain, a structural constituent protein at the basement membrane in the rat testis, likely  proteolytic cleavage of matrix metalloproteinase 9. Studies have shown that this NC1 peptide regulates testis  by inducing Sertoli cell blood-testis  (BTB) remodeling and is also capable of inducing elongate spermatid exfoliation through its disruptive effects on the organization of actin- and microtubule (MT)-based cytoskeletons at these cell adhesion sites. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. NC1 peptide was found to exert its biologic effects through an activation of small GTPase cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42) because cooverexpression of the dominant negative mutant of Cdc42 [namely, Cdc42-T17N ( a single mutation of amino  residue 17 from the N terminus from Thr to Asn by site-directed mutagenesis, making it constitutively inactive)] and NC1 peptide was able to block the NC1 peptide-induced Sertoli cell tight junction-permeability  disruption. Their cooverexpression also blocked the NC1 peptide-induced misdistribution of BTB-associated proteins at the cell-cell interface and also disruptive cytoskeletal organization of F-actin and MTs through changes in spatial expression of the corresponding actin and MT regulatory proteins. Interestingly, NC1 peptide was also found to induce an up-regulation of phosphorylated (p)-ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) (namely, p-rpS6-S235/S236) and a concomitant down-regulation of p-Akt1/2 (namely, p-Akt1-S473 and p-Akt2-S474), but these changes could not be blocked by overexpression of Cdc42-T17N. More importantly, NC1 peptide-induced Cdc42 activation was effectively blocked by treatment of Sertoli cell epithelium with a p-Akt1/2 activator SC79, which is also capable of blocking NC1 peptide-induced down-regulation of p-Akt1-S473 and p-Akt2/S474, but not p-rpS6-S235/S236 up-regulation. In summary, these findings illustrate that Cdc42 is working downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/rpS6/Akt1/2 signaling pathway to support NC1 peptide-mediated effects on Sertoli cell  in the testis using the rat as an animal model.-Su, W., Cheng, C. Y.

This study presents the by-products (bracts, exterior leaves, and stalks) of the "Blanca de Tudela" artichoke variety as a potential source of phenolic compounds with promising antioxidant properties. Artichoke residues were subjected to different extraction processes, and the antioxidant capacity and phenolic composition of the extracts were analyzed by spectrophotometric methods and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, respectively. The most abundant polyphenols in artichoke waste were chlorogenic , luteolin-7--rutinoside, and luteolin-7--glucoside. Minor quantities of cynarin, luteolin, apigenin-7--glucoside, apigenin-7--rutinoside, and naringenin-7--glucoside were also found. The antioxidant activity of the obtained extracts determined by ABTS [2, 2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic )], DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-pycrilhydracyl), and FRAP (Ferric Ion Reducing Antioxidant Power) was highly correlated with the total concentration of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic , luteolin-7--glucoside, and luteolin-7--rutinoside, the most abundant compounds in 60% methanol extracts, are the components most responsible for the antioxidant activity of the artichoke waste extracts. The extract with the best antioxidant capacity was selected to assay its antioxidant potential on a model intestinal . This action of the hydroxycinnamic  on intestinal cells (Caco-2) was confirmed. In summary, artichoke waste may be considered a very interesting ingredient for food functionalization and for therapeutic purposes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547425>d-amino  in Health and Disease: A Focus on Cancer.</a></h1><p>d-amino , the enantiomeric counterparts of l-amino , were long considered to be non-functional or not even present in living organisms. Nowadays, d-amino  are acknowledged to play important roles in numerous physiological processes in the human body. The most commonly studied link between d-amino  and human  concerns the contribution of d-serine and d-aspartate to neurotransmission. These d-amino  and several others have also been implicated in regulating innate immunity and gut  . Importantly, the presence of certain d-amino  in the human body has been linked to several diseases including schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and age-related disorders such as cataract and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, increasing evidence supports a role for d-amino  in the development, pathophysiology, and treatment of cancer.

The effects of almond on the skin's lipid  and the appearance of wrinkles have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of almond consumption on facial sebum production and wrinkles.This was a prospective, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial in which subjects consumed 20% of their daily energy consumption in either almonds or a calorie-matched snack for 16 weeks. This study was completed at the UC Davis Dermatology clinic. Participants were a volunteer sample of generally healthy postmenopausal females with Fitzpatrick skin types 1 and 2. A facial photograph and image analysis system was used to obtain standardized photographs and information on wrinkle width and severity at 0, 8, and 16 weeks. Measurements of transepidermal water loss and sebum production were also completed at 0, 8, and 16 weeks.Fifty healthy postmenopausal females were recruited, 31 participants were enrolled, and 28 completed the study. Under photographic analysis, the almond group had significantly decreased wrinkle severity and width compared with the control group at 16 weeks (p < .02). Changes in skin   were nonsignificant, measured by the transepidermal water loss (p = .65) between the almond and control groups relative to baseline after 16 weeks. No adverse effects were reported.Our study demonstrates that daily almond consumption may reduce wrinkle severity in postmenopausal females to potentially have natural antiaging benefits.© 2019 The Authors.

HPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS/MS) analyses of individual phenolic compounds revealed that the petal and stamen contained higher levels of flavonoid glycosides than other organs ( < 0.05). Kaempferol-3,7-di--glucoside was the dominant flavonoid in these two organs, however, the calyx and ovary contained higher contents of gallic  derivatives than other organs ( < 0.05). Hexa--galloyl-glucose was the dominant species in the calyx and ovary. At the same concentration of total phenolic extract (TPE), the stamen had the highest protection effect on Caco-2 cell oxidative damage induced by HO. The antioxidant effect was attributed to potent antioxidant capability; restored redox state due to the increased expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); and improved   of Caco-2 cell owing to increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), CLDN3 (Claudin 3), and occludin mRNA expression.

In the intestine, VA are known to promote mucosal homeostasis and immunity. However, the effect of VA in intestinal development has not been well elucidated. In the present study, we generated human intestine organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and investigated the effect of the VA active metabolite all-trans retinoic  (RA), on differentiation into intestinal organoids. As a result, RA increased the gene expression of a drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, as a functional molecule of intestinal mature development, in iPSC-derived intestinal organoids. In addition, RA increased transepithelial electrical resistance, an indicator of epithelial integrity, and decreased the permeability of monolayers to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran in intestinal epithelial monolayers. Finally, RA increased the expression of ZO-1, a marker of tight junctions, which are essential for intestinal epithelial  . Taken together, these results indicate that RA promotes  functions of iPSC-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers by increasing ZO-1 expression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It is typically described in critically ill patients with multiple medical conditions, arising from a combination of ischemic insult to the esophageal mucosa due to low-flow vascular states, corrosive injury caused by reflux of  and pepsin, and decreased  of the mucosal  systems and reparative mechanisms as occurs in malnourished and debilitated physical states. Patients with AEN tend to be older men, as medical comorbidities including vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, renal insufficiency, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, stroke, and cirrhosis may be more common. Typically, patients present with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematemesis or melena is seen in up to 90% of cases. Herein we present 3 cases of AEN in critically ill patients.

The present study determined if gut microbial signatures could transfer cardiovascular risk phenotypes between lean and obese mice using cecal microbiota transplantation (CMT). Pooled cecal contents collected from obese leptin-deficient (Ob) mice or C57Bl/6j control (Con) mice were transplanted by oral gavage into cohorts of recipient Ob and Con mice maintained on identical low-fat diets for 8 weeks (n=9-11/group). Cardiovascular pathology was assessed as the degree of arterial stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity) and myocardial infarct size following a 45/120 min  global cardiac ischemia/reperfusion protocol. Gut microbiota was characterized by 16s rDNA sequencing, along with measures of intestinal   and cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) composition. Following CMT, the gut microbiota of recipient mice was altered to resemble that of the donors. Ob CMT to Con mice increased arterial stiffness, left ventricular (LV) mass and myocardial infarct size, which was associated with greater gut permeability and reduced cecal SCFA concentrations. Conversely, Con CMT to Ob mice increased cecal SCFA, reduced LV mass and attenuated myocardial infarct size, with no effects on gut permeability or arterial stiffness. Collectively, these data demonstrate that obesity-related changes in the gut microbiota, independent of dietary manipulation, regulate hallmark measures of cardiovascular pathology in mice, and highlight the potential of microbiota-targeted therapeutics for reducing cardiovascular pathology and risk in obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520508>Construction and applications of a B vitamin genetic resource for investigation of vitamin-dependent metabolism in maize.</a></h1><p>The B vitamins provide essential co-factors for central metabolism in all organisms. In plants, B vitamins have surprising emerging roles in development, stress tolerance and pathogen resistance. Hence, there is a paramount interest in understanding the regulation of vitamin biosynthesis as well as the consequences of vitamin deficiency in crop species. To facilitate genetic analysis of B vitamin biosynthesis and functions in maize, we have mined the UniformMu transposon resource to identify insertional mutations in vitamin pathway genes. A screen of 190 insertion lines for seed and seedling phenotypes identified mutations in biotin, pyridoxine and niacin biosynthetic pathways. Importantly, isolation of independent insertion alleles enabled genetic confirmation of genotype-to-phenotype associations. Because B vitamins are essential for survival, null mutations often have embryo lethal phenotypes that prevent elucidation of subtle, but physiologically important, metabolic consequences of sub-optimal (functional) vitamin status. To circumvent this , we demonstrate a strategy for refined genetic manipulation of vitamin status based on construction of heterozygotes that combine strong and hypomorphic mutant alleles. Dosage analysis of pdx2 alleles in endosperm revealed that endosperm supplies pyridoxine to the developing embryo. Similarly, a hypomorphic bio1 allele enabled analysis of transcriptome and metabolome responses to incipient biotin deficiency in seedling leaves. We show that systemic pipecolic  accumulation is an early metabolic response to sub-optimal biotin status highlighting an intriguing connection between biotin, lysine metabolism and systemic disease resistance signaling.

While the lipoxygenase catalytic domains are structurally and functionally similar, these fungal enzymes are decorated with N-linked glycans. The impact of N-linked glycans on the structure and  of these enzymes remains largely unknown. One exemplary system is MoLOX, a lipoxygenase from the fungus , that is emerging as an important target for the devastating rice blast disease. Herein, we demonstrate that hydrogen transfer, associated with C-H cleavage of the substrate linoleic  by MoLOX, is rate-determining and occurs by a hydrogen tunneling mechanism. Using the differential enthalpic  for hydrogen and deuterium transfer, Δ, as a kinetic reporter of tunneling efficiency, a disproportionate increase in the activation energy for deuterium transfer is observed upon treatment of MoLOX with a peptide:-glycosidase that cleaves N-linked carbohydrates from the protein. This increased Δ is consistent with an impairment of substrate positioning in the enzyme-substrate complex for both the tunneling ready state and the ground state. These results provide new insight into the functional consequences of N-linked glycosylation on lipoxygenase C-H activation and have important implications for MoLOX inhibitor design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329991>Effect of dietary graded resistant potato starch levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, and intestinal health in meat ducks.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary graded raw potato starch (RPS) levels on growth performance, plasma cytokines concentration, ileal  , and cecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentration in meat ducks from 1 to 35 D of age. This study included 2 experiments. In experiment (Exp.) 1, sixteen 35-day-old meat ducks were used to evaluate the AME of RPS by orogastric administration. Results showed the AME value of RPS on ducks is 2.76 kcal/g. In Exp. 2, a total of 600 one-day-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 5 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments that included 0 (control), 6, 12, 18, and 24% RPS, respectively. Samples were collected at both of 14 and 35 D. Neither growth performance nor ileal parameters (length, weight, and pH) at both of 14 and 35 D was affected by dietary RPS. However, the mucosal thickness (14 D), villus height (except for 18% RPS at 14 D), and the villus height: crypt depth ratio (14 and 35 D) of the ileum were increased in the 12 and 18% RPS diets when compared to 0% RPS diet. Meanwhile, proinflammatory factors such as plasma interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 (14 D) reduced in 12% RPS diet and tumor necrosis factor α decreased in 12% (except for 14 D) and 18% RPS groups. When compared with the control group, diets with 18% RPS significantly increased mucin 2 gene expression at 14 D, and 12% RPS elevated the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins including Zonula occludens-1 and Claudin 1 (except for 14 D) in the ileal mucosa of birds. Furthermore, ducks fed 12% RPS diet had higher concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in cecal digesta than other groups. These findings indicated that diets with 12 and/or 18% RPS increased the cecal SCFA concentration, which subsequently enhanced the   and improved intestinal health in the ileum for 14 and 35-day-old meat ducks.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400786>Age- and diet-specific effects of chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos on hormones, inflammation and gut microbiota in rats.</a></h1><p>Chlorpyrifos is a pesticide frequently detected in food and has been reported to disturb endocrine and gut health, which was regulated by gut microbiota and enteroendocrine cells. In this study, newly weaned (3 week) and adult (8 week) male rats fed a normal- or high- fat diet were chronically exposed to 0.3 mg chlorpyrifos/kg bodyweight/day. The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood. Furthermore, a decrease in epinephrine induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, regardless of their diet. Chlorpyrifos-induced disturbances in the microbiome community structure were more apparent in rats fed a high-fat diet and exposed beginning at newly weaned. The affected bacteria included short-chain fatty -producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, norank_f_Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibaculum, Parasutterella and norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae), testosterone-related genus (Turicibacter, Brevibacterium), pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus), and inflammation-related bacteria (unclassified_f__Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, Parasutterella, Oscillibacter), which regulated the endocrine system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as the immune response and gut . Early exposure accelerated the endocrine-disturbing effect and immune responses of chlorpyrifos, although these effects can be eased or recovered by a high-fat diet.

The present study demonstrated for the first time that dietary supplementation with a galactooligosaccharide (GOS) promotes fecal Pb excretion and reduces Pb accumulation in the blood and tissues of mice. The effects against Pb exposure were also observed in mice that received the fecal microbiota from donors treated with GOS, but were diminished in gut microbiota-depleted mice that received antibiotic pre-treatment, indicating that the protection by GOS administration was dependent on the modulation of the gut microbiota. We also provide evidence that the protective mechanism of GOS supplementation was related to the enhanced abundance of intestinal bacteria with good Pb-binding ability, recovery of the gut  , modulation of bile  metabolism, and improved essential metal utilization. These results indicate that GOS can be considered a potentially protective prebiotic against Pb toxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634869>The Effect of Lauric  on Pathogens Colonizing the Burn Wound: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Some of the most serious complications of burns include septic infections. Instead of fulfilling the  of a protective , tissues damaged by high temperature create a niche that serves as an environment and source of nourishment for pathogens. An accepted practice is to use antibiotics to inhibit development of pathogens. Taking into consideration the characteristics of the burn wound and increasing antibiotic resistance, the search for new substances that have both antimicrobial and regenerative effects seems justified. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of lauric  on bacteria-colonizing tissue samples taken during surgical treatment of burns.Lauric  was combined with 5 different ointment bases: Anhydrous Eucerin DAB, Anhydrous Eucerin II, Hydrophilic Vaseline, White Vaseline, and Lekobaza. The content of lauric  in the ointment bases was 10% to 20% w/w. The preparations were applied onto samples of burnt skin collected during surgery. The samples were subsequently subjected to a microbiological test with the use of model strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.With one exception (White Vaseline), lauric  showed a more pronounced effect on bacteria in 20% w/w concentration. In a 10% lauric  concentration, no effect on bacteria was observed on the Hydrophilic Vaseline ointment base. Lauric  had the strongest inhibiting effect on microbial growth of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Satisfactory zones of inhibition were also observed in the case of Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed only when pure lauric  was used.Due to its aseptic and regenerative effect on chemically damaged tissues, lauric  can be a promising modifier of the burn healing process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202650>Effect of fermented milk from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris strain JFR1 on Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>The process of fermentation contributes to the organoleptic properties, preservation, and nutritional benefits of food. Fermented food may interfere with pathogen infections through a variety of mechanisms, including competitive exclusion or improving intestinal  integrity. In this study, the effect of milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 on Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cell cultures was investigated. Epithelial cells (HT29-MTX, Caco-2, and cocultures of the 2) were treated for 1 h with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 fermented milk before infection with Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica Typhimurium. Treatment with fermented milk resulted in increased transepithelial electrical resistance, which remained constant for the duration of infection (up to 3 h), illustrating a protective effect. After gentamicin treatment to remove adhered bacterial cells, enumeration revealed a reduction in numbers of intracellular Salmonella. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR data indicated a downregulation of Salmonella virulence genes hilA, invA, and sopD after treatment with fermented milk. Fermented milk treatment of epithelial cells also exhibited an immunomodulatory effect reducing the production of proinflammatory IL-8. In contrast, chemically acidified milk (glucono delta-lactone) failed to show the same effect on monolayer integrity, Salmonella Typhimurium invasion, and gene expression as well as immune modulation. Furthermore, an oppA knockout mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium infecting treated epithelial cells did not show suppressed virulence gene expression. Collectively, these results suggest that milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR1 is effective in vitro in the reduction of Salmonella invasion into intestinal epithelial cells. A functional OppA permease in Salmonella is required to obtain the antivirulence effect of fermented milk.The Authors.

This review presents possible mechanisms by which metabolic disorders increase blood pressure (BP) and discusses the importance of the gut as a novel modulator of BP.Obesity and high salt intake are major risk factors for hypertension. There is a hypothesis of "salt-induced obesity"; i.e., high salt intake may tie to obesity. Heightened sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, especially in the kidney and brain, increases BP in obese patients. Adipokines, including adiponectin and leptin, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) contribute to hypertension. Adiponectin induced by a high-salt diet may decrease sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 expression in the kidney, which results in reducing BP. High salt can change secretions of adipokines and RAAS-related components. Evidence has been accumulating linking the gastrointestinal tract to BP. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and ghrelin decrease BP in both rodents and humans. The sweet taste receptor in enteroendocrine cells increases SGLT1 expression and stimulates sodium/glucose absorption. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass improves glycemic and BP control due to reducing the activity of SGLT1. Na/H exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) increases BP by stimulating the intestinal absorption of sodium. Gastrin functions as an intestinal sodium taste sensor and inhibits NHE3 activity. Intestinal mineralocorticoid receptors also regulate sodium absorption and BP due to changing ENaC activity. Gastric sensing of sodium induces natriuresis, and gastric distension increases BP. Changes in the composition and  of gut microbiota contribute to hypertension. A high-salt/fat diet may disrupt the gut , which results in systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased BP. Gut microbiota regulates BP by secreting vasoactive hormones and short-chain fatty . BP-lowering effects of probiotics and antibiotics have been reported. Bariatric surgery improves metabolic disorders and hypertension due to increasing GLP-1 secretion, decreasing leptin secretion and SNS activity, and changing gut microbiome composition. Strategies targeting the gastrointestinal system may be therapeutic options for improving metabolic abnormalities and reducing BP in humans.

Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) may modulate glycocalyx development.The effects of hMOs and NDCs on human gut epithelial cells (Caco2) are investigated by quantifying thickness and area coverage of adsorbed albumin, heparan sulfate (HS), and hyaluronic  (HA) in the glycocalyx. Effects of hMOs (2'-FL and 3-FL) and NDCs [inulins with degrees of polymerization (DP) (DP3-DP10, DP10-DP60, DP30-DP60) and pectins with degrees of methylation (DM) (DM7, DM55, DM69)] are tested using immunofluorescence staining at 1 and 5 days stimulation. HMOs show a significant enhancing effect on glycocalyx development but effects are structure-dependent. 3-FL induces a stronger albumin adsorption and increases HS and HA stronger than 2'-FL. The DP3-DP10, DP30-60 inulins also increase glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent manner as DP3-DP10 selectively increases HS, while DP30-DP60 specifically increases HA. Pectins have less effects, and only increase albumin adsorption.Here, it is shown that 2'-FL and 3-FL and inulins stimulate glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent fashion. This may contribute to formulation of effective hMO and NDC formulations in infant formulas to support microbial colonization and gut  .© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty  oleic  did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty  palmitic  accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a   of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Decision tools to balance benefits and risks of PPI therapy are largely missing. In this study, we tested gut-derived biomarkers to identify PPI-associated dysbiosis, its association with gut   and liver-related mortality. In this observational study, faecal microbiome composition data obtained from 16S rDNA sequencing of 90 cirrhotic patients with and without long-term PPI use and additional potential biomarkers identified from the literature were evaluated for their predictive value regarding PPI-associated dysbiosis and liver-related three-year mortality. In addition, faecal calprotectin, faecal zonulin and serum lipopolysaccharides were assessed as markers for intestinal inflammation, gut permeability and bacterial translocation. Streptococcus salivarius, Veillonella parvula and the genus Streptococcus were significantly increased in patients with long-term PPI therapy and performed well as biomarkers for PPI-associated dysbiosis (accuracy: 74%, 72% and 74%, respectively). The abundance of Streptococcus salivarius was linked to intestinal inflammation and gut  dysfunction, whereas the abundance of Veillonella parvula showed associations with liver disease severity; both were independent predictors for liver-related three-year mortality.

Dietary fiber is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and modulates the composition of the gut microbiota. New evidence indicates that dietary fiber also directly interacts with the epithelium and immune cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract by microbiota-independent effects. This review provides a focused overview of how dietary fiber improve human health and how these reported health benefits are connected to molecular pathways, in (1) a microbiota-independent manner, via interaction with specific surface receptors on epithelial and immune cells regulating intestinal  and immune , (2) a microbiota-dependent manner via maintaining intestinal homeostasis by promoting beneficial microbes, including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, limiting the growth, adhesion and cytotoxicity of pathogenic microbes, as well as stimulating fiber-derived microbial short-chain fatty  production.This article is protected by copyright.

We hypothesized that intestinal microbiota changes may mediate these effects, and this study aims to prove this hypothesis. Mice were fed a normal diet (ND, 0.86% methionine + 4% fat), a HF diet (HFD, 0.86% methionine + 20% fat), or a MRD (0.17% methionine + 20% fat) and euthanized at week 22. Our results showed that the HFD induced fat accumulation and gut microbiota dysbiosis; reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production; and increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. The MRD decreased the body weight, body fat rate, and blood glucose and plasma lipid levels; increased the abundance of putative SCFA-producing bacteria Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Ruminococcus and inflammation-inhibiting bacteria Oscillospira and Corynebacterium; and decreased the abundance of inflammation-producing bacteria Desulfovibrio in colonic contents. Moreover, the MRD improved intestinal  , inflammatory response, and oxidative stress, and altered the metabolite levels of colonic contents (such as increasing SCFA and bile  concentrations); the latter may have contributed to the prevention of HFD-induced obesity. In conclusion, the MRD can improve gut health by regulating the intestinal microbiota and its metabolite profiles in the HFD mice. Reducing methionine intake by simple dietary adjustment may be an effective method to improve intestinal health in animals and humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236687>Potential of Intestine-Selective FXR Modulation for Treatment of Metabolic Disease.</a></h1><p>Farnesoid X receptor controls bile  metabolism, both in the liver and intestine. This potent nuclear receptor not only maintains homeostasis of its own ligands, i.e., bile , but also regulates glucose and lipid metabolism as well as the immune system. These findings have led to substantial interest for FXR as a therapeutic target and to the recent approval of an FXR agonist for treating primary biliary cholangitis as well as ongoing clinical trials for other liver diseases. Given that FXR biology is complex, including moderate expression in tissues outside of the enterohepatic circulation, temporal expression of isoforms, posttranscriptional modifications, and the existence of several other bile -responsive receptors such as TGR5, clinical application of FXR modulators warrants thorough understanding of its actions. Recent findings have demonstrated remarkable physiological effects of targeting FXR specifically in the intestine (iFXR), thereby avoiding systemic release of modulators. These include local effects such as improvement of intestinal   and intestinal cholesterol turnover, as well as systemic effects such as improvements in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Intriguingly, metabolic improvements have been observed with both an iFXR agonist that leads to production of enteric Fgf15 and increased energy expenditure in adipose tissues and antagonists by reducing systemic ceramide levels and hepatic glucose production.

However, whether it contributes to I/R-induced blood-brain  (BBB) injury remains unclear. cilostazol exerts protective effects toward I/R-induced BBB injury, with unclear mechanisms. This study explored the potential role of ER stress in I/R-induced endothelial cell damage and determined whether the therapeutic potential of cilostazol, with respect to I/R-induced endothelial cell damage, is related to inhibition of ER stress. We found that exposing brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) significantly activated ER stress and diminished the   of cell monolayers; treatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric  (4-PBA) or cilostazol prevented OGD/R-induced ER stress and preserved  . Furthermore, OGD/R induced the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated NF-κB. These changes were partially reversed by 4-PBA or cilostazol treatment. , 4-PBA or cilostazol significantly attenuated I/R-induced ER stress and ameliorated Evans blue leakage and tight junction loss. These results demonstrate that I/R-induced ER stress participates in BBB disruption. Targeting ER stress could be a useful strategy to protect the BBB from ischemic stroke, and cilostazol is a promising therapeutic agent for this process.-Nan, D., Jin, H., Deng, J., Yu, W., Liu, R., Sun, W., Huang, Y.

SDR9C7 encodes a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7) recently found mutated in ichthyosis. In a patient with SDR9C7 mutation and a mouse Sdr9c7 knockout model we show loss of covalent binding of epidermal ceramides to protein, a structural fault in the . For reasons unresolved, protein binding requires lipoxygenase-catalyzed transformations of linoleic  (18:2) esterified in ω-O-acylceramides. In Sdr9c7-/- epidermis, quantitative LC-MS assays revealed almost complete loss of a species of ω-O-acylceramide esterified with linoleate-9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-ketone; other acylceramides related to the lipoxygenase pathway were in higher abundance. Recombinant SDR9C7 catalyzed NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of linoleate 9,10-trans-epoxy-11E-13-alcohol to the corresponding 13-ketone, while ichthyosis mutants were inactive. We propose, therefore, that the critical requirement for lipoxygenases and SDR9C7 is in producing acylceramide containing the 9,10-epoxy-11E-13-ketone, a reactive moiety known for its non-enzymatic coupling to protein. This suggests a mechanism for coupling of ceramide to protein and provides important insights into skin  formation and pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295716>Photodynamic therapy for skin cancer: How to enhance drug penetration?</a></h1><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induced by protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) has been widely used in dermatological practices such as treatment of skin cancers. Clearance rate depends on different factors such as light irradiation, skin oxygenation and drug penetration. The poor penetration of 5-aminolevulinic  (5-ALA) with topical application is limited and restrains the production of PpIX which could restrict PDT outcomes. This review will focus on techniques already used to enhance drug penetration in human skin, and will present their results, advantages, and drawbacks. Chemical and physical pretreatments will be discussed. Chemical pre-treatments comprise of drug formulation modification, use of agents that modify the heme cycle, enhance PpIX formation, and the combination of differentiation-promoting agent prior to PDT. On the other hand, physical pretreatments affect the skin  by creating holes in the skin or by removing stratum corneum. To promote drug penetration, iontophoresis and temperature modulation are interesting alternative methods. Cellular mechanisms enrolled during chemical or physical pretreatments have been investigated in order to understand how 5-ALA penetrates the skin, why it is preferentially metabolized in PpIX in tumour cells, and how it could be accumulated in deeper skin layers. The objective of this review is to compare clinical trials that use innovative technology to conventional PDT treatment. Most of these pretreatments present good or even better clinical outcomes than usual PDT.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

'Leaky gut' has been found in intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. However, functional evaluation of intestinal permeability is not widely used as a diagnostic marker, possibly owing to significant limitations of currently used permeability assays. There is an unmet need for development of a new, non-invasive test to assess intestinal . What is the main finding and its importance? We show that an increased blood-to-stool ratio of the concentration of gut bacteria-produced short-chain fatty  may be used as a marker of gut permeability. Our findings lay the groundwork for establishing a new, non-invasive, risk-free diagnostic tool in diseases associated with intestinal  malfunction, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are characterized by an impaired gut-blood  commonly referred to as 'leaky gut'. Therefore, functional evaluation of the gut-blood  is a promising diagnostic marker. We hypothesized that short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria might serve as a marker in IBD. Animal experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats with acetic -induced colitis and in sham control animals. The gut-blood  permeability was determined by assessing the ratios of the following: (i) portal blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); (ii) systemic blood concentration of SCFAs (C ) to faecal concentration of SCFAs (C ); and (iii) C and C of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran administered into the colon. As a clinical study, we evaluated C , C and the C /C ratio of SCFAs in six paediatric patients with IBD, assessed as mild/moderate/severe by the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) at the time of sample collection, and nine age-matched healthy control subjects. Rats with histologically confirmed IBD had significantly increased ratios of C /C and C /C for SCFAs. This was positively correlated with the plasma FITC-dextran concentration. Likewise, IBD patients showed a significantly higher C /C ratio for SCFAs, including acetic, valeric, isocaproic, caproic and propionic , in comparison to control subjects. In conclusion, in the rats and in paediatric patients with IBD we found an increased blood-to-stool ratio of SCFAs, suggesting an increased gut-to-blood penetration of SCFAs. These findings pave the way for a new, non-invasive diagnostic tool in IBD and other diseases accompanied by intestinal  malfunction.© 2019 The Authors.

FATP4 (SLC27A4) mutations cause ichthyosis prematurity syndrome, a nonlethal disorder. In contrast, Fatp4 mice die neonatally from a defective . Here we used electron microscopy and lipidomics to characterize defects in Fatp4 mice. Mutants showed lamellar body, corneocyte lipid envelope, and cornified envelope abnormalities. Lipidomics identified two lipids previously speculated to be present in mouse epidermis, sphingosine β-hydroxyceramide and monoacylglycerol; mutants displayed decreased proportions of these and the two ceramide classes that carry ultralong-chain, amide-linked fatty  (FAs) thought to be critical for  , unbound ω-O-acylceramide and bound ω-hydroxyceramide, the latter constituting the major component of the corneocyte lipid envelope. Other abnormalities included elevated amounts of sphingosine α-hydroxyceramide, phytosphingosine non-hydroxyceramide, and 1-O-acylceramide. Acyl chain length alterations in ceramides also suggested roles for FATP4 in esterifying saturated non-hydroxy and β-hydroxy FAs with at least 25 carbons and saturated or unsaturated ω-hydroxy FAs with at least 30 carbons to CoA.

These allergic conditions have been linked to environmental and lifestyle changes driving the dysfunction of three interdependent biological systems: microbiota, epithelial  and immune system. While this is multifactorial, dietary changes are of particular interest in the altered establishment and maturation of the microbiome, including the associated profile of metabolites that modulate immune development and  . Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially influence the health of the host by 1) acting as a fermentable substrate for some specific commensal host bacteria leading to the release of short-chain fatty  in the gut intestinal tract influencing many molecular and cellular processes; 2) acting directly on several compartments and specifically on different patterns of cells (epithelial and immune cells). Nutrients with prebiotic properties are therefore of central interest in allergy prevention for their potential to promote a more tolerogenic environment through these multiple pathways. Both observational studies and experimental models lend further credence to this hypothesis.

Autophagy of epithelial cells maintains homeostasis of the intestinal  by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-2. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of activity of sinensetin, a polymethylated flavonoid isolated from tangerine peel and citrus, on intestinal  dysfunction in colitis. Animal model of colitis were established by intracolonic administration of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  and oral treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. Epithelial   was evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-4 kD dextran in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco-2 cells, respectively. Epithelial cell autophagy assayed by autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy-related protein. Sinensetin reversed colitis-associated increase in intestinal permeability, significantly promoted epithelial cell autophagy, and further decreased epithelial cell apoptosis, and reduced mucosal claudin-2. Sinenstetin alleviated colitis symptoms rats and mice with colitis. Knockdown of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the promotion of epithelial autophagy by sinensetin.

The CP epithelium regulates the transport of ions and water between the blood and the ventricles, contributing to CSF production and composition. Several studies suggest a connection between the cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) and transepithelial ion movement. TRPV4 is a nonselective, calcium-permeable cation channel present in CP epithelia reported to be activated by cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Utilizing the PCP-R (porcine choroid plexus-Riems) cell line, we investigated the effects of various cytokines and inflammatory mediators on TRPV4-mediated activity. Select proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β1) had inhibitory effects on TRPV4-stimulated transepithelial ion flux and permeability changes, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, and IL-6) had none. Quantitative mRNA analysis showed that these cytokines had no effect on TRPV4 transcription levels. Inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB, involved in the production and regulation of several inflammatory cytokines, inhibited TRPV4-mediated activity, suggesting a link between TRPV4 and cytokine production. Contrary to published studies, the proinflammatory mediator arachidonic  (AA) had inhibitory rather than stimulatory effects on TRPV4-mediated responses. However, inhibition of AA metabolism also caused inhibitory effects on TRPV4, suggesting a complex interaction of AA and its metabolites in the regulation of TRPV4 activity. Together these data imply that TRPV4 activity is involved in the inflammatory response; it is negatively affected by proinflammatory mediators. Furthermore, arachidonic  metabolites, but not arachidonic  itself, are positive regulators of TRPV4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480143>Effects of compound organic  calcium on growth performance, hepatic antioxidation and intestinal  of male broilers under heat stress.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of compound organic  calcium (COAC) on growth performance, hepatic antioxidant status and intestinal  of male broilers under high ambient temperature (32.7 ℃).Nine hundred healthy one-d-old Cobb-500 male broiler chicks were randomly assigned into three groups with six replicates of 50 birds each.

After direct dilution using 5% HCl (v:v), a prepared blood sample was introduced into the DS-HG with a UV digestion unit, of which arsenic hydrides directly generated from sample under 5% HCl (v:v) and 5 g/L KBH in 1.5 g/L KOH. Herein, the newly designed DS-HG is capable of effectively eliminating foam generation deriving from protein in blood sample. Then, arsenic hydrides were trapped by 11 kV discharging at 110 mL/min air, and released by 13 kV at 180 mL/min H orderly. Under the optimized conditions, the linearity ranged from 0.05 to 50 ng/mL with a regression coefficient (R) = 0.996. The method detection limit (LOD) was 7 pg arsenic (0.14 ng/mL), and relative standard deviation (RSD) of 10 repeated measurements for a real blood sample was 4.2%, indicating a good precision. The spiked recoveries for real samples were in the range of 97%-102%. Furthermore, arsenic presence in real blood samples measured by the proposed method were consistent (P > 0.05) with the microwave digestion ICP-MS. The whole analytical time can be controlled within 8 min including sample dilution. As a matter of fact, it is a favorable progress for DBD technique to eliminate matrix interferences of real samples based on the gas phase enrichment (GPE) principle, with advantages such as excellent sensitivity, digestion-free, fast and simple operation. Thus, the recommended DS-HG-in-situ DBD-AFS are suitable to the fast analysis of ultratrace arsenic in blood samples to protect human's health.Copyright © 2019.

The disease is caused by mutations in the  gene coding for the lysosomal enzyme sulfamidase. Sulfamidase deficiency leads to accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS), which triggers aberrant cellular , inflammation and eventually cell death. There is currently no available treatment against MPS IIIA. In the present study, a chemically modified recombinant human sulfamidase (CM-rhSulfamidase) with disrupted glycans showed reduced glycan receptor mediated endocytosis, indicating a non-receptor mediated uptake in MPS IIIA patient fibroblasts. Intracellular enzymatic activity and stability was not affected by chemical modification. After intravenous (i.v.) administration in mice, CM-rhSulfamidase showed a prolonged exposure in plasma and distributed to the brain, present both in vascular profiles and in brain parenchyma. Repeated weekly i.v. administration resulted in a dose- and time-dependent reduction of HS in CNS compartments in a mouse model of MPS IIIA. The reduction in HS was paralleled by improvements in lysosomal pathology and neuroinflammation. Behavioral deficits in the MPS IIIA mouse model were apparent in the domains of exploratory behavior, neuromuscular , social- and learning abilities. CM-rhSulfamidase treatment improved activity in the open field test, endurance in the wire hanging test, sociability in the three-chamber test, whereas other test parameters trended towards improvements. The unique properties of CM-rhSulfamidase described here strongly support the normalization of clinical symptoms, and this candidate drug is therefore currently undergoing clinical studies evaluating safety and efficacy in patients with MPS IIIA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678325>Extracellular vesicles as an emerging tool for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a series of interacting pathophysiological cascades, including the aggregation of β-amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles derived from hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. AD is the cause of approximately 70% of dementia, an irreversible and untreatable syndrome at its late stage. Hence, more efforts should be devoted to identifying at-risk or preclinical AD populations for early intervention and the improved design of drug trials. The exosome, a nanoscale subtype of extracellular vesicle that serves as a cell-to-cell communication messenger, is an emerging liquid biopsy tool for various diseases including AD. Recently, it has been discovered that brain-derived exosomes can flow through the blood-brain  to the peripheral blood, containing important protein and nucleic  biomarkers that are associated with the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Other reports showed a strong involvement of exosomes in synaptic , insulin resistance, and neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we summarize those studies and assess the value of exosomes as an emerging tool for the early detection of AD in conjunction with the current clinical diagnosis paradigm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hyodeoxycholic  (HDCA) is a bioactive compound extracted from calculus bovis. When combined with cholic , baicalin and jas-minoidin, HDCA prevents hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced brain injury by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptotic signaling. However, the effects of HDCA in ischemic stroke injury have not yet been studied. Neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction occurs in ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of HDCA on the NVU under ischemic conditions in vitro. We co-cultured primary brain microvascular endothelial cells, neurons and astrocytes using a transwell chamber co-culture system. The NVU was pre-treated with 10.16 or 2.54 μg/mL HDCA for 24 hours before exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 1 hour. The cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect cell activity. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling were used to assess apoptosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Oxidative stress-related factors, such as superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde and γ-glutamyltransferase, were measured using kits. Pretreatment with HDCA significantly decreased blood-brain  permeability and neuronal apoptosis, significantly increased transendothelial electrical resistance and γ-glutamyltransferase activity, attenuated oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Our findings suggest that HDCA maintains NVU morphological integrity and  by modulating inflammation, oxidation stress, apoptosis, and the expression of neurotrophic factors. Therefore, HDCA may have therapeutic potential in the clinical management of ischemic stroke. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Experimental Animals of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (approval No. BUCM-3-2016040201-2003) in April 2016.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336054>Oral ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel normalizes fructose-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion in female rats.</a></h1><p>The present study investigated the effects of oral ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel (EEL) on hepatic lipid and glycogen contents during high fructose (HF) intake, and determined whether pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity were involved in HF and (or) EEL-induced hepatic dysmetabolism. Female Wistar rats weighing 140-160 g were divided into groups. The control, EEL, HF, and EEL+HF groups received water (vehicle, p.o.), 1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg levonorgestrel (p.o.), fructose (10% ), and EEL plus HF, respectively, on a daily basis for 8 weeks. Results revealed that treatment with EEL or HF led to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, increased hepatic uric  production and triglyceride content, reduced glycogen content, and reduced production of plasma or hepatic glutathione- and G6PD-dependent antioxidants. HF but not EEL also increased fasting glucose and hepatic PDK-4. Nonetheless, these alterations were attenuated by EEL in HF-treated rats. Our results demonstrate that hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion induced by HF is accompanied by increased PDK-4 and defective G6PD activity. The findings also suggest that EEL would attenuate hepatic lipid accumulation and glycogen depletion by suppression of PDK-4 and enhancement of a G6PD-dependent antioxidant .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614770>The Effects and Mechanisms of Cyanidin-3-Glucoside and Its Phenolic Metabolites in Maintaining Intestinal Integrity.</a></h1><p>Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a well-known natural anthocyanin and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

In the present study, we assessed the effects of oral glutamine (Gln) or branched-chain amino  (BCAA) supplementation during ABA to target intestinal functions, body composition and feeding behavior.C57BL/6 male mice were randomized in Control (CTRL) and ABA groups. After ABA induction, mice received, or not, either 1% Gln or 2.5% BCAA (Leu, Ile, Val) for one week in drinking water.Neither Gln nor BCAA supplementation affected body weight and body composition, while only Gln supplementation slightly increased food intake. ABA mice exhibited increased paracellular permeability and reduced protein synthesis in the colonic mucosa. Oral Gln restored colonic paracellular permeability and protein synthesis and increased the mucin-2 mRNA level, whereas BCAA did not affect colonic parameters.In conclusion, oral Gln specifically improves colonic response during ABA. These data should be further confirmed in AN patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540548>Pyrimidine Analogues as a New Class of Gram-Positive Antibiotics, Mainly Targeting Thymineless-Death Related Proteins.</a></h1><p>Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are widespread throughout the world and pose an increasingly serious threat to human and animal health. Besides implementing strict measures to prevent improper antibiotic use, it remains essential that novel antibiotics must be developed. These antibiotics need to exert their activity via mechanisms different from those employed by currently approved antibiotics. In this study, we used several 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) analogues as chemical probes and investigated the potential of these pyrimidine analogues as antibacterial agents. Several 5-FU derivatives exerted potent activity against strains of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) that are susceptible or resistant toward approved antibiotics, without showing cross-resistance. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that the pyrimidine analogues exerted anti-GPC activity via thymineless death by inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (ThyA) and/or inhibition of RNA synthesis. Interestingly, whole genome resequencing of in vitro-selected, pyrimidine analogue-resistant  mutants indicated that  strains with pyrimidine-analogue resistance induced an amino  (AA) substitution, deletion, and/or insertion into thymineless-death related proteins except for ThyA, or enhanced the ThyA transcription level. Thus,  may avoid altering the ThyA  by introducing an AA substitution, suggesting that the pyrimidine analogues, which directly bind to ThyA without phosphorylation, may be more effective and show a higher genetic  than the pyrimidines that depend on phosphorylation for activity. The findings of this study may assist in the future development of a novel class of antibiotics for combating MDR GPC, including methicillin-resistant  and vancomycin-resistant .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531158>Ceramide- and Keratolytic-containing Body Cleanser and Cream Application in Patients with Psoriasis: Outcomes from a Consumer Usage Study.</a></h1><p> Ceramides are epidermal lipids that play an essential role in stratum corneum , including maintaining physiologic permeability  properties. The role of ceramides in the maintenance and repair of epidermal   is believed to be valuable in the treatment of psoriasis. Normalization of corneocyte desquamation and the incorporation of agents that promote desquamation to reduce hyperkeratosis are also regarded as key factors in psoriasis management.  We sought to evaluate the benefits of two formulations (CeraVe® Body Cleanser [Cer-PSO-BCl] and CeraVe® Body Cream [Cer-PSO-Cr]), containing ceramides, salicylic , and urea in patients with a history of psoriasis, including those with mild-to-moderate psoriatic flares.  This was a two-center customer usage study involving 33 male and female subjects, 18 years of age or older, with a history of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Cer-PSO-Cr was applied liberally wherever psoriasis was present twice a day for two weeks. Cer-PSO-BCl was recommended for use twice a week. Product attributes, performance of individual test products, and use of this combination regimen (favorable or unfavorable) were assessed using a self-assessment questionnaire at Week 2.  Overall, 72.7 and 75.8 percent of patients with psoriasis reported the Cer-PSO-Cr alone or Cer-PSOCr/Cer-PSO-BCl regimen improved the appearance of their skin. For the cleanser, 97.0 percent reported it rinsed clean with no unpleasant residue. For cream and cleanser together, 84.8 percent reported it provided relief of psoriasis, and 90.9 percent reported that their skin felt soft and smooth.  Based on results reported by the study patients, the evaluated ceramide/keratolytic-containing cream and cleanser both yielded a high level of patient acceptance regarding improvement in skin characteristics in patients with psoriasis, including when used as a combination adjunctive regimen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277430>The Lipid Status in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Sphingolipids are Disease-Dependent Regulated.</a></h1><p>The factors that contribute to the development of ulcerative colitis (UC), are still not fully identified. Disruption of the colon  is one of the first events leading to invasion of bacteria and activation of the immune system. The colon  is strongly influenced by sphingolipids. Sphingolipids impact cell-cell contacts and  as second messengers. We collected blood and colon tissue samples from UC patients and healthy controls and investigated the sphingolipids and other lipids by LC-MS/MS or LC-QTOFMS. The expression of enzymes of the sphingolipid pathway were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In inflamed colon tissue, the de novo-synthesis of sphingolipids is reduced, whereas lactosylceramides are increased. Reduction of dihydroceramides was due to posttranslational inhibition rather than altered serine palmitoyl transferase or ceramide synthase expression in inflamed colon tissue. Furthermore, in human plasma from UC-patients, several sphinglipids change significantly in comparison to healthy controls. Beside sphingolipids free fatty , lysophosphatidylcholines and triglycerides changed significantly in the blood of colitis patients dependent on the disease severity. Our data indicate that detraction of the sphingolipid de novo synthesis in colon tissue might be an important trigger for UC. Several lipids changed significantly in the blood, which might be used as biomarkers for disease control; however, diet-related variabilities need to be considered.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473343>Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides alleviate colon tumorigenesis via restoring intestinal   and enhancing anti-tumor immune response.</a></h1><p>Intact epithelial  and mucosal immune system are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Previous study indicated that Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides (DOPS) can regulate immune responses and inflammation to alleviate experimental colitis. However, it remains largely unknown whether DOPS can suppress AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model through its direct impact on intestinal   and intestinal mucosal immunity. Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic action of DOPS for CRC model and further illustrated its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) and DOPS significantly improved the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic colitis, relieve colon damage, suppress the formation and growth of colon tumor in CRC mice. Moreover, administration of DOPS effectively preserved the intestinal   via reducing the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in adjacent tissues and carcinomatous tissues. Further studies demonstrated that DOPS improved the metabolic ability of tumor infiltrated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reduced the expression of PD-1 on CTLs to enhance the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironments (TME). Together, the conclusions indicated that DOPS restore intestinal   and enhance intestinal anti-tumor immune response to suppress CRC, which may be a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have revealed that chlorogenic  (CGA) could improve the intestinal  integrity for weaned rats. Hence, this study sought to investigate the protective effects of CGA from pure reagent and sunflower seed extract (SSE) on growth performance, antioxidant indicators, inflammatory biomarkers and intestinal   in Cd treated rats. A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley female rats with similar weights were randomly allotted to four treatments: control, CdCl (6 mg/kg BW), co-treatment of Cd (6 mg/kg BW) and pure CGA (50 mg/kg BW), and co-treatment of Cd (6 mg/kg BW) and SSE (50 mg/kg BW) for 14 days. The data indicated that, CGA or SSE with Cd sequestration and good antioxidative ability decreased Cd absorption and accumulation in the jejunum and increased fecal Cd levels in Cd-exposed rats. Compared with the Cd group, co-treatment with CGA or SSE also alleviated inflammation, ameliorated the villus damage, reversed the disruption of tight junctions, and recovered weight gain of rats. These results suggest that CGA or SSE can protect the intestinal , which is related to the alleviation of Cd-induced oxidative stress and growth decrease.Copyright © 2019.
