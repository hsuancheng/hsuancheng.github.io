Among four  compounds, a dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in these cancer cells after treatment with gamabufotalin and arenobufagin. The IC50 values of the two compounds were 3-5 times higher in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than these values for both cancer cell lines. However, similar phenomena were not observed for two other  compounds, telocinobufagin and bufalin. These results thus suggest that gamabufotalin and arenobufagin possess selective cytotoxic activity against tumor cells rather than normal cells. Moreover, a clear dose-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, a well-known hallmark of necrosis, was observed in both cancer cells treated with gamabufotalin, suggesting that gamabufotalin-mediated cell death is predominantly associated with a necrosis-like phenotype. Of most importance, treatment with as little as 8 ng/ml of gamabufotalin, even an almost non-toxic concentration to PBMCs, efficiently downregulated the percentages of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulator T (Treg) cells in mitogen-activated PBMCs. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in tumor immunotolerance by suppressing antitumor , these results suggest that gamabufotalin may serve as a promising candidate, as an adjuvant therapeutic agent by manipulating Treg cells to enhance the efficacy of conventional anticancer drugs and lessen their side-effects. These findings provide insights into the clinical application of gamabufotalin for cancer patients with glioblastoma/pancreatic cancer based on its cytocidal effect against tumor cells as well as its depletion of Treg cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150435>Bufalin Enhances Immune Responses in Leukemic Mice Through Enhancing Phagocytosis of Macrophage .</a></h2><p>Bufalin,  present in Chan Su, has been shown to induce cancer cell apoptosis in many human cancer cells, including human leukemia cells, but its effects on immune responses are unknown.This study investigated whether bufalin affected immune responses of mice with WEHI-3 cell-generated leukemia in vivo. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with WEHI-3 cells to develop leukemia and then were treated with oral treatment with bufalin at different doses (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At the end of treatment, all mice were weighted and blood was collected; liver and spleen tissues were collected for cell marker, phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activity and T- and B-cell proliferation measurements by using flow cytometric assays.When compared with the leukemia control group, bufalin increased the body weight, but reduced liver and spleen weights, and reduced CD3, CD16 and Mac-3 cell markers at 0.4 mg/kg treatment and increased CD11b marker at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment. Furthermore, bufalin at 0.4 mg/kg increased phagocytosis by macrophages isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and at 0.1 mg/kg by those from the peritoneal cavity. Bufalin (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) increased NK cell cytotoxic activity at effector:target ratio of 50:1. Bufalin increased B-cell proliferation at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment but only increased T-cell proliferation at 0.1 mg/kg. Bufalin increased glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase level at all dose treatments, increased glutamic pyruvic transaminase level only at 0.1 mg/kg treatment, but reduced the level of lactate dehydrogenase at all dose levels in mice with WEHI-3 cell-induced leukemia in vivo.Bufalin increased immune responses by enhancing phagocytosis in mice with leukemia mice.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.
