We used a metabolomic approach to identify urine  markers before cardiac surgery, aiming to define the physiology of patients with complex CHD and to contribute to predict their neurodevelopmental outcome.In a prospective, observational, single-center study we enrolled 28 patients with complex biventricular and univentricular CHD aged less than  years, on stable hemodynamic conditions, and with no genetic anomalies. We analyzed urine samples, collected at the induction of anesthesia, by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Profiles of 1H NMR spectra were submitted to unsupervised (principal component) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant) multivariate analysis. Neurodevelopment was assessed by neuropsychological and adaptive functioning testing.Principal components analysis divided CHD patients  profiles in two distinct clusters (RED and BLACK).  profiles belonging to the RED cluster showed higher levels of accumulation of citric acid cycle intermediates and glucose compared to the profiles in the BLACK cluster, indicating a possible switching to anaerobic . Patients belonging to the RED cluster were significantly more prone to show an adverse neurodevelopment pattern (p = 0.01).The application of metabolomic analysis to CHD children permitted a deeper insight on their  status that could help to obtain a better understanding of the physiological implications and to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.© 2019 The Authors.

Aim of the review To obtain a more precise estimation of the associations between EPHX1 polymorphisms and carbamazepine  and resistance. Methods The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database, China Biology Medicine disc and Wan fang Database were searched for appropriate studies regarding the rs1051740 and rs2234922 polymorphisms of EPHX1 up to September 2019. The meta-analysis was carried out using the Review Manager .3 software. The mean difference and 95% confidence interval were applied to assess the strength of the relationship. Results A total of 7 studies involving 1118 related epilepsy patients were included. EPHX1 rs1051740 polymorphism was significantly associated with adjusted concentrations of both carbamazepine (CC vs. TT: P = 0.02; CC vs. CT + TT: P = 0.005) and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CC vs. CT + TT: P = 0.03). Furthermore, EPHX1 rs2234922 polymorphism was also observed to be significantly associated with decreased adjusted concentrations of carbamazepine-10,11-trans dihydrodiol (GG vs. GA + AA: P = 0.04) and CBZD:CBZE ratio (GG vs. AA: P = 0.008; GG vs. GA + AA: P = 0.0008). Nevertheless, the pooled analysis showed that the EPHX1 polymorphisms had no significant effect on CBZ resistance. Conclusion EPHX1 rs1051740 and rs2234922 polymorphisms may affect the carbamazepine ; but carbamazepine resistance was not related to any of the single nucleotide polymorphisms investigated. These findings provided further evidence for individualized therapy of epilepsy patients in clinics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671132>MitoToxy assay: A novel cell-based method for the assessment of  toxicity in a multiwell plate format using a lactate FRET nanosensor, Laconic.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial toxicity is a primary source of pre-clinical drug attrition, black box warning and post-market drug withdrawal. Methods that detect mitochondrial toxicity as early as possible during the drug development process are required. Here we introduce a new method for detecting mitochondrial toxicity based on MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing the genetically encoded FRET lactate indicator, Laconic. The method takes advantage of the high cytosolic lactate accumulation observed during mitochondrial stress, regardless of the specific toxicity mechanism, explained by compensatory glycolytic activation. Using a standard multi-well plate reader, dose-response curve experiments allowed the sensitivity of the methodology to detect  toxicity induced by classical mitochondrial toxicants. Suitability for high-throughput screening applications was evaluated resulting in a Z'-factor > 0. and CV% < 20 inter-assay variability. A pilot screening allowed sensitive detection of commercial drugs that were previously withdrawn from the market due to liver/cardiac toxicity issues, such as camptothecin, ciglitazone, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and terfenadine, in ten minutes. We envisage that the availability of this technology, based on a fluorescent genetically encoded indicator, will allow direct assessment of mitochondrial , and will make the early detection of mitochondrial toxicity in the drug development process possible, saving time and resources.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663278>Discovery and Identification of Serum Succinyl-Proteome for Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis and Osteopenia.</a></h2><p>For the purpose of providing evidence for the treatment of osteoporosis and osteopenia, this study retrospectively identified succinylation-modified sites and proteins in postmenopausal women, and bioinformatics analysis were performed.From January 2016 to June 2018, a total of 30 postmenopausal women aged from 55 to 70 years old were assigned to three groups: 10 cases with osteoporosis; 10 cases with osteopenia; and 10 cases with normal bone mass. Subsequently, the serum samples were collected from all cases for succinyl-proteome. Measures comprised label-free quantitative analysis, succinylation enrichment techniques, the liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) methods, and bioinformatics.A total of 113 succinylation sites on 35 proteins were identified based on quantitative information. The variation of the different multiple folds were more than 1.2 times as a significant increase for up-regulated and less than 1/1.2 times as a significant decrease for down-regulated. Among the quantified succinylation sites, 66 were up-regulated and 11 down-regulated in the Osteopenia/Normal comparison group, 24 were up-regulated and 44 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Osteopenia comparison group, 45 were up-regulated and 32 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Normal comparison group. Among the quantified succinylation proteins, 24 were up-regulated and 7 down-regulated in the Osteopenia/Normal comparison group, 15 were up-regulated and 20 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Osteopenia comparison group, 20 were up-regulated and 17 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Normal comparison group. The percentage of proteins differed in immune response, signaling pathway, proteolysis, lymphocyte, leukocyte, and cell activation. Four differentially expressed proteins (apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, hemoglobin subunit alpha, and haptoglobin) contained quantitative information; they were mediated with receptors, factors, mechanisms, that related to bone . Hemoglobin subunit alpha was screened for diagnosis of osteopenia.The succinyl-proteome experimental data indicated that apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, hemoglobin subunit alpha, and haptoglobin were valuable for diagnosis and treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and osteopenia.© 2019 The Authors.

Dose applied was 3 mg/10 g fish weight. After feeding, they were let out into aquarium and kept there for 3 days. Aquarium water containing excreted metabolites was extracted, and sample was purified and finally analyzed by means of HPLC/MS. Expected both primary (products of hydroxylation) and secondary (products of glucuronidation and sulfatation) metabolites of abiraterone acetate were identified. The NMR measurement of one of the prevailing metabolites presumed to be one of possible hydroxy-abiraterones discovered that it is not hydroxy-abiraterone but abiraterone 16,17-epoxide. Closer analysis of MS and MS spectra revealed that one of presumed hydroxy-abiraterone acetates and also some secondary metabolites are probably 16,17-epoxides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664099>Aβ modulates actin cytoskeleton via SHIP2-mediated phosphoinositide .</a></h2><p>Emerging evidences suggest that phospholipid  is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but molecular mechanisms on how this affects neurodegeneration in AD is poorly understood. SHIP2 is a phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzyme, which dephosphorylates PI(3,4,)P resulting to PI(3,4)P, and it has been recently shown that Aβ directly increases the activity of SHIP2. Here we monitored, utilizing fluorescent SHIP2 biosensor, real-time increase of PI(3,4)P-containing vesicles in HT22 cells treated with Aβ. Interestingly, PI(3,4)P is accumulated at late endosomes and lysosomal vesicles. We further discovered that ARAP3 can be attracted to PI(3,4)P-positive mature endosomes via its PH domain and this facilitates the degradation of ARAP3. The reduced level of ARAP3 then causes RhoA hyperactivation and filamentous actin, which are critical for neurodegeneration in AD. These results provide a novel molecular link between Aβ and actin disruption through dysregulated phosphoinositide , and the SHIP2-PI(3,4)P-ARAP3-RhoA signaling pathway can be considered as new therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat .</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early  abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and diabetes, and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and - to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (> min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662775>Effect of Naoxintong Capsules on the Activities of CYP450 and  of Metoprolol Tartrate in Rats Evaluated by Probe Cocktail and Pharmacokinetic Methods.</a></h2><p>Naoxintong capsule (NXT), a prescribed Chinese medicine, has been used clinically for more than 20 years and is widely received by patients. We determined five probe drugs, namely, omeprazole (CYP2C19), midazolam (CYP3A4), phenacetin (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) to study the potential influences of NXT on the activities of CYP enzymes and assessed the pharmacokinetics effect of NXT on metoprolol tartrate in rat plasma. The study showed that AUC and AUC of midazolam (CYP3A4) in NXT coadministration group (283.7 ± 65.2 h·ng·mL and 292.0 ± 75.1 h·ng·mL in group B; 295.7 ± 62.7 h·ng·mL and 299. ± 60.0 h·ng·mL in group C) were significantly decreased as compared to another group (416.8 ± 82.3 h·ng·mL and 424.9 ± 77.9 h·ng·mL in group A), while that of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) showed an opposite tendency (540.7 ± 119.7 h·ng·mL and 595.3 ± 122.2 h·ng·mL in group A, 760.6 ± 184.9 h·ng·mL and 788.7 ± 211.0 h·ng·mL in group B, and 734.3 ± 118. h·ng·mL and 757.2 ± 105.4 h·ng·mL in group C). Moreover, NXT preadministration can enhance the  of metoprolol tartrate and reduce the  of O-demethylmetoprolol. The results indicated that NXT had potential effects in inducing CYP3A4 and inhibiting CYP2D6 in the  of metoprolol tartrate. It suggests that patients who coadministered NXT and metoprolol tartrate should be advised of potential herb-drug interactions (HDIs) to reduce therapeutic failure or accelerated toxicity of conventional drug treatment.Copyright © 2019 Huizi Ouyang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672758>Relationship of obstructive sleep apnoea severity and subclinical systemic atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing. Untreated OSA might accelerate atherosclerosis, potentially increasing the cardiovascular disease burden in patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between objectively measured OSA severity and the presence of subclinical systemic atherosclerosis using non-invasive measurements, including tomographic quantification of the calcium burden.A total of 2157 participants of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, who were free of structural heart disease and underwent both in-home polysomnography and chest computed tomography, were cross-sectionally analysed. Participants were divided into three groups based on the severity of OSA: no OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index [AHI]<, n=1096), mild OSA (≤AHI<15, n=700), and moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI≥15, n=361). Calcium deposits in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries were measured by the Agatston score.Participants with moderate-to-severe OSA were 1.6 times (95% CI=1.18-2.15, p=0.002) more likely to have ascending thoracic aorta calcification (aTAC≥100 units) than those without OSA, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between moderate-to-severe OSA and aTAC of subjects with higher epicardial fat volume (EFV) was slightly stronger than that in patients without OSA and lower EFV tertile (OR=2.11; 95% CI=1.30-3.43).Severity of OSA in the general population was independently associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of severe OSA, especially in subjects with higher epicardial fat, as a possible predictive factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670603>Naringenin Increases Insulin Sensitivity and  Rate: A Case Study.</a></h2><p>Our studies in primary human adipocytes show that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, increases oxygen consumption rate and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), glucose transporter type 4, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on  rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting  rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The  rate peaked at 3.% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient. Compared to baseline, insulin decreased by 18%, but the change in glucose was not clinically significant. Other blood safety markers were within their reference ranges, and there were no adverse events.  and  mRNA expression was reduced by inhibitors of PPAR and PPAR, but there was no effect of PKA or PKG inhibition. We conclude that naringenin supplementation is safe in humans, reduces body weight and insulin resistance, and increases  rate by PPAR and PPAR activation. The effects of naringenin on energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity warrant investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673493>Body Weight Misperception and Psychological Distress Among Children and Adolescents: The CASPIAN-V Study.</a></h2><p>Misperception of weight status is a risk factor that affects psychological health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between weight misperception patterns and psychological distress among Iranian children and adolescents.This was a cross-sectional nationwide study where data was collected from 14,440 students, aged 7-18 years who participated in the national school-based surveillance program (CASPIAN-V). The students' weight perception and psychological distress were assessed by validated questionnaires. Weight misperception was classified as misperception of being either underweight or overweight with respect to actual weight.The rate of weight misperception in all study participants was 59.1%. In groups with a perception of being underweight or overweight, the risks of worthlessness, being worried, experiencing aggression, insomnia, or depression, were significantly higher than groups with an accurate weight perception ( < 0.05). The risk of anxiety in girls of normal weight who perceived themselves as underweight, decreased by 57% compared to girls with an accurate weight perception (OR: 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28-0.66).Weight misperception is highly prevalent among Iranian children and adolescents and is associated with their psychological health status. Appropriate education intervention needs to be developed to improve the children and adolescents' perception of their body weight status.Copyright ©2019, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655440>pH control and microbial community analysis with HCl or CO addition in H-based autotrophic denitrification.</a></h2><p>H-based autotrophic denitrification is promising to remove nitrate from water or wastewater lacking organic carbon sources, and pH is one of its most important process parameters. HCl and CO addition are known as adequate pH control methods for practical purposes. However, because of H, added CO may participate in microbial metabolisms and affect denitrification mechanisms. Here, a combined micro-electrolysis and autotrophic denitrification (CEAD) reactor, in which H is generated based on galvanic-cell reactions between zero-valent iron and carbon, was optimized and continuously operated for 233 days by adding HCl or CO to control pH in the range of 7.2-8.2. Microbial communities were compared between the two pH-control methods through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA, nirS, and nirK genes. Under a low COD/N ratio of 0. in the influent (with ∼36 mgNO-N/L), when adding HCl, the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency reached 91.4% ± 0.9% with a 28-h hydraulic retention time (HRT). When adding CO, the TN removal efficiency was improved to 96.% ± 1.7% with 24-h HRT. Significant differences of 16S rRNA and nirS genes between the two pH-control stages indicated the variation of microbial communities and nirS-type denitrifiers. With HCl addition, Thiobacillus, unclassified Comamonadaceae, Arenimonas, Limnobacter, and Thermomonas, which were reported previously as likely autotrophic or heterotrophic denitrifiers, were most dominant in the biofilms. With CO addition, the biofilms became dominated by Anaerolineaceae and Methylocystaceae (related to organic carbon ), Denitratisoma (likely heterotrophic denitrifier), and uncultured bacteria TK10 and AKYG587. The results suggest that the added CO not only contributed to pH control but also participated in microbial metabolisms. This study provides useful insights into microbial mechanisms and further optimization of H-based autotrophic denitrification in water and wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale  models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational  engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate  model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the  were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic , the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas , varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these  result in different energy yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these  in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central  demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general  engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict  behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671694>Effects of the Essential Oil from  Var.  on the Lateral Line System and the Gene Expression Profile of Zebrafish ().</a></h2><p>Mastic essential oil exhibits anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. With the growing interest of the use of mastic oil in the food and pharmaceutical industry, systematic in vivo studies are needed to address controlled usage and safety issues. In the present work we evaluated the safety of mastic oil using as a model the zebrafish lateral line system. In addition, we studied the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with mastic oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the hair cells of lateral line neuromasts are functional upon exposure of zebrafish larvae up to 20 ppm of mastic essential oil, while treatment with higher concentrations, 100 and 200 ppm, resulted in increased larvae mortality. Dietary supplementation of zebrafish with mastic essential oil led to differential expression of interferon response-related genes as well as the immune responsive gene 1 () that links cellular  with immune defense. Notably, , a constituent of the mucus hydrogel that protects the host against invading pathogens, was up-regulated.

Furthermore, PR expression can predict response to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Current immunohistochemical approaches to PR detection are limited by sampling error associated with biopsy and lack of standardised protocols; positron emission tomography (PET) using receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals to provide quantitative, whole-body imaging may overcome these limitations. PR expression has been successfully imaged with PET in the clinical setting, however investigation into new radioligands with improved pharmacokinetics and  stability is desirable.We report the synthesis of a focused library of non-steroidal PR ligands evaluated for use as PET radioligands. A lead candidate ([F]2) with low nanomolar activity was selected and radiolabelled with a radiochemical yield of 2.29 ± 2.31% (decay-corrected), radiochemical purity (RCP) > 95% and a molar activity of 2. ± 1.6 GBq/μmol. Cell uptake studies showed a significant and specific accumulation of [F]2 in T47D (PR++) breast cancer cell compared to MDA-MB-231 (PR-) control; however, in vivo evaluation was confounded by rapid defluorination of the radioligand. In vitro metabolite analysis of 2 in MLM confirmed defluorination and oxidative  of the thiocarbamate to oxocarbamate moiety by mass spectrometry.A route to access [F]2 was developed to allow in vitro and in vivo evaluation, albeit with low radiochemical yield and modest molar activity.

The mice in the high VT group were subdivided into 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours subgroups, with 8 mice in each subgroup. All mice underwent direct tracheal intubation, those in the spontaneous breathing group maintained spontaneous breathing, and those in the normal VT group and high VT group were mechanically ventilated with different VT. After ventilation for 4 hours, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to determine total protein, and the levels of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were determined by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA).

When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate  and amino acid  were dominant  . Lipid  was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid  pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648564>Prednisone and Its Active Metabolite Prednisolone Attenuate Lipid Accumulation in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Synthetic forms of glucocorticoids (GCs; eg, prednisone, prednisolone) are anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used in clinical practice. The role of GCs in cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, is highly controversial, and their impact on macrophage foam cell formation is still unknown. We investigated the effects of prednisone and prednisolone on macrophage oxidative stress and lipid .C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with prednisone or prednisolone ( mg/kg) for 4 weeks, followed by lipid  analyses in the aorta and peritoneal macrophages. We also analyzed the effect of serum samples obtained from 9 healthy human volunteers before and after oral administration of prednisone (20 mg for  days) on J774A.1 macrophage atherogenicity. Finally, J774A.1 macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, and fibroblasts were incubated with increasing concentrations (0-200 ng/mL) of prednisone or prednisolone, followed by determination of cellular oxidative status, and triglyceride and cholesterol . Prednisone and prednisolone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, as observed in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. These effects were associated with GCs' inhibitory effect on triglyceride- and cholesterol-biosynthesis rates, through downregulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and HMG-CoA reductase expression. Glucocorticoid-induced reduction of cellular lipid accumulation was mediated by the GC receptors on the macrophages, because the GC-receptor antagonist (RU486) abolished these effects. In fibroblasts, unlike macrophages, GCs showed no effects.Prednisone and prednisolone exhibit antiatherogenic activity by protecting macrophages from lipid accumulation and foam cell formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664515>Randomized trial of prophylactic ipsilateral central lymph node dissection in patients with clinically node negative papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the role of prophylactic ipsilateral central neck dissection (pCND) in patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).In this randomized control trial, a total of 164 consecutive patients were enrolled. By double-blinded randomization protocol, patients were allocated into hemithyroidectomy with pCND (n = 82) or without pCND (n = 82). With intention-to-treat analysis, post-surgical pathological and clinical course, surgery-related complications, causes and clinical course of protocol-violated cases and -year recurrence-free survival were compared.Operation time, hospital stay, and post-surgical complication were not significantly different between the two groups. In the pCND (+) group, occult lymph node metastasis rate was 50.0%, and lymph node ratio (metastatic/harvested lymph nodes) was 45.2%. Ten patients in the pCND (+) group had converted to undergo onsite or staged completion total thyroidectomy due to the presence of metastatic central lymph nodes and/or positive resection margin. Until last follow-up (mean 73.4 months), one regional recurrence developed in the pCND (-) group, and three regional recurrences occurred in the pCND (+) group. Five-year recurrence-free survival was similar between the two groups.Although ipsilateral pCND could clear occult lymph node metastasis in the central compartment, it failed to provide any oncological benefit for cN0 PTMC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657685>Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of cerebral frontal lobe tissue indentified RNA  dysregulation as one potential pathogenic mechanism in cerebral autosomal dominant.</a></h2><p>Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is an important cause of stroke and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), leading to subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. As a hereditary form of SVD with early onset, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) represents a pure form of SVD and may thus serve as a model disease for SVD. To date, underlying molecular mechanisms linking vascular pathology and subsequent neuronal damage in SVD are incompletely understood.We performed comparative transcriptional profiling microarray and proteomic analyses on post-mortem frontal lobe specimen from 2 CADASIL patients and  non neurologically diseased controls in order to identify dysregulated  potentially involved in the development of tissue damage in CADASIL.Transcriptional microarray analysis of material extracted from frontal grey and white matter (WM) identified subsets of up- or down-regulated genes enriched into biological  mostly in WM areas. Proteomic analysis of these regions also highlighted cellular processes identified by dysregulated proteins.Discrepancies between proteomic and transcriptomic data were observed, but a number of  were commonly associated with genes and corresponding proteins, such as: "ribosome" identified by upregulated genes and proteins in frontal cortex or "spliceosome" associated with down-regulated genes and proteins in frontal WM.This latter finding suggests that defective expression of spliceosomal components may alter widespread splicing profile, potentially inducing expression abnormalities that could contribute to cerebral WM damage in CADASIL.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651357>Correlation analysis of serum thyroid stimulating hormone with acute cerebrovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Acute cerebrovascular disease (ACVD) could cause abnormal  of thyroid hormones (TH), mostly represented as a euthyroid sick syndrome or low T3 syndrome. However, the changes in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical significance of TSH alteration in patients with ACVD.Patients with ACVD admitted in our hospitals between January 2013 and September 2017 were enrolled in this study (n = 245, including 176 cerebral infarctions and 69 cerebral hemorrhages). Their thyroid hormones were measured and compared with healthy individuals (n = 75). The correlation of TSH with severity and prognosis of ACVD were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve.Serum TSH in ACVD group was higher than the control group (1.64 ± 1.08 vs. 1.26 ± 0.36 μIU/mL, P < 0.05). The TSH levels in intermediate and severe patients with ACVD were higher than in mild patients (1.72 ± 1.18 vs. 2.71 ± 0.93 vs. 1.02 ± 0.47 μIU/mL, P < 0.05). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) of TSH in determining the severity of patients were 0.863 (Area under the curve, AUC), 1.496 μIU/L (optimal threshold), 76.% (sensitivity) and 87.3% (specificity). TSH levels in improved and unchanged groups were significantly higher than the primarily healing group (2.27 ± 1.11 vs. 2.88 ± 1.07 vs. 0.86 ± 0.46 μIU/mL, P < 0.05). ROC of TSH in determining the prognosis of patients was 0.910 (AUC), 1.681 mIU/L (optimal threshold), 79.8% (sensitivity) and 90.% (specificity) correspondingly.Since elevated TSH in ACVD patients affects the outcome of thyroid function evaluation, it is preferable to re-check after the acute period. A correlation between a high TSH level and the severity and prognosis of ACVD was detected, but the mechanism of this correlation needs to be further studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661737>Project profile: a multicenter study on breast cancer in young women in Latin America (PRECAMA study).</a></h2><p>To describe the rationale and the methodology of a multicenter project to study the etiology of breast cancer in young Latin American women.The International Agency for Research on Cancer has established an international collaborative population-based case-control study in four countries in Latin America: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico (the PRECAMA study).

However, microbial production of some compounds like aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived chemicals, remains an outstanding  engineering challenge. Here we present the construction of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce high levels of p-coumaric acid, an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between glycolysis and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several important genes at key nodes between these two . This results in a maximum p-coumaric acid titer of 12. g L and a maximum yield on glucose of 154.9 mg g.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667811>Glycogenolysis in Cerebral Cortex During Sensory Stimulation, Acute Hypoglycemia, and Exercise: Impact on Astrocytic Energetics, Aerobic Glycolysis, and Astrocyte-Neuron Interactions.</a></h2><p>Most glycogen in cerebral cortex is located in astrocytes, and the importance of glycogenolysis for critical functions, including neurotransmission and memory consolidation, is strongly supported by many studies. However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the oxygen-glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from .0 to 2.8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic glycolysis, not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic  of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.</a></h2><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different  tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs , adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675352>Elevated ceramides 18:0 and 24:1 with aging are associated with hip fracture risk through increased bone resorption.</a></h2><p>We assessed whether circulating ceramides, which play a role in a number of degenerative changes with aging, significantly differed according to fragility hip fracture (HF) status. We also performed a human study using bone marrow (BM) aspirates, directly reflecting the bone microenvironment, in addition to  experiments. Peripheral blood and BM samples were simultaneously collected from 74 patients 65 years or older at hip surgery for either HF ( = 28) or for other causes ( = 46). Ceramides were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Age was correlated positively with circulating C16:0, C18:0, and C24:1 ceramide levels. Patients with fragility HF had 21.3%, 49.%, 34.3%, and 22.% higher plasma C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C24:1 ceramide levels, respectively, than those without HF. Higher C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C24:1 ceramide levels were positively related to bone resorption markers in both blood and BM samples. Furthermore,  studies showed that C18:0 and C24:1 ceramides directly increased osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, and expression levels of osteoclast differentiation markers. These results suggested that the association of increased ceramides, especially C18:0 and C24:1, with adverse bone phenotypes in elderly people could be explained mainly by the increase in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661482>[Identification of the Molecular Partners of Lymphocyte Phosphatase-Associated Phosphoprotein (LPAP) That Are Involved in Human Lymphocyte Activation].</a></h2><p>Lymphocyte phosphatase-associated phosphoprotein (LPAP) is a small transmembrane protein that is found in lymphocytes and is tightly associated with the phosphatase CD45. The function of LPAP is still unknown. Studies of the LPAP interactome may reveal new details of how C45 and lymphocyte signaling in general are regulated. LPAP binding partners were sought using coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, stabilization of protein complexes with chemical crosslinkers, and Blue Native electrophoresis. In addition to CD45, several proteins were identified as LPAP partners, including CD71, CD98, cytoskeletal proteins, the amino acid transporter SLC1A4, and the cell signaling component HS1. It was confirmed that more than 70% of LPAP molecules were bound with CD45 in a 1 : 1 complex. The effect of CD45 on LPAP was studied in CEM and Jurkat cells with a CD45 knockout. The LPAP levels in the cells were 10% of the level in wild-type cells. In the absence of CD45, LPAP phosphorylation at Ser-153 and Ser-163 was not affected, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-99 and Ser-172 decreased significantly. Based on the results, CD45 was assumed to play a role in regulating LPAP expression and phosphorylation status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657332>[Effects of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (CORM-2) on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats.140 healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into sham operation (Sham) group, model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, inactivated carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (iCORM) pretreatment group, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group by random number table, with 28 rats in each group. The rat sepsis model was reproduced by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The rats in the Sham group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of normal saline (NS). The rats in the CORM-2 and iCORM-2 pretreatment groups were injected intraperitoneally with 8 mg/kg CORM-2 or iCORM-2 at 1 hour before LPS injection, respectively, and those in the DMSO group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of DMSO, but the rats in the Sham group and the model group were not treated after injection of NS or LPS. Twenty rats were randomly selected from each group to observe 10-day survival rate. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the remaining 8 rats at 12 hours after modeling, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) were calculated to evaluate heart function. The blood of the inferior vena cava was harvested, then serum myocardial troponin I (cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then the rats were sacrificed, and the myocardial tissues were harvested, the pathological morphology and ultrastructure of myocardium were observed.(1) Survival rates: all rats in the Sham group survived; compared with the Sham group, the survival rates of the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were significantly decreased at 10 days [10% (2/20), 70% (14/20), 25% (/20), 15% (3/20) vs. 100% (20/20), all P < 0.01].

This method is based on the simultaneous administration of [1-C]glycine and [N]glycine followed by the measurement of excretion kinetics of breath CO and urinary N. The basic idea of the DLAAM is that the unknown C recovery RF(C) of the 1-C amino acid, essential for the calculation of the net CO production, can be approximated by the easily measureable N recovery RF(N) of the α-NH labelled amino acid. In four healthy adult men (76-97 kg) the DLAAM was tested parallel to the IC and in one man (74 kg) parallel to the DLWM. Using the approximation RF(C) ≈ RF(N) the RCO (in l CO d) was calculated to 387.0 ± 30.3 (DLAAM) vs. 382.8 ± 22.6. (IC). The Bland-Altman plot shows that the difference between the DLAAM and IC of individual RCO is within the 95 % confidence interval (mean ± 2 SD): +4.3 ± 37. l CO d.

Therefore, methods to recover these reservoirs efficiently are of importance to guarantee energy supply. Here we report our novel stimulation of indigenous microbes by optimizing the water cut in low permeability reservoirs for green and enhanced oil recovery. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of indigenous bacterial communities with changes in water cut in reservoirs by high-throughput sequencing technology, and reveal the mechanism and characteristics of the crude oil biotreatment under different crude oil-water ratio conditions and the optimum activation time of indigenous functional microbial groups in reservoirs. The indigenous microbial  products were characterized by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Results showed that Acinetobacter (47.1%) and Pseudomones (19.8%) were the main functional genus of crude oil degradation at the optimal activation time, and can reduce the viscosity of crude oil from 8.33 to .75 mPa·s. The dominant bacteria genus for oil recovery after activation of the production fluids was similar to those in the reservoirs with water cut of 60-80%.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of macronutrient supplements for infants born small on later development and .We searched OvidMedline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to April 1, 2019, and controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and anzctr.org.au. Randomised or quasirandomised trials were included if the intention was to increase macronutrient intake to improve growth or development of infants born small and assessed post-discharge outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were cognitive impairment and  risk, evaluated in toddlers (<3 years), childhood (3 to 8 years), and adolescence (9 to 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and data were pooled using random-effect models. Twenty-one randomised and one quasirandomised trial of variable methodological quality involving 3,680 infants were included. In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to 2.65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD .60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -2.04; 95% CI -7.04 to 2.95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and fasting insulin concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some  outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669626>Changing trends in the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus from 1990 to 2018: A retrospective study in a Portuguese population.</a></h2><p>to estimate the prevalence of DR in a Portuguese population with type 1 diabetes.Retrospective review of all patients with type 1 DM, whose reference center was Centro Hospitalar de São João, a tertiary center in Portugal, who were diagnosed between 1990 and 2018.

In the first  years, in ESC-HF we published more than 450 articles. Through ESC-HF, the HFA gives room for heart failure research output from around the world. A transfer process from the European Journal of Heart Failure to ESC-HF has also been installed. As a consequence, in 2018 ESC-HF received 289 submissions, and published 148 items (acceptance rate 51%). The journal is listed in Scopus since 2014 and on the PubMed website since 2015. In 2019, we received our first impact factor from ISI Web of Knowledge / Thomson-Reuters, which is 3.407 for 2018. This report reviews which papers get best cited. Not surprisingly, many of the best cited papers are reviews and facts & numbers mini reviews, but original research is also well cited.© 2019 The Authors.

These copy-number polymorphic duplications are under positive selection and include three to eight copies of BOLA2, a gene involved in the maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins. To investigate the potential advantage provided by the rapid expansion of BOLA2, we assessed hematological traits and anemia prevalence in 379,385 controls and individuals who have lost or gained copies of BOLA2: 89 chromosome 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion carriers and 56 reciprocal duplication carriers in the UK Biobank. We found that the 16p11.2 deletion is associated with anemia (18/89 carriers, 20%, p = 4e-7, OR = ), particularly iron-deficiency anemia. We observed similar enrichments in two clinical 16p11.2 deletion cohorts, which included 6/63 (10%) and 7/20 (35%) unrelated individuals with anemia, microcytosis, low serum iron, or low blood hemoglobin. Upon stratification by BOLA2 copy number, our data showed an association between low BOLA2 dosage and the above phenotypes (8/15 individuals with three copies, 53%, p = 1e-4). In parallel, we analyzed hematological traits in mice carrying the 16p11.2 orthologous deletion or duplication, as well as Bola2 and Bola2 animals. The Bola2-deficient mice and the mice carrying the deletion showed early evidence of iron deficiency, including a mild decrease in hemoglobin, lower plasma iron, microcytosis, and an increased red blood cell zinc-protoporphyrin-to-heme ratio. Our results indicate that BOLA2 participates in iron homeostasis in vivo, and its expansion has a potential adaptive role in protecting against iron deficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Human Genetics.

Similar experiments were also performed with leptin-deficient (Ob/Ob) mice.The results showed that the HFD group presented decreased GLUT2, PEPT1, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1, and increased NHE3, MTTP and L-FABP content. Animals fed an HFD also presented enhanced lipid transporter gene expression of , , ,  and . Additionally, FAT/CD36 and NPC1L1 protein levels were reduced in both HFD-induced obese and Ob/Ob mice. Ob/Ob mice also exhibited increased  and  mRNAs expression, but the protein expression levels remained unchanged. The HFD also attenuated PKA and PKC activities. The inhibition of PKA was associated with decreased FAT/CD36 content, whereas increased L-FABP levels likely depend on CREB activation, independent of PKA. It is plausible that the HFD-induced changes in NPC1L1, MTTP and L-FABP protein content involve regulation at the level of transcription. Moreover, the changes in GLUT2 and PEPT1 content might be associated with low PKC activity.The results indicated that an HFD is capable of reducing nutrient transporter content, possibly attenuating nutrient uptake into the intestine, and may represent a feedback mechanism for regulating body weight. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NHE3, L-FABP and MTTP may account for the increased prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia in obese individuals. All of these changes are potentially linked to reduced PKA or PKC activities.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654214>Molecular cloning and functional analysis of lotus salt-induced NnDREB2C, NnPIP1-2 and NnPIP2-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Dehydration-responsive element bindings transcription factor (DREBs) and plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) have been characterized multi-functions in plant growth and , as well as in the adaptation to various stresses. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of NnDREB2C from a salt-tolerated lotus species with RT-PCR methods. Analysis of qRT-PCR demonstrated that NnDREB2C mRNA in the leaf dramatically increased after the treatments of NaCl, abscisic acid, low temperature and mannitol. Next, NnDREB2C was cloned into constitutive expression vector pSN1301, which in turn transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate its function in plants. NnDREB2C overexpression significantly elevated Arabidopsis tolerance against salt and drought stresses, showing higher survival rates, lower conductivity and more chlorophyll content than those of wild-type plants. Moreover, higher germination rates were observed in the NnDREB2C overproducing plants when subjected into the stresses of NaCl and mannitol. Furthermore, we investigate the potential down-stream genes regulated by NnDREB2C and observed a significant increase in expressions of several genes belonging to PIPs family, including PIP1-1, PIP1-2, PIP1-3, PIP1-4 and PIP1-. Consistently, overexpressed NnPIP1-2 and NnPIP2-1 conferred Arabidopsis the tolerance to stresses. Taken together, we concluded that overexpression of NnDREB2C enhanced the tolerance of salt and drought stresses in plants, which might probably be derived from the increased expression of the genes belonging to PIPs family.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659056>Plant defense resistance in natural enemies of a specialist insect herbivore.</a></h2><p>Plants defend themselves against herbivores through the production of toxic and deterrent metabolites. Adapted herbivores can tolerate and sometimes sequester these metabolites, allowing them to feed on defended plants and become toxic to their own enemies. Can herbivore natural enemies overcome sequestered plant defense metabolites to prey on adapted herbivores? To address this question, we studied how entomopathogenic nematodes cope with benzoxazinoid defense metabolites that are produced by grasses and sequestered by a specialist maize herbivore, the western corn rootworm. We find that nematodes from US maize fields in regions in which the western corn rootworm was present over the last 50 y are behaviorally and metabolically resistant to sequestered benzoxazinoids and more infective toward the western corn rootworm than nematodes from other parts of the world. Exposure of a benzoxazinoid-susceptible nematode strain to the western corn rootworm for  generations results in higher behavioral and  resistance and benzoxazinoid-dependent infectivity toward the western corn rootworm. Thus, herbivores that are exposed to a plant defense sequestering herbivore can evolve both behavioral and  resistance to plant defense metabolites, and these traits are associated with higher infectivity toward a defense sequestering herbivore. We conclude that plant defense metabolites that are transferred through adapted herbivores may result in the evolution of resistance in herbivore natural enemies. Our study also identifies plant defense resistance as a potential target for the improvement of biological control agents.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Mutation of the  gene is associated with Kallmann syndrome 16 with or without a normal sense of smell. In addition, two case reports showed that mutation of the  gene could cause short stature, low gonadotropin, hypogonadism, thoracic deformity, a high scapula, rib and lower limb deformity, facial deformity (long face, epicanthic folds, backwards ears), and arterial malformation.We reported the case of a 26-year-old Chinese man who was admitted because of short stature. Physical examination showed that he had many abnormal symptoms, including a short neck, facial moles, knee valgus, transverse palm, continuous grade /6 murmurs in the pulmonary auscultation area, no whiskers, or pubic hair, no Adam's apple, short penis and cryptorchidism. Radiological examination showed pituitary, gonad, heart, kidney and skeletal dysplasia. The laboratory tests revealed low growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone and estrogen. Clinical whole-exome detection showed that our patient, unlike previously reported patients, has a new  gene mutation (c.950A>G). Now, his height has increased by 3 cm. In addition, he has a good appetite and reduced subcutaneous fat over 3 mo of recombinant human growth hormone injections therapy. Unfortunately, he refuses further treatment about gonad.Patients who come to a hospital because of their short stature must undergo gene detection if they have other simultaneous abnormal phenotypes.©The Author(s) 2019.

As these compounds may interact with any surface of the analytical system, time-resolved monitoring and reliable quantification is difficult. We describe a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) based analytical method for direct breath-resolved monitoring of reactive compounds. Aliphatic amines were used as test substances. Matrix adapted gas standards were generated by means of a liquid calibration unit. Calibration conditions were adapted in terms of materials, temperature and equilibration time. PTR-ToF-MS conditions were optimized in terms of inlet materials, transfer line and drift tube temperature and drift tube reduced electric field (E/N). Optimized PTR conditions in combination with inert materials and high temperatures considerably reduced the interactions of compounds with the surfaces of the analytical system. Good linearity (R2 > 0.99, RSDs < %) with LODs between 0.15 ppbV and 1.23 ppbV and LOQs between 0.24 ppbV and 1.94 ppbV could be achieved. The method was then applied to breath-resolved monitoring of reactive compounds in 17 healthy subjects after high and low oral protein challenge. Exhaled concentrations of trimethylamine, indole, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, acetone, 2-propanol, 2-butanone and phenol showed significant changes after protein intake. Methanethiol concentrations increased 6-fold within minutes after the protein intake. Optimization of methods and instrument design enabled reliable breath-resolved PTR-MS based analysis of exhaled reactive VOCs in the sub-ppbV range. Continuous in vivo monitoring of exhaled amines and sulphur containing compounds may provide novel non-invasive insight into endogenous and gut bacteria driven protein .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661442>Effect of nitrite and nitrate on sulfate reducing ammonium oxidation.</a></h2><p>The effects of nitrite and nitrate on the integration of ammonium oxidization and sulfate reduction were investigated in a self-designed reactor with an effective volume of  L. An experimental study indicated that the ammonium oxidization and sulfate reduction efficiencies were increased in the presence of nitrite and nitrate. Studies showed that a decreasing proportion of N/S in the presence of NO at 30 mg·L would lead to high removal efficiencies of NH-N and SO-S of up to 78.13% and 46.72%, respectively. On the other hand, NO was produced at approximately 26.89 mg·L. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes and Nitrospirae were detected in the anaerobic cycle growth reactor. Proteobacteria was identified as the dominant functional bacteria removing nitrogen in the reactor. The nitritation reaction could promote the sulfate-reducing ammonium oxidation (SRAO) process. NH was converted to NO and other intermediates, for which the electron acceptor was SO. These results showed that nitrogen was converted by the nitrification process, the denitrification process, and the traditional anammox process simultaneously with the SRAO process. The sulfur-based autotrophic denitration and denitrification in the reactor were caused by the influent nitrite and nitrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661481>[Mechanisms of Procaspase-8 Activation in the Extrinsic Programmed Cell Death Pathway].</a></h2><p>Caspase-8 performs initiatory functions during the induction of apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that plays an important role in regulating embryogenesis and maintaining homeostasis in the tissue of an adult organism, as well as differentiating and removing damaged cells. Dysregulation of the apoptosis mechanisms is associated with the pathogenesis and progression of a number of oncological and neurodegenerative diseases. Caspase-8 (also called СAP4, FLICE, MACH, MCH5) is one of two members of the death effector domain (DED)-containing caspases. Despite the fact that the role of caspase-8 in apoptosis has been well known since the mid 1990s, we are only now beginning to understand the subtle mechanisms of its activation and regulation in response to the activation of death receptors (DRs). In particular, it was demonstrated that the activation of caspase-8 requires the formation of specific oligomeric structures, which are named DED filaments. In this review, the recent data on the mechanisms of activating initiator caspase-8 in DED filaments are considered that allow us to better understand the subtle mechanisms of the initiation of the programmed cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673536>Perioperative characteristics and management of liver transplantation for isolated methylmalonic acidemia-the largest experience in China.</a></h2><p>There are few detailed consensus and guidelines on perioperative clinical characteristics of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA). This retrospective study investigated details of the clinical course and individualized treatment plan of the center with largest experience in China.A total of 7 MMA patients undergoing LT in Beijing Friendship Hospital from June 2013 to December 2017 were enrolled in the study, whose clinical data (clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chronological changes in urine MMA levels, treatment, etc.) during perioperative period were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients received strict postoperative management.All the 7 cases were confirmed to have isolated MMA, among which, 3 cases received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), 4 cases received deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). A wild fluctuate of  condition was observed within the first few days after surgery and two weeks after LT, the mean base excess of blood value (BE-B) restored to normal whereas plasma bicarbonate (HCO ) was still below normal value even with intermittent sodium bicarbonate correction. It also showed marked reduction in propionylcarnitine (C3) and C3/C2 level and the mean urine MMA by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was reduced by 81.7% (P<0.01) but remained >72× higher than upper limit of normal. The -correcting medications were administered as before. The renal function of one case with renal insufficiency before LT (serum creatinine rising) maintained stable by adjusting the immunosuppressive regimen during the observation period. All patients survive to date.LT is an effective treatment to prevent  crisis, but patients with MMA tend to be metabolically fragile even after surgery. During perioperative period, close monitoring should be given for acidosis episodes so as to implement sodium bicarbonate correction. -correcting medications are still needed. Special immunosuppressive regimen is an effective way of maintaining renal function for those with kidney dysfunction.2019 Hepatobiliary Surgery and Nutrition.

Participants were observed for outcomes through September 2015, with data analysis conducted from June 2017 to August 2019.Self-reported physical activity and sedentary time.Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for total and site-specific fracture incidence.During a mean (SD) follow-up period of 14.0 (.2) years among 77 206 women (mean [SD] age, 63.4 [7.3] years; 66 072 [85.6%] white), 25 516 (33.1%) reported a first incident fracture. Total physical activity was inversely associated with the multivariable-adjusted risk of hip fracture (>17.7  equivalent [MET] h/wk vs none: HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95; P for trend < .001). Inverse associations with hip fracture were also observed for walking (>7.

Moderate to vigorous activity was positively associated with wrist or forearm fracture (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15; P for trend = .004). After controlling for covariates and total physical activity, sedentary time was positively associated with total fracture risk (>9. h/d vs <6. h/d: HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P for trend = .01). When analyzed jointly, higher total activity mitigated some of the total fracture risk associated with sedentary behavior. Analysis of time-varying exposures resulted in somewhat stronger associations for total physical activity, whereas those for sedentary time were materially unchanged.In older ambulatory women, higher total physical activity was associated with lower total and hip fracture risk but higher knee fracture risk. Mild activity and walking were associated with lower hip fracture risk, a finding with important public health implications because these activities are common in older adults.

Cells of isolated strain NKC3- were 0.-0.7 μm wide and 1.4-2.8 μm long. The strain NKC3-5T could grow at up to 20.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 10%), pH 6.-10.0 (optimum pH 9.0), and 25-40°C (optimum 35°C). The cells were able to reduce nitrate under aerobic conditions, which is the first report in the genus Salicibibacter. The genome size and genomic G + C content of strain NKC3- were 3,754,174 bp and 45.9 mol%, respectively; it contained 3,630 coding sequences, 16S rRNA genes (six 16S, five 5S, and five 23S), and 59 tRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA showed that strain NKC3- clustered with bacterium Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1, with a similarity of 96.2-97.6%, but formed a distinct branch with other published species of the family Bacillaceae. In addition, OrthoANI value between strain NKC3- and Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1 was far lower than the species demarcation threshold. Using functional genome annotation, the result found that carbohydrate, amino acid, and vitamin  related genes were highly distributed in the genome of strain NKC3-. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that strain NKC3- had 716 pan-genome orthologous groups (POGs), dominated with carbohydrate . Phylogenomic analysis based on the concatenated core POGs revealed that strain NKC3- was closely related to Salicibibacter kimchii. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified lipids. Anteiso-C, iso-C, anteiso-C, and iso-C were the major cellular fatty acids, and menaquinone-7 was the major isoprenoid quinone present in strain NKC3-. Cell wall peptidoglycan analysis of strain NKC3- showed that meso-diaminopimelic acid was the diagnostic diamino acid. The phephenotypic, genomic, phylogenetic, and chemotaxonomic properties reveal that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Salicibibacter, for which the name Salicibibacter halophilus sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain NKC3- (= KACC 21230 = JCM 33437).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655123>Human CYP1A1 inhibition by flavonoids.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) is involved in the  of several genotoxic/carcinogenic environmental xenobiotics including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like benzo[a]pyrene. Several authors had proposed CYP1A inhibition as a plausible strategy for cancer chemoprevention. Using ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD), we tested the inhibitory properties of nine flavonoids: quercetin, miricetin, luteolin, fisetin, morin, kaempferol, -hydroxyflavone (-HF), 3-hydroxyflavone (3-HF), and flavone (F) against human recombinant CYP1A1. The last three compounds exerted the highest inhibitory effect with IC50 values of 0.07, 0.10 and 0.08 μM respectively; the more hydroxyl-groups were present, the lower the potency of inhibition was. Biochemical characterization leads to the conclusion that flavone and its hydroxy derivatives are mixed-type inhibitors. In silico studies have shown that, Phe224 and other aromatic residues in the human CYP1A1 active site play an important role in flavonoid-CYP interaction, through a π/π stacking between the aminoacid and the flavonoid C-ring. Outside the active site, the three flavonoids bind preferentially between A and K helices of the enzyme. Results from the Ames test using human S9 fraction revealed that none of the three compounds was mutagenic. We can consider -HF, 3-HF, and F as potential chemopreventive agents against genotoxic damage caused by metabolites resulting from CYP1A1 activity.Copyright © 2018.

One of the main drugs associated with the gingival overgrowth is the anti-epileptic such as phenytoin, which affects gingival tissues by altering extracellular matrix . In our study, we evaluate the effect of phenytoin, a drug whose active substance is phenytoin, on gingival fibroblasts of healthy volunteers. Gene expression of 29 genes was investigated in gingival fibroblasts' cell culture treated with phenytoin compared with untreated cells. Among the studied genes, only 13 genes (CXCL5, CXCL10, CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, CCR6, IL-1A, IL-1B, IL-, IL-7, IL-6R, BMP-2, and TNFSF-10) were statistically significant. All but one gene resulted downregulated after 24 h of treatment with phenytoin. BPM2 was the only, although weakly, up-expressed gene. Probably, we have not highlighted overexpression of the other inflammatory molecules because the study was performed on healthy people. Many studies show that phenytoin induces the overexpression of these cytokines but, probably, in our study, the drug does not have the same effect because we used gingival fibroblasts of healthy people.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654598>Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma in young adults Efficacy of nationwide selective vaccination.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis B vaccination in infancy was performed in Japan only when the mother was persistently infected since 1986 to 2016. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the results of vaccination for the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma in the young adults.We studied the number of patients who had liver cancer and died since 1976 to 2017 using national database. Furthermore, we did nationwide survey focusing on patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma who were diagnosed under 40 years of age from 2007 to 2016.The national database showed that the number of deaths under the age of 40 decreased from 337 in 1986 to 61 in 2016. Among the 122 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were registered in the survey, only three patients were born after the start of the vaccination in 1986. Liver cirrhosis, defined by a high Fib-4 index (≥3.25), was found in only 12.% of the patients at the time of the survey. HCC was incidentally diagnosed in 85 of the 122 (69%) patients. More than 60% of the patients (54/88) were dead at the time of the study, which may be attributed to the delay in diagnosis.Selective vaccination was effective for the prevention of HBV-related HCC. On the other hand, many young adults who missed the chance of HB vaccination and HCC surveillance developed HCC and died. HBV screening in young adults and careful follow-up of infected patients are important to prevent HCC development.This article is protected by copyright.

Following treatment, patients may recuperate in a hotel room to avoid exposing family members. The main purpose of this study was to estimate external effective dose rate coefficients to a hotel worker who handles potentially contaminated bed linens due to secretions from I patients as sweat or urine. The external dose rate estimates were derived using Monte Carlo radiation transport code and the phantom with movable arms and legs to model a housekeeper standing in an upright position holding a pile of bed linens. Simulations further integrated the body burden of time-dependent biokinetic  of I in the patient's body, differentiating between biokinetic excretion models of hyperthyroid vs. cancer patients. Organ absorbed dose rate and effective dose rate coefficients were calculated for three scenarios of bed linen contamination and estimated out to  d postadministration and compared to past I patient contamination measurements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661721>Metabolomic Investigations of the Temporal Effects of Exposure to Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products and their Mixture in the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica).</a></h2><p>The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) supports a large aquaculture industry and is a keystone species along the Atlantic seaboard. Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diphenhydramine, and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 µg/L of each chemical or mixture for ten days, followed by an eight-day depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, , 10 and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that  effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point and that overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post-depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e., Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino acid  and the urea cycle. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected   associated with anaerobic , osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects of each chemical's postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, there were fewer metabolites altered, but none of the treatments returned to their initial control values, indicating that  disruptions were long-lasting. Interestingly, the mixture did not directly cluster with individual treatments in the scores plot from partial least squares discriminant analysis, and many of its affected   were not well-predicted from the individual treatments. This research highlights the utility of untargeted metabolomics in developing exposure biomarkers for compounds with different modes of action in bivalves. This article is protected by copyright.

This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant microbiota of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut microbiota physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral microbiota could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte , themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of microbiota to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut microbiota close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 °C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 °C every  days from 25 to 30 °C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 °C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference, oxygen consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 ± 0.9 °C), preference (28.7 ± 0.4 °C), growth (1.10 ± 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36. ± 1, 29.4 ± 0.3 °C, 0.48 ± 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced  depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 ± 175.4 J g day) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30 °C (115.4 ± 63.4 J g day, 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected  performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate that in human endothelial cells, activation of mTORC2 signaling by GFs is mediated by transmembrane cell adhesion protein CD146. Upon GF stimulation, the cytoplasmic tail of CD146 is phosphorylated, which permits its positively charged, juxtamembrane KKGK motif to interact with Rictor, the defining subunit of mTORC2. The formation of the CD146-Rictor/mTORC2 complex protects Rictor from ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby specifically upregulating mTORC2 activity with no intervention of the PI3K and mTORC1 . This CD146-mediated mTORC2 activation in response to GF stimulation promotes cell proliferation and survival. Therefore, our findings identify a molecular mechanism by which extracellular stimuli regulate mTORC2 activity, linking environmental cues with mTORC2 regulation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

This study investigates the effects of consumption of yoghurt enriched with vitamins B, in comparison with conventional yoghurt, on body weight management and glycemic control of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-three overweight/obese patients (BMI 27-36 kg m-2) were randomized into two groups receiving two servings of non-fat yoghurt per day, either strawberry-flavored enriched with vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (VY) or conventional (CY) for 12 weeks. At the beginning and the end of the dietary intervention, anthropometric characteristics, biochemical parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b), vitamins B and homocysteine concentrations were determined. Dietary assessments were also performed. At the end of the intervention, body weight and BMI were reduced in the VY group (86. ± 3.1 vs. 87.7 ± 3.0 kg, and 29.2 ± 1.0 vs. 29.6 ± 0.9 kg m-2, respectively, P < 0.05) and dietary intake was lower compared to the CY group (7277.6 ± 332.6 vs. 9918.2 ± 612.1 kJ day-1, P < 0.05). HbA1c was marginally reduced in the VY group (6.2 ± 0.2 vs. 6.4 ± 0.3%, P = 0.08), concentrations of B1, B2 and B6 were increased (63.8 ± .6 vs. 52.8 ± 1.7 μg L-1, P = 0.09, 9.2 ± 1. vs. 6.9 ± 1.4 μg L-1, P < 0.05 and 23.0 ± 2.8 vs. 14.9 ± 1.2 μg L-1, P < 0.05, respectively) and a trend towards reduced homocysteine concentrations was observed (16.9 ± 1.7 vs. 18.3 ± 2.0 μmol L-1, P = 0.06). IL-6 was decreased in both groups but significantly in the CY group (1.33 ± 0.13 vs. 1.67 ± 0.63 pg mL-1, P < 0.05).

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid  in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659144>Adipose tissue-derived Omentin-1 attenuates arterial calcification via AMPK/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue-derived adipokines mediate various kind of crosstalk between adipose tissue and other organs and thus regulate  balance, inflammation state as well as disease progression.

This may result from altered energy  or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial insulin secretion and improves white adipose tissue  and gut microbiome composition.

Systematic literature research of PubMed, WOS, Embase and CNKI was performed to identify eligible studies. Review Manager Version .3.3 was used to conduct statistical analyses. Totally 37 genetic association studies were included for analyses. The pooled analyses showed that  rs1801394 (dominant model:  = 0.01; recessive model:  = 0.04; allele model:  = 0.005) and  rs1801133 (dominant model:  = 0.008; recessive model:  = 0.0003; allele model:  = 0.0002) polymorphisms were both significantly associated with susceptibility to LC in overall population. Subgroup analyses revealed similar significant findings for  rs1801133 polymorphism in East Asians. Significant associations with LC were also observed for  rs1801394 and  rs1801133 polymorphisms in smokers. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that  rs1801394 was significantly associated with LC in smokers, and  rs1801133 polymorphisms was also significantly associated with LC in smokers and East Asians. These results suggested that these two polymorphisms could be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing LC in certain populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655025>Novel highly potent OXE receptor antagonists with prolonged plasma lifetimes that are converted to active metabolites in vivo in monkeys.</a></h2><p>The -lipoxygenase product -oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (-oxo-ETE), acting through the OXE receptor, is a potent eosinophil chemoattractant that may be an important proinflammatory mediator in eosinophilic diseases such as asthma. We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and  to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of -oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

Basal  rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body  and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific  profile on cancer risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 obesity-related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and cancer risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with obesity. However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: 2.46; 95%CI 1.20; .03), and distal colon cancer (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal colon (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; 2.05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women.

The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from  control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins, lipid  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Here we describe a 23-year-old man with FD possessing a novel mutation in the GLA gene, the evaluation of his family, and the functional characterization of the novel variant.Two generations of a family were screened for FD by clinical symptoms and low enzymatic activity. This step was followed by DNA sequencing that showed a novel GLA missense mutation. To confirm the pathogenicity potential of the mutation, we employed site-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. GLA wild-type and mutant plasmids were transfected into mammalian cells; RNA and proteins were extracted for expression and analysis of enzymatic activity.The patient presents the variant p.Asn34Asp in the GLA and had several manifestations of FD since adolescence. The investigation of the deficiency of α-Gal A was initiated due to stage 4 of chronic kidney disease. All family members carrying the novel mutation presented early symptoms, including index case's mother, who received a renal transplant when she was 35 years old. In silico and in vitro analysis confirmed the pathogenic potential of the mutation p.Asn34Asp showing that the enzyme had only 4% of residual activity due to protein misfolding. The ability of the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin to recover the mutant was confirmed, producing 37.% of residual activity.In this work, we present a novel missense mutation in GLA that leads to the production of a catalytically competent α-Gal A, which is degraded before its delivery to the lysosome, promoting severe manifestations of FD, with a very similar disease course in affected men and women.© 2019 S.

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±.9yrs, BMI: 29.±.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat  and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to  flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid  alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves  deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal  communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The identification of human FA blood biomarkers related to disease severity and neuro-pathomechanism could support clinical trials of drug efficacy. To try to identify human biomarkers of neuro-pathomechanistic relevance, we compared the overlapping gene expression changes of primary blood and skin cells of FA patients with changes in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) of the KIKO FA mouse model. As DRG is the primary site of neurodegeneration in FA, our goal was to identify which changes in blood and skin of FA patients provide a 'window' into the FA neuropathomechanism inside the nervous system. In addition, gene expression in frataxin-deficient neuroglial cells and FA mouse hearts were compared for a total of  data sets. The overlap of these changes strongly supports mitochondrial changes, apoptosis and alterations of selenium . Consistent biomarkers were observed, including three genes of mitochondrial stress (MTIF2, ENO2), apoptosis (DDIT3/CHOP), oxidative stress (PREX1), and selenometabolism (SEPW1). These results prompted our investigation of the GPX1 activity as a marker of selenium and oxidative stress, in which we observed a significant change in FA patients. We believe these lead biomarkers that could be assayed in FA patient blood as indicators of disease severity and progression, and also support the involvement of mitochondria, apoptosis and selenium in the neurodegenerative process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666412>[Protective effect of uridine on  processes in rat myocardum during its ischemia/reperfusion damage].</a></h2><p>The experimental study of the cardioprotective effect of uridine, the  precursor of the endogenous activator of mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+-channels (mitoKATP-channels), was performed using the model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/RP) in rats. Ischemia for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min resulted in a significant decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine (PC) content, intensification of lipid peroxidation (LPO), and inhibition of the antioxidant system (AOS) in cardiomyocytes. Uridine in a dose of 30 mg/kg, administered intravenously prior to reperfusion, had a protective effect on myocardial  in the I/RP zone. It prevented the decrease of ATP and PC, limited the LPO processes, evaluated by the content of lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes, and improved the AOS state by, preventing the decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and increasing the content of reduced glutathione (GSH). The mitoKATP-channel blocker -hydroxydecanoate (-HD,  mg/kg) eliminated the ability of uridine to maintain the ATP level and to exhibit its positive effect on the intensity of the LPO and activity of AOS. The obtained data allow us to conclude that activation of mitoKATP-channels play an important role in the mechanism of the cardioprotective effect of uridine in I/RP damage of myocardium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669906>Overlooked  of denitrification in a sulfur-based denitrification system with organic supplementation.</a></h2><p>Elemental sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrification (SADN) is a cost-effective approach for treating secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Additional organics are generally supplemented to promote total nitrogen (TN) removal, reduce nitrite accumulation and sulfate production, and balance the pH decrease induced by SADN. However, understanding of the impacts of organic supplementation on microbial communities, nitrogen , denitrifier activity, and SADN rates in sulfur-based denitrification reactors is still limited. Here, a sulfur-based denitrification reactor was continuously operated for 272 days during which six different C/N ratios were tested successively (2.7, 1., 0.7, 0., 0.25, and 0). Organic supplementation improved TN removal and decreased NO accumulation, but reduced the relative abundance of denitrifiers and the contribution of autotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria (aNRB) to TN removal during the long-term operation of reactor. Predictive functional profiling showed that nitrogen  potential increased with decreasing C/N ratios. SADN was the predominant removal process when the C/N ratio was ≤0.7 (achieving 60% contribution when C/N = 0.7). Although organic supplementation weakened the dominant role of aNRB in denitrification, batch tests for the first time demonstrated that it could accelerate the SADN rate, attributed to the improvement of sulfur bioavailability, likely via the formation of polysulfide. A possible nitrogen removal pathway with multiple electron donors (i.e., sulfur, organics, sulfide, and polysulfide) in a sulfur-based denitrification reactor with organic supplementation was therefore proposed. However, supplementation with a high level of organics could increase the operational cost and effluent concentrations of sulfide and organics as well as enrich heterotrophic denitrifiers. Moreover, microbial community had substantial changes at C/N ratios of >0.. Accordingly, an optimal C/N ratio of 0.25-0. was suggested, which could simultaneously minimize the additional operating cost associated with organic supplementation and maximize TN removal and SADN rates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the neurotrophin - brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) has implicated in SC regulation in animals. To date, little is known regarding the role of BDNF in human SC function in vivo. Twenty-nine males (21±0.5y) participated in the study. Muscle biopsies from the thigh were obtained prior to a bout of 300 maximal eccentric contractions (PRE), and 6h, 24h, 72h, and 96h of post-exercise. BDNF was not detected in any quiescent (Pax7+/MyoD-) SCs across the time-course. BDNF co-localized to 39±% of proliferating (Pax7+/MyoD+) cells at PRE, which increased to 84±3% by 96h (P<0.05). BDNF was only detected in 13±% of differentiating (Pax7-/MyoD+) cells at PRE, which increased to 67±4% by 96h (P<0.05). The number of Myogenin+ cells increased 95% from PRE (1.6±0.2 cells/100MF) at 24h (3.1±0.3 cells/100MF) and remained elevated until 96h (cells/100MF), p<0.05. The proportion of BDNF+/Myogenin+ cells was 26±0.3% at PRE, peaking at 24h (49±3%, p<0.05) and remained elevated at 96h (p<0.05). These data are the first to demonstrate an association between SC proliferation and differentiation and BDNF expression in humans in vivo, with BDNF co-localization to SCs increasing during the later stages of proliferation and early differentiation. Novelty: • BDNF is associated with SC response to muscle injury • BDNF was not detected in non-activated (quiescent) SCs • BDNF is associated with late proliferation and early differentiation of SCs in vivo in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650348>Airborne microplastics: a review study on method for analysis, occurrence, movement and risks.</a></h2><p>Microplastics (of size <  mm) pollution in our environment is of current concern by researchers, public media and non-governmental organizations. Implications by their presence in aquatic and soil ecosystems have been well studied and documented, but less attention has been paid on airborne microplastics (MPs). Studies concerning airborne microplastics started from 2016 and only a few (n = 13) have been published to date. Although, studies may increase in the following years, since air is very important for human survival. Microplastics have been observed in atmospheric fallouts in indoor and outdoor environments using a sampling or vacuum pump, rain sampler, and/or particulate fallout collector. Identification and quantification have been carried out by visual, spectroscopic, and spectrometric techniques. Factors such as meteorological, climatic, and anthropogenic influence the distribution and movement of airborne MP. Human exposure may be through inhalation, dermal, and open meal during fallout, with their potential biopersistence and translocation. Ingestion may cause localized inflammation and cancer due to responses by the immune cells, especially in individuals with compromised  and poor clearance mechanisms. Ecological risks involve possible contamination of the ecosystem through a dynamic relationship of MPs in soil, water, and air forming a MP contamination cycle. The present review aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of current knowledge or information regarding microplastics in air, identifying gap in knowledge, and giving suggestions for future research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651917>Integrated metabolomic and proteomics profiling reveals the promotion of Lactobacillus reuteri LR1 on amino acid  in the gut-liver axis of weaned pigs.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus reuteri LR1 improved growth performance of weaned pigs in our previous study. The objective of this study was to reveal effects of L. reuteri LR1 on amino acid (AA)  in weaned pigs and its underlying mechanism using metabolomic and proteomics methods. Weaned pigs were fed a basal diet (CON) or the basal diet supplemented with  × 1010 cfu kg-1 L. reuteri LR1 (LR1) for a 14 d period. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of the liver showed that LR1 up-regulated 33 metabolites and most of them were related to AA . Quantitative proteomics found that differential proteins were mainly involved in a  process in the ileal mucosa of LR1 vs. CON. Integrated metabolomic and proteomics analysis showed that the LR1's enhancement of AA  in the gut-liver axis is mediated by the up-regulated intestinal AA transporters in the pathway of protein digestion and absorption. Moreover, qPCR results confirmed that LR1 increased (p < 0.05) mRNA abundances of AA transporters (PepT1, EAAT3, rBAT, B0AT1, and b0,+AT) in the ileal mucosa compared with CON. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that LR1 activated the mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of S6 and 70S6K1 in the gut-liver axis of weaned pigs. Together, these data indicated that dietary supplemented LR1 enhanced AA  by up-regulating intestinal AA transporter expression and activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the gut-liver axis of weaned pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671379>Stimulation of -HT serotonin receptor subtype in the hypothalamic arcuate nuclei (ARC) increases the cytochrome P450 activity in the liver.</a></h2><p>Our previous study has demonstrated that activation of the -HT, but not -HT serotonin receptor type in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) is responsible for the neuroendocrine regulation of liver cytochrome P450. The goal of these studies was to determine whether -HT serotonin receptor subtype in the ARC is engaged in the regulation of liver cytochrome P450.The -HT serotonin receptor agonist CP-809,101 was injected into the ARC for  days. The liver cytochrome P450 activity and protein level were measured.In rats receiving an injection of the -HT serotonin receptor agonist CP-809,101 into the ARC (1 μg/side) for five days, the activities of CYP2B, CYP2C11 and CYP3A significantly increased corresponding with the elevated enzyme protein level.The obtained results suggest that the -HT serotonin receptor subtype in the ARC is involved in the positive neuroendocrine regulation of cytochrome P450.

Mutations in the exon 6 of the PPM1D result in production of a highly stable, C-terminally truncated PPM1D. These gain-of-function PPM1D mutations are present in various human cancers but their role in tumorigenesis remains unresolved. Here we show that truncated PPM1D impairs activation of the cell cycle checkpoints in human non-transformed RPE cells and allows proliferation in the presence of DNA damage. Next, we developed a mouse model by introducing a truncating mutation in the PPM1D locus and tested contribution of the oncogenic PPM1D allele to colon tumorigenesis. We found that p53 pathway was suppressed in colon stem cells harboring PPM1D resulting in proliferation advantage under genotoxic stress condition. In addition, truncated PPM1D promoted tumor growth in the colon in Apc mice and diminished survival. Moreover, tumor organoids derived from colon of the ApcPpm1d mice were less sensitive to -fluorouracil when compared to ApcPpm1dand the sensitivity to -fluorouracil was restored by inhibition of PPM1D. Finally, we screened colorectal cancer patients and identified recurrent somatic PPM1D mutations in a fraction of colon adenocarcinomas that are p53 proficient and show defects in mismatch DNA repair. In summary, we provide the first in vivo evidence that truncated PPM1D can promote tumor growth and modulate sensitivity to chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648705>Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Evolocumab in Patients With Hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Evolocumab and other anti-PCSK9 antibodies reduced adverse cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials of high-risk patients over <3 years median treatment duration.The OSLER-1 trial (Open Label Study of Long Term Evaluation Against LDL-C Trial) evaluated longer-term effects of evolocumab during open-label hypercholesterolemia treatment for up to  years.Patients randomized to standard of care (SOC) or evolocumab 420 mg monthly (evolocumab + SOC) for year 1. After year 1, patients could enter the all-evolocumab period and receive evolocumab + SOC for an additional 4 years. The authors analyzed the persistence of lipid effects and exposure-dependent safety focusing on yearly rates of adverse events (AEs) and anti-drug antibodies over 4.951 patient-years of observation.A total of 1,255 patients (safety analysis population) randomized into the year 1 SOC-controlled period and received ≥1 evolocumab dose (mean ± SD age 57 ± 12 years; 53% female). A total of 1,151 patients (efficacy analysis population) progressed to the all-evolocumab period (year 2 and beyond). Evolocumab + SOC persistently lowered mean ± SE low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 56% ± 0.6% (n = 1,071), 57% ± 0.8% (n = 1,001), 56% ± 0.8% (n = 943), and 56% ± 0.8% (n = 803) after approximately 2, 3, 4, and  years, respectively, from randomization. Mean baseline LDL-C decreased from 140 to 61 mg/dl on treatment. Yearly serious AE rates during evolocumab + SOC ranged from 6.9% to 7.9%, comparable to the 6.8% rate in SOC patients during year 1. Evolocumab discontinuation due to AEs occurred in .7% of patients. Two SOC and 2 evolocumab + SOC patients developed new, transient, binding anti-drug antibodies; no neutralizing antibodies were observed.The OSLER-1 trial demonstrated consistently excellent LDL-C-lowering efficacy, tolerance, and safety of evolocumab, with no neutralizing antibodies detected, throughout the longest-duration study of a PCSK9 inhibitor reported to date.

Supporting this notion, aKG supplementation can restore growth/survival of glutamine-deprived cells. However, pancreatic cancers are often poorly vascularized and limited in glutamine supply, in alignment with recent concerns on the significance of glutaminolysis in pancreatic cancer. Here, we show that aKG-mediated rescue of glutamine-deprived pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) cells requires glutamate ammonia ligase (GLUL), the enzyme responsible for de novo glutamine synthesis. GLUL-deficient PDAC cells are capable of the TCA cycle but defective in aKG-coupled glutamine biosynthesis and subsequent nitrogen anabolic processes. Importantly, GLUL expression is elevated in pancreatic cancer patient samples and in mouse PDAC models. GLUL ablation suppresses the development of Kras-driven murine PDAC. Therefore, GLUL-mediated glutamine biosynthesis couples the TCA cycle with nitrogen anabolism and plays a critical role in PDAC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, we evaluate the ion efflux of Cl and K, as well as the pHi in order to elucidate which channel is suitable to perform an in silico study.Total and progressive motility notably decreased after 60 min of incubation and also the fertility rates. ATP levels and mitochondrial activity suffered a drastic decrease. Furthermore, the three enzymes decreased their activities.

Planktonically grown  is known to prioritize the consumption of organic acids including lactic acid over catabolism of glucose using a CCR strategy termed "reverse diauxie."  is an opportunistic pathogen with well-documented biofilm phenotypes that are distinct from its planktonic phenotypes. Reverse diauxie has been described in planktonic cultures, but it has not been documented explicitly in  biofilms. Here a combination of exometabolomics and label-free proteomics was used to analyze planktonic and biofilm phenotypes for reverse diauxie.  biofilm cultures preferentially consumed lactic acid over glucose, and in addition, the cultures catabolized the substrates completely and did not exhibit the acetate secreting "overflow"  that is typical of many model microorganisms. The biofilm phenotype was enabled by changes in protein abundances, including lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, GTP cyclohydrolase, L-ornithine N()-monooxygenase, and superoxide dismutase. These results are noteworthy because reverse diauxie-mediated catabolism of organic acids necessitates a terminal electron acceptor like O, which is typically in low supply in biofilms due to diffusion limitation. Label-free proteomics identified dozens of proteins associated with biofilm formation including 16 that have not been previously reported, highlighting both the advantages of the methodology utilized here and the complexity of the proteomic adaptation for  biofilms. Documenting the reverse diauxic phenotype in  biofilms is foundational for understanding cellular nutrient and energy fluxes, which ultimately control growth and virulence.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662259>Genotoxicity and DNA damage signaling in response to complex mixtures of PAHs in biomass burning particulate matter from cashew nut roasting.</a></h2><p>Approximately 3 billion people world-wide are exposed to air pollution from biomass burning. Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from artisanal cashew nut roasting, an important economic activity worldwide, was investigated. This study focused on: i) chemical characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated (oxy-) PAHs; ii) intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); iii) genotoxic effects and time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA damage signaling, and iv) differential expression of genes involved in xenobiotic , inflammation, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, using A549 lung cells. Among the PAHs, chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benz[a]anthracene showed the highest concentrations (7.8-10 ng/m), while benzanthrone and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant oxy-PAHs. Testing of PM extracts was based on B[a]P equivalent doses (B[a]P). IC values for viability were .7 and 3.0 nM B[a]P at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. At these low doses, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of ROS, genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) and DNA damage signaling (phosphorylation of the protein checkpoint kinase 1 - Chk1). In comparison, effects of B[a]P alone was observed at micromolar range. To our knowledge, no previous study has demonstrated an activation of pChk1, a biomarker used to estimate the carcinogenic potency of PAHs in vitro, in lung cells exposed to cashew nut roasting extracts. Sustained induction of expression of several important stress response mediators of xenobiotic  (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), ROS and pro-inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-2, COX2), and DNA damage response (CDKN1A and DDB2) was also identified. In conclusion, our data show high potency of cashew nut roasting PM to induce cellular stress including genotoxicity, and more potently when compared to B[a]P alone. Our study provides new data that will help elucidate the toxic effects of low-levels of PAH mixtures from air PM generated by cashew nut roasting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It was 7.4% (3.9 to 10.8) for proliferative DR and 7.1% (4.9 to 9.4) for clinically significant macular edema. The heterogeneity of individual estimates of prevalence was highly significant. HDI (  < 0.001), density of specialists (  = 0.004), subspecialists (  < 0.001), and sampling site (  = 0.041) were associated with heterogeneity after the adjustment for type of DR, duration of diabetes, study year, and proportion of diabetics with controlled HbA1C.Human development and healthcare access were correlated with the prevalence of DR. Data were scarce on the prevalence of DR in less developed provinces. Participant recruitment in eye clinics might overestimate the prevalence of DR.Copyright © 2019 Mahmoudi Nezhad et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649231>Fatty liver in a two days old neonate.</a></h2><p>Neonatal death due to inborn error of  (IEM) is rare in Malaysia. We report a sudden neonate death just a few hours after being discharged from the hospital. The deceased was a two-day-old baby boy and was asymptomatic until his demise. He was fed with expressed breast milk and formula milk. Autopsy revealed fatty changes of the liver and an enlarged heart. Laboratory investigation confirmed very long chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency which resulted in his death.

Cardiovascular abnormalities such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), coarctation of the aorta (CoA), aortic stenosis (AS), and aortic dilatation (AD) account for some cases of TS-related early mortality. In this study, we investigated the correlations between cardiovascular phenotypes and karyotypes in TS.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 105 local patients with TS aged 6-43 years between January 1994 and December 2018. They were categorized into two groups of complete monosomy X (45,X) and other X chromosome abnormalities. Most of the patients underwent echocardiography (n = 88, 83.8%), cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography, and/or cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 58, 55.2%). We used independent the Student's t test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and log-rank test to compare differences in continuous data, proportions, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis results between the two TS groups.45,X was the most common karyotype (n = 47, 44.8%). Phenotypically, cardiovascular malformations were found in 29 patients with TS (27.6%). BAV (n = 6), CoA (n = 3), AS (n = 2), ASD (n = 1, 2.%), and PAPVR (n = 1, 2.%) were found in only the 45,X group. The mean age at AD onset was 25.55 ± .78 years (mean ± SD). Survival analysis of age at onset of AD demonstrated no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.051).Cardiovascular abnormalities, such as BAV, CoA, AS, and AD, are common and potentially progressive in patients with TS, especially those with the 45,X karyotype. They should receive immediate cardiological assessments upon receiving diagnosis, regular assessments, and treatment to carefully control blood pressure, even with no apparent congenital heart disease.Copyright © 2019.

However, frequency and severity of pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease is unclear. We investigated frequency, severity and predictive factors of pruritus in these patients from a large cohort.A total of 2477 patients with chronic liver disease without allergies or skin diseases were investigated for itch frequency and severity. Itch severity was self-assessed using pruritus scores using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with pruritus. Serum autotaxin levels were measured in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and the relationship to liver fibrosis and pruritus was analyzed.The frequency of pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease was significantly higher than in subjects without liver disease (29.8 and 16.2%, respectively, P < 0.001). NRS was high in patients with chronic liver disease, especially in those with PBC, as is generally expected. Multivariate analysis identified lower albumin, higher eosinophil count, and etiology of PBC as independent factors associated with severe pruritus (≥ points of NRS). In patients with PBC, serum autotaxin levels were significantly correlated with liver fibrosis markers such as platelet count and liver stiffness, and hepatobiliary enzymes such as total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. However, no significant correlations between serum autotaxin levels and frequency and severity of pruritus were observed in patients with PBC.The frequency of pruritus was high in patients with chronic liver disease. Reduction of liver function is associated with severe pruritus based on the large number of patients with chronic liver disease. Serum autotaxin is useful for assessing liver fibrosis and severity of cholangitis; however, it is not a predictive marker for severe pruritus in patients with PBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655591>High ectoine production by an engineered Halomonas hydrothermalis Y2 in a reduced salinity medium.</a></h2><p>As an attracted compatible solute, 1,4,,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid (ectoine) showed great potentials in various field. However, lower productivity and high saline medium seriously hinder its wide applications.The entire ectoine , including  for ectoine synthesis and catabolism, was identified in the genome of an ectoine-excreting strain Halomonas hydrothermalis Y2. By in-frame deletion of genes encoding ectoine hydroxylase (EctD) and (or) ectoine hydrolase (DoeA) that responsible for ectoine catabolism, the  for ectoine utilization were disrupted and resulted in an obviously enhanced productivity. Using an optimized medium containing 100 g L NaCl in a 500-mL flask, the double mutant of Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA synthesized 3.13 g L ectoine after 30 h cultivation. This is much higher than that of the wild type strain (1.91 g L), and also exceeds the production of Y2/ΔectD (2.21 g L). The remarkably enhanced accumulation of ectoine by Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA implied a critical function of Doe pathway in the ectoine catabolism. Furthermore, to reduce the salinity of fermentation medium and overcome the wastewater treatment difficulty, mutants that lacking key Na/H antiporter, Mrp and (or) NhaD2, were constructed based on strain Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA. As a result, the Mrp-deficient strain could synthesize equal amount of ectoine (around 7 g L or 500 mg (g DCW) ) in the medium containing lower concentration of NaCl. During a fed-batch fermentation process with 60 g L NaCl stress, a maximum 10. g L ectoine was accumulated by the Mrp-deficient strain, with a specific production of 765 mg (g DCW) and a yield of 0.21 g g monosodium glutamate.The remarkably enhanced production of ectoine by Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA implied the critical function of Doe pathway in the ectoine catabolism. Moreover, the reduced salinity requirement of Mrp-deficient strain implied a feasible protocol for many compatible solute biosynthesis, i.e., by silencing some Na/H antiporters in their halophilic producers and thus lowering the medium salinity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657437>How is the acyl chain composition of phosphoinositides created and does it matter?</a></h2><p>The phosphoinositide (PIPn) family of signalling phospholipids are central regulators in membrane cell biology. Their varied functions are based on the phosphorylation pattern of their inositol ring, which can be recognized by selective binding domains in their effector proteins and be modified by a series of specific PIPn kinases and phosphatases, which control their interconversion in a spatial and temporal manner. Yet, a unique feature of PIPns remains largely unexplored: their unusually uniform acyl chain composition. Indeed, while most phospholipids present a range of molecular species comprising acyl chains of diverse length and saturation, PIPns in several organisms and tissues show the predominance of a single hydrophobic backbone, which in mammals is composed of arachidonoyl and stearoyl chains. Despite evolution having favoured this specific PIPn configuration, little is known regarding the mechanisms and functions behind it. In this review, we explore the   that could control the acyl chain composition of PIPns as well as the potential roles of this selective enrichment. While our understanding of this phenomenon has been constrained largely by the technical limitations in the methods traditionally employed in the PIPn field, we believe that the latest developments in PIPn analysis should shed light onto this old question.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668375>Longitudinal Evolution of Markers of Mineral  in Patients With CKD: The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of disordered mineral  in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely informed by cross-sectional studies of humans and longitudinal animal studies.

Compared with other mineral metabolites, FGF-23 levels demonstrated the highest rate of change (velocity: first derivative of the function of concentration over time) and magnitude of acceleration (second derivative). These changes became evident approximately  years before ESKD and persisted without deceleration through ESKD onset. Rates of changes in PTH and phosphate levels increased modestly and without marked acceleration around the same time, with modest deceleration immediately before ESKD, when use of active vitamin D and phosphate binders increased.Individuals who entered the CRIC Study at early stages of CKD and who did not progress to ESKD were not studied.Among patients with progressive CKD, FGF-23 levels begin to increase  years before ESKD and continue to rapidly accelerate until transition to ESKD.Copyright © 2019 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs, which activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptor, are potent stimuli for adipocyte browning yet fail to induce  expression in mouse adipocytes. In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2. kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675536>Fructooligosaccharides and wheat bran fed at similar fermentation levels differentially affect the expression of genes involved in transport, signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and oncogenesis in the colon epithelia of healthy Fischer 344 rats.</a></h2><p>The influence of the source of fermentable material (FM) on the luminal concentrations of their end products and its effects on colon cell  and disease susceptibility is not well characterized. We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, 2%, or % FM) or FOS (~2%, %, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three SCFA transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at 2% and % FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To investigate whether central oligodendrocytosis and gliosis triggered an adaptive immune response, the impact of combining a standard (0.2%) or low (0.1%) dose of ingested CPZ with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB), using pertussis toxin (PT), was assessed in mice. 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for  weeks produced oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis  marked splenic atrophy (37%) and reduced levels of CD4 (44%) and CD8 (61%). Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for  weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for  weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods. Notably, CPZ(±PT)-feeding induced changes in the brain proteome related to the suppression of immune function, cellular , synaptic function and cellular structure/organization, indicating that demyelinating conditions, such as MS, can be initiated in the absence of adaptive immune system involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651125>Incidence of second primary malignancies in patients with thyroid cancer in the Turkish population</a></h2><p>Thyroid  cancer  is  the  most  common  endocrine  malignancy.

Different studies have shown that the incidence of breast cancer in patients followed due to thyroid cancer has increased, and vice versa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of second primary cancers in the follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer.In this study, 1196 patients with thyroid cancer were evaluated in the Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical School’s Department of Endocrinology between 2004 and 2018. Demographic characteristics and radiological and pathological results of the patients were recorded. The presence of accompanying second malignancies in patients with thyroid cancer was investigated.In  our  study,  985  (82.4%)  women  (mean  age:  46.1  ±  13.3  years)  and  211  (17.6%)  men  (mean  age:  49.9  ±  14.2  years)  were  evaluated. The median follow-up was 63 months (2–164 months). Of the 1196 patients, 1126 (94.1%) had no additional cancer and 70 (.9%) patients had a second malignancy.

The NL-ENIGMA study explored the effect of Souvenaid on synapse function in early AD by assessing cerebral glucose  (CMRglc) with F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).We conducted an exploratory double-blind randomized controlled single-center trial. Fifty patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia with evidence of amyloid pathology (cerebrospinal fluid or PET) were stratified for MMSE (20-24 and 25-30) and randomly 1:1 allocated to 24-week daily administration of 125 mL Souvenaid (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Dynamic 60-minute [F]FDG-PET scans (21 frames) with arterial sampling were acquired at baseline and 24 weeks. CMRglc was estimated by quantitative (K) and semiquantitative (standardized uptake value ratio, reference cerebellar gray matter) measurements in five predefined regions of interest and a composite region of interest. Change from baseline in CMRglc was compared between treatment groups by analysis of variance, adjusted for baseline CMRglc and MMSE stratum. Additional exploratory outcome parameters included voxel-based analyses by Statistical Parametric Mapping.No baseline differences between treatment groups were found (placebo/intervention: n = 25/25; age 66 ± 8/65 ± 7 years; female 44%/48%; MMSE 25 ± 3/25 ± 3). [F]FDG-PET data were available for quantitative (placebo n = 19, intervention n = 18) and semiquantitative (placebo n = 20, intervention n = 22) analyses. At follow-up, no change within treatment groups and no statistically significant difference in change between treatment groups in CMRglc in any regions of interest were found by both quantitative and semiquantitative analyses. No treatment effect was found in the cerebellar gray matter using quantitative measures. The additional Statistical Parametric Mapping analyses did not yield consistent differences between treatment groups.In this exploratory trial, we found no robust effect of 24-week intervention with Souvenaid on synapse function measured by [F]FDG-PET.

In , there are 14 members of the ABA receptor family, which are key positive regulators involved in ABA signaling. Besides reduced drought stress tolerance, the quadruple and sextuple mutants ( (1124) and  (112458) show abnormal growth phenotypes, such as decreases in yield and height, under non-stress conditions. However, it remains unknown whether ABA receptors mediate ABA signaling to regulate plant growth and development. Here, we showed the primary metabolite profiles of 1124, 112458 and wild-type (WT) plants grown under normal conditions. The  changes were significantly different between ABA receptor mutants and WT. Guanosine, for the biosynthesis of cyclic guanosine 3','-monophosphate (cGMP), is an important second messenger that acts to regulate the level of ABA. In addition, other amino acids were increased in the 112458 mutant, including proline.

On physical examination of buck showed fever, dullness, poor body condition and pale conjunctival mucous membrane.The peripheral blood smear revealed the mixed infection of  sp. and  sp. The blood picture showed anaemia and leukocytosis. The animal was treated with buparvaquone 2. mg/kg( and long acting oxytetracycline (20 mg/kg). Post treatment evaluation was done 7 days after initial treatment. Animal showed mild improvement in feed intake, the body temperature becomes normal, but showed tachycardia with weak pulse. Subsequently, animal showed severe emaciation with frequent urination. Urinalysis revealed glycosuria, ketonuria and acidic urine (pH = 6.0). Serum biochemistry revealed hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, increased level of fructosamine and triglycerides and confirmed spontaneous DKA.

In addition, although micro-TESE (mTESE) has been advocated as the gold standard for sperm retrieval in men with NOA, its superiority over conventional TESE (cTESE) remains conflicting.The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the currently available studies comparing the techniques of sperm retrieval and to identify clinical and biochemical factors predicting SRR in men with NOA. In addition, PRs and live birth rates (LBRs), as derived from subjects with NOA post-ICSI, were also analysed as secondary outcomes.An extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane search was performed. All trials reporting SRR derived from cTESE or mTESE in patients with NOA and their specific determinants were included. Data derived from genetic causes of NOA or testicular sperm aspiration were excluded.Out of 1236 studies, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, enrolling 21 404 patients with a mean age (± SD) of 35.0 ± 2.7 years. cTESE and mTESE were used in 56 and 43 studies, respectively. In addition, 10 studies used a mixed approach and 8 studies compared cTESE with mTESE approach. Overall, a SRR per TESE procedure of 47[45;49]% (mean percentage [95% CI]) was found. No differences were observed when mTESE was compared to cTESE (46[43;49]% for cTESE versus 46[42;49]% for mTESE). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SRR per cycle was independent of age and hormonal parameters at enrolment. However, the SRR increased as a function of testis volume. In particular, by applying ROC curve analysis, a mean testis volume higher than 12. ml predicted SRR >60% with an accuracy of 86.2% ± 0.01. In addition, SRR decreased as a function of the number of Klinefelter's syndrome cases included (S = -0.02[-0.04;-0.01]; P < 0.01. I = 0.12[-0.05;0.29]; P = 0.16). Information on fertility outcomes after ICSI was available in 42 studies. Overall, a total of 1096 biochemical pregnancies were reported (cumulative PR = 29[25;32]% per ICSI cycle). A similar rate was observed when LBR was analysed (569 live births with a cumulative LBR = 24[20;28]% per ICSI cycle). No influence of male and female age, mean testis volume or hormonal parameters on both PR and LBR per ICSI cycle was observed. Finally, a higher PR per ICSI cycle was observed when the use of fresh sperm was compared to cryopreserved sperm (PR = 35[30;40]%, versus 20[13;29]% respectively): however, this result was not confirmed when cumulative LBR per ICSI cycle was analysed (LBR = 30[20;41]% for fresh versus 20[12;31]% for cryopreserved sperm).This analysis shows that cTESE/mTESE in subjects with NOA results in SRRs of up to 50%, with no differences when cTESE was compared to mTESE. Retrieved sperms resulted in a LBR of up to 28% ICSI cycle. Although no difference between techniques was found, to conclusively clarify if one technique is superior to the other, there is a need for a sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare mTESE to cTESE in men with NOA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although the risk factors for HCC development are well known and great advances have been made through HBV vaccinations, direct-acting antivirals for HCV treatment, and aflatoxin eradication programs, the overall incidence and mortality rates of HCC are still rising. To tackle the burden of HCC, it is essential to understand the principle molecular and cellular processes as well as fundamental clinical challenges. This book provides an overview on several important disease aspects. Chapter 1 reviews recent studies assessing the potential cellular origins of HCC. Chapter 2 describes the newly discovered regulatory roles of the tumor microenvironment on tumor growth and progression. Chapters 3 and 4 outline the most commonly used in vitro systems and animal models of chronic liver disease and HCC in detail. Chapter  provides an overview of  reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid  as a newly recognized hallmark of HCC. Chapter 6 details the currently accepted standards and challenges for the surgical management of HCC, while Chapter 7 provides an overview of the recent developments in the field of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Chapter 8 discusses multidrug resistance to chemotherapy and potential approaches to overcome this clinical obstacle. The book, written by experts from several countries, addresses each topic in sophisticated detail. It will be a valuable resource for clinicians and investigators who are interested in HCC.Copyright © 2019 Codon Publications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661187>Clinical FDG-PET Findings in Patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Concordance with EEG and MRI.</a></h2><p>We aimed to study the yield of PET in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) by analyzing the correlation of PET findings with MRI, and interictal and ictal EEG findings, in a single-center cohort of patients with TLE. Predictors of PET thalamic changes and its role in predicting postsurgical outcome were also studied.This was a retrospective study of 39 patients with TLE who underwent MRI, PET, and scalp video EEG monitoring at the University at Buffalo, New York from 2001 to 2011 during presurgical evaluation. PET-defined  of the temporal lobes was evaluated using a 4-point ordinal rating scale.PET hypometabolism was associated with a variation in ictal (P = .034) and interictal (P < .001) foci in both lesional (by MRI) and nonlesional patients. Nonlesional MRI scans were associated with none to mild temporal PET hypometabolism (71% of patients) while lesional MRI scans were associated with moderate to severe hypometabolism (82% of patients) (P = .006). The odds of thalamic hypometabolism were .36 times higher when there was moderate to severe temporal hypometabolism (P = .039).This study underscores the utility of PET in localizing ictal foci in TLE patients even in those with normal MRI. The degree of PET hypometabolism corresponds to presence of MRI pathology. Coexistent thalamic hypometabolism with temporal hypometabolism suggests a secondary effect of distant temporal network disruption. Extratemporal  is a predictor of poor postsurgical seizure outcome in TLE patients.© 2019 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659381>Genome analysis provides insights into microaerobic toluene-degradation pathway of Zoogloea oleivorans Buc.</a></h2><p>Zoogloea oleivorans, capable of using toluene as a sole source of carbon and energy, was earlier found to be an active degrader under microaerobic conditions in aquifer samples. To uncover the genetic background of the ability of microaerobic toluene degradation in Z. oleivorans, the whole-genome sequence of the type strain Buc was revealed. Metatranscriptomic sequence reads, originated from a previous SIP study on microaerobic toluene degradation, were mapped on the genome. The genome (.68 Mb) had a mean G + C content of 62.%, 5005 protein coding gene sequences and 80 RNA genes. Annotation predicted that 66 genes were involved in the  of aromatic compounds. Genome analysis revealed the presence of a cluster with genes coding for a multicomponent phenol-hydroxylase system and a complete catechol meta-cleavage pathway. Another cluster flanked by mobile-element protein coding genes coded a partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway including a subfamily I.2.C-type extradiol dioxygenase. Analysis of metatranscriptomic data of a microaerobic toluene-degrading enrichment, containing Z .  oleivorans as an active-toluene degrader revealed that a toluene dioxygenase-like enzyme was responsible for the ring-hydroxylation, while enzymes of the partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway coding cluster were responsible for further degradation of the aromatic ring under microaerobic conditions. This further advances our understanding of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation between fully oxic and strictly anoxic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674039>Dasotraline as a Selective Cytochrome 2B6 Inhibitor for Reaction Phenotyping.</a></h2><p>Reaction phenotyping using human liver microsomes or hepatocytes with chemical inhibitors is one of the most commonly applied methods to assess fraction metabolized (f ) of drug candidates by enzymes. The f information is critical to the understanding the risk of victim drug-drug interactions in the clinic. Inhibitor selectivity is essential in order to generate reliable data and irreversible inhibitors are often preferred over reversible inhibitors to minimize the impact of inhibitor depletion. Although many selective cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors are available, identification of selective CYP2B6 inhibitors have been challenging due to cross inhibition to the other enzymes. In this study, dasotraline is evaluated as a selective inactivator of CYP2B6 under reaction phenotyping conditions with human hepatocytes. The results show that dasotraline is a very selective inactivator for CYP2B6 with minimal inhibition to other enzymes. A concentration of 0.1 μM dasotraline is recommended for reaction phenotyping with a hepatocyte cell density of 0. million cells/mL or 0. μM for 2 million cells/mL, when using a 15 minute preincubation, as well as the protocol of inactivator removal before addition of substrates.This article is protected by copyright.

In fetuses affected by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal blood cholesterol levels are low. Whether this is the result of a reduced materno-fetal cholesterol transport, or due to low fetal de novo synthesis rates, remains a matter of debate. By analyzing cholesterol interbolites and plant sterols we aimed at deeper insights into transplacental cholesterol transport and fetal cholesterol handling in IUGR with potential targets for future therapy. We hypothesized that placental insufficiency results in a diminished cholesterol supply to the fetus.Venous umbilical cord sera were sampled post-partum from fetuses delivered between 24 weeks of gestation and at full term. IUGR fetuses were matched to 49 adequate-for-age delivered preterm and term neonates (CTRL) according to gestational age at delivery. Cholesterol was measured by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection using 5a-cholestane as internal standard. Cholesterol precursors and synthesis markers, such as lanosterol, lathosterol, and desmosterol, the absorption markers, α-cholestanol and plant sterols, such as campesterol and sitosterol, as well as enzymatically oxidized cholesterol metabolites (oxysterols), such as 24S- or 27-hydroxycholesterol, were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, using epicoprostanol as internal standard for the non-cholesterol sterols and deuterium labeled oxysterols for 24S- and 27-hydroxycholesterol.Mean cholesterol levels were 25% lower in IUGR compared with CTRL (p < 0.0001). Lanosterol and lathosterol to cholesterol ratios were similar in IUGR and CTRL. In relation to cholesterol mean, desmosterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol levels were higher by 30.0, 39.1 and 60.7%, respectively, in IUGR compared to CTRL (p < 0.0001). Equally, α-cholestanol, campesterol, and β-sitosterol to cholesterol ratios were higher in IUGR than in CTRL (17.2%, p < 0.004; 33.%, p < 0.002; 29.3%, p < 0.021).Cholesterol deficiency in IUGR is the result of diminished fetal de novo synthesis rates rather than diminished maternal supply. However, increased oxysterol- and phytosterol to cholesterol ratios suggest a lower sterol elimination rate. This is likely caused by a restricted hepatobiliary function. Understanding the fetal cholesterol  is important, not only for neonatal nutrition, but also for the development of strategies to reduce the known risk of future cardiovascular diseases in the IUGR fetus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673622>Percutaneous endoscopic versus radiologic gastrostomy for enteral feeding: a retrospective analysis on outcomes and complications.</a></h2><p>  Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) are techniques used for long-term enteral feeding. Our primary aim was to analyze procedure-related and 30-day mortality and complications between PEG and PRG in relation to indications.   A single-center retrospective analysis was performed thath included all adult patients receiving initial PEG (January 2008 until April 2016) and PRG (January 2010 until April 2016). Outcomes were mortality (procedure-related, 30-day), complications (early (≤ 30 days) and late) and success rates.   A total of 760 procedures (469 PRG and 291 PEG) were analyzed. Most common indications were head and neck cancer (HNC), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Success rates for placement were 91.2 % for PEG and 97.1 % for PRG (   = 0.001). Procedure-related mortality was 1.7 % in PEG and 0.4 % in PRG (   = 0.113). The 30-day mortality was 10.7 % in PEG and .1 % in PRG (   = 0.481 after multivariate logistic regression) CVA was associated with higher 30-day mortality, whereas ALS, higher body weight, and prophylactic placements in HNC were associated with lower rates. Tube-related complications were less frequent in PEG, both early (2.7 % vs. 26.4 %,   ≤ 0.001) and late (8.6 % vs. 31. %,   ≤ 0.001). The percentage of major complications and infections did not differ.   With respect to procedure-related and 30-day mortality, PEG and PRG compare equally. PRG had a higher procedural success rate. Tube-related complications and pain are less frequent after PEG compared to PRG. The choice for either PEG or PRG therefore should primarily be based on local facilities and expertise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658882>Impact of peripheral mutations on the access channels of human cytochrome P450 1A2.</a></h2><p>As an important member of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, human CYP1A2 is associated with the  of caffeine and melatonin and the activation of precarcinogens. Besides, this CYP protein also involves in the  of -10% clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate . To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on lipid membranes. Free energy calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations do not influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel. R431W causes a sidechain conformational rearrangement for aromatic residues around the substrate channel, making it in a closed state in most cases. Our computational simulations demonstrate that pi-pi stacking interactions are essential for substrate binding and channel opening. It is hoped that these findings may be of general relevance to the mutation-induced activity changes for CYP proteins, providing useful information for understanding the CYP-mediated drug .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675538>PPARG and FTO polymorphism can modulate the outcomes of a central European diet and a Mediterranean diet in centrally obese postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that polymorphism of genes with the biggest effects on body mass (FTO and PPARG) can affect the results of dieting in centrally obese postmenopausal women. A total of 144 volunteers were randomized to a 16-week intervention with two hypocaloric diets: either a Mediterranean diet (MED) moderate in fat (37% total energy as fat) or the Central European diet (CED) moderate in carbohydrates (55% total energy as carbohydrates). The associations between FTO and PPARG polymorphism on the baseline body mass, body composition, blood pressure, lipid and non-lipid parameters, and their changes after the trial were analyzed. None of the examined baseline outcomes differed in the rs9939609 FTO subgroups; abdominal fat was higher in the minor (G) allele carriers of the PPARG rs1801282. After the intervention, in the CED group, the PPARG G allele carriers showed greater reductions in weight (-6.58 ± 0.61 vs -9.58 ± 0.83; P < .01), lean mass (-0.38 ± 0.29 vs -1.79 ± 0.38; P < .05) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (-0.46 ± 0.77 vs -.25 ± 1.49; P < .01) than the CC homozygotes, and the TT individuals of the rs9939609 FTO had greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure (-9.03 ± 1.78 vs. -7.58 ± 1.50; P < .05). In the MED group, greater reductions in abdominal fat were observed in the G allele carriers than in the CC homozygotes (-3.31 ± 0.26 vs. -4.23 ± 0.41; P < .05). PPARG and FTO polymorphism may affect the outcomes of the diets aimed at weight reduction in postmenopausal women.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It is necessary to look beyond neuropathology to identify the underlying causes of AD and many other common neurological diseases. Lipid abnormalities are well documented in the preclinical phases of many neurological diseases including AD. Here, we use AD as an example to examine the role of lipid abnormalities as an underlying cause of neurodegeneration. Role of lipids, particularly phospholipids, in the optimal function of the nervous system, impact of the aberrations of phospholipid  on β-amyloid deposition and cholinergic neuronal function, epidemiological evidence on the association of phospholipids with AD, and preliminary data on the possible modulation of risk factors of AD by phospholipids are examined. Implications of these findings on diagnosis and prevention are also discussed.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654131>Accuracy of liver stiffness measurement and controlled attenuation parameter using FibroScan M/XL probes to diagnose liver fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a multicenter prospective study.</a></h2><p>Few studies have evaluated both liver fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using both FibroScan M and XL probes. This study was performed to investigate the accuracy of both FibroScan probes to diagnose liver fibrosis and steatosis in patients with NAFLD.We prospectively enrolled 137 consecutive patients with clinically suspected NAFLD in our joint-research facilities. Liver biopsies, liver stiffness measurements (LSMs), and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurements were performed, and 122 patients with NAFLD diagnosed pathologically by central pathologists were included in the final analysis.Reliable LSM results were obtained in 85.2% (M) and 89.3% (XL) of patients, and CAP was reliable in 90.2% (M) and 90.2% (XL). The median LSM was significantly lower with the XL than M probe, and CAP was significantly higher with the XL than M probe. The optimal cut-off values for diagnosing the fibrosis stage were lower for LSM with the XL than M probe (stage ≥ 2, 6.7 vs. 7.0; stage ≥ 3, 8.2 vs. 10.8; stage 4, 14.3 vs. 16.8, respectively), whereas those of CAP were higher for the XL than M probe (score of ≥ 2, 273 vs. 267; score of 3, 302 vs. 286, respectively). There were no significant differences in accuracy of the LSM and CAP between the probes.Liver fibrosis and steatosis could be equally evaluated with FibroScan M and XL probes in patients with NAFLD.

However, it was also being sold as 'ketamine' misleading people to believe that they were getting genuine ketamine. Dissociative anaesthetics have also come to the attention of psychiatric field due to their potential properties in the treatment of depression. At present, there is dearth of information on deschloroketamine related to its , biodistribution and its mechanism of action. We have therefore carried out a metabolomics study for deschloroketamine via non-targeted screening of urine samples employing liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry. We developed and validated a multiple reaction monitoring method using a triple quadrupole instrument to track metabolites of deschloroketamine. Furthermore, significant metabolites of deschloroketamine, (trans-dihydrodeschloroketamine, cis- and trans-dihydronordeschloroketamine, and nordeschloroketamine), were synthesized in-house. The prepared standards were utilized in the developed multiple reaction monitoring method. The quantification method for serum samples provided intra-day accuracy ranging from 86-112% with precision of 3% in average. The concentrations of cis/trans-dihydronordeschloroketamines and trans-dihydrodeschloroketamine were lower than 10 ng/mL, nordeschloroketamine and deschloroketamine ranged from 0. to 860 ng/mL in real samples. The quantification method for brain tissue provided intra-day accuracy ranging from 80-125% with precision of 7% in average. The concentrations of cis/trans-dihydronordeschloroketamines and trans-dihydrodeschloroketamine ranged from 0. to 70 ng/g, nordeschloroketamine and deschloroketamine varied from 0. to 4700 ng/g in real samples.This article is protected by copyright.

The role of this  pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine  by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a  pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the  of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667854>Metabolomics analysis in adults with High Bone Mass identifies a relationship between bone resorption and circulating citrate which replicates in the general population.</a></h2><p>Bone turnover, which regulates bone mass, may exert  consequences, particularly on markers of glucose  and adiposity. To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and  traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score≥+3.2).β-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.  traits, including lipids and glycolysis-related metabolites, were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with  traits were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use).198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77% female. Of 23 summary  traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted β =0.050 (95% CI 0.024,0.076),p=1.71x10 , β =6.54x10 (1.87x10 ,0.001),p=0.006 and β =2.40x10 (6.49x10 ,4.14x10 ),p=0.007 (β= increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1μg/L BTM increase). Inverse relationships of β-CTX (β=-0.276 [-0.434,-0.118],p=6.03x10 ) and osteocalcin (-0.004 [-0.007,-0.001],p=0.020) with triglycerides were also identified. We explored the generalizability of these associations in 3,664 perimenopausal women (age 47.9 [4.4] years) from a UK family cohort. We confirmed a positive, albeit lower magnitude, association between β-CTX and citrate (adjusted β =0.020 [0.013,0.026],p=1.95x10 ) and an inverse association of similar magnitude between β-CTX and triglycerides (β=-0.354 [-0.471,-0.237],p=3.03x10 ).Bone resorption is positively related to circulating citrate and inversely related to triglycerides. Further studies are justified to determine whether plasma citrate or triglyceride concentrations are altered by factors known to modulate bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654722>Impaired  of kynurenine and its metabolites in CSF of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>The kynurenine (KYN) pathway plays an important role in degrading molecules responsible for oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS), but can also have neurotoxic effects. Both 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and quinolinic acid are neurotoxic metabolites produced from this pathway. In Parkinson's disease (PD), oxidative stress is suspected to represent a key pathogenic mechanism. This study aimed to investigate the function of the KYN pathway and interactions between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in PD.Participants comprised 20 patients with PD and 13 controls. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of KYN and 3-HK were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector. CSF levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon (IFN)-γ were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and results were statistically compared between PD patients and controls.Median CSF levels of KYN and 3-HK were 49.0 nM and 4.25 nM in PD and 30. nM and 1.55 nM in controls, respectively, showing significantly higher levels in PD (p < 0.05). CSF levels of measured cytokines showed that TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. No positive correlation between 3-HK and TNF-α was seen in PD.Dysfunction of the KYN pathway may induce oxidative stress in the CNS in PD, and may also induce cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation. Functional amelioration of the KYN pathway may facilitate modification of neurodegenerative processes in PD.Copyright © 2019.

Of these, 616 were seen again 3 y later for the longitudinal analysis. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) was calculated from a validated diet history questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/m2; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men. The association between incident falls and E-DII was partly mediated by concentrations of IL-7.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653715>A 'Select and Resequence' approach reveals strain-specific effects of Medicago nodule-specific PLAT-domain genes.</a></h2><p>Genetic studies of legume symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria have traditionally focused on nodule and nitrogen-fixation phenotypes when hosts are inoculated with a single rhizobial strain. These approaches overlook the potential effect of host genes on rhizobial fitness (i.e., how many rhizobia are released from host nodules) and strain-specific effects of host genes (i.e., genome x genome interactions). Using Medicago truncatula mutants in the recently described Nodule-specific PLAT Domain (NPD) gene family, we show how inoculating plants with a mixed inoculum of 68 rhizobial strains (Ensifer meliloti) via a select-and-resequence (S&R) approach can be used to efficiently assay host mutants for strain-specific effects of late-acting host genes on interacting bacteria. The deletion of a single NPD gene (npd2) or all five members of the NPD gene family (npd1-) differentially altered the frequency of rhizobial strains in nodules even though npd2 mutants had no visible nodule morphology or N-fixation phenotype. Also, npd1- nodules were less diverse and had larger populations of colony-forming rhizobia despite their smaller size. Lastly, NPD mutations disrupt a positive correlation between strain fitness and wild-type host biomass. These changes indicate that the effects of NPD proteins are strain dependent and that NPD family members are not redundant with regard to their effects on rhizobial strains. Association analyses of the rhizobial strains in the mixed inoculation indicate that rhizobial genes involved in chromosome segregation, cell division, GABA , efflux systems, and stress tolerance play an important role in the strain-specific effects of NPD genes.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

After IVI, SO2a significantly decreased in CNV and DME eyes by 2.6% (p = 0.016) and 4.6% (p = 0.002) and SO2v decreased by 14.0% (p = 0.004) and 12.4% (p = 0.017), respectively. However, a significant increase in AVD was only found in CNV (15.7%, p = 0.001). VDa decreased significantly only in DME by .7% (p = 0.010). No medication-specific disease effect was found and vice versa.The observed changes can be interpreted as signs of increased  demand during the physiological stress after an IVI. The abnormal arterial constriction and the abolished increase in AVD seen only in eyes with DME indicate an impairment of vascular autoregulation and oxygen distribution and a reduced neuroretinal  in the diabetic retina with a significant impact on inner retinal oxygen consumption shortly after IVI.© 2019 The Authors.

Two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) study using genetic variations as instrumental variables to infer causality. Summary statistics of genome-wide association study of serum calcium (N=39,400) and life-long whole-body BMD (N=66,628) were used.BMD measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.In NHANES 2003-6 and HKOS, each SD increase in serum calcium was significantly associated with 0.036-0.092 SD decrease in BMD at various sites (all P<0.05). In multivariable inverse-variance weighted MR analysis, genetic predisposition to higher serum calcium level was inversely associated with whole-body BMD after adjustment for serum parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and phosphate (-0.431 SD per SD increase in serum calcium; 95% CI: -0.773 to -0.089, P=0.014). Similar estimates were obtained in sensitivity analyses.Our study reveals that genetic predisposition to higher serum calcium level per se may have negative impact on bone . Whether increased serum calcium caused by calcium/vitamin D supplementations would have the same negative effect on bone remains unknown, which warrants further investigation. In addition to other adverse clinical outcomes, careful use of high-dose supplementations is required.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = ) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

The link between OCM, apolipoprotein E (APOE), and DNA methylation creates a biologically plausible mechanism of interaction.To assess OCM metabolites as predictors of -year cognitive prognosis in patients with mild dementia, and in subgroups defined by the APOEε4 allele variant.We followed one-hundred and fifty-two patients with mild dementia (86 with Alzheimer's disease, 66 with Lewy body dementia, including 90 with at least one APOEε4 allele) for  years with annual Mini-Mental State Examinations (MMSE). Total homocysteine, methionine, choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, folate, cobalamin and pyridoxal '-phoshate were measured in serum at baseline. We used linear mixed models to assess metabolite-MMSE associations, including 3-way interactions between metabolites, time, and APOEε4. False-discovery rate adjusted p-values (Q-values) are reported.Metabolite concentrations were not different in patients with dementia according to the presence of APOEε4. Overall, serum concentration of total homocysteine was inversely associated with MMSE performance, while betaine was positively associated with MMSE (Q < 0.05), but neither was associated with MMSE decline. Serum concentrations of betaine, dimethylglycine and sarcosine, however, were associated with slower MMSE decline in patients with APOEε4, but with faster MMSE decline in patients without the allele (all 3-way interactions: Q < 0.05).Components of the choline oxidation pathway are associated with a better cognitive prognosis in APOEε4 carriers and a worse cognitive prognosis in non-carriers.

Participants were classified as having normoglycemia, borderline glycemia, or diabetes mellitus (DM) with prior CAD (CAD+) or without prior CAD (CAD-). Cox regression model identified variables related to the incidence of CAD.Among CAD-, management of traditional risks differed from those with and without subsequent CAD events. On the other hand, such differences were weaker in borderline glycemia and DM CAD+, and the influence of traditional risk factors on subsequent CAD was not observed. Cox regression model showed that borderline glycemia and DM confer approximately 1.2- and 2.8-fold excess risks of CAD, respectively, compared with CAD- with normoglycemia. CAD+ confers approximately a - to 8-fold increased risk. The impacts of DM and prior CAD additively reached a hazard ratio (HR) of 15.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.82-21.00). However, the HR in those with borderline glycemia and CAD+ was 7.20 (95%CI: .01-10.34), which was not different from those with normoglycemia and CAD+.Control status of traditional risk factors and impact on subsequent CAD differ among categories of glycemic status with and without prior CAD.

Filamentous bacterial cells could represent a possible strategy to increase PHA yield, since more abundant PHA inclusions can be stored in elongated than in rod-shaped cells. At first, we determined the optimal batch culture conditions to induce filamentation in Pseudomonas mediterranea CFBP-5447T, using glutamine, glycerol, glucose, and sodium octanoate, as the sole carbon source, at low- (100 rpm) or high- (250 rpm) shaking speeds. Successively, a fermentative process was set up using glutamine in a co- strategy with glycerol, and the PHAs production was compared in rod-shaped and filamentous cells. High glutamine concentrations (from 28 to 56 mM) were able to induce alone filamentation, whereas at lower glutamine concentrations (-10 mM), the shaking speeds became critical to allow or not filamentous phenotype. PHA granule production was higher in filamentous than in rod-shaped cells, when glycerol (46.6 mM) was added to glutamine ( mM) in co-, and fermentation was performed at a low-shaking speed. After extraction and precipitation, PHA yield was about two times higher in filamentous than that rod-shaped cells. Our results provide new insights into filament-inducing conditions and indicate a potential use of filamentous P. mediterranea CFBP-5447T cells to increase PHA yield. These findings could have great advantages in PHAs recovering during downstream processes, since the harvesting of elongated cells is much less time-consuming and energy expensive than required with rod-shaped cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666195>Circulating amino acid signature in older people with Parkinson's disease: A  complement to the EXosomes in PArkiNson Disease (EXPAND) study.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in old age. Neurotoxicity of dopaminergic neurons triggered by aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein is a major pathogenic trait of PD. However, growing evidence indicates that peripheral processes, including  changes, may precede and contribute to neurodegeneration. The present study was undertaken to identify a  signature of PD through the quantification of serum amino acids and derivatives.Twenty older adults with PD (11 men and 9 women; mean age 73.1 ± 10.2 years) and 30 age-matched controls (14 men and 16 women; mean age 74.6 ± 4.3 years) were enrolled. A panel of 37 serum amino acids and derivatives was assessed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) followed by double cross-validation was used to characterize the relationship between amino acid profiles and PD.The optimal complexity of the PLS-DA model was found to be three latent variables. The proportion of correct classifications was 99.3 ± 2.% for participants with PD and 94.7 ± 3.0% for non-PD controls. Higher levels of β-amino butyric acid, cystine, ornithine, phosphoethanolamine, and proline defined the circulating amino acid profile of older people with PD. Controls were characterized by higher concentrations of 3-methyl-histidine, citrulline, and serine.Our findings indicate the existence of a distinct metabotype in older persons with PD. Future studies will have to establish whether changes in amino acid  are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. This knowledge may be harnessed to identify novel disease biomarkers as well as new targets for interventions.Copyright © 2019.

Additionally, to compare health-related quality of life and subjective visual functioning before and after 4 years of treatment.Fifty-eight patients with DMO were evaluated after 4 years of antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment. VA, CRT and clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. Health-related quality of life and subjective visual functioning were evaluated with Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and National Eye Institute Vision Functioning Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25). Comparisons between independent groups were performed using Pearson's χ test, Fisher's exact test or Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman's ρ was used for correlation analyses. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison between dependent groups. Logistic regression analysis was applied for analysis of VA and CRT over 4 years.Follow-up data were obtained from 37 of 58 (63.8%) patients.

Its coenzyme A (CoA) derivative, itaconyl-CoA, inhibits B-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that itaconyl-CoA is a suicide inactivator of human and  MCM, which forms a markedly air-stable biradical adduct with the '-deoxyadenosyl moiety of the B coenzyme. Termination of the catalytic cycle in this way impairs communication between MCM and its auxiliary repair proteins. Crystallography and spectroscopy of the inhibited enzyme are consistent with a metal-centered cobalt radical ~6 angstroms away from the tertiary carbon-centered radical and suggest a means of controlling radical trajectories during MCM catalysis. Mycobacterial MCM thus joins enzymes in the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle as targets of itaconate in pathogen propionate .Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The study demonstrated that estimates of fracture risk by FRAX without BMD were higher than those by FRAX with BMD in women with old age.BMD is an integral component for bone strength assessment, but age-specific impacts of BMD on fracture risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making remained unclear. We aimed to investigate whether using BMD measurement changed the interpretation of the FRAX-based fracture probability assessment and treatment decision.The database was provided by the Taiwanese Osteoporosis Association (TOA) which conducted a nationwide survey of BMD. We calculated the 10-year major and hip fracture probabilities using the FRAX for each participant, either with (FRAX + BMD) or without BMD (FRAX - BMD). Age-specific individual intervention thresholds (IITs) were established using the FRAX-based fracture risk, equivalent to a woman with a prior fracture. Participants whose FRAX scores of major fracture were greater than or equal to their IITs were deemed suitable for therapeutic intervention.A total of 14,007 postmenopausal women were enrolled. Compared with FRAX + BMD, FRAX - BMD predicted lower FRAX scores in major and hip fractures in subjects aged 40-60 years; however, FRAX - BMD estimated higher risks for those aged 61-90 years. The therapeutic decision using FRAX - BMD was concordant to that using FRAX + BMD in 90.% of the subjects, especially in the younger age group (40-70 years). FRAX - BMD identified more treatment candidates (7.7-16.4%) among those aged 71-90 years.The FRAX scores are influenced by age, irrespective of the consideration of BMD. FRAX - BMD is able to identify more subjects for therapeutic intervention in the elderly population. We should reconsider the role of BMD at different ages for therapeutic decision-making.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670287>Lifetime overproduction of circulating angiotensin-(1-7) in rats attenuates the increase in skeletal muscle damage biomarkers after exhaustive exercise.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-[1-7]) can modulate glucose  and protect against muscular damage.

Hydralazine is an FDA-approved drug used in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure and cancer. Hydralazine has been recently shown to promote lifespan in C. elegans, rotifer and yeast through a mechanism which has remained elusive. Here we report cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as the direct target of hydralazine. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate a mechanism in which binding and stabilization of a catalytic subunit of PKA by hydralazine lead to improved mitochondrial function and  homeostasis via the SIRT1/SIRT5 axis, which underlies hydralazine's prolongevity and stress resistance benefits. Hydralazine also protects mitochondrial  and function resulting in restoration of health and lifespan in C. elegans under high glucose and other stress conditions.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after -weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine . This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte . In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed -fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino acids. The automated system used HPLC to separate amino acids followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino acids. Eight mammalian keratin samples from herbivores (kudu and caribou), omnivores (humans) and carnivores (bowhead and humpback zooplanktivorous whales) were analysed with this new system. The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino acid carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino acids during normal . Analyses of non-essential amino acid isotope profiles showed (1) consistent and general taxon-level  differences between the herbivore, human and whale samples, (2) marked differences among individual humans, ruminants and whales (3) evidence for gluconeogenesis in the wildlife samples, and (4) extensive 13C enrichment likely associated with fasting in the humpback whale sample.

However, the molecular and biochemical changes due to moist snuff consumption relative to smoking remain incompletely understood. We previously reported that smokers (SMK) exhibit elevated oxidative stress and inflammation relative to moist snuff consumers (MSC) and non-tobacco consumers (NTC), based on metabolomic profiling data of saliva, plasma, and urine from MSC, SMK, and NTC. In this study, we investigated the effects of tobacco consumption on additional   using pathway-based analysis tools. To this end,  pathway enrichment analysis and topology analysis were performed through pair-wise comparisons of global metabolomic profiles of SMK, MSC, and NTC. The analyses identified >8 significantly perturbed   in SMK compared with NTC and MSC in all 3 matrices. Among these differentially enriched , perturbations of caffeine , energy , and arginine  were mostly observed. In comparison, fewer enriched   were identified in MSC compared with NTC ( in plasma, none in urine and saliva). This is consistent with our transcriptomics profiling results that show no significant differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression between MSC and NTC. These findings, taken together with our previous biochemical, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analysis results, provide a better understanding of the relative changes in healthy tobacco consumers, and demonstrate that chronic cigarette smoking, relative to the use of smokeless tobacco, results in more pronounced biological changes, which could culminate in smoking-related diseases.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654053>ABCG5/G8: a structural view to pathophysiology of the hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion.</a></h2><p>The ABCG5/G8 heterodimer is the primary neutral sterol transporter in hepatobiliary and transintestinal cholesterol excretion.

The  prolidase enzyme plays an important role in collagen synthesis. We aimed to investigate the association of prolidase levels with brucellosis.Serum prolidase levels in 20 patients newly diagnosed with brucellosis were compared with levels in 30 healthy control subjects. Patients with brucellosis were reassessed 3 months later for prolidase, other laboratory measurements, and response to treatment.The levels of serum prolidase were significantly higher in brucellosis patients compared with those of healthy controls. Prolidase, sedimentation, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower after antibrucellosistreatment than before treatment.The  current  study  is  the  first  to  demonstrate  significantly  increased  serum  prolidase  levels  in  patients  with  brucellosis  compared with healthy controls. Prolidase levels also significantly decreased with antibrucellosis treatment. This finding provides a new experimental basis to understand the pathogenesis of brucellosis in relation to collagen . The increase in serum prolidase levels might be related to several factors such as tissue destruction, increased fibroblastic activity, and granuloma formation, all of which are involved in the natural history of brucellosis.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667314>Proteome dataset of subcutaneous adipose tissue from postpartum cows treated with sodium salicylate.</a></h2><p>This article contains raw and processed data related to research published by Takiya et al. [1]. Literature have shown that treatment with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent sodium salicylate () during the first days postpartum in dairy cows increased lactation performance [2], and tended to alter glucose  [3]. Yet, the specific effects of systemic SS treatment on the proteome of the adipose tissue () and on the inflammatory process in AT of postpartum cows is unknown. Subcutaneous AT samples were collected at 7 d of lactation from control cows (n = ) and from cows treated with 2.3 g/L SS (n = ) via drinking water during the first 7 d of lactation. Protein extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were performed to obtain proteomics data. Differential abundance of proteins was determined through MS1 intensity based label-free method. Proteomics analysis generated a novel dataset consisted of 1422 proteins, 80 (.6%) of which were differentially abundant [fold change ± 1.,  < 0.05 2-way ANOVA] when comparing control and SS-treated cows. The present dataset of subcutaneous AT proteome from postpartum dairy cows treated with SS can be used as a reference for any research involving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent treatment in dairy cows or in comparative research between species.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655017>A Pilot study of Preproinsulin Peptides Reactivity in Chinese Patients with Type 1 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The aim of our study is to investigate whether preproinsulin (PPI) could trigger a proinflammatory CD4 T cell response in Chinese patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D).Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by a pool of 13 PPI peptides. Additional  PPI peptides previously proved to be antigenic in other cohorts of patients with T1D were also used. PPI reactive T cell responses were measured by interferon (IFN)-γ ELISPOT assay.51 Chinese patients with T1D were enrolled in this study and 72.34% of them were positive for at least one islet autoantibody. The stimulation index (SI) value of IFN-γ response to PPI peptide pool or peptides with dominant epitopes was below 3 in patients when SI≥3 was used as the positive cut-off value. 2 peptides (B9-23, C19-A3) restricted to DQ8 or DR4 molecule failed to induce positive IFN-γ response in patients with high risk HLA-DQ8 or HLA-DR4/DR9 alleles. RNA-seq analysis of PPI specific CD4 T cell lines further showed that most of the IFN-γ associated genes remained unchanged.This is the first report of CD4 T cell epitope mapping of PPI in Chinese T1D. The lack of positive IFN-γ response to PPI peptides indicates that PPI might not be the principal antigenic candidate for autoreactive CD4 T cells in Chinese T1D. Therefore, the efficacy of PPI-based immunotherapies in attenuating proinflammatory CD4 T cell response requires further investigation.This article is protected by copyright.

Although reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) enabling the determination of these analytes has been used, they were limited in chromatographic signal intensity and reproducibility due to significant peak tailing caused by complexing with metallic cations and phosphate groups. In this work, we applied the LC-MS/MS with metal-free column for comprehensive quantification of 40 analytes regarding to purine and pyrimidine  in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (pCSF) from AD. For the analytical column, an InertSustain AQ-C18 metal-free PEEK column was used. MS detection is electrospray positive ionization. Metal-free column allows for a sharp peak detection of highly polar metabolites within running time (17 min). In validation, LOD, LOQ and recovery using pooled pCSF sample showed 1-500 nM, 0.-250 nM and a range of 53.1%-144.0% (RSD ranged from 0.4% to 19.6%). The developed LC-MS/MS method utilizing a metal-free column provides an accurate quantification of some metabolites regarding to purine and pyrimidine  in pCSF sample obtained from AD patient.This article is protected by copyright.

We evaluated the prognostic value of changes in serum amino acid concentrations in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) METHODS: Seventy-five PBC patients who started urusodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy were retrospectively enrolled. Baseline serum concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and tyrosine, and BCAA-to-tyrosine ratio (BTR) were determined. The hazard ratios (HRs) of factors associated with liver-related events were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard analysis.Of the 75 patients enrolled, 12 showed a decrease in serum BCAA levels and 15 showed an increase in serum tyrosine levels. The BTR decreased in 16 patients. During a median .6-year follow-up, liver-related events occurred in 11 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that high serum tyrosine levels at baseline and high alkaline phosphatase levels 48 weeks after starting UDCA therapy were independent risk factors for event occurrence. From the receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, serum tyrosine concentration >110 μmol/L was identified as a cutoff value with an adjusted HR 20.9 (95% confidence interval: 4.3-101., P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the -year cumulative incidences of event occurrence in patients with high and low serum tyrosine concentration were 56.% and .%, respectively (P < 0.001). The 10-year survival probabilities also showed significant differences between patients with high and low serum tyrosine concentration (44.9% vs. 92.0%, P < 0.001).Elevation of serum tyrosine concentration indicates high risk of liver-related events in PBC patients under UDCA therapy.This article is protected by copyright.

Local tissue inflammation is difficult to assess serially during pathogenesis. While F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulates in inflammatory leukocytes which may identify inflammation in the myocardial microenvironment, it remains unclear whether this imaging technique can isolate diffuse leukocytes in pressure overload heart failure. We aimed to evaluate the capability to serially image inflammation with F-FDG in the early stages of pressure overload-induced heart failure, and to compare the timecourse to functional impairment assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  C57Bl6/N mice underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC,  = 22) or sham surgery ( = 12), or coronary ligation as an inflammation-positive control ( = ). MRI assessed ventricular geometry and contractile function at d2 and d8 after TAC. Immunostaining identified the extent of inflammatory leukocyte infiltration early in pressure overload. F-FDG PET scans were acquired at d3 and d7 after TAC, under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia to suppress cardiomyocyte glucose uptake.  Pressure overload evokes rapid left ventricular dilation compared to sham (end systolic volume, d2: 40.6±10.2µL vs. 23.8 ±1.7µL, p<0.001). Contractile function was similarly impaired (ejection fraction, d2: 40.9 ± 9.7% vs. 59.2 ± 4.4%, p<0.001). Severity of contractile impairment was proportional to histology-defined myocardial macrophage density at d8 (r=-0.669;  = 0.010). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging identified significantly higher F-FDG accumulation in the left ventricle of TAC compared to sham mice at d3 (10.±4.1%ID/g vs. 3.8±0.9%ID/g, p<0.001) and at d7 (7.8±3.7%ID/g vs.3.0 ±0.8%ID/g  = 0.006), though the efficiency of cardiomyocyte suppression was variable between TAC mice. The F-FDG signal correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.75,  = 0.01) and ventricle volumes (r=0.75, p<0.01). Western immunoblotting demonstrated 60% elevation of myocardial glucose transporter 4 expression in the left ventricle at d8 after TAC, indicating altered glucose .  TAC induces rapid changes in left ventricle geometry and contractile function, with a parallel modest infiltration of inflammatory macrophages.  remodeling overshadows inflammatory leukocyte signal using F-FDG PET imaging. More selective inflammatory tracers are requisite to selectively identify the diffuse local inflammation in pressure overload.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660859>Genomic characteristics and comparative genomics analysis of the endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae.</a></h2><p>Sarocladium brachiariae is a newly identified endophytic fungus isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. A previous study indicated that S. brachiariae had antifungal activity; however, limited genomic information restrains further study. Therefore, we sequenced the genome of S. brachiariae and compared it with the genome of S. oryzae to identify differences between a Sarocladium plant pathogen and an endophyte.In this study, we reported a gapless genome sequence of a newly identified endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. The genome of S. brachiariae is 31.86 Mb, with a contig N50 of 3.27 Mb and 9903 protein coding genes. Phylogenomic analysis based on single copy orthologous genes provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of S. brachiariae and its closest species was identified as S. oryzae. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that S. brachiaria has 14.9% more plant cell wall degradation related CAZymes to S. oryzae, and 33.3% more fungal cell wall degradation related CAZymes, which could explain the antifungal activity of S. brachiaria. Based on Antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis, we identified a contact helvolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for the first time in S. oryzae. However, S. brachiaria had seven fewer terpene gene clusters, including helvolic acid BGC, compared with S. oryzae and this may be associated with adaptation to an endophytic lifestyle. Synteny analysis of polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and hybrid (PKS-NRPS) gene clusters between S. brachiariae and S. oryzae revealed that just 37.% of tested clusters have good synteny, while 63.% have no or poor synteny. This indicated that the S. brachiariae could potentially synthesize a variety of unknown-function secondary metabolites, which may play an important role in adaptation to its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.The data provided a better understanding of the Sarocladium brachiariae genome. Further comparative genomic analysis provided insight into the genomic basis of its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666192>Hypothalamic C2-domain protein involved in MC4R trafficking and control of energy balance.</a></h2><p>Rates of overweight and obesity epidemic have risen significantly in the past few decades, and 34% of adults and 15-20% of children and adolescents in the United States are now obese. Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), contributes to appetite control in hypothalamic neurons and is a target for future anti-obesity treatments (such as setmelanotide) or novel drug development effort. Proper MC4R trafficking regulation in hypothalamic neurons is crucial for normal neural control of homeostasis and is altered in obesity and in presence of lipids. The mechanisms underlying altered MC4R trafficking in the context of obesity is still unclear. Here, we discovered that C2CD5 expressed in the hypothalamus is involved in the regulation of MC4R endocytosis. This study unmasked a novel trafficking protein nutritionally regulated in the hypothalamus providing a novel target for MC4R dependent  involved in bodyweight homeostasis and Obesity.To evaluate the expression of C2cd5, we first used in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology in combination with electronic microscopy. For in vivo, we characterized the energy balance of wild type (WT) and C2CD5 whole-body knockout (C2CD5KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) and/or western-diet (high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) (WD). To this end, we performed comprehensive longitudinal assessment of bodyweight, energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, locomotor activity using TSE  cages), and glucose homeostasis. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of loss of C2CD5 on feeding behavior changes normally induced by MC4R agonist (Melanotan, MTII) injection in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH). For in vitro approach, we tease out the role of C2CD5 and its calcium sensing domain C2 in MC4R trafficking. We focused on endocytosis of MC4R using an antibody feeding experiment (in a neuronal cell line - Neuro2A (N2A) stably expressing HA-MC4R-GFP; against HA-tag and analyzed by flux cytometry).We found that 1) the expression of hypothalamic C2CD5 is decreased in diet-induced obesity models compared to controls, 2) mice lacking C2CD5 exhibit an increase in food intake compared to WT mice, 3) C2CD5 interacts with endocytosis machinery in hypothalamus, 4) loss of functional C2CD5 (lacking C2 domain) blunts MC4R endocytosis in vitro and increases MC4R at the surface that fails to respond to MC4R ligand, and, ) C2CD5KO mice exhibit decreased acute responses to MTII injection into the PVH.Based on these, we conclude that hypothalamic C2CD5 is involved in MC4R endocytosis and regulate bodyweight homeostasis. These studies suggest that C2CD5 represents a new protein regulated by  cues and involved in  receptor endocytosis. C2CD5 represent a new target and pathway that could be targeted in Obesity.Copyright © 2019.

We hypothesized that HE increases the risk of both VA and SCA and that glucose-lowering agents causing HE also increase the risk of VA/SCA in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).Patients aged 20 years or older with newly diagnosed T2D were identified using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. HE was defined as the presentation of hypoglycaemic coma or specified/unspecified hypoglycaemia. The control group consisted of T2D patients without HE. The primary outcome was the occurrence of VA (including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation) and SCA during the defined follow-up periods. A multivariate Cox hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) for VA or SCA.A total of 54 303 patients were screened, with 1037 patients with HE assigned to the HE group and 4148 frequency-matched patients without HE constituting the control group. During a mean follow-up period of 3.3 ± 2. years, 29 VA/SCA events occurred. Compared with the control group, HE group had a higher incidence of VA/SCA (adjusted HR: 2.42, P = .04). Patients who had used insulin for glycaemic control showed an increased risk of VA/SCA compared with patients who did not receive insulin (adjusted HR: 3.05, P = .01).The HEs in patients with T2D increased the risk of VA/SCA, compared with those who did not experience HEs. Use of insulin also independently increased the risk of VA/SCA.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670281>Effects of cannabinoid modulation on hypothalamic nesfatin-1 and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Both nesfatin-1 and cannabinoid systems involved in the regulation of sleep, , and food intake. The relationship between cannabinoid system and nesfatin-1 levels remains to be elucidated. This study investigated nesfatin-1 and insulin resistance in 72-h rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-deprived mice under the effects of cannabinoid, and cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R blocking. Sixty mice were exposed to 72-h sleep deprivation. Groups and drug administrations were as follows: Group 1 (control) received injection of vehicle. Group 2 received WIN 55,212,2. Group 3 received AM251 (CB1R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212,2 injection. Group 4 received SR144528 (CB2R antagonist) followed by WIN 55,212,2 injection. Group  received only AM251. Group 6 received only SR144528. Blood samples were collected 1 h after drug administration and prepared for biochemical measurements. Glucose levels were measured by glucometer, whereas insulin and nesfatin-1 levels were measured by ELISA. Central nesfatin-1 was also assessed using immunohistochemistry. One-way analysis of variance together with post hoc Tukey's test was used for inter-group comparisons. Serum nesfatin-1 levels were comparable in all study groups. Brain nesfatin-1 immune-positive cell count was lower in WIN group compared to controls. The administration of CB1R or CB2R antagonist prevented reduction in nesfatin-1-positive cell count. Insulin resistance was higher in WINCB2 and CB2 groups than in control and WINCB1 groups. Cannabinoid treatment reduced nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity in the central nervous system and this effect was prevented by either CB1R or CB2R antagonist pretreatment. Insulin resistance might be related to CB2 receptor activation which was independent from central nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654486>The association study of lipid  gene polymorphisms with AMD identifies a protective role for APOE-E2 allele in the wet form in a Northern Spanish population.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the potential role of eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the most relevant lipid  genes in Northern Spanish patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).A case-control study of 228 unrelated native Northern Spanish patients diagnosed with AMD (73 dry and 155 wet) and 95 healthy controls was performed. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyped for the SNPs APOE rs429358 and rs7412; CTEP rs3764261; LIPC rs10468017 and rs493258; LPL rs12678919; ABCA1 rs1883025; ABCA4 rs76157638, rs3112831 and rs1800555; and SCARB1 rs5888, using TaqMan probes. An additional association study of ε2, ε3 and ε4 major isoforms of APOE gene with AMD has been carried out.The allele and genotype frequencies for each of the eleven sequence variants in the lipid  genes did not show significant differences when comparing AMD cases and controls. Statistical analysis revealed that APOE-ε2 carrier genotypes were less frequently observed in patients with wet AMD compared to controls (.8% versus 13.7%, respectively: p = 3.28 × 10 ; OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.19-0.95).

Two strains, CB-3 and CD-2, were isolated from the polluted soil of a chemical factory and could completely degrade 50 mg/L 4CBP within 12 h by co-culture. The consortium comprising strains CB-3 and CD-2 was effective in the degradation of 4CBP. 4CBP was degraded initially by strain CB-3 to accumulate 4-chlorobenzoate (4CBA) and further oxidised by strain CD-2. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and phenotypic typing, strain CB-3 and strain CD-2 were identified as Pseudomonas sp. and Comamonas sp., respectively. The substrate spectra experiment showed that strain CB-3 could degrade PCBs with no more than three chlorine atoms. A gene cluster of biphenyl  was found in the genome of strain CB-3. Besides, a dechlorination gene cluster and a gene cluster of protocatechuate (PCA)  were found in the genome of strain CD-2. These gene clusters are supposed to be involved in 4CBP degradation.

Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or immunity), which may altogether affect adult . All these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult  has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on RMR (resting  rate, measured in thermoneutrality, 25°C) and TMR (thermoregulatory  rate, measured in cold challenging condition, °C) in the House sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood when their  was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of  was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss.

A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to determine their effectiveness for FGIDs.We searched the following electronic databases till July 2019 with English language restriction: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PUBMED. Randomized double-blind controlled trials of HMs compared with placebo or conventional pharmacological drugs for adult FGIDs patients were included.In total, 49 trials involving 7396 participants with FGIDs were included. The risk of bias was low in 9, unclear in 36, and high in 4 trials. More than 33 different herbal formulae were tested. HMs demonstrated statistically significant benefits for symptom improvement compared with placebo in 46 trials (RR= 1.67, 95% CI 1.48-1.88). When compared with conventional pharmacological therapy in  trials, HMs were found to be non-inferior (RR= 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18).

Maize is both a genetic model for grass species and a potential source of lignocellulosic biomass from crop residues. Genetic improvement of maize for its utility as a bioenergy feedstock depends on identification of the specific gene family members expressed during secondary wall development in stems.High-throughput sequencing of transcripts expressed in developing rind tissues of stem internodes provided a comprehensive inventory of cell wall-related genes in maize (Zea mays, cultivar B73). Of 1239 of these genes, 854 were expressed among the internodes at ≥95 reads per 20 M, and 693 of them at ≥500 reads per 20 M. Grasses have cell wall compositions distinct from non-commelinid species; only one-quarter of maize cell wall-related genes expressed in stems were putatively orthologous with those of the eudicot Arabidopsis. Using a slope-metric algorithm, five distinct patterns for sub-sets of co-expressed genes were defined across a time course of stem development. For the subset of genes associated with secondary wall formation, fifteen sequence motifs were found in promoter regions. The same members of gene families were often expressed in two maize inbreds, B73 and Mo17, but levels of gene expression between them varied, with 30% of all genes exhibiting at least a -fold difference at any stage. Although presence-absence and copy-number variation might account for much of these differences, fold-changes of expression of a CADa and a FLA11 gene were attributed to polymorphisms in promoter response elements.Large genetic variation in maize as a species precludes the extrapolation of cell wall-related gene expression  even from one common inbred line to another. Elucidation of genotype-specific expression patterns and their regulatory controls will be needed for association panels of inbreds and landraces to fully exploit genetic variation in maize and other bioenergy grass species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652245>Exercise Effects on Mitochondrial Function and Lipid  during Energy Balance.</a></h2><p>Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and upregulate proteins related to lipid . However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in energy balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± .1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured energy requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty acid substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or lipid transport and  following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty acid substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657329>[Clinical significance of antibacterial peptide LL-37 in early diagnosis of patients with sepsis in emergency department].</a></h2><p>To discuss the clinical significance of antibacterial peptide LL-37 in the early diagnosis of patients with sepsis in emergency department.Forty patients diagnosed with sepsis in the emergency department of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College from December 2017 to March 2018 were enrolled as sepsis group. Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled contemporaneously in our hospital at medical center as healthy control group. Peripheral blood was collected immediately after diagnosis in sepsis group or during physical examination in healthy control group. The expression of antibacterial peptide LL-37 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined. The differences in antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP levels between the two groups were compared. Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, and the early individually or jointly diagnostic value of each detected index for sepsis was analyzed.The levels of antimicrobial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP in peripheral blood of sepsis group were significantly higher than those of healthy control group [LL-37 (μg/L): 1.34±0.69 vs. 0.10±0.06, PCT (μg/L): 46.67±39.51 vs. 0.03±0.02, CRP (mg/L): 129.68±49.83 vs. 3.16±2.85], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the expression of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was positively correlated with PCT and CRP levels (r = 0.835, r = 0.932, both P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of LL-37, PCT and CRP for early diagnosis of sepsis was 0.885, 0.963 and 0.983, respectively, and the AUC of combined diagnosis of the three parameters was as high as 0.994, indicating that the value of combined diagnosis of sepsis was greater than that of single diagnosis; when the combined prediction probability of the three parameters was 0.92, the sensitivity was 97.%, and the specificity was 95.0%.Antibacterial peptide LL-37 has certain clinical value in early diagnosis of patients with sepsis, which can be used as early routine monitoring indicators for patients with early sepsis when combined with PCT and CRP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667410>An immunofluorescence study on VEGF and extracellular matrix proteins in human periodontal ligament during tooth movement.</a></h2><p>The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a highly vascularized connective tissue surrounding the root of a tooth. In particular, the PDL is continuously exposed to mechanical stresses during the phases of mastication, and it provides physical, sensory, and trophic functions. It is known that the application of orthodontic force creates a change in periodontal structures. In fact, these forces generate a pressure on the ligament that closes the vessels. The aim of this study is to observe the modifications of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the PDL and extracellular matrix proteins after application of a pre-calibrated and constant orthodontic force at different phases of treatment. We used a 50-g NiTi coiled spring and in vivo samples of PDL of maxillary and mandibular premolars of patients subjected to orthodontic treatment. These teeth were extracted at 1, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days, respectively, by application of force. The extraction of the PDL was effectuated by scarifying the radicular surface on the pressure and tension sides. The mechanical stress induced by the application of force caused an increase in the reactive type of  of extracellular matrix proteins and modulation of neoangiogenesis until restoration.© 2019 The Authors.

To explore the effect of gentiopicroside on depression, this study investigated the therapeutic effect of gentiopicroside on corticosterone-induced depressionin vivo and in vitro by using metabolomic methods.A total of 36 rats were randomly assigned to three groups: a normal group, model group (depression), and treatment group (depression + gentiopicroside). Corticosterone was administrated to induce depression-like model rats. Morris water maze test was used to validated the behavior performance. The hippocampus of rats was obtained for metabolomic detection. Metabolites that were differentially expressed between the groups were extracted for Heatmap, Go, and pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, neuronal cells were cultured and examined to validated the effect of gentiopicroside.Corticosterone injured rats learning capacity, and decreased the levels of -HT, and reversed by gentiopicroside delivery. Metabolites obtained from the hippocampus of rats in the three groups were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA). Go and pathway enrichment analyses revealed the involvement of sphingolipid  et al. Gentiopicroside could inhibit apoptosis caused by corticosterone, and also decrease neuronal cell proliferation and BDNF levels in vitro. Arachidonic acid (ARA) reversed the protective effect of gentiopicroside on neuronal cells.These findings suggest that gentiopicroside reduces apoptosis and increases the proliferation of hippocampus cells in depressed animals by regulating metabolites. Moreover, our study provides a new basis for the clinical treatment of depression and demonstrates the potential efficacy of gentiopicroside in this area of pathology.Copyright © 2019.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum  Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least  years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6. to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -. kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe energy restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669830>Differential expression of structural and functional proteins during bean common mosaic virus-host plant interaction.</a></h2><p>Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), the most common seed-borne pathogen in Phaseolus vulgaris L. is known to cause severe loss in productivity across the globe.

Dextransuccrase resembles in its catalytic properties with the brush boarder sucrase and exhibits pH dependent inhibitory and stimulatory effects in response to Na. In this communication we studied the effect of monovalent cations on the activity of dextransuccrase from . The percentage inhibition of dextransuccrase was 65% at 0. mM NaCl which enhanced to 90% at 20 mM sodium concentration. However there was no effect on dextransucrase activity in presence of other monovalent cations (Rb, Cs, and K) tested. Enzyme activity was enhanced 20-24% in acidic pH but was strongly inhibited (59-89%) around neutral and alkaline pH by 0.-2.0 mM sodium chloride. Upon dialysis, 86% of enzyme activity was restored to control values. There was no effect of 2 mM NaCl on glucosyltransferase activity of the enzyme.

Using the transparent visibility of zebrafish, the strains for intestinal peristalsis were quickly screened. The methods and results were as follows: (1) 18 strains with outstanding gastrointestinal viability via their surface hydrophobicity, self-aggregation ability, acid tolerance, bile tolerance, simulated gastric digestion and intestinal fluid tolerance were determined from 54 unpublished strains. (2) 5dpf zebrafish were randomly selected and divided into 22 groups with 12 tails in each group. The intestinal peristalsis frequency of each group within 1 min was calculated after immersing the model zebrafish in a 108 CFU mL-1 strain solution, with  effective strains obtained. (3) The serotonin in zebrafish was measured by Elisa and fluorescence immunization. The regulation mechanism of serotonin by Bifidobacterium animalis F1-7 was revealed by RT-PCR and the results show that this most effective strain promotes intestinal peristalsis in zebrafish via the modulation of serotonin release and key genes for serotonin synthesis in zebrafish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652246>Football Increases Future Risk for Symptomatic Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>Male youth in the United States commonly participate in gridiron (American) football. There are little data substantiating current popular opinion that it is associated with knee pain or osteoarthritis (OA) later in life. We aimed to evaluate the relationship of football with these outcomes in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI).This is a study of male OAI participants with knee x-ray readings, symptom assessments, and completed surveys on lifetime physical activity. The OAI is a multi-center, observational cohort recruited from the community not based on football participation status. A history of exposure to American football was ascertained via self-report. Knee radiographs were scored for Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade (0-4). Radiographic OA (ROA) was defined as KL ≥ 2 in at least one knee. Frequent knee pain meant at least one knee with frequent knee pain. Symptomatic radiographic OA (SOA) required at least one knee with both ROA and frequent knee pain.1166 men had a mean age of 63.7 (SD 9.2) years and body mass index of 28.6 (SD 4.2) kg/m2. 31% (365/1166) played football at some point in their lives, 95% of whom participated from ages 12 - 18 years. The ORs for SOA from lowest to highest football participation were 1.2, 1., and 2.2 respectively (p for trend = 0.004). Findings were similar for football from ages 12 - 18 years and for outcomes of knee pain and ROA.This is the first large epidemiologic study to suggest that football participation, including in the teen years, may be detrimental towards knee health.

However, the hypolipidemic effects and mechanism of rosemary ethanol extract (RO) and their metabolites are less known. In this study, the hypolipidemic effects of RO and its active compounds were clarified. The results showed that RO, rosmarinic acid (RA) and carnosic acid (CA) significantly reduced the contents of liver triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acids (FFA) and improved cell hypertrophy, vacuolation, and cell necrosis in the liver of orotic acid induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model rats. The mechanism and related  of RO and its main metabolites against lipid disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine '-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of fatty acid synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479>Diosgenin Supplementation Prevents Lipid Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h2><p>Diosgenin (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid . Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an energy expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675203>Dimensionally Enhanced Antibacterial Library Screening.</a></h2><p>The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance is a major public health threat, and there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to address the issue. In this study, the possibility of enhancing a whole cell based antibacterial library screen by increasing the dimensionality of the screening effort is explored using methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the target organism. One dimension involved generating and screening a human liver microsome metabolized FDA approved drug library. Comparative screening of the un-metabolized (UM) and pre-metabolized (PM) libraries allows identification of intrinsically active agents from the UM library screen, and of agents with active metabolites from the PM library screen. To further enhance this screening effort, it was combined with a -/+ resistant to antibiotic screen (-/+ cefoxitin; Cef). This allows the identification of agents that can act synergistically with the resistant to antibiotic. This approach revealed  compounds with substantially improved activity after , and 4 compounds with substantial synergistic activity with cefoxitin. Capecitabine in particular only had significant antibacterial activity after . Its metabolites were isolated, identified and characterized for spectrum of activity along with several other anticancer drugs with anti-MRSA activity. Floxuridine, gemcitabine, novobiocin and rifaximin were identified as having substantial synergy with cefoxitin from the -/+ Cef screens. Checkerboard assays verified synergy for these agents. Floxuridine demonstrated a particularly high degree of synergy with cefoxitin (FIC=0.14).

However, Cc has moonlighting roles outside mitochondria driving the transition of apoptotic cells from life to death. When living cells are damaged, Cc escapes its natural mitochondrial environment and, once in the cytosol, it binds other proteins to form a complex named the apoptosome-a platform that triggers caspase activation and further leads to controlled cell dismantlement. Early released Cc also binds to inositol 1,4,-triphosphate receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which stimulates further massive Cc release from mitochondria. Besides the well-characterized binding proteins contributing to the pro-apoptotic functions of Cc, many novel protein targets have been recently described. Among them, histone chaperones were identified as key partners of Cc following DNA breaks, indicating that Cc might modulate chromatin dynamics through competitive binding to histone chaperones. In this article, we review the ample set of recently discovered anti-apoptotic proteins-involved in DNA damage, transcription and energetic -reported to interact with Cc in the cytoplasm and even the nucleus upon DNA breaks.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid .</a></h2><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired inflammation at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic acid-dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and inflammation, leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid  genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669404>Metabolomic changes of blood plasma associated with two phases of rat OIR.</a></h2><p>Although acute hyperoxia/hypoxia alternation can shift sharply physiological processes of vessel development, e.g. oxygen induced retinopathy, very little is known of  products resulted from the neovascularization disorder.

Distinct differences in the plasma metabolome were found between groups of CT1 vs. HO1, and HO1 vs. HO2, by using univariate and multivariate analyses. Alternating hyperoxia/hypoxia conditions induced significant changes of richness of proline, ornithine and glutamine that were important components of 'arginine and proline ' pathway. These metabolites contributed largely to plasma sample classification, determined with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and were involved profoundly in the proline-dependent production of reactive oxygen species related to the cellular redox reactions.

The 2 prespecified subgroups comprised patients who were able to walk 350 m or more in 6 minutes (stable subgroup) and patients who were not able to walk 350 m in 6 minutes (unstable subgroup) at baseline.Among 49 ambulant male children with DMD who were screened for eligibility, 47 patients with a mean (SD) age of 8.2 (1.1) years were randomized to a treatment group receiving combination therapy (n = 23) or a control group receiving placebo (n = 24), and 45 patients completed the study. No significant differences between groups were found in the results of timed function and muscle force tests for overall, proximal and axial, and distal motor function. Among patients receiving combination therapy, the Motor Function Measure first dimension subscore decrease was .% greater than that of patients receiving placebo (95% CI, -1.0% to 12.1%; P = .09). The administration of combination therapy had significantly favorable effects on the first dimension subscore decrease among the 29 patients in the stable subgroup (6.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-12.6%; P = .03) but not among the 15 patients in the unstable subgroup (3.9%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 20.9%; P = .63). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with only mild adverse effects.Treatment with combination therapy was not associated with an overall reduction in motor function decline among ambulant patients with DMD; however, a reduction in motor function decline was observed among the stable subgroup of patients treated with combination therapy. The statistically nonsignificant difference of distal motor function in favor of combination therapy and the reduced degeneration of muscle tissue appear to support the treatment concept, but the study may have lacked sufficient statistical power. Further research exploring this treatment option with a greater number of patients is warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670380>Metabolomics study of fasudil on cisplatin-induced kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Fasudil is a derivative of -isoquinoline sulfonamide, which is a Rho kinase inhibitor, a wide range of pharmacological effects. Fasudil has been shown to attenuate kidney injury caused by certain substances. In the present study, metabolomic analysis of mouse kidney tissues ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine the metabolomic changes in cisplatin-induced kidney injury and the fasudil-induced attenuation of cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Metabolomic profiling of kidney tissues revealed significant differences in metabolites between the control group and the cisplatin group and between the cisplatin group and the fasudil-intervention group. With metabolomic approach, 68 endogenous differential metabolites were found, and multivariate statistical analysis, accurate molecular weights, isotope tracers, mass-spectrometry secondary-fragment information, and standard-reference comparisons were used to identify these substances. Based on these differential metabolites, a -pathway network was constructed and revealed that fasudil primarily attenuated cisplatin-induced renal injury by modulating lipid and amino-acid . These results further demonstrate that kidney injury can be induced by cisplatin and, moreover, suggest that fasudil can be used to reduce kidney injury at early stages in patients treated with cisplatin.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669996>Variable carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation in TCE co- oxidation.</a></h2><p>Identifying co- TCE oxidation in polluted groundwater is challenging due to lack of indicative by-products. This challenge may theoretically be resolved if the oxidation process can be characterized by a distinct dual isotope enrichment. In this work, we aimed to explore the carbon and chlorine isotope effects associated with TCE oxidation by a variety of oxygenases. These included pure strains and enrichment cultures of methane, toluene and ammonia oxidizers, as well as experiments with crude extracts. Isotope effects determined for TCE oxidation by toluene and ammonia oxidizers were mostly in line with expected values for epoxidation mechanism (ϵC -11.0 ± 0.7 to -24.8 ± 0.2‰ and ϵCl +0.9 ± 0. to +1.0 ± 0.4‰), whereas, the methanotrophs resulted in distinctively different isotope effects (ϵC -2.4 ± 0.4 to -3.4 ± 0.8‰ and ϵCl -1.8 ± 0.2 to -2.9 ± 0.9‰). It is suggested that in TCE oxidation by methanotrophs, substrate binding rather than bond cleavage is rate limiting, leading to this unexpected isotope effect. On the environmental level, our results imply that the oxidative process can be differentiated if catalyzed by toluene and ammonia oxidizers or by methanotrophs. Additionally, the oxidative process can be distinguished from the reductive one. However, using dual isotope analysis in the field may result in an under-estimation of the overall co- process if methanotrophs are to be excluded due to low isotope effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to  disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or  kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related  disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656227>Allylic hydroxylation of triterpenoids by a plant cytochrome P450 triggers key chemical transformations that produce a variety of bitter compounds.</a></h2><p>Cucurbitacins are highly oxygenated triterpenoids characteristic of plants in the family Cucurbitaceae and responsible for the bitter taste of these plants. Fruits of bitter melon () contain various cucurbitacins possessing an unusual ether bridge between C5 and C19, not observed in other Cucurbitaceae members. Using a combination of next-generation sequencing and RNA-seq analysis and gene-to-gene co-expression analysis with the ConfeitoGUIplus software, we identified three P450 genes, , , and , expected to be involved in cucurbitacin biosynthesis. CYP81AQ19 co-expression with cucurbitadienol synthase in yeast resulted in the production of cucurbita-,24-diene-3β,23α-diol. A mild acid treatment of this compound resulted in an isomerization of the C23-OH group to C25-OH with the concomitant migration of a double bond, suggesting that a non-enzymatic transformation may account for the observed C25-OH in the majority of cucurbitacins found in plants. The functional expression of CYP88L7 resulted in the production of hydroxylated C19, as well as C5-C19 ether-bridged products. A plausible mechanism for the formation of the C5-C19 ether bridge involves C7 and C19 hydroxylations, indicating a multifunctional nature of this P450. On the other hand, functional CYP88L8 expression gave a single product, a triterpene diol, indicating a monofunctional P450 catalyzing the C7 hydroxylation. Our findings of the roles of several plant P450s in cucurbitacin biosynthesis reveal that an allylic hydroxylation is a key enzymatic transformation that triggers subsequent processes to produce structurally diverse products.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665438>The External Genitalia Score (EGS): A European multicenter validation study.</a></h2><p>Standardized description of external genitalia is needed in the assessment of children with atypical genitalia.To validate the External Genitalia Score (EGS), to present reference values for preterm and term babies up to 24 months and correlate obtained scores with anogenital distances (AGDs).A European multicentre (n=8) validation study was conducted from 07/2016 until 07/2018.EGS is based on the external masculinization score but uses a gradual scale from female to male (range 0-12) and terminology appropriate for both sexes.

Empagliflozin and dulaglutide, developed for diabetes, reduce weight, decrease insulin resistance, and exert additive effects. We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on obesity-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin ( days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose , and abnormal serum levels of leptin and insulin, and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR. HFD-induced lung fibrosis was decreased by both drugs alone and combined. HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs.

Traditional chemotherapy options are often the front-line choice of regimen in the treatment of patients with RCC, but responses may be modest or limited due to resistance of the tumor to anticarcinogen. Downregulated expression of organic cation transporter OCT2 is a possible mechanism underlying oxaliplatin resistance in RCC treatment. In this study, we observed that miR-489-3p and miR-630 suppress OCT2 expression by directly binding to the OCT2 3'-UTR. Meanwhile,  786-O-OCT2-miRNAs stable expression cell models, we found that miRNAs could repress the classic substrate 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), fluorogenic substrate ,-dimethyl-4-(2-pyridin-4-ylethenyl) aniline (ASP), and oxaliplatin uptake by OCT2 both  and in xenografts. In 33 clinical samples, miR-489-3p and miR-630 were significantly upregulated in RCC, negatively correlating with the OCT2 expression level compared to that in adjacent normal tissues, using tissue microarray analysis and qPCR validation. The increased binding of c-Myc to the promoter of pri-miR-630, responsible for the upregulation of miR-630 in RCC, was further evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assay.

To determine whether a single dose of Zynamite administered 1 h before exercise increases repeated-sprint performance, 20 men and 20 women who were physically active were randomly assigned to three treatments following a double-blind cross-over counterbalanced design. Treatment A, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, 147.7 mg of maltodextrin, and 420 mg of sunflower lecithin; Treatment B, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, and 2126 mg of maltodextrin and Treatment C, 2548 mg of maltodextrin (placebo). Subjects performed three Wingate tests interspaced by 4 min and a final 15 s sprint after ischemia. Treatments A and B improved peak power output during the first three Wingates by 2.8% and 3.8%, respectively (treatment x sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Vastus Lateralis oxygenation (NIRS) was reduced, indicating higher O extraction (treatment × sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Improved O extraction was observed in the sprints after ischemia ( = 0.008; placebo vs. mean of treatments A and B). Blood lactate concentration was .9% lower after the ingestion of Zynamite® with quercetin in men (treatment by sex interaction,  = 0.049). There was a higher Vastus Lateralis O extraction during 60 s ischemia with polyphenols (treatment effect,  = 0.03), due to the greater muscle VO in men ( = 0.001). In conclusion, a single dose of Zynamite combined with quercetin one hour before exercise improves repeated-sprint performance and muscle O extraction and mitochondrial O consumption during ischemia.

The small monomers released by decomposition are metabolised by microbes, supporting their growth. Most of the extracellular enzymes are adaptative and their synthesis and activity is strongly affected by environmental factors, consequently the relative importance of leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucosidase reflects differences in the composition of organic matter and assume a different meaning. Since more than two decades, at the CNR the influence of climate changes, seasonal variability, depth and coastal input on the patterns of enzymatic activities in the Mediterranean Sea have been studied. Its particular characteristics of a semi-closed basin, high summer evaporation and the occurrence of important water dynamics, make this ecosystem particularly suitable as a model site for climate changes-related observations. The present paper reviews the current information of environmental changes on extracellular enzymatic activity obtained in the Mediterranean areas with the aim of evaluating the effects of environmental changes on the microbial activities. The obtained results revealed significant variations in the rates of hydrolytic activities in relation to space and time, with the highest levels generally found in the epipelagic layer (0-100m) and in coastal zones during warm periods. In the Central Mediterranean Sea their relationship with temperature changes was demonstrated. Spatial variations in the relative enzyme activities also suggested a modulation in the  profiles of the prokaryotic communities, with biogeochemical implications in nutrient regeneration. Long term studies on microbial activity and abundances in relation with rising temperatures can have a predictive value to describe the evolutionary scenario of microbial processes and the response of microbial  to climate changes in the Mediterranean Sea.© 2019 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662430> Modeling of Streptococcus mutans Reveals Complex Nutrient Requirements of an Oral Pathogen.</a></h2><p> is a Gram-positive bacterium that thrives under acidic conditions and is a primary cause of tooth decay (dental caries).

Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose . Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity.

Several of these actions rely on Ca delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU's gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic  impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy  and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

CYP19A1 is a member of cytochrome P450 family of heme-thiolate monooxygenases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and depends on reducing equivalents from the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate via the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase coded by POR. Both the CYP19A1 and POR genes are highly polymorphic, and mutations in both these genes are linked to disorders of steroid biosynthesis. We have previously shown that R264C and R264H mutations in CYP19A1, as well as mutations in POR, result in a reduction of CYP19A1 activity. The R264C is a common polymorphic variant of CYP19A1, with high frequency in Asian and African populations. Polymorphic alleles of POR are found in all populations studied so far and, therefore, may influence activities of CYP19A1 allelic variants. So far, effects of variations in POR on enzymatic activities of allelic variants of CYP19A1 or any other steroid metabolizing cytochrome P450 proteins have not been studied. Here we are reporting the effects of three POR variants on the aromatase activities of two CYP19A1 variants, R264C and R264H. We used bacterially expressed and purified preparations of WT and variant forms of CYP19A1 and POR and constructed liposomes with embedded CYP19A1 and POR proteins and assayed the CYP19A1 activities using radiolabeled androstenedione as a substrate. With the WT-POR as a redox partner, the R264C-CYP19A1 showed only 15% of aromatase activity, but the R264H had 87% of aromatase activity compared to WT-CYP19A1. With P284L-POR as a redox partner, R264C-CYP19A1 lost all activity but retained 6.7% of activity when P284T-POR was used as a redox partner. The R264H-CYP19A1 showed low activities with both the POR-P284 L as well as the POR-P284 T. When the POR-Y607C was used as a redox partner, the R264C-CYP19A1 retained around % of CYP19A1 activity. Remarkably, The R264H-CYP19A1 had more than three-fold higher activity compared to WT-CYP19A1 when the POR-Y607C was used as the redox partner, pointing towards a beneficial effect. The slight increase in activity of R264C-CYP19A1 with the P284T-POR and the three-fold increase in activity of the R264H-CYP19A1 with the Y607C-POR point towards a conformational effect and role of protein-protein interaction governed by the R264C and R264H substitutions in the CYP19A1 as well as P284 L, P284 T and Y607C variants of POR. These studies demonstrate that the allelic variants of P450 when present with a variant form of POR may show different activities, and combined effects of variations in both the P450 enzymes as well as in the POR should be considered when genetic data are available. Recent trends in the whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing as diagnostic tools will permit combined evaluation of variations in multiple genes that are interdependent and may guide treatment options by adjusting therapeutic interventions based on laboratory analysis.Copyright © 2019.

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen , relative expression of amino acid transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial weight of 11.53 ± 0.04 kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.%, 1.0% and 1.% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28 days. Compared with the LP group, the LP + 1.0%A and LP + 1.%A groups increased the growth performance (p < .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino acid transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (p < .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (p < .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (p < .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (p < .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (p < .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition. Taken together, an LP diet supplemented with AKG provides a theoretical basis for the promotion and application of AKG in piglet production.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674709>Evolutionary adaptation of Aspergillus niger for increased ferulic acid tolerance.</a></h2><p>To create an Aspergillus niger mutant with increased tolerance against ferulic acid using evolutionary adaptation.Evolutionary adaptation of Aspergillus niger N402 was performed by consecutive growth on increasing concentrations of ferulic acid in the presence of 25 mmol l D-fructose, starting from 0· mmol l and ending with  mmol l ferulic acid. The A. niger mutant obtained after six months, named Fa6, showed increased ferulic acid tolerance compared to the parent. In addition, Fa6 has increased ferulic acid consumption and a higher conversion rate, suggesting that the mutation affects aromatic  of this species. Transcriptome analysis of the evolutionary mutant on ferulic acid revealed a distinct gene expression profile compared to the wild type. Further analysis of this mutant and the parent strain provided the first experimental confirmation that A. niger converts coniferyl alcohol to ferulic acid.The evolutionary adaptive A. niger mutant Fa6 has beneficial mutations that increase the tolerance, conversion rate and uptake of ferulic acid.This study demonstrates that evolutionary adaptation is a powerful tool to modify microorganisms towards increased tolerance to harsh conditions, which is beneficial for various industrial applications.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661476>[Humanized Mouse Models as a Tool to Study Proinflammatory Cytokine Overexpression].</a></h2><p>Dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine expression may result in the development of severe pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and neurodegenerative diseases. Transgenic mice and, in particular, those with controllable systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines have recently become an essential instrument to study the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development. Importantly, many of the models are humanized by introducing a human cytokine gene, while leaving or removing the respective endogenous mouse gene. Humanized mice are especially valuable for biomedical research as they provide a relevant model to develop therapies based on blocking the pathogenic activity of a cytokine or to establish the functional significance of genome polymorphisms. The review discusses the available humanized mouse models with overexpression of key proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-ip, and IL-6) and inflammatory cytokines with more specific functions (IL-8, IL-17, and IL-32) and their significance for basic and clinical research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651370>Effect of etelcalcetide on cardiac hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients: a randomized controlled trial (ETECAR-HD).</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with chronic kidney disease, and calcimimetic therapy reduces plasma concentrations of FGF23. It remains unknown whether treatment with the calcimimetic etelcalcetide (ETL) reduces LVH in patients on hemodialysis.This single-blinded randomized trial of 12 months duration will test the effects of ETL compared with alfacalcidol on LVH and cardiac fibrosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Both treatment regimens will be titrated to equally suppress secondary hyperparathyroidism while alfacalcidol treatment causes an increase and ETL a decrease in FGF23, respectively. Patients treated thrice weekly with hemodialysis for ≥ 3 months and ≤ 3 years with parathyroid hormone levels ≥ 300 pg/ml and LVH will be enrolled in the study. The primary study endpoint is change from baseline to 12 months in left ventricular mass index (LVMI; g/m) measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Sample size calculations showed that 62 randomized patients will be necessary to detect a difference in LVMI of at least 20 g/m between the two groups at 12 months. Due to the strong association of volume overload and LVH, randomization will be stratified by residual kidney function, and regular body composition monitoring will be performed to control the volume status of patients. Study medication will be administered intravenously by the dialysis nurses after every hemodialysis session, thus omitting adherence issues. Secondary study endpoints are cardiac parameters measured by echocardiography, biomarker concentrations of bone  (FGF23, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphate, s-Klotho), cardiac markers (pro-brain natriuretic peptide, pre- and postdialysis troponin T) and metabolites of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade (angiotensin I (Ang I), Ang II, Ang-(1-7), Ang-(1-), Ang-(1-9), and aldosterone).The causal inference and pathophysiology of LVH regression by FGF23 reduction using calcimimetic treatment has not yet been shown. This intervention study has the potential to discover a new strategy for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. It might be speculated that successful treatment of cardiac morphology will also reduce the risk of cardiac death in this population.European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT number 2017-000222-35; ClinicalTrials.gov,  .

The aim of this study was to find the clues for their synergistic actions by comparing the biliary  and excretion profiles after oral administration of CNS and its individual extracts. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS) platform was used to identify and quantify the CNS-derived components in bile. The neutral losses, precursor ions, and predictive multiple reaction monitoring (pMRM) scans were firstly used to detect the CNS-derived ingredients in vivo. A total of 43 components, including 38 flavonoids and  ginsenosides were tentatively identified according to the previously established chemical and  profiles of NS and SF. Afterwards, the primary circulating and biological components, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), ginsenosides Rg (GRg), Re (GRe), and Rd (GRd) were chosen to compare the bile excretion between CNS and its individual extract groups, by using a validated LC-MRM-MS/MS method. The approach was proved to be well satisfied the related requirements from the guidelines of FDA (specificity, calibration curve, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery, and stability). Comparing with the SF and NS groups, the combination group did not affect the   of the CNS-related components, however, it decreased the cumulative excretion ratios of HSYA, GRg, GRe, and GRd. In conclusion, the compatibility of SF and NS could reduce the bile excretion of the CNS-derived compounds, which may be one of the reasons for the enhancement of anti-myocardial ischemia after combination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by lipid analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty acids in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at  and 10 h by 1.89±0.2 and 2.58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p></html>
