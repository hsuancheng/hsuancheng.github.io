<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25893635> abrogates growth of colon cancer and induces cell cycle arrest by inhibiting transcriptional activation of E2F.</a></h1><p>Despite significant progress in diagnostics and therapeutics, over 50 thousand patients die from colorectal cancer annually. Hence, there is urgent need for new lines of treatment. , a natural compound isolated from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii, is effective against multiple cancers. We have synthesized a water soluble  of , named Minnelide, which is currently in phase I trial against pancreatic cancer. The aims of the current study were to evaluate whether /Minnelide is effective against colorectal cancer and to elucidate the mechanism by which  induces cell death in colorectal cancer. Efficacy of Minnelide was evaluated in subcutaneous xenograft and liver metastasis model of colorectal cancer. For mechanistic studies, colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and HT29 were treated with  and the effect on viability, caspase activation, annexin positivity, lactate dehydrogenase release, and cell cycle progression was evaluated. Effect of  on E2F transcriptional activity, mRNA levels of E2F-dependent genes, E2F1- retinoblastoma protein (Rb) binding, and proteins levels of regulator of G1-S transition was also measured. DNA binding of E2F1 was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.  decreased colon cancer cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Minnelide markedly inhibited the growth of colon cancer in the xenograft and liver metastasis model of colon cancer and more than doubles the median survival of animals with liver metastases from colon cancer. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that at low concentrations  induces apoptotic cell death but at higher concentrations it induces cell cycle arrest. Our data suggest that  is able to induce G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting transcriptional activation of E2F1. Our data also show that  downregulates E2F activity by potentially modulating events downstream of DNA binding. Therefore, we conclude that  and Minnelide are effective against colon cancer in multiple pre-clinical models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301418>(5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide ameliorates liver lipid accumulation by suppressing lipid synthesis and promoting lipid oxidation in mice.</a></h1><p>(5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) is a   with excellent capability against cancers, cerebral ischemic injury and rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we discovered its hepatoprotective effects in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ameliorating liver lipid accumulation.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat/high-fructose (HFHFr) diet for 29 weeks to induce the pathological phenomena of NAFLD. Then the mice were treated with LLDT-8 (0.5mg/kg and 1mg/kg) or Vehicle for 8 weeks. Finally, the serum biochemical indexes, liver histological features, fatty acids (FAs) profile and related gene expression in liver were detected to investigate the effect of LLDT-8 on lipid accumulation and its possible mechanism.LLDT-8 treatment significantly inhibited hepatic injury featured by the decrease of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), the lessening of hepatic ballooning and macrovesicular steatosis. Moreover, LLDT-8 could downregulate the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which further led to the lower ratios of C16:1/C16:0 and C18:1/C18:0 and thus inhibited lipid synthesis. LLDT-8 treatment also could upregulate liver peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm) expression levels involved in fatty acids oxidation (FAO) and markedly promoted lipolysis.Our results provide a novel application of LLDT-8 in improving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of action of LLDT-8 in a murine anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis model. NZW mice were injected with rabbit anti-GBM serum (500 μL, ip). The mice were orally treated with LLDT-8 (0.125 mg/kg, every other day) or a positive control prednisolone (2 mg/kg every day) for 14 d. Blood and urine samples as well as spleen and kidney tissues were collected for analyses. LLDT-8 treatment did not affect the generation of mouse anti-rabbit antibodies. LLDT-8 significantly reversed established proteinuria, improved renal histopathology and attenuated renal dysfunction in glomerulonephritis mice. Furthermore, LLDT-8 inhibited inflammation in the kidney evidenced by significantly decreasing C3 and IgG deposition, reducing the levels of the pathogenic cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ, and reducing related chemokine expression and leukocyte infiltration in kidneys. Moreover, LLDT-8 treatment significantly increased the expression of FcγRIIB in the kidney and spleen. In addition, the treatment restored the reduced expression of FcγRIIB on the surface of kidney effector cells, CD11b cells, and interfered with FcγR-dependent signaling, especially FcγRIIB-mediated downstream kinases, such as BTK. These results demonstrate that LLDT-8 ameliorates anti-GBM glomerulonephritis by regulating the Fcγ receptor signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608823>Production of Putative Diterpene Carboxylic Acid Intermediates of  in Yeast.</a></h1><p>The development of medical applications exploiting the broad bioactivities of the diterpene therapeutic  from  is limited by low extraction yields from the native plant. Furthermore, the extraordinarily high structural complexity prevents an economically attractive enantioselective total synthesis. An alternative production route of  through engineered  (yeast) could provide a sustainable source of . A potential intermediate in the unknown biosynthetic route to  is the diterpene dehydroabietic acid. Here, we report a biosynthetic route to dehydroabietic acid by transient expression of enzymes from  and Sitka spruce () in . The combination of diterpene synthases TPS9, TPS27, and cytochromes P450 CYP720B4 yielded dehydroabietic acid and a novel , tentatively identified as 'miltiradienic acid'. This biosynthetic pathway was reassembled in a yeast strain engineered for increased yields of the pathway intermediates, the diterpene olefins miltiradiene and dehydroabietadiene. Introduction in that strain of CYP720B4 in combination with two alternative NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductases resulted in scalable in vivo production of dehydroabietic acid and its  from glucose. Approaching future elucidation of the remaining biosynthetic steps to , our findings may provide an independent platform for testing of additional recombinant candidate genes, and ultimately pave the way to biotechnological production of the high value diterpenoid therapeutic.</p></html>
