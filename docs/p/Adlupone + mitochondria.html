Trophoblasts also give rise to cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal blood, and has been used for noninvasive prenatal screening for chromosomal aneuploidy. We intended to prove the existence of DNA in the EVs (evDNA) of maternal blood, and compared evDNA with plasma cfDNA in terms of genome distribution, fragment length, and the possibility of detecting genetic diseases.Maternal blood from 20 euploid pregnancies, 9 T21 pregnancies, 3 T18 pregnancies, 1 T13 pregnancy, and 2 pregnancies with FGFR3 mutations were obtained. EVs were separated from maternal plasma, and confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), western blotting, and flow cytometry (FACS). evDNA was extracted and its fetal origin was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Pair-end (PE) whole genome sequencing was performed to characterize evDNA, and the results were compared with that of cfDNA. The fetal risk of aneuploidy and monogenic diseases was analyzed using the evDNA sequencing data.EVs separated from maternal plasma were confirmed with morphology by TEM, and protein markers of CD9, CD63, CD81 as well as the placental specific protein placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) were confirmed by western blotting or flow cytometry. EvDNA could be successfully extracted for qPCR and sequencing from the plasma EVs. Sequencing data showed that evDNA span on all 23 pairs of chromosomes and , sharing a similar distribution pattern and higher GC content comparing with cfDNA. EvDNA showed shorter fragments yet lower fetal fraction than cfDNA. EvDNA could be used to correctly determine fetal gender, trisomies, and de novo FGFR3 mutations.We proved that fetal DNA could be detected in EVs separated from maternal plasma. EvDNA shared some similar features to plasma cfDNA, and could potentially be used to detect genetic diseases in fetus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674658>Exercise and mitochondrial health.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial health is an important mediator of cellular function across a range of tissues, and as a result contributes to whole-body vitality in health and disease. Our understanding of the regulation and function of these organelles is of great interest to scientists and clinicians across many disciplines within our healthcare system. Skeletal muscle is a useful model tissue for the study of mitochondrial adaptations because of its mass and contribution to whole body metabolism. The remarkable plasticity of  allows them to adjust their volume, structure, and capacity under conditions such as exercise, which is useful or improving metabolic health in individuals with various diseases and/or advancing age.  exist within muscle as a functional reticulum which is maintained by dynamic processes of biogenesis and fusion, and is balanced by opposing processes of fission and mitophagy. The sophisticated coordination of these events is incompletely understood, but is imperative for organelle function and essential for the maintenance of an interconnected organelle network that is finely tuned to the metabolic needs of the cell. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial turnover in muscle could offer potential therapeutic targets for the advancement of health and longevity among our aging populations. As well, investigating exercise modalities that are both convenient and capable of inducing robust mitochondrial adaptations are useful in fostering more widespread global adherence. To this point, exercise remains the most potent behavioural therapeutic approach for the improvement of mitochondrial health, not only in muscle, but potentially also in other tissues.

The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is important for the maintenance of ATP production and other functions of . The electron transport chain (ETC) generates an electrochemical gradient of protons known as the proton-motive force across the IMM and thus produces the mitochondrial membrane potential that is critical to ATP synthesis. One of the main factors regulating the structural and functional integrity of the IMM is the changes in the matrix volume. Mild (reversible) swelling regulates mitochondrial metabolism and function; however, excessive (irreversible) swelling causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The central mechanism of mitochondrial swelling includes the opening of non-selective channels known as permeability transition pores (PTPs) in the IMM by high mitochondrial Ca and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mechanisms of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling and transition between these two states are still unknown. The present study elucidates an upgraded biophysical model of reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics. The model provides a description of the PTP regulation dynamics using an additional differential equation. The rigidity tensor was used in numerical simulations of the mitochondrial parameter dynamics with different initial conditions defined by Ca concentration in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum. We were able to estimate the values of the IMM rigidity tensor components by fitting the model to the previously reported experimental data. Overall, the model provides a better description of the reversible and irreversible mitochondrial swelling dynamics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

We previously showed that Cytc is regulated in a highly tissue-specific manner: Cytc isolated from heart, liver, and kidney is phosphorylated on Y97, Y48, and T28, respectively. Here, we have analyzed the effect of a new Cytc phosphorylation site, threonine 58, which we mapped in rat kidney Cytc by mass spectrometry. We generated and overexpressed wild-type, phosphomimetic T58E, and two controls, T58A and T58I Cytc; the latter replacement is found in human and testis-specific Cytc. In vitro, COX activity, caspase-3 activity, and heme degradation in the presence of HO were decreased with phosphomimetic Cytc compared to wild-type. Cytc-knockout cells expressing T58E or T58I Cytc showed a reduction in intact cell respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ), ROS production, and apoptotic activity compared to wild-type. We propose that, under physiological conditions, Cytc is phosphorylated, which controls mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis. Under conditions of stress Cytc phosphorylations are lost leading to maximal respiration rates, ∆Ψ hyperpolarization, ROS production, and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691575>Anaerobic transcription by OxyR: a novel paradigm for nitrosative stress.</a></h2><p>S-nitrosylation, the post-translational modification by nitric oxide to form S-nitrosothiols (SNOs), regulates diverse aspects of cellular function, and aberrant S-nitrosylation (nitrosative stress) is implicated in disease, from neurodegeneration to cancer. While essential roles for S-nitrosylation have been demonstrated in microbes, plants and animals, bacteria have often served as model systems for elucidation of general principles.

The mtDNA can be heteroplasmic, containing more than one type of mtDNA sequence; if one of the mtDNAs contains the mt3243A>G mutation, a patient may develop MIDD. Patients can inherit different amounts of mutated mtDNA and normal mtDNA that effect the severity of the clinical manifestations of MIDD. The most common clinical manifestations include diabetes mellitus (DM), deafness, ophthalmic disease, cardiac disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disease, short stature, and myopathies. In order to effectively treat patients with MIDD it is important to recognize the underlying pathophysiology of this specific form of diabetes and the pathophysiology associated with the organ-specific complications present in this disease.The heteroplasmic inheritance of mutated mtDNA play an important role in the clinical manifestations of various mitochondrial diseases, specifically MIDD.

EPI and NE release from CCs is regulated both neurogenically by splanchnic nerve fibers and nonneurogenically by hormones (histamine, corticosteroids, angiotensin, and others) and paracrine messengers [EPI, NE, adenosine triphosphate, opioids, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), etc.]. The "stimulus-secretion" coupling of CCs is a Ca -dependent process regulated by Ca entry through voltage-gated Ca channels, Ca pumps, and exchangers and intracellular organelles (RE and ) and diffusible buffers that provide both Ca -homeostasis and Ca -signaling that ultimately trigger exocytosis. CCs also express Na and K channels and ionotropic (nAChR and GABA ) and metabotropic receptors (mACh, PACAP, β-AR, 5-HT, histamine, angiotensin, and others) that make CCs excitable and responsive to autocrine and paracrine stimuli. To maintain high rates of E/NE secretion during stressful conditions, CCs possess a large number of secretory chromaffin granules (CGs) and members of the soluble NSF-attachment receptor complex protein family that allow docking, fusion, and exocytosis of CGs at the cell membrane, and their recycling. This article attempts to provide an updated account of well-established features of the molecular processes regulating CC function, and a survey of the as-yet-unsolved but important questions relating to CC function and dysfunction that have been the subject of intense research over the past 15 years. Examples of CCs as a model system to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with neurodegenerative diseases are also provided. Published 2019.

This article reviews such data, indicating two important aspects of alterations in the gut in the modulation of : (1) Gut permeability increases toll-like receptor (TLR) activators, viz circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and exosomal high-mobility group box (HMGB)1. LPS and HMGB1 increase inducible nitric oxide synthase and superoxide, leading to peroxynitrite-driven acidic sphingomyelinase and ceramide. Ceramide is a major driver of MS pathophysiology via its impacts on glia  functioning; (2) Gut dysbiosis lowers production of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate. Butyrate is a significant positive regulator of mitochondrial function, as well as suppressing the levels and effects of ceramide. Ceramide acts to suppress the circadian optimizers of  functioning, viz daytime orexin and night-time melatonin. Orexin, melatonin, and butyrate increase  oxidative phosphorylation partly via the disinhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, leading to an increase in acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Acetyl-CoA is a necessary co-substrate for activation of the  melatonergic pathway, allowing melatonin to optimize mitochondrial function. Data would indicate that gut-driven alterations in ceramide and mitochondrial function, particularly in glia and immune cells, underpin MS pathophysiology. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activators, such as stress-induced kynurenine and air pollutants, may interact with the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway via AhR-induced cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1, which backward converts melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). The loss of mitochnodria melatonin coupled with increased NAS has implications for altered mitochondrial function in many cell types that are relevant to MS pathophysiology. NAS is increased in secondary progressive MS, indicating a role for changes in the  melatonergic pathway in the progression of MS symptomatology. This provides a framework for the integration of diverse bodies of data on MS pathophysiology, with a number of readily applicable treatment interventions, including the utilization of sodium butyrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671682>Syntaxin-17-Dependent Mitochondrial Dynamics is Essential for Protection Against Oxidative-Stress-Induced Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>In this study, cell death induced by the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBH) was observed in UOS cells; this phenotype was rescued by Syntaxin 17 (STX17) knockout (KO) but the mechanism is unknown. STX17 plays dual roles in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and mitochondrial fission. However, the contribution of the two functions of STX17 to apoptosis has not been extensively studied. Here, we sought to dissect the dual roles of STX17 in oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis by taking advantage of STX17 knockout cells and an autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant of STX17. We generated STX17 knockout UOS cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system and the STX17 knockout cells were reconstituted with wild-type STX17 and its autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant. Autophagy was assessed by autophagic flux assay, Monomer red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-GFP-LC3 assay and protease protection assay. Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and mitochondrial dynamics were examined by staining the different indicator proteins. Apoptosis was evaluated by caspase cleavage assay. The general reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry. In STX17 complete knockout cells, sealed autophagosomes were efficiently formed but their fusion with lysosomes was less defective. The fusion defect was rescued by wild-type STX17 but not the autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant. No obvious defects in Golgi, ERGIC or ER dynamics were observed.  were significantly elongated, supporting a role of STX17 in  fission and the elongation caused by STX17 KO was reversed by the autophagosome-lysosome fusion defective mutant. The clearance of protein aggregation was compromised, correlating with the autophagy defect but not with mitochondrial dynamics. This study revealed a mixed role of STX17 in autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress response. STX17 knockout cells were highly resistant to oxidative stress, largely due to the function of STX17 in mitochondrial fission rather than autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682939>Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 selectively associate with H2A.Z-occupied promoters and are required for histone modifications.</a></h2><p>Histone H2A.Z plays an essential role in regulating transcriptional rates and memory. Interestingly, H2A.Z-bound nucleosomes are located in both transcriptionally active and inactive promotors, with no clear understanding of the mechanisms via which it differentially regulates transcription. We hypothesized that its functions are mediated through recruitment of regulatory proteins to promoters. Using rapid chromatin immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we uncovered the association of H2A.Z-bound chromatin with the metabolic enzymes, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2). Recombinant green florescence fusion proteins, combined with mutations of predicted nuclear localization signals, confirmed their nuclear localization and chromatin binding. Conclusively, chromatin immunoprecipitation-deep sequencing, confirmed the predominant association of OGDH and ACAA2 with H2A.Z-occupied transcription start sites and enhancers, the former of which we confirmed is conserved in both mouse and human tissue. Furthermore, H2A.Z-deficient human HAP1 cells exhibited reduced chromatin-bound metabolic enzymes, accompanied with reduced posttranslational histone modifications, including acetylation and succinylation. Specifically, knockdown of OGDH diminished H4 succinylation. Thus, the data reveal that select metabolic enzymes are assembled at active, H2A.Z-occupied, promoters, for potential site-directed production of metabolic intermediates that are required for histone modifications.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, transport performance depends on how motors organize on the cargo. Unfortunately, the lack of methodologies capable of measuring this organization in cells determines that many aspects of the collective action of motors remain elusive. Here, we combined fluorescence fluctuations and single particle tracking techniques to address how kinesins organize on rod-like  moving along microtubules in cells. This methodology simultaneously provides  trajectories and EGFP-tagged kinesin-1 intensity at different mitochondrial positions with millisecond resolution. We show that kinesin exchange at the mitochondrion surface is within ~100 ms and depends on the organelle speed. During anterograde transport, the mitochondrial leading tip presents slower motor exchange in comparison to the rear tip. In contrast, retrograde  show similar exchange rates of kinesins at both tips. Numerical simulations provide theoretical support to these results and evidence that motors do not share the load equally during intracellular transport.Copyright © 2019.

In this work we used the pesticide imidacloprid, in the Confidor formulation, as the stress factor and analyzed its influence on the metabolic activity, proteome and lipid content and composition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. During the cultivation of yeast, the lowest recommended application dose of Confidor (0.025%, v/v) was added to the growth media and its influence on the , cytosol with microsomes, and the whole yeast cells was monitored. The results show that under the stress provoked by the toxic effects of Confidor, yeast cells density significantly decreased and the percentage of metabolically disturbed cells significantly increased comparing with untreated control. Also, there was a downregulation of majority of glycolytic, gluconeogenesis, and TCA cycle enzymes (Fba1, Adh1, Hxk2, Tal1, Tdh1,Tdh3, Eno1) thus providing enough acetyl-CoA for the lipid restructuring and accumulation mechanism since we have found the changes in the cell and mitochondrial lipid content and FA composition. This data suggest that lipids could be the molecules that orchestrate the answer of the cells in the stress response to the Confidor treatment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692323>GSH-Activatable NIR Nanoplatform with  Targeting for Enhancing Tumor-Specific Therapy.</a></h2><p>Developing smart photosensitizers that are sensitive to tumor-specific signals for minimal side effects and enhanced antitumor efficacy is a tremendous challenge for tumor phototherapies. Herein, we construct a nanoplatform with glutathione (GSH)-activatable and -targeted pro-photosensitizer encapsulated by ultra-sensitive pH-responsive polymer for achieving imaging-guided tumor-specific photodynamic therapy (PDT). The GSH-activatable pro-photosensitizer, di-cyanine (DCy7) has been synthesized where two cyanine moieties are covalently conjugated by a disulfide bond, and the hydrophobic DCy7 is further encapsulated with an amphiphilic pH-responsive diblock copolymer POEGMA-b-PDPA to form P@DCy7 nanoparticels. Upon endocytosis by cancer cells, P@DCy7 nanoparticels dissociate at endosome firstly, and then DCy7 is released to cytoplasm and subsequently activated by the high concentration of GSH, finally targets  for organelle-targeted PDT. Moreover, intracellular antioxidant GSH is consumed during the activation procedure that is beneficial to efficient PDT. These P@DCy7 nanoparticles display selective phototoxicity against tumor cells (HepG2 or 4T1 cells) over normal cells (BEAS-2B cells) in vitro, and their GSH-activatable enhanced PDT efficacy is further confirmed in tumor-bearing mice. Thus, P@DCy7 nanoparticles allow for accurate and highly efficient PDT with minimal side effects, providing an attractive nanoplatform for organelle-targeted precise PDT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686395>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Induced by Toxic Elements-a Review of Recent Developments.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum of all eukaryotic cells is a membrane-bound organelle. Under electron microscope it appears as parallel arrays of "rough membranes" and a maze of "smooth vesicles" respectively. It performs various functions in cell, i.e., synthesis of proteins to degradation of xenobiotics. Bioaccumulation of drugs/chemicals/xenobiotics in the cytosol can trigger ER stress. It is recognized by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of ER. Present review summarizes the present status of knowledge on ER stress caused by toxic elements, viz arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, copper, chromium, and nickel. While inorganic arsenic may induce various glucose-related proteins, i.e., GRP78, GRP94 and CHOP, XBP1, and calpains, cadmium upregulates GRP78. Antioxidants like ascorbic acid, NAC, and Se inhibit the expression of UPR. Exposure to lead also changes ER stress related genes, i.e., GRP 78, GRP 94, ATF4, and ATF6. Mercury too upregulates these genes. Nickel, a carcinogenic element upregulates the expression of Bak, cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-12, and GADD 153. Much is not known on ER stress caused by nanoparticles. The review describes inter-organelle association between  and ER. It also discusses the interdependence between oxidative stress and ER stress. A cross talk amongst different cellular components appears essential to disturb pathways leading to cell death. However, these molecular switches within the signaling network used by toxic elements need to be identified. Nevertheless, ER stress especially caused by toxic elements still remains to be an engaging issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670371>Multifaceted roles of porin in mitochondrial protein and lipid transport.</a></h2><p> are essential eukaryotic organelles responsible for primary cellular energy production. Biogenesis, maintenance, and functions of  require correct assembly of resident proteins and lipids, which require their transport into and within . Mitochondrial normal functions also require an exchange of small metabolites between the cytosol and , which is primarily mediated by a metabolite channel of the outer membrane (OM) called porin or voltage-dependent anion channel. Here, we describe recently revealed novel roles of porin in the mitochondrial protein and lipid transport. First, porin regulates the formation of the mitochondrial protein import gate in the OM, the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, and its dynamic exchange between the major form of a trimer and the minor form of a dimer. The TOM complex dimer lacks a core subunit Tom22 and mediates the import of a subset of mitochondrial proteins while the TOM complex trimer facilitates the import of most other mitochondrial proteins. Second, porin interacts with both a translocating inner membrane (IM) protein like a carrier protein accumulated at the small TIM chaperones in the intermembrane space and the TIM22 complex, a downstream translocator in the IM for the carrier protein import. Porin thereby facilitates the efficient transfer of carrier proteins to the IM during their import. Third, porin facilitates the transfer of lipids between the OM and IM and promotes a back-up pathway for the cardiolipin synthesis in . Thus, porin has roles more than the metabolite transport in the protein and lipid transport into and within , which is likely conserved from yeast to human.© 2019 The Author(s).

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are highly conserved across species and play major roles in mounting the stress response. The emerging information now suggests that Hsp90 family of chaperones display additional cellular roles contributing to diseases like cancer. For this reason, pharmacological targeting of Hsp90 has emerged as a novel antitumor strategy. However, its mitochondrial homologue TRAP1 has not been implicated in cancer with conclusive mechanistic insights. Since understanding the mutational spectrum of cancer cells indicates the outcome of the disease as well as treatment response, we examined mutational spectrum of TRAP1. Our in silico analyses of TRAP1 SNPs and CNVs correlated with the aggressive cancer phenotypes, and are found to be predominant over Hsp90 itself. The increased CNVs have been correlated with increased expression of TRAP1 in metastatic cancer cells, increased ATP production, and decreased oxygen consumption rate of . Examining TRAP1 knockdown as well as over expression in metastatic cancer cells furthered our understanding that TRAP1 likely to facilitate the altered energy metabolism in the functional compromise of mitochondrial OXPHOS. Interestingly, the increased ATP levels in the TRAP1 background are found to be independent of glucose oxidation. Our results suggest TRAP1 role in triggering the alternate energy metabolism in cancer cells. Since targeting tumor metabolism is considered as an alternate strategy to combat cancer, we propose pharmacological targeting of TRAP1 to target alternate energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

The aim of the study was to determine the effects of EPA, green tea extract (GTE), and a combination of both on the cardiac consequences of diabetes mellitus, induced in Wistar rats by injection of a low dose of streptozotocin (33 mg/kg) combined with a high fat diet. Cardiac mechanical function, coronary reactivity, and parameters of oxidative stress, inflammation, and energy metabolism were evaluated. In the context of diabetes, GTE alone limited several diabetes-related symptoms such as inflammation. It also slightly improved coronary reactivity and considerably enhanced lipid metabolism. EPA alone caused the rapid death of the animals, but this effect was negated by the addition of GTE in the diet. EPA and GTE combined enhanced coronary reactivity considerably more than GTE alone. In a context of significant oxidative stress such as during diabetes mellitus, EPA enrichment constitutes a risk factor for animal survival.

However, the relationship between SIRT3 and aberrant lipid synthesis in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance of SIRT3 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and normal tissues. To analyze the role of SIRT3 in CCSC in vitro, endogenous SIRT3 levels were up- and down-regulated in SiHa and C33a cells, respectively, via lentiviral-based transfection. Levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Acetylation levels for acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC1) were measured with the anti-acetyllysine antibody. Knockdown of SIRT3 reduced levels of cellular lipid content in cells. To investigate the role of SIRT3 in cell proliferation, nude mice were xenografted with SIRT3-overexpressing or SIRT3-knockdown CCSC cells. Overall, the results demonstrate that SIRT3 significantly contributed to the reprogramming of FA synthesis in CCSC by up-regulating ACC1 to promote de novo lipogenesis by SIRT3 deacetylation. Moreover, the findings show that the SIRT3-mediated regulation of FA synthesis played a critical role in the proliferation and metastasis of CCSC cells, suggesting that SIRT3 has therapeutic potential in CCSC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666868>Synthesis of a dihalogenated pyridinyl silicon rhodamine for mitochondrial imaging by a halogen dance rearrangement.</a></h2><p> Since their first synthesis, silicon xanthenes and the subsequently developed silicon rhodamines (SiR) gained a lot of attention as attractive fluorescence dyes offering a broad field of application.

The dye is suitable for live cell STED nanoscopy imaging and shows a nontoxic profile which makes it an appropriate candidate for medical imaging.

These tiny protists display complex life histories that include sessile as well as different pelagic stages. Some choanoflagellates have the ability to form colonies as well. Up until recently, these colonies have been described to consist of mostly identical cells showing no spatial cell differentiation, which supported the traditional view that spatial cell differentiation, leading to the co-existence of specific cell types in animals, evolved after the split of the last common ancestor of the Choanoflagellata and Metazoa. The recent discovery of single cells in colonies of the choanoflagellate  that exhibit unique cell morphologies challenges this traditional view. We have now reanalyzed TEM serial sections, aiming to determine the degree of similarity of  cells within a rosette colony. We investigated cell morphologies and nuclear, mitochondrial, and food vacuole volumes of 40 individual cells from four different  rosette colonies and compared our findings to sponge choanocytes. Our analysis shows that cells in a choanoflagellate colony differ from each other in respect to cell morphology and content ratios of nuclei, , and food vacuoles. Furthermore, cell disparity within  colonies is slightly higher compared to cell disparity within sponge choanocytes. Moreover, we discovered the presence of plasma membrane contacts between colonial cells in addition to already described intercellular bridges and filo-/pseudopodial contacts. Our findings indicate that the last common ancestor of Choanoflagellata and Metazoa might have possessed plasma membrane contacts and spatial cell disparity during colonial life history stages.Copyright © 2019 Naumann and Burkhardt.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679961>A novel free radical scavenger, NSP-116, ameliorated the brain injury in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke models.</a></h2><p>Reperfusion injury is a serious problem in ischemic stroke therapy, which leads to neuronal damage and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). A novel free radical scavenger, NSP-116, has anti-oxidative effect and may ameliorate reperfusion injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of NSP-116 on both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke models. First, we assessed whether NSP-116 has protective effects in vitro. Pre-treatment of NSP-116 decreased neuronal cell damage induced by HO or LPS. Moreover, NSP-116 also suppressed  damage and apoptosis in HO-induced neuronal injury model. Based on these results, we used a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic stroke model or a collagenase-induced ICH model. Using the MCAO model, we evaluated the cerebral blood flow (CBF), neurological deficit, and infarct volume. Hematoma volume was assessed at 3 days after ICH. In the MCAO model, oral administration of NSP-116 at 30 mg/kg attenuated the reduction of CBF, neurological deficits, and infarct formation. Interestingly, NSP-116 also ameliorated hematoma expansion and neurological deficits in the ICH model. Additionally, pre-treatment of NSP-116 suppressed the brain microvascular endothelial cell death induced by collagenase treatment. Collectively, our findings indicated that oral administration of NSP-116 attenuates both ischemic and hemorrhagic brain injuries after stroke.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Most cases of PD are sporadic, while 5-10% have a known genetic basis. Variants in the PARK2 gene are the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive juvenile-onset PD. PARK2 encodes parkin, a multi-domain protein that functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase. Numerous variants spanning all parkin domains have been identified, although the pathogenic relevance for several of those remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to functionally characterize two truncating parkin variants: N52Mfs*29, which is highly prevalent in the Portuguese and Spanish populations, and L358Rfs*77, recently identified in the Portuguese population. Our results indicate that both variants are prematurely degraded by the proteasome, even though proteins levels are still moderate. We also showed that they are aggregation-prone and lead to mislocalized parkin. Interestingly, the L358Rfs*77 variant is mislocalized to the nucleus, which was never reported for parkin variants. While N52Mfs*29 impaired self-ubiquitination activity, the L358Rfs*77 variant seemed to retain it. Both variants, however, fail to ubiquitinate p62 substrate and did not relocalize to depolarized . Therefore, we conclude that parkin truncating variants cause loss of parkin function, thus showing their causative role in PD pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678302>Recurrent Rearrangements in PRKACA and PRKACB in Intraductal Oncocytic Papillary Neoplasms of the Pancreas and Bile Duct.</a></h2><p>Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms (IOPNs) of the pancreas and bile duct contain epithelial cells with numerous, large  and are cystic precursors to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), respectively. However, IOPNs do not have the genomic alterations found in other pancreatobiliary neoplasms. In fact, no recurrent genomic alterations have been described in IOPNs. PDACs without activating mutations in KRAS contain gene rearrangements, so we investigated whether IOPNs have recurrent fusions in genes.We analyzed 20 resected pancreatic IOPNs and 3 resected biliary IOPNs using a broad RNA-based targeted sequencing panel to detect cancer-related fusion genes. Four invasive PDACs and 2 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas from the same patients as the IOPNs, were also available for analysis. Samples of pancreatic cyst fluid (n=5, collected before surgery) and bile duct brushings (n=2) were analyzed for translocations. For comparison, we analyzed pancreatobiliary lesions from 126 patients without IOPN (controls).All IOPNs evaluated were found to have recurring fusions of ATP1B1-PRKACB (n = 13), DNAJB1-PRKACA (n = 6), or ATP1B1-PRKACA (n = 4). These fusions were also found in corresponding invasive PDACs and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, as well as in matched pancreatic cyst fluid and bile duct brushings. These gene rearrangements were absent from all 126 control pancreatobiliary lesions.We identified fusions in PRKACA and PRKACB genes in pancreatic and biliary IOPNs, as well as in PDACs and pancreatic cyst fluid and bile duct cells from the same patients. We did not identify these gene fusions in 126 control pancreatobiliary lesions. These fusions might be used to identify patients at risk for IOPNs and their associated invasive carcinomas.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A modified Zea Longa method was used to establish a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. The apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential of hippocampal nerve cells were measured by flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of AIF, Endo G and BNIP3 in hippocampal tissues were determined by qPCR. Western blot was used to determine the protein expressions of AIF, Endo G and BNIP3 in the  of hippocampal tissue.The apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons in the group treated with 2-AG was significantly lower than that of the model (<0.01), which indicated that 2-AG could inhibit the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons induced by MCAO. However, the mitochondrial membrane potential of hippocampal neurons in the group treated with 2-AG was significantly higher than that of the model (<0.01), indicating that 2-AG could improve the mitochondrial membrane potential of hippocampal neurons in MCAO mice. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that 2-AG could inhibit the gene expressions of AIF, Endo G and BNIP3 in hippocampal tissues. Western blot results showed that 2-AG could inhibit the secretions of AIF, Endo G and BNIP3 into cytoplasm in .Endocannabinoids 2-AG had a protective effect on neurons injury, and the mechanism was possibly associated with the protection of the brain nerve cells in the hippocampus and the integrity of the mitochondrial function.

Mitochondrial calcium overload leads to apoptosis of cells in neurologic diseases. We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of amlodipine camsylate (AC) on neural stem cells (NSCs) injured by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) with a focus on mitochondrial structure and function. NSCs were isolated from rodent embryonic brains. Effects of AC on cell viability, proliferation, level of free radicals, and expression of intracellular signaling proteins were assessed in OGD-injured NSCs. We also investigated the effect of AC on mitochondrial structure in NSCs under OGD by transmission electron microscopy. AC increased the viability and proliferation of NSCs. This beneficial effect of AC was achieved by strong protection of . AC markedly enhanced the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial anti-apoptosis proteins.

In the current study, we show that crd1Δ cells exhibit decreased levels of glutamate and cysteine and are deficient in the essential antioxidant, glutathione, a tripeptide of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol essential for maintaining intracellular redox potential in almost all eukaryotes, including yeast. Consistent with glutathione deficiency, the growth defect of crd1Δ cells at elevated temperature was rescued by supplementation of glutathione or glutamate and cysteine. Sensitivity to the oxidants iron (FeSO) and hydrogen peroxide (HO), was rescued by supplementation of glutathione. The decreased intracellular glutathione concentration in crd1Δ was restored by supplementation of glutamate and cysteine, but not by overexpressing YAP1, an activator of expression of glutathione biosynthetic enzymes. These findings show for the first time that CL plays a critical role in regulating intracellular glutathione metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we find a newly synthesized flavonoid named GL-V9, which inhibits glycolysis and induces apoptosis of human breast cancer cell lines, and investigate the underlying mechanism. Results show that hexokinase II (HKII) plays important roles in the anticancer effects of GL-V9. GL-V9 not only downregulates the expression of HKII in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, but also induces dissociation of HKII from voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in , resulting in glycolytic inhibition and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. The dissociation of mitochondrial HKII is attributed to GSK-3β-induced phosphorylation of mitochondrial VDAC. Our in vivo experiments also show that GL-V9 significantly inhibits the growth of human breast cancer due to activation of GSK-3β and inactivation of AKT. Thus, GL-V9 induces cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells via disrupting the mitochondrial binding of HKII. Our works demonstrate the significance of metabolic regulators in cancer growth and offer a fresh insight into the molecular basis for the development of GL-V9 as a candidate for breast carcinoma treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The optimized strategy presented extracts with the extraction yield up to 21.19% with a significantly higher antioxidant ability, compared with the one without SS pretreatment. Further investigation proved that the SS suppressed the polyphenol oxidase activity of the TPs extract. The ability to scavenge the free radicals were compared in mouse liver . Mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cardiolipin peroxidation, and respiratory chain complex (RCC) I-V activities were also evaluated as the index of the mitochondrial oxidative damage. The study supports evidence that the TPs extract exhibited significant protection against oxidative damage on mitochondrial. Furthermore, the effect of TPs on antioxidant ability in zebrafish embryo was evaluated. After TPs pretreatment for 1 day, zebrafish embryos showed a significantly higher survival rate as well as heart rate when facing the oxidative stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Polyphenols from tea leaves have been viewed as an antioxidant additive in food, mainly due to the ability of scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species. The results of this study suggest that the SS pretreatment could be used as an efficient method to extract TPs from the tea waste for the prevention of oxidative damage in the mouse liver  and zebrafish embryos.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671915>1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Decreases Tertiary Butyl-Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Oxidative Stress and Increases AMPK/SIRT1 Activation in C2C12 Muscle Cells.</a></h2><p>Enhanced oxidative stress has been associated with muscle mitochondrial changes and metabolic disorders. Thus, it might be a good strategy to decrease oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial changes in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we investigate the role of the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes in tertiary butyl-hydrogen (tBHP)-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Differentiated C2C12 muscle cells were pretreated with tBHP, followed by 1,25(OH)2D for additional 24 h. An exogenous inducer of oxidative stress, tBHP significantly increased oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, intracellular damage, and cell death which were reversed by 1,25(OH)2D in C2C12 myotubes. 1.25(OH)2D improves tBHP-induced mitochondrial morphological changes such as swelling, irregular cristae, and smaller size and number, as observed by transmission electron microscope. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D treatment increases mtDNA contents as well as gene expression involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1α, NRF1, and Tfam. Significant increments in mRNA levels related to antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2, HMOX1, and TXNRD1, myogenic differentiation markers including myoglobin, muscle creatine kinase (MCK), and MHCІ and ІІ, and vitamin D metabolism such as CYP24, CYP27, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were found in 1,25(OH)2D-treated myotubes. Moreover, upon t-BHP-induced oxidative stress, significant incremental changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, activities of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtulin 1 (SIRT1), and SIRT1 expression were noted in 1,25(OH)2D-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Taken together, these results suggest the observed potent inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on muscle oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics might be at least involved in the activation of AMPK and SIRT1 activation in muscle cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.</a></h2><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in , and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance.

Previous studies have shown that AgNPs exposure in HepG2 cells is primarily related to the damage of , which includes induction of mitochondrial swelling and increase of intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway. In this study, the effects of AgNPs exposure in HepG2 cells on mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis were investigated. AgNPs were found to induce mitochondrial morphological and structural alterations. The expressions of key proteins (Drp1, Fis1, OPA1, Mff, Mfn1, and Mfn2) related to mitochondrial fission/fusion event were changed. Especially the expression of fission-related protein 1 (p-Drp1) (Ser616) was significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis protein (PGC-1α) was reduced in AgNP-treated cells. Concomitantly, the expression of autophagy marker proteins (LC3B and p62) was increased. The results suggested that AgNPs could trigger cytotoxicity by targeting the , resulting in the disruption of mitochondrial function, damage to the mitochondrial structure and morphology, interfering in mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis.

It is a symptom of many chronic diseases, including cancer, liver failure, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and there is as yet no effective treatment. While the mechanisms underlying cachexia are complex, it is often accompanied by elevated angiotensin II (Ang II). Human placental extract (HPE) is a source of numerous biologically active molecules and has been used clinically to treat chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and other chronic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of HPE in an Ang II-induced cachexia model in mice. HPE treatment preserved both fat mass and lean body mass and suppressed weight loss in the cachexia model, though food intake was unaffected. Ang II infusion also caused cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. HPE suppressed these effects as well as Ang II-induced cardiac expression of genes related to heart failure and cardiac remodeling. HPE also reversed Ang II-induced downregulation of -related molecules and suppressed cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress. HPE administration may thus be an effective approach to the treatment of cachexia, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696196>-targeted cationic liposomes modified with alkyltriphenylphosphonium bromides loaded with hydrophilic drugs: preparation, cytotoxicity and colocalization assay.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this work was to obtain cationic liposomes based on 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine noncovalently modified using alkyltriphenylphosphonium bromides (TPPB-n) with different lengths of hydrocarbon tail for targeted delivery to .

Platelets are one of the crucial factors for hemostasis and thrombosis. In terminally differentiated MKs many molecular process such as caspase activation and a massive cytoskeletal rearrangement drive the formation of cytoplasmic extensions called proplatelets. These cytoplasmic extensions packed with granules and organelles are then released from the bone marrow into the blood circulation as platelets. Classically, caspase activation is associated with apoptosis and recent reports suggest their involvement in cell differentiation and maturation. There is no clear evidence demonstrating the stimulus for caspase activation during megakaryocyte development. In the current study, we attempted to understand the importance of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the caspase activation during megakaryocyte maturation. We used human megakaryoblstic cell line (Dami cells) as an experimental model. We induced these cells with PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) a known inducer of megakaryocyte to understand the involvement of ER stress during maturation, with increased cell size in association with ER stress induced caspase activation. We used Thapsigargin, a non-competitive inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum CaATPase (SERCA) as a positive control to induce ER stress.Upon its treatment, we observed larger and adherent cells with the increased expression of megakaryocytic markers (CD41 and CD61) and UPR markers in PMA or Thapsigargin treated cells as compared to control. Also, Thapsigargin treatment induced increased caspase activity and PARP cleavage and showed decrease in ER calcium levels leading to reduced activity of calcium-dependent ER chaperones and accumulation of unfolded protein. The increased megakaryocyte maturation markers alongside with ER stress and caspase activation suggests the importance of ER stress in caspase activation during MK maturation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.

Mitochondrial dynamics, regulated by mitochondrial fission, fusion, and trafficking, ensure restructuring of this complex reticulum in response to nutrient availability, molecular signals, and cellular stress. Aberrant mitochondrial structures have long been observed in aging and age-related diseases indicating that mitochondrial dynamics are compromised as cells age. However, the specific mechanisms by which aging affects mitochondrial dynamics and whether these changes are causally or casually associated with cellular and organismal aging is not clear. Here, we review recent studies that show specifically how mitochondrial fission, fusion, and trafficking are altered with age. We discuss factors that change with age to directly or indirectly influence mitochondrial dynamics while examining causal roles for altered mitochondrial dynamics in healthy aging and underlying functional outputs that might affect longevity. Lastly, we propose that altered mitochondrial dynamics might not just be a passive consequence of aging but might constitute an adaptive mechanism to mitigate age-dependent cellular impairments and might be targeted to increase longevity and promote healthy aging.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672358>Melatonin ameliorates ochratoxin A-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in porcine oocytes.</a></h2><p>Melatonin is a hormone which is generated from pineal gland, and it is responsible for the regulation of wake-sleep cycle. Melatonin is a well-known antioxidant and free radical scavenger to protect against multiple type of tissue damage. While ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin found widely in contaminated food and foodstuffs, which causes nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive damage in humans and animals. In present study we report the toxicity of OTA on porcine oocyte quality and the protective effects of melatonin on OTA-exposed oocytes. Using transcriptome analysis our results show that OTA exposure alters the expression of multiple genes in oocytes, indicating its effect on oocyte maturation. The cellular changes following OTA treatment are examined, and the results show that OTA adversely affects oocyte polar body extrusion, which is confirmed by the delay of Cdc2-mediated cell cycle progression. OTA exposure also disrupts meiotic spindle formation, which is confirmed by altered phosphorylated MAPK expression. RNA-seq screening and further fluorescence staining results show that OTA induces aberrant  distribution and oxidative phosphorylation defects, which then causes oxidative stress, followed by early apoptosis and autophagy. Treatment with melatonin significantly ameliorates oxidative stress and apoptosis, which further protects cell cycle and spindle formation in OTA-exposed oocytes. Collectively, these results show the protective effects of melatonin against defects induced by OTA during porcine meiotic oocyte maturation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the DARS2 gene which encodes mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. As mitochondrial ARSs are key components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus, we investigated the effects of DARS2 mutations on mitochondrial functions and mitochondrial morphology in an LBSL patient. In fibroblasts from the patient with LBSL, biosynthesis of respiratory chain complex proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA was decreased, while those encoded by nuclear DNA were not. Cellular oxygen consumption rates and respiratory control ratio were decreased in the LBSL patient; in addition, fragmentation of  was increased, while their tubular elongation and interconnectivity were decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that DARS2 mutations impair translations of mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory chain complex proteins, consequently causing dysfunction of cellular respiration and impediment of mitochondrial dynamics, which highlights the role of mtARSs in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679230>Chaga Medicinal Mushroom, Inonotus obliquus (Agaricomycetes) Polysaccharides Suppress Tacrine-induced Apoptosis by ROS-scavenging and Mitochondrial Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Tacrine is the first drug licensed for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

The results showed that I. obliquus polysaccharides (IOP) reduced tacrine-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of tacrine-induced ROS generation, 8-OHdG formation in mitochondrial DNA, and loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential by IOP were also observed. Furthermore, IOP decreased the cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3 induced by tacrine. These data suggest that IOP could inhibit tacrine-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The protection is mediated by an antioxidant protective mechanism. Consumption of IOP may be a plausible way to prevent tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694192>The Role of Inflammasome-Dependent and Inflammasome-Independent NLRP3 in the Kidney.</a></h2><p>Cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) forms an inflammasome with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and pro-caspase-1, which is followed by the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1 and ultimately the activation of IL-1β and IL-18 and induction of pyroptosis in immune cells. NLRP3 activation in kidney diseases aggravates inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, and this effect is abrogated by genetic or pharmacologic deletion of NLRP3. Inflammasome-dependent NLRP3 mediates the progression of kidney diseases by escalating the inflammatory response in immune cells and the cross-talk between immune cells and renal nonimmune cells. However, recent studies have suggested that NLRP3 has several inflammasome-independent functions in the kidney. Inflammasome-independent NLRP3 regulates apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells by interacting with  and mediating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and mitophagy. This review will summarize the mechanisms by which NLRP3 functions in the kidney in both inflammasome-dependent and inflammasome-independent ways and the role of NLRP3 and NLRP3 inhibitors in kidney diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694019>Mitochondrial-Derived Peptide MOTS-c Attenuates Vascular Calcification and Secondary Myocardial Remodeling via Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Vascular calcification (VC) is a complex, regulated process involved in many disease entities. So far, there are no treatments to reverse it. Exploring novel strategies to prevent VC is important and necessary for VC-related disease intervention.In this study, we evaluated whether MOTS-c, a novel -related 16-aa peptide, can reduce vitamin D3 and nicotine-induced VC in rats.Vitamin D3 plus nicotine-treated rats were injected with MOTS-c at a dose of 5 mg/kg once a day for 4 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight were measured, and echocardiography was performed. The expression of phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) and endothelin B (ET-B) receptors was determined by Western blot analysis.Our results showed that MOTS-c treatment significantly attenuated VC. Furthermore, we found that the level of phosphorylated AMPK was increased and the expression levels of the AT-1 and ET-B receptors were decreased after MOTS-c treatment.Our findings provide evidence that MOTS-c may act as an inhibitor of VC by activating the AMPK signaling pathway and suppressing the expression of the AT-1 and ET-B receptors.© 2019 S.

But, how impaired mitophagy participates in tissue-specific vulnerability in the brain remains unclear. Here, we find that striatal-enriched protein, Rhes, is a critical regulator of mitophagy and striatal vulnerability in brain. In vivo interactome and density fractionation reveal that Rhes coimmunoprecipitates and cosediments with mitochondrial and lysosomal proteins. Live-cell imaging of cultured striatal neuronal cell line shows Rhes surrounds globular , recruits lysosomes, and ultimately degrades . In the presence of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, Rhes disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ  ) and promotes excessive mitophagy and cell death. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that systemic injection of 3-NP in mice promotes globular , accumulation of mitophagosomes, and striatal lesion only in the wild-type (WT), but not in the Rhes knockout (KO), striatum, suggesting that Rhes is critical for mitophagy and neuronal death in vivo. Mechanistically, Rhes requires Nix (BNIP3L), a known receptor of mitophagy, to disrupt ΔΨ  and promote mitophagy and cell death. Rhes interacts with Nix via SUMO E3-ligase domain, and Nix depletion totally abrogates Rhes-mediated mitophagy and cell death in the cultured striatal neuronal cell line. Finally, we find that Rhes, which travels from cell to cell via tunneling nanotube (TNT)-like cellular protrusions, interacts with dysfunctional  in the neighboring cell in a Nix-dependent manner. Collectively, Rhes is a major regulator of mitophagy via Nix, which may determine striatal vulnerability in the brain.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

We investigated the function of tumor protein D54 (TPD54/TPD52L2) and found that TPD54 was involved in multiple membrane trafficking pathways: anterograde traffic, recycling, and Golgi integrity. To understand how TPD54 controls these diverse functions, we used an inducible method to reroute TPD54 to . Surprisingly, this manipulation resulted in the capture of many small vesicles (30 nm diameter) at the mitochondrial surface. Super-resolution imaging confirmed the presence of similarly sized TPD54-positive structures under normal conditions. It appears that TPD54 defines a new class of transport vesicle, which we term intracellular nanovesicles (INVs). INVs meet three criteria for functionality. They contain specific cargo, they have certain R-SNAREs for fusion, and they are endowed with a variety of Rab GTPases (16 out of 43 tested). The molecular heterogeneity of INVs and the diverse functions of TPD54 suggest that INVs have various membrane origins and a number of destinations. We propose that INVs are a generic class of transport vesicle that transfer cargo between these varied locations.© 2019 Larocque et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678001>Uncoupling protein 1 inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and alleviates acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is predominantly found in brown adipose tissue , and mediates energy dissipation to generate heat rather than ATP via functional mitochondrial uncoupling. However, little is known about its expression and function in kidney.We carried out a mRNA microarray analysis in mice kidneys with ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. The most dramatically downregulated gene UCP1 after IR was identified, and its role in generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress injury was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. Genetic deletion of UCP1 was used to investigate the effects of UCP1 on ischemia or cisplatin-indued acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice.UCP1 was located in renal tubular epithelial cells in kidney and downregulated in a time-dependent manner during renal IR. Deletion of UCP1 increased oxidative stress in kidneys and aggravated ischemia or cisplatin induced AKI in mice.Viral-based overexpression of UCP1 reduced mitochondrial ROS generation and apoptosis in hypoxia-treated tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, UCP1 expression was regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR) γ in kidneys during renal IR. Overexpression of PPAR-γ resembled UCP1-overexpression phenotype in vitro. Treatment with PPAR-γ agonist could induce UCP1 upregulation and provide protective effect against renal IR injury in UCP1mice, but not in UCP1mice.UCP1 protects against AKI likely by suppressing oxidative stress, and activation of UCP1 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for AKI.

However, the effect of iron-overload on the brain of thalassemic condition has never been investigated. An iron chelator (deferiprone) provides neuroprotective effects against metal toxicity. Furthermore, a T-type calcium channels blocker (efonidipine) effectively attenuates cardiac dysfunction in thalassemic mice with iron-overload. However, the effects of both drugs on brain of iron-overload thalassemia has not been determined. We hypothesize that iron-overload induces neurotoxicity in Thalassemic and wild-type mice, and not only deferiprone, but also efonidipine, provides neuroprotection against iron-overload condition.Mice from both wild-type (WT) and β-thalassemic type (HT) groups were assigned to be fed with a standard-diet or high-iron diet containing 0.2% ferrocene/kg of diet (HFe) for 4 months consecutively. After three months of HFe, 75-mg/kg/d deferiprone or 4-mg/kg/d efonidipine were administered to the HFe-fed WT and HT mice for 1 month.HFe consumption caused an equal impact on circulating iron-overload, oxidative stress, and inflammation in WT and HT mice. Brain iron-overload and iron-mediated neurotoxicity, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, glial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Alzheimer's like pathologies, were observed to an equal degree in HFe fed WT and HT mice. These pathological conditions were mitigated by both deferiprone and efonidipine.These findings indicate that iron-overload itself caused neurotoxicity, and T-type calcium channels may play a role in this condition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The Ca transients measured with GA and mitoGA reflected contractions of the trunk observed by transmitted light. The mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP and the inhibitor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), DS16570511, abolished mitochondrial Ca transients whereas they increased the frequency of cytosolic Ca transients and muscle contractions, confirming the subcellular localization of mitoGA. Mitochondrial Ca dynamics were also determined with mitoGA and were found to follow closely cytoplasmic changes, with a slower decay. Cytoplasmic Ca kinetics and propagation along the trunk and tail were characterized with GA and with the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca indicator, Twitch-4. Although fluorescence provided a better spatio-temporal resolution, GA was able to resolve the same kinetic parameters while allowing continuous measurements for hours.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680803>NeurodegenERation: The Central Role for ER Contacts in Neuronal Function and Axonopathy, Lessons From Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias and Related Diseases.</a></h2><p>The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative conditions whose characteristic feature is degeneration of the longest axons within the corticospinal tract which leads to progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Though highly genetically heterogeneous, the majority of HSP cases are caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are responsible for generating and organizing the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite this, the role of the ER within neurons, particularly the long axons affected in HSP, is not well understood. Throughout axons, ER tubules make extensive contacts with other organelles, the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. At these ER contacts, protein complexes work in concert to perform specialized functions including organelle shaping, calcium homeostasis and lipid biogenesis, all of which are vital for neuronal survival and may be disrupted by HSP-causing mutations. In this article we summarize the proteins which mediate ER contacts, review the functions these contacts are known to carry out within neurons, and discuss the potential contribution of disruption of ER contacts to axonopathy in HSP.Copyright © 2019 Fowler, Garcia-Pardo, Simpson and O’Sullivan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669858>News and views in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): The role of co-morbidity and novel treatments.</a></h2><p>Though affecting many thousands of patients, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) should be considered an orphan disease, since the cause remains elusive and no treatment is available that can provide complete cure.

The exposure index value increases with extended usage of the chemical. Further, estimated total amount of BHT could exceed standard regulation, considering dietary intake or another exposure. Although BHT may induce side effects in reproductive systems, adequate research had not yet been performed to confirm them. In this study, we investigated the effects of BHT on mouse Leydig cells (TM3), which are components of testis. Our results indicated that BHT suppressed cellular proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in TM3 cells. Moreover, BHT hampered cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis in TM3 cells. Furthermore, BHT treatment led to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and DNA fragmentation, simultaneously stimulating intrinsic apoptosis signal transduction. To elucidate the mode of action of BHT on Leydig cells, we performed western blot analysis and confirmed the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Collectively, our results demonstrated that BHT has toxic effects on mouse Leydig cells via induction of calcium dysregulation and ER- dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the mechanism by which α-MG reduces LPS-stimulated IEC-6 cells inflammation. A genome-wide examination of control, LPS-stimulated, and α-MG-pretreated cells was performed with the Illumina Hiseq sequencing platform, and gene expression was verified with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Among the 37,199 genes profiled, 2014 genes were regulated in the LPS group, and 475 genes were regulated in the α-MG group. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that they were mainly related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Based on the transcriptomic results, we constructed a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with LPS and investigated the effects of α-MG on NLRP3 inflammasomes. After LPS stimulation, the rat intestinal villi were significantly detached, with congestion and hemorrhage; the intestinal epithelial cell nuclei were deformed; and the  were swollen. However, after pretreatment with α-MG, the intestinal villus congestion and hemorrhage were reduced, the epithelial nuclei were rounded, and the mitochondrial morphology was intact. qPCR and western blotting were used to detect NLRP3, caspase 1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β expression at the gene and protein levels. Their expression increased at both the transcript and protein levels after LPS stimulation, whereas it decreased after pretreatment with α-MG. This study provides new methods and ideas for the treatment of inflammation. α-MG may have utility as a drug for intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679452>Defending stressed : uncovering the role of MUL1 in suppressing neuronal mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Chronic mitochondrial stress is associated with major neurodegenerative diseases; and thus, the recovery of those  constitutes a critical step of energy maintenance in early stages of neurodegeneration. Our recent study provides the first lines of evidence showing that the MUL1-MFN2 pathway acts as an early checkpoint to maintain mitochondrial integrity by regulating mitochondrial morphology and interplay with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This mechanism ensures that degradation through mitophagy is restrained in neurons under early stress conditions. MUL1 deficiency increases MFN2 activity, triggering the first phase of mitochondrial hyperfusion and acting as an antagonist of ER- (ER-Mito) tethering. Reduced ER-Mito interplay enhances the cytoplasmic Ca load that induces the DNM1L/Drp1-dependent second phase of mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into neuronal mitochondrial maintenance under stress conditions. Identifying this pathway is particularly relevant because chronic mitochondrial dysfunction and altered ER-Mito contacts have been reported in major neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672329>From  to healthy aging: The role of branched-chain amino acids treatment: MATeR a randomized study.</a></h2><p>Malnutrition often affects elderly patients and significantly contributes to the reduction in healthy life expectancy, causing high morbidity and mortality. In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino acid supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino acid enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for 2 months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of  bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) forms the enzymatic core of the highly conserved mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is a key inhibitor of autophagy, yet the function of mTORC2 in autophagy is controversial. We here show that inactivation of mTORC2 and its direct target serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK-1) potently induces autophagy and the autophagic degradation of  in C. elegans. Enhanced autophagy in mTORC2- or SGK-1-deficient animals contributes to their developmental and reproductive defects and is independent of the canonical SGK-1 effector DAF-16/FOXO. Importantly, we find that inactivation of mTORC2-SGK-1 signaling impairs mitochondrial homeostasis and triggers an increased release of -derived reactive oxygen species (mtROS) to induce autophagy. Thus, mitochondrial stress couples reduced mTORC2 activity to enhanced autophagic turnover.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although, glutamine is known to activate mTOR, if/how differential mitochondrial utilization of glutamine impinges on mTOR signalling is less explored. Mitochondrial SIRT4, which unlike other sirtuins is induced in a fed state, is known to inhibit catabolic signalling/pathways through AMPK-PGC1α/SIRT1-PPARα axis and negatively regulate glutamine metabolism via TCA cycle. However, physiological significance of SIRT4 functions during a fed state is still unknown. Here, we establish SIRT4 as key anabolic factor that activates TORC1 signalling and regulates lipogenesis, autophagy and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the ability of SIRT4 to inhibit anaplerotic conversion of glutamine to α-ketoglutarate potentiates TORC1. Interestingly, we also show that mitochondrial glutamine sparing or utilization is critical for differentially regulating TORC1 under fed and fasted conditions. Moreover, we conclusively show that differential expression of SIRT4 during fed and fasted states is vital for coupling mitochondrial energetics and glutamine utilization with anabolic pathways.

The mitochondrial metabolic phenotypes of macrophages were assessed according to oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Inflammatory responses were assessed for production of cytokines and expression of activation markers. MCT oil was more rapidly oxidized as observed by increased OCR in macrophages.

However, its role in the intestine during hibernation remains unclear. In the current study, we characterized in vivo up-regulation of autophagy in enterocytes of the small intestine of Chinese soft-shelled turtles during hibernation. Autophagy-specific markers were used to confirm the existence of autophagy in enterocytes through immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and immunoblotting. IHC staining indicated strong, positive immunoreactivity of the autophagy-related gene (ATG7), microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3), and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) within the mucosal surface during hibernation and poor expression during nonhibernation. IF staining results showed the opposite tendency for ATG7, LC3, and sequestosome 1 (p62). During hibernation ATG7 and LC3 showed strong, positive immunosignaling within the mucosal surface, while p62 showed strong, positive immunosignaling during nonhibernation. Similar findings were confirmed by immunoblotting. Moreover, the ultrastructural components of autophagy in enterocytes were revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). During hibernation, the cumulative formation of phagophores and autophagosomes were closely associated with well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum in enterocytes. These autophagosomes overlapped with lysosomes, multivesicular bodies, and degraded  to facilitate the formation of autophagolysosome, amphisomes, and mitophagy in enterocytes. Immunoblotting showed the expression level of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was enhanced during hibernation. Furthermore, the exosome secretion pathway of early-late endosomes and multivesicular bodies were closely linked with autophagosomes in enterocytes during hibernation. These findings suggest that the entrance into hibernation is a main challenge for reptiles to maintain homeostasis and cellular quality control in the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682795>Important methodological aspects that should be taken into account during the research of isolated .</a></h2><p>Isolated  have been widely used for the study of energetic functioning of these important cellular organelles in a physiological or pathophysiological state.

Choline PET or PET/CT has been used to visualize prostate cancer, and high levels of choline accumulation have been observed in tumors. However, the uptake system for choline and the functional expression of choline transporters in prostate cancer are not completely understood. In this study, the molecular and functional aspects of choline uptake were investigated in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line along with the correlations between choline uptake and cell viability in drug-treated cells. Choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 mRNA were highly expressed in LNCaP cells. CTL1 and CTL2 were located in the plasma membrane and , respectively. [H]Choline uptake was mediated by a single Na-independent, intermediate-affinity transport system in the LNCaP cells. The anticancer drugs, flutamide and bicalutamide, inhibited cell viability and [H]choline uptake in a concentration-dependent manner.

Apoptosis in most cells is coordinated on  by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins sets a threshold for mitochondrial apoptosis, a balance that is altered during cancer progression. Consequently, avoidance of cell death is an established cancer hallmark. Although there is a general perception that tumour cells are more resistant to apoptosis than their normal counterparts, the realities of cell death regulation in cancer are more nuanced. In this review we discuss how a profound understanding of this control has led to new therapeutic approaches, including the new class of BH3-mimetics, which directly target apoptosis as a vulnerability in cancer. We discuss recent findings that highlight the current limitations in our understanding of apoptosis and how these novel therapeutics work.Copyright: © 2019 Gilmore A and King L.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693908>MitoRibo-Tag Mice Provide a Tool for In Vivo Studies of Mitoribosome Composition.</a></h2><p> harbor specialized ribosomes (mitoribosomes) necessary for the synthesis of key membrane proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. To date, no animal model exists to study mitoribosome composition and mitochondrial translation coordination in mammals in vivo. Here, we create MitoRibo-Tag mice as a tool enabling affinity purification and proteomics analyses of mitoribosomes and their interactome in different tissues. We also define the composition of an assembly intermediate formed in the absence of MTERF4, necessary for a late step in mitoribosomal biogenesis. We identify the orphan protein PUSL1, which interacts with a large subunit assembly intermediate, and demonstrate that it is an inner-membrane-associated mitochondrial matrix protein required for efficient mitochondrial translation. This work establishes MitoRibo-Tag mice as a powerful tool to study mitoribosomes in vivo, enabling future studies on the mitoribosome interactome under different physiological states, as well as in disease and aging.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has profound effects on the brain. In primary mitochondrial diseases, mutations that impair specific oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins or OXPHOS assembly factors lead to isolated biochemical defects and a heterogeneous group of clinical phenotypes, including mitochondrial encephalopathies. A broader defect of OXPHOS function, due to mutations in proteins involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance, mitochondrial biogenesis, or mitochondrial tRNAs can also underlie severe mitochondrial encephalopathies. While primary mitochondrial dysfunction causes rare genetic forms of neurological disorders, secondary mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of some of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many studies have investigated mitochondrial function and dysfunction in bulk central nervous system (CNS) tissue. However, the interpretation of these studies has been often complicated by the extreme cellular heterogeneity of the CNS, which includes many different types of neurons and glial cells. Because neurons are especially dependent on OXPHOS for ATP generation, mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be directly involved in cell autonomous neuronal demise. Despite being metabolically more flexible than neurons, glial  also play an essential role in the function of the CNS, and have adapted specific metabolic and mitochondrial features to support their diversity of functions. This review analyzes our current understanding and the gaps in knowledge of mitochondrial properties of glia and how they affect neuronal functions, in health and disease.Copyright © 2018.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of Sirt3 on diabetic mice and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under high glucose (HG) condition. HUVECs were cultured under HG and inflammation pathway was determined via qPCR, western blots, and immunofluorescence. Sirt3 expression was reduced in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Overexpression of Sirt3 sustains renal function and retard the development of diabetic nephropathy. Mechanistically, Sirt3 overexpression attenuated hyperglycemia-mediated endothelial cells apoptosis in kidney. Besides, Sirt3 overexpression repressed oxidative injury and blocked caspase-9-related apoptosis pathway. Moreover, we found that Sirt3 overexpression was associated with AMPK activation and the latter elevates PGC1α-related mitochondrial protective system, especially mitochondrial autophagy. Loss of opa1 and/or inhibition of AMPK could depress mitochondrial autophagy and exacerbates mitochondrial function, finally contributing to the death of human renal mesangial cells. Our results demonstrated the beneficial effects of Sirt3 in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Increased Sirt3-activated AMPK pathway, augments PGC1α-related mitochondrial protective system, sustained redox balance and closed caspase-9-involved apoptosis pathway in the setting of diabetic nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694905>MET Inhibition Elicits PGC1α-Dependent Metabolic Reprogramming in Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>The receptor kinase c-MET has emerged as a target for glioblastoma therapy. However, treatment resistance emerges inevitably. Here, we performed global metabolite screening with metabolite set enrichment coupled with transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis and proteomic screening, and identified substantial reprogramming of tumor metabolism involving oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with substantial accumulation of acyl-carnitines accompanied by an increase of PGC1α in response to genetic (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) and pharmacological (crizotinib) inhibition of c-MET. Extracellular flux and carbon tracing analyses (U-13C-Glucose, U-13C-Glutamine and U-13C-palmitic acid) demonstrated enhanced oxidative metabolism, which was driven by FAO and supported by increased anaplerosis of glucose carbons. These findings were observed in concert with increased number and fusion of  and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Genetic interference with PGC1α rescued this oxidative phenotype driven by c-MET inhibition. Silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CREB regulates the expression of PGC1α in the context of c-MET inhibition. Interference with both oxidative phosphorylation (metformin, oligomycin) and beta-oxidation of fatty acids (etomoxir) enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of c-MET inhibition. Synergistic cell death was observed with c-MET inhibition and gamitrinib treatment. In patient-derived xenograft models, combination treatments of crizotinib and etomoxir, and crizotinib and gamitrinib were significantly more efficacious than single treatments and did not induce toxicity. Collectively, we have unraveled the mechanistic underpinnings of c-MET inhibition and identified novel combination therapies that may enhance its therapeutic efficacy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685808>Correction: X-chromosome-linked miR548am-5p is a key regulator of sex disparity in the susceptibility to -mediated apoptosis.</a></h2><p>An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692435>Gut-Amygdala Interactions in Autism Spectrum Disorders: Developmental Roles via regulating , Exosomes, Immunity and microRNAs.</a></h2><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have long been conceived as a developmental disorder. A growing body of data highlights a role for alterations in the gut in the pathoetiology and/or pathophysiology of ASD. Recent work shows alterations in the gut microbiome to have a significant impact on amygdala development in infancy, suggesting that the alterations in the gut microbiome may act to modulate not only amygdala development but how the amygdala modulates the development of the frontal cortex and other brain regions.This article reviews wide bodies of data pertaining to the developmental roles of the maternal and foetal gut and immune systems in the regulation of offspring brain development.A number of processes seem to be important in mediating how genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors interact in early development to regulate such gut-mediated changes in the amygdala, wider brain functioning and inter-area connectivity, including via regulation of microRNA (miR)-451, 14-3-3 proteins, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1B1 and the melatonergic pathways. As well as a decrease in the activity of monoamine oxidase, heightened levels of in miR-451 and CYP1B1, coupled to decreased 14-3-3 act to inhibit the synthesis of N-acetylserotonin and melatonin, contributing to the hyperserotonemia that is often evident in ASD, with consequences for  functioning and the content of released exosomes. These same factors are likely to play a role in regulating placental changes that underpin the association of ASD with preeclampsia and other perinatal risk factors, including exposure to heavy metals and air pollutants. Such alterations in placental and gut processes act to change the amygdala-driven biological underpinnings of affect-cognitive and affect-sensory interactions in the brain.Such a perspective readily incorporates previously disparate bodies of data in ASD, including the role of the mu-opioid receptor, dopamine signalling and dopamine receptors, as well as the changes occurring to oxytocin and taurine levels. This has a number of treatment implications, the most readily applicable being the utilization of sodium butyrate and melatonin.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681307>NLRX1 Is a Multifaceted and Enigmatic Regulator of Immune System Function.</a></h2><p>Over the last decade, significant progress has been achieved in defining mechanisms underlying NLR regulation of immune system function. However, several NLR family members continue to defy our best attempts at characterization and routinely exhibit confounding data. This is particularly true for NLR family members that regulate signaling associated with the activation of other pattern recognition receptors. NLRX1 is a member of this NLR sub-group and acts as an enigmatic regulator of immune system function. NLRX1 has been shown to negatively regulate type-I interferon, attenuate pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling, promote reactive oxygen species production, and modulate autophagy, cell death, and proliferation. However, the mechanism/s associated with NLRX1 modulation of these pathways is not fully understood and there are inconsistencies within the field. Likewise, it is highly likely that the full repertoire of biological functions impacted by NLRX1 are yet to be defined. Recent mouse studies have shown that NLRX1 significantly impacts a multitude of diseases, including cancer, virus infection, osteoarthritis, traumatic brain injury, and inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, it is essential that the underlying mechanism associated with NLRX1 function in each of these diseases be robustly defined. Here, we summarize the current progress in understanding mechanisms associated with NLRX1 function. We also offer insight into both unique and overlapping mechanisms regulated by NLRX1 that likely contribute to disease pathobiology. Ultimately, we believe that an improved understanding of NLRX1 will result in better defined mechanisms associated with immune system attenuation and the resolution of inflammation in a myriad of diseases.Copyright © 2019 Nagai-Singer, Morrison and Allen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678601>Mitochondrial complex IV is lost in neurons in the cuprizone mouse model.</a></h2><p>Cuprizone administration in mice leads to oligodendrocyte death and demyelination.

However, there is a lack of research on the development of ROS-generating nanosystems that combine endogenous and exogenous ROS to enhance oxidative stress-mediated cancer cell death.  A ROS-generating agent based on polymer-modified zinc peroxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) was presented, which simultaneously delivered exogenous HO and Zn capable of amplifying endogenous ROS production for synergistic cancer therapy.  After internalization into tumor cells, ZnO NPs underwent decomposition in response to mild acidic pH, resulting in controlled release of HO and Zn. Intriguingly, Zn could increase the production of mitochondrial O· and HO by inhibiting the electron transport chain, and thus exerted anticancer effect in a synergistic manner with the exogenously released HO to promote cancer cell killing. Furthermore, ZnO NPs were doped with manganese  cation exchange, making them an activatable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent.

Gefitinib resistance mechanisms include MET gene amplification. A therapeutic strategy targeting MET as well as EGFR can overcome resistance to gefitinib. In the present study we identified Echinatin (Ecn), a characteristic chalcone in licorice, which inhibited both EGFR and MET and strongly altered NSCLC cell growth. The antitumor efficacy of Ecn against gefitinib-sensitive or -resistant NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations and MET amplification was confirmed by suppressing cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony growth. During the targeting of EGFR and MET, Ecn significantly blocked the kinase activity, which was validated with competitive ATP binding. Inhibition of EGFR and MET by Ecn decreases the phosphorylation of downstream target proteins ERBB3, AKT and ERK compared with total protein expression or control. Ecn induced the G2/M cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway of caspase-dependent activation. Ecn induced ROS production and GRP78, CHOP, DR5 and DR4 expression as well as depolarized the  membrane potential.

Through its pantetheine-4'-phosphate post-translational modification, NDUFAB1 interacts with members of the leucine-tyrosine-arginine motif (LYRM) protein family. Although a number of LYRM proteins have been described to participate in a variety of defined processes, the functions of others remain either partially or entirely unknown. We profiled the interaction network of NDUFAB1 to reveal associations with 9 known LYRM proteins as well as more than 20 other proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex and mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Subsequent knockout and interaction network studies in human cells revealed the LYRM member AltMiD51 to be important for optimal assembly of the large mitoribosome subunit, consistent with recent structural studies. In addition, we used proteomics coupled with topographical heat-mapping to reveal that knockout of LYRM2 impairs assembly of the NADH-dehydrogenase module of complex I, leading to defects in cellular respiration. Together, this work adds to the catalogue of functions executed by LYRM family of proteins in building mitochondrial complexes and emphasises the common and essential role of NDUFAB1 as a protagonist in mitochondrial metabolism.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680811>ASCs-Exosomes Recover Coupling Efficiency and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in an  Model of ALS.</a></h2><p>The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motoneurons death. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein have been identified to be related to the disease. Beyond the different altered pathways, the mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major features that leads to the selective death of motoneurons in ALS. The NSC-34 cell line, overexpressing human SOD1(G93A) mutant protein [NSC-34(G93A)], is considered an optimal  model to study ALS. Here we investigated the energy metabolism in NSC-34(G93A) cells and in particular the effect of the mutated SOD1(G93A) protein on the mitochondrial respiratory capacity (complexes I-IV) by high resolution respirometry (HRR) and cytofluorimetry. We demonstrated that NSC-34(G93A) cells show a reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity. In particular, we found significant impairment of the complex I-linked oxidative phosphorylation, reduced efficiency of the electron transfer system (ETS) associated with a higher rate of dissipative respiration, and a lower membrane potential. In order to rescue the effect of the mutated SOD1 gene on  impairment, we evaluated the efficacy of the exosomes, isolated from adipose-derived stem cells, administrated on the NSC-34(G93A) cells. These data show that ASCs-exosomes are able to restore complex I activity, coupling efficiency and mitochondrial membrane potential.

Thus, chronic exposure to environmental chemicals that affect mitochondrial function can have harmful effects on humans. We argue that the concept of hormesis should be revisited to explain the non-linear responses to mitochondrial toxins at a low-dose range and develop practical methods to protect humans from the negative effects of mitochondrial toxins. Of the most concern to humans are lipophilic chemical mixtures and heavy metals, owing to their physical properties. Even though these chemicals tend to demonstrate no safe level in humans, a non-linear dose-response has been also observed. Stress response activation, i.e., hormesis, can explain this non-linearity. Recently, hormesis has reemerged as a unifying concept because diverse stressors can induce similar stress responses. Besides potentially harmful environmental chemicals, healthy lifestyle interventions such as exercise, calorie restriction (especially glucose), cognitive stimulation, and phytochemical intake also activate stress responses. This conceptual link can lead to the development of practical methods that counterbalance the harm of mitochondrial toxins. Unlike chemical hormesis with its safety issues, the activation of stress responses via lifestyle modification can be safely used to combat the negative effects of mitochondrial toxins.Copyright © 2019 Korean Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679456>Pharmacological restoration of autophagy reduces hypertension-related stroke occurrence.</a></h2><p>The identification of the mechanisms predisposing to stroke may improve its preventive and therapeutic strategies in patients with essential hypertension. The role of macroautophagy/autophagy in the development of hypertension-related stroke needs to be clarified. We hypothesized that a defective autophagy may favor hypertension-related spontaneous stroke by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction. We studied autophagy in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rat, which represents a clinically relevant model of stroke associated with high blood pressure. We assessed autophagy, mitophagy and NAD:NADH levels in brains of SHRSP and stroke-resistant SHR fed with high salt diet. Vascular smooth muscle cells silenced for the mitochondrial complex I subunit  gene (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2) and cerebral endothelial cells isolated from SHRSP were also used to assess autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial function in response to high salt levels. We found a reduction of autophagy in brains of high salt-fed SHRSP. Autophagy impairment was associated with NDUFC2 downregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and NAD depletion. Restoration of NAD levels by nicotinamide administration reactivated autophagy and reduced stroke development in SHRSP. A selective reactivation of autophagy/mitophagy by Tat-Beclin 1 also reduced stroke occurrence, restored autophagy/mitophagy and improved mitochondrial function. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from subjects homozygous for the thymine allele variant at /rs11237379, which is associated with  deficiency and increased stroke risk, displayed an impairment of autophagy and increased senescence in response to high salt levels.

Icariin has been shown to exert a protective effect on human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accordingly has implications for the prevention and treatment of IVDD; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action are not fully established. In this study, the mechanisms underlying its protection against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced oxidative stress injury were investigated. In vitro, we demonstrated that icariin inhibits HO-induced -mediated apoptosis. It upregulates oxidative stress mediators, i.e., reactive oxygen species, and downregulates mitochondrial membrane potential. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) is a key factor involved in the regulation of the endogenous defense system. It was proved that icariin could activate the Nrf-2 signaling pathway, upregulate the protein expression of nuclear respiratory factor-1 and the mitochondrial transcription factor, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in human NP cells. An Nrf-2 agonist and inhibitor promoted or partly abolished the protective effects of icariin on mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the Nrf-2 signaling pathway could be inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT pathway. In vivo, icariin ameliorated IVDD in a rat model by promoting Nrf-2 activity, and preserving extracellular matrix in NP cells. These data suggest that icariin could ameliorate IVDD in rat models in vivo. In summary, the protective effects of icariin on human NP cells may suppress the pathogenesis of IVDD via the Nrf-2 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that the Nrf-2 signaling pathway is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IVDD.Copyright © 2019.

The HI injury causes mitochondrial damage leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phytoestrogens are non-steroidal plant substances structurally and functionally similar to estrogen. Coumestrol is a potent isoflavonoid with a protective effect against ischemic brain damage in adult rats. Our aim was to determine if coumestrol treatment following neonatal HI attenuates the long-term cognitive deficits induced by neonatal HI, as well as to investigate one possible mechanism underlying its potential effect.On the 7th postnatal day, male Wistar rats were submitted to the Levine-Rice HI model. Intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg of coumestrol, or vehicle, were administered immediately pre-hypoxia or 3 hours post-hypoxia. At 12 hours after HI the mitochondrial status and ROS levels were determined. At 60th postnatal day the cognitive deficits were revealed in the Morris water maze reference and working spatial memories. Following behavioral analysis, histological assessment was performed and reactive astrogliosis was measured by GFAP expression.Results demonstrate that both pre- and post-HI administration of coumestrol were able to counteract the long-term cognitive and morphological impairments caused by HI, as well as to block the late reactive astrogliosis. The pre-HI administration of coumestrol was able to prevent the early mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus of injured rat pups.Present data suggest that coumestrol exerts protection against experimental neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia through, at least in part, early modulation of mitochondrial function.Copyright © 2019.

Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel is a Ca permeable cation channel that can be activated by HO and plays an important role in cellular functions. It is also able to promote susceptibility to cell death. We studied expression and functionality of TRPM2 in KGN cells and examined GCT tissue microarrays (TMAs) to explore in vivo relevance. We employed live cell, calcium and mitochondrial imaging, viability assays, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We confirmed that KGN cells produce HO and found that they express functional TRPM2. HO increased intracellular Ca levels and N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA), a TRPM2 inhibitor, blocked this action.

Studies investigating doxorubicin-induced myotoxicity have reported disrupted mitochondrial function.  are responsible for regulating both cellular energy status and Ca2+ handling, both of which impact contractile function. Moreover, loss of mitochondrial integrity may initiate muscle atrophy. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysregulation may therefore contribute to an overall loss of skeletal muscle quality and performance that may be mitigated by appropriately targeted mitochondrial therapies. We therefore assessed the impact of doxorubicin on muscle performance and applied a multiplexed assay platform to diagnose alterations in mitochondrial respiratory control. Mice received a clinically relevant dose of doxorubicin delivered systemically and were euthanized 72 h later. We measured extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscle forces, fatigue, and contractile kinetics were measured in vitro, along with Ca2+ uptake in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Isolated skeletal muscle  were used for real-time respirometry or frozen for protein content and activity assays. Doxorubicin impaired muscle performance indicated by reduced force production, fatigue resistance, and SR-Ca2+ uptake, which were associated with a substrate-independent reduction in respiration and membrane potential, but no changes in the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ redox state. Protein content and dehydrogenase activity results corroborated these findings, indicating that doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial impairments are located upstream of ATP synthase within the electron transport system (ETS).  Collectively, doxorubicin-induced lesions likely span mitochondrial complexes I-IV, providing potential targets for alleviating doxorubicin myotoxicity.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682209>Integrating Autism Spectrum Disorder Pathophysiology: , Vitamin A, CD38, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Melatonergic Alterations in the Placenta and Gut.</a></h2><p>A diverse array of data has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), reflecting the complexity of its pathophysiology as well as its heterogeneity. Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in  functioning crucial in both.Factors acting to regulate  functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article.Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic acid metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal  functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in  functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal obesity and preeclampsia as well as more general prenatal stressors modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.Such an integrated model of the pathophysiology of ASD has important preventative and treatment implications.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687403>Curcumin Inhibits Proliferation of Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Human Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells by Inhibiting EBV Nuclear Antigen 1 Expression.</a></h2><p>This investigation aims to study the effect of curcumin on the proliferation, cycle arrest, and apoptosis of Epstein-Barr virus- (EBV-) positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. EBV NPC cells were subjected to curcumin treatment. The cell viability was evaluated with the CCK-8. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis.

Curcumin induced the cycle arrest of the HONE1 and HK1-EBV cells positive for EBV. Moreover, curcumin treatment promoted the NPC cell apoptosis, via the - and death receptor-mediated pathways. Furthermore, curcumin decreased the expression of EBNA1 in the HONE1 and HK1-EBV cells and inhibited the transcriptional level of EBNA1 in the HeLa cells. Curcumin induced EBNA1 degradation via the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway. In addition, curcumin inhibited the proliferation of HONE1 and HK1-EBV cells positive for EBV, probably by decreasing the expression level of EBNA1.

BCL-2-associated X apoptosis regulator (BAX) plays a pivotal role in the initiation of -mediated apoptosis as one of the factors causing mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Of current interest are endogenous BAX ligands that inhibit its MOMP activity. Mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) are a recently identified class of mitochondrial retrograde signaling molecules and are reported to be potent apoptosis inhibitors. Among them, humanin (HN), has been shown to suppress apoptosis by inhibiting BAX translocation to the mitochondrial outer membrane, but the molecular mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Here, using recombinant protein expression, along with light-scattering, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopy, we report that HN and BAX can form fibers together in vitro. Results from negative stain EM experiments suggest that BAX undergoes secondary and tertiary structural rearrangements and incorporates into the fibers, and that its membrane-associating C-terminal helix is important for the fibrillation process. Additionally, HN mutations known to alter its anti-apoptotic activity affect fiber morphology. Our findings reveal for the first time a potential mechanism by which BAX can be sequestered by fibril formation, which can prevent it from initiating MOMP and committing the cell to apoptosis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676404>Buddleja saligna Willd (Loganiaceae) inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in oxidative cardiopathy with concomitant modulation of nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymatic activities and dysregulated lipid metabolic pathways.</a></h2><p>Buddleja saligna Willd (Loganiaceae), mostly indigenous to South Africa is traditionally used in the treatment cardio-dysfunctional related ailments amongst other diseases.The cardio-protective effect of B. saligna was investigated in ferric-induced oxidative cardiopathy.Hearts harvested from healthy male SD rats were incubated with 0.1 mM FeSO to induce oxidative damage and co-incubated with B. saligna extract. Reaction mixtures without the extract served as negative control, while tissues without the extract or standard antioxidant (gallic acid) and pro-oxidant served as the normal control.

However, the antiviral functions of helicase SF1, which shares a conserved helicase core with SF2, are little understood. Here we demonstrate that zinc finger NFX1-type containing 1 (ZNFX1), a helicase SF1, is an interferon (IFN)-stimulated, mitochondrial-localised dsRNA sensor that specifically restricts the replication of RNA viruses. Upon virus infection, ZNFX1 immediately recognizes viral RNA through its Armadillo-type fold and P-loop domain and then interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein to initiate the type I IFN response without depending on retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs). In short, as is the case with interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) alone, ZNFX1 can induce IFN and ISG expression at an early stage of RNA virus infection to form a positively regulated loop of the well-known RLR signalling. This provides another layer of understanding of the complexity of antiviral immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680966>Methylprednisolone Decreases -Mediated Apoptosis and Autophagy Dysfunction in Hepatocytes of Experimental Autoimmune Hepatitis Model  the Akt/mTOR Signaling.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by massive immune cell-mediated hepatocyte destruction. Glucocorticoids, particularly methylprednisolone (MP), are the most effective treatment for AIH; however, the mechanism underlying the effects of glucocorticoid treatment has not been fully elucidated. The present study explored the effects of MP on damaged hepatocytes in mice with concanavalin A (ConA)-induced experimental autoimmune hepatitis (EAH). C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: a normal control group (injected with normal saline), a ConA (20 mg/kg) group, and a ConA + MP (3.12 mg/kg) group. The serum levels of liver enzymes, cytokines, activated T cells, and apoptosis- and autophagy-associated marker proteins were determined 12 h after ConA injection. Human hepatocyte cell line LO2 was used to verify the effects of ConA and MP . MP treatment significantly decreased inflammatory reactions in the serum and liver tissues and activated the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocytes . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed fewer autophagosomes in the MP-treated group than in the ConA-treated group. MP treatment obviously suppressed apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss in hepatocytes . Furthermore, ConA treatment increased the levels of LC3-II, p62/SQSTM1, and Beclin-1, while bafilomycin A1 did not augment the levels of LC3-II. MP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-II, p62/SQSTM1, and Beclin-1 and upregulated the levels of phosphorylated (p)-Akt and p-mTOR. In conclusion, MP ameliorated -mediated apoptosis and autophagy dysfunction in ConA-induced hepatocyte injury  and  the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Fan, Men, Wang, Shen, Wang, Ye, Luo and Yang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677478>Visualizing Dynamic Performance of Lipid Droplets in a Parkinson's Disease Model via a Smart Photostable Aggregation-Induced Emission Probe.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease affected by diverse factors, and lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly recognized as major players in PD because of their relevance to neuron activity.

We further found a close relationship between LDs and variation in mitochondrial activity. Strikingly, the progression of cell death was accelerated by lipase, whereas pre-stimulation of LDs by unsaturated fatty acid-oleic acid decreased the death process by inhibiting excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fatty acid production, thereby protecting .

Progression of peritoneal metastasis, as with other advanced malignancies, is associated with cancer cachexia anorexia syndrome (CAS), involving poor appetite (anorexia), involuntary weight loss, and chronic inflammation. Eventual causes of mortality include dysfunctional metabolism and energy store exhaustion. Etiology of CAS in PM patients is multifactorial including tumor growth, host response, cytokine release, systemic inflammation, proteolysis, lipolysis, malignant small bowel obstruction, ascites, and gastrointestinal side effects of drug therapy (chemotherapy, opioids). Metabolic changes of CAS in PM relate more to a systemic inflammatory response than an adaptation to starvation. Metabolic reprogramming is required for cancer cells shed into the peritoneal cavity to resist anoikis (i.e., programmed cell death). Profound changes in hexokinase metabolism are needed to compensate ineffective oxidative phosphorylation in . During the development of PM, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a key role in activating both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, increasing the uptake of glucose, lipid, and glutamine into cancer cells. HIF-1α upregulates hexokinase II, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), pyruvate kinase muscle isoenzyme 2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose transporters (GLUT) and promotes cytoplasmic glycolysis. HIF-1α also stimulates the utilization of glutamine and fatty acids as alternative energy substrates. Cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity interact with cancer-associated fibroblasts and adipocytes to meet metabolic demands and incorporate autophagy products for growth. Therapy of CAS in PM is challenging. Optimal nutritional intake alone including total parenteral nutrition is unable to reverse CAS. Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) stabilized nutritional status in a significant proportion of PM patients.

In this study, the structure and composition of APS was determined, following the evaluation of in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of APS targeted macrophages and host immune system based on immunoregulated strategy. The results indicated that APS had no direct cytotoxicity against 4T1 cells, but APS mediated macrophages could significantly inhibit the growth of 4T1 cells by the induction of cell cycle arrest (G2 phase) and cell apoptosis. APS mediated macrophages promoted the apoptosis of 4T1 cells mainly through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

APS could significantly enhance the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes and increase phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages in mice. Furthermore, APS was capable of up-regulating the expression of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ in peripheral blood.

It is widely accepted that autophagic dysfunction is involved in pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders; however, the role of heavy metals in regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy is unclear.

We hypothesize that cardiac overexpression of the S100A1 gene mediated by a double-stranded adeno-associated virus (scAAV) results in better functional and molecular improvements compared with the single-stranded virus (ssAAV).Heart failure was induced by coronary artery ligation. Then, intramyocardial injections of saline, AAV9 empty capsid, scAAV9.S100A1, and ssAAV9.S100A1 were performed. Ten weeks postinfarction, all rats received cardiac evaluation; serum and tissue were collected for genetic analysis, cytokine profiling, and assessments of mitochondrial function and structure.Overexpression of AAV9.S100A1 improved systolic and diastolic function. Compared with control, ejection fraction was greater in treated groups (54.8% vs 32.3%, P < .05). Similarly, end-diastolic volume index was significantly less in the treated group than in control (1.14 vs 1.59 mL/cm), whereas fractional shortening was greater in treated groups than control (26% vs 38%, P < .05). Interestingly, cardiac mechanics were significantly better when treated with double-stranded virus compared with single-stranded. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated robust transfection of myocardium with the S100A1 gene, with more infection in the self-complimentary group compared with the single-stranded group (5.68 ± 0.44 vs 4.09 ± 0.25 log genome copies per 100 ng of DNA; P < .0001).

Isoprenoids are synthesized from the precursor's isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphosphate (DMAPP), which are interconverted by the enzyme isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPPI). Many plants express multiple isoforms of IPPI, the only enzyme shared by the mevalonate (MVA) and non-mevalonate (MEP) pathways, but little is known about their specific roles. Rice (Oryza sativa) has two IPPI isoforms (OsIPPI1 and OsIPPI2). We, therefore, carried out a comprehensive comparison of IPPI gene expression, protein localization, and isoprenoid biosynthesis in this species. We found that OsIPPI1 mRNA was more abundant than OsIPPI2 mRNA in all tissues, and its expression in de-etiolated leaves mirrored the accumulation of phytosterols, suggesting a key role in the synthesis of MVA pathway isoprenoids. We investigated the subcellular localization of both isoforms by constitutively expressing them as fusions with synthetic green fluorescent protein. Both proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as peroxisomes and , whereas only OsIPPI2 was detected in plastids, due to an N-terminal transit peptide which is not present in OsIPPI1. Despite the plastidial location of OsIPPI2, the expression of OsIPPI2 mRNA did not mirror the accumulation of chlorophylls or carotenoids, indicating that OsIPPI2 may be a redundant component of the MEP pathway. The detection of both OsIPPI isoforms in the ER indicates that DMAPP can be synthesized de novo in this compartment.

In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation in the . Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain.

Under unfavorable pro-oxidative conditions, proteins can form aggregates which may exceed the overall proteolytic capacity of the proteasome. After stress termination LDs can adjust and support the removal of these aggregates. Additionally, LDs interact with , specifically take over certain proteins and thus prevent apoptosis. LDs, which are loaded with these harmful proteins, are subsequently eliminated via lipophagy. Recently it was demonstrated that this autophagic process is a modulator of longevity. LDs do not only eliminate potentially dangerous proteins, but they are also able to prevent lipotoxicity by storing specific lipids. In the present study we used the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to compare the proteome as well as lipidome of  and LDs under different conditions: replicative aging, stress and apoptosis. In this context we found an accumulation of proteins at LDs, supporting the role of LDs in proteostasis. Additionally, the composition of main lipid classes such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycerols, triacylglycerols, ceramides, phosphatidic acids and ergosterol of LDs and  changed during stress conditions and aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683244>Alcohol impairs hippocampal function: From NMDA receptor synaptic transmission to mitochondrial function.</a></h2><p>Many studies have reported that alcohol produces harmful effects on several brain structures, including the hippocampus, in both rodents and humans. The hippocampus is one of the most studied areas of the brain due to its function in learning and memory, and a lot of evidence suggests that hippocampal failure is responsible for the cognitive loss present in individuals with recurrent alcohol consumption.  are organelles that generate the energy needed for the brain to maintain neuronal communication, and their functional failure is considered a mediator of the synaptic dysfunction induced by alcohol. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of how alcohol exposure affects neuronal communication through the impairment of glutamate receptor (NMDAR) activity, neuroinflammatory events and oxidative damage observed after alcohol exposure, all processes under the umbrella of mitochondrial function. Finally, we discuss the direct role of mitochondrial dysfunction mediating cognitive and memory decline produced by alcohol exposure and their consequences associated with neurodegeneration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The highly metabolically active cells of the renal tubule also pair their energetic needs to the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including energy generation, antioxidant responses, autophagy and mitochondrial quality control. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential not only for the harvesting of energy from substrates but also for an array of regulatory reactions that determine cellular health. In acute kidney injury (AKI), substantial decreases in the levels of NAD impair energy generation and, ultimately, the core kidney function of selective solute transport. Conversely, augmentation of NAD may protect the kidney tubule against diverse acute stressors. For example, NAD augmentation can ameliorate experimental AKI triggered by ischaemia-reperfusion, toxic injury and systemic inflammation. NAD-dependent maintenance of renal tubular metabolic health may also attenuate long-term profibrotic responses that could lead to chronic kidney disease. Further understanding of the genetic, environmental and nutritional factors that influence NAD biosynthesis and renal resilience may lead to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686894>Use Of Quantitative Modelling To Elucidate The Roles Of The Liver, Gut, Kidney, And Muscle In Ammonia Homeostasis And How Lactulose And Rifaximin Alter This Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Humans must eliminate approximately 1M of ammonia per day while maintaining the blood concentration of this potent neurotoxin at a concentration of only about 30 µM. The mechanisms producing such effective ammonia homeostasis are poorly understood by clinicians due to the multiple organs (liver, gut, kidney and muscle) involved in ammonia homeostasis. Based on literature values we present a novel, simplified description of normal and disordered ammonia and the potential mechanisms whereby the drugs used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, lactulose and rifaximin, lower the blood ammonia concentration. Concepts discussed include the following: 1) only about 44 mmol of ammonia/day (4.4% of total production) reaches the peripheral circulation due to the efficient linkage of amino deamination and the urea cycle in hepatic ; 2) the gut and kidney contribute roughly equally to delivery of this 44 mmol/day to systemic blood; 3) the bulk of gut ammonia production seemingly originates in the small bowel from bacterial deamination of urea by bacteria and mucosal deamination of circulating and ingested glutamine; 4) the apparent production of ammonia in the small bowel markedly exceeds that quantity that enters the portal blood, indicating that ammonia disposal mechanisms in the small bowel play a major role in ammonia homeostasis. With regard to the hyperammonemia of chronic liver disease: 1) shunting of portal blood around the liver, by itself, can account for commonly observed ammonia elevations; 2) severe portal hypertension causes an increased release of ammonia by the kidney; 3) high blood ammonia is associated with an unexplained massive increase in the muscle uptake of ammonia that could play an important role in limiting hyperammonemia; and 4) a major action of lactulose administration may be the enhancement of ammonia uptake by small bowel bacteria, while the mechanism of action of rifaximin is unclear.© 2019 Levitt and Levitt.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695197>Lipid signalling drives proteolytic rewiring of  by YME1L.</a></h2><p>Reprogramming of  provides cells with the metabolic flexibility required to adapt to various developmental transitions such as stem cell activation or immune cell reprogramming, and to respond to environmental challenges such as those encountered under hypoxic conditions or during tumorigenesis. Here we show that the i-AAA protease YME1L rewires the proteome of pre-existing  in response to hypoxia or nutrient starvation. Inhibition of mTORC1 induces a lipid signalling cascade via the phosphatidic acid phosphatase LIPIN1, which decreases phosphatidylethanolamine levels in mitochondrial membranes and promotes proteolysis. YME1L degrades mitochondrial protein translocases, lipid transfer proteins and metabolic enzymes to acutely limit mitochondrial biogenesis and support cell growth. YME1L-mediated mitochondrial reshaping supports the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as spheroids or xenografts. Similar changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur in the tumour tissues of patients with PDAC, suggesting that YME1L is relevant to the pathophysiology of these tumours.

They are characterized by the self-renewal capacity, multi-lineage differentiation abilities and immunomodulation properties which render them perfectly ideal cell type for treating a wide range of chronic diseases. Despite these enchanted features, there are many hurdles that need to be circumvented to ensure their long-term survival and viability after transplantation. Recently, hypoxia has been indicated as one of the most baffling stress conditions that can affect the survival rate of MSCs either positively or negatively depending on the level of hypoxia. MSCs can survive well under moderate hypoxia, but die shortly if they were exposed to severe hypoxia without clearly convincing explanation for this enigma. The current study reveals a novel mechanism of 26S proteasome in controlling the ability of BM-MSCs to withstand hypoxic stress by maintaining proper mitochondrial function. The results indicated that 26S proteasome remains functioning once BM- MSCs are exposed to moderate hypoxia (2.5%O) and preserves their survival and proliferation mediated by intact mitochondrial performance, whereas 26S proteasome becomes inactive when BM-MSCs faces severe hypoxia that lead to poor mitochondrial function and less chance to survive longer. The outcomes of this study demonstrated the importance of 26S proteasome machinery in enhancing the resistance of BM-MSCs to hypoxic stress condition which may help in better planning future studies that target this system. Schematic representation summarizing the findings of the current study. 26S proteasome function preservation in normoxia and moderate hypoxia leads to maintain appropriate proliferation and mitochondrial activity in human BM-MSCs and promote their survival. On the opposite side, severe hypoxia disrupts the 26S proteasome function leading to significant reduction in the proliferation, survival and mitochondrial dynamics in human BM-MSCs causing their death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669489>The spatio-temporal organization of mitochondrial FF ATP synthase in cristae depends on its activity mode.</a></h2><p>FF ATP synthase is a key enzyme of mitochondrial energy metabolism which works in two directions. It is not known whether ATP synthase and ATPase function are correlated with different spatio-temporal organization of the enzyme. To analyze this, we have tracked and localized individual ATP synthase/ATPase molecules in situ by live cell microscopy. Under normal conditions, ATP synthase is restricted mainly to cristae. A mobile fraction exist that displays orthogonal trajectories following the cristae membranes but also move in the IBM. By inhibiting glycolysis, we induced ATP hydrolysis in addition to ATP synthesis. The coexistence of two subpopulations was supported by data from single molecule localization and tracking analysis. We found that the spatial-temporal organization of ATP synthase was flexible and mirrored the physiological data. The clear cristae-related structuring of the ATP synthase/ATPase was obliterated when glycolysis was inhibited. At the same time, ATP synthase dimers decreased. The ratiometric change in dimeric/monomeric, respectively more mobile/less mobile ATP synthase was reversible. In IF1-KO cells, ATP synthase was more mobile, while inhibition of ATPase activity decreased the mobility. Together this data strongly supports the model of distinct subpopulations of ATP synthase and ATP hydrolase, the latter with higher mobility and likely present in the IBM compartment. Obviously, ATP synthase reacts quickly and reversibly to metabolic conditions, not only through functional but also through spatial and structural re-organization.Copyright © 2019.

About half of DLBCL patients are either refractory to, or will relapse, after the treatment. Therefore, identifying novel drug targets and effective therapeutic agents is urgently needed for improving DLBCL patient survival. b-AP15, a selective small molecule inhibitor of proteasomal USP14 and UCHL5 deubiquitinases (DUBs), has shown selectivity and efficacy in several other types of cancer cells. This is the first study to report the effect of b-AP15 in DLBCL.Cell lines of two DLBCL subtypes, Germinal Center B Cell/ GCB (SU-DHL-4, OCI-LY-1, OCI-LY-19) and Activated B Cell/ABC (SU-DHL-2), were used in the current study. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay, proliferation by trypan blue exclusion staining assay, cellular apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and mitochondrial outer membrane permeability assays, the activities of 20S proteasome peptidases by cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates, and cell migration was detected by transwell assay in these GCB- and ABC-DLBCL cell lines. Mouse xenograft models of SU-DHL-4 and SU-DHL-2 cells were used to determine in vivo effects of b-AP15 in DLBCL tumors.b-AP15 inhibited proteasome DUB activities and activated cell death pathway, as evident by caspase activation and  apoptosis in GCB- and ABC- DLBCL cell lines. b-AP15 treatment suppressed migration of GCB- and ABC-DLBCL cells via inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ/Smad pathways.

In this study, we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor-like 9 (EGFL9) is significantly upregulated in basal-like breast cancer cells and associated with metastatic progression in breast tumor samples. Functionally, EGFL9 is both necessary and sufficient to enhance cancer cell migration and invasion, as well as distant metastasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that EGFL9 binds cMET, activating cMET-mediated downstream signaling. EGFL9 and cMET co-localize at both the cell membrane and within the . We further identify an interaction between EGFL9 and the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly factor COA3. Consequently, EGFL9 regulates COX activity and modulates cell metabolism, promoting a Warburg-like metabolic phenotype. Finally, we show that combined pharmacological inhibition of cMET and glycolysis reverses EGFL9-driven stemness.

While current drugs for AD are always employed as symptomatic therapies with variable benefits, there is no treatment to delay its progression or halt neurodegeneration. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy has increasingly been implicated as a prominent histopathological feature of AD and related dementias. Our recent studies have implicated  as critical targets of TDP-43 neurotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate that the suppression of mitochondrial-associated TDP-43 protects against neuronal loss and behavioral deficits in 5XFAD transgenic mice recapitulating AD-related phenotypes. In AD patients and 5XFAD mice, the level of TDP-43 is increased in , and TDP-43 highly co-localizes with  in brain neurons exhibiting TDP-43 proteinopathy. Chronic administration of a TDP-43 mitochondrial localization inhibitory peptide, PM1, significantly alleviates TDP-43 proteinopathy, mitochondrial abnormalities, microgliosis and even neuronal loss without effect on amyloid plaque load in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice well after the onset of symptoms. Additionally, PM1 also improves the cognitive and motor function in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice and completely prevents the onset of mild cognitive impairment in 6-month-old 5XFAD mice.

Here, we report the effect of mitofluorescein (mitoFluo), a new protonophoric uncoupler representing a conjugate of fluorescein with decyl(triphenyl)phosphonium, on the electrical activity of neurons from Lymnaea stagnalis. Incubation with mitoFluo in the dark led to a decrease in the absolute value of the resting membrane potential of the neurons and alterations in their spike activity, such as spike broadening, spike amplitude reduction, and increase in the spike frequency. Prolonged incubation at high (tens micromoles) mitoFluo concentrations resulted in complete suppression of neuronal electrical activity. The effect of mitoFluo on the neurons was qualitatively similar to that of the classical mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) but manifested itself after much longer incubation and at higher concentrations. The distinctive feature of mitoFluo is its light-induced effect on the electrical activity of neurons. Changes in the parameters of the neuronal activity upon illumination in the presence of mitoFluo were similar to the light-induced effects of the well-known photosensitizer Rose Bengal, although less pronounced. It was suggested that the effects of mitoFluo on the electrical activity of neurons, both as a mitochondrial uncoupler and a photosensitizer, are mediated by the changes in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678591>Molecular insights on cytochrome c and nucleotide regulation of apoptosome function and its implication in cancer.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome c (Cyt c) released from  interacts with Apaf-1 to form the heptameric apoptosome, which initiates the caspase cascade to execute apoptosis. Although lysine residue at 72 (K72) of Cyt c plays an important role in the Cyt c-Apaf-1 interaction, the underlying mechanism of interaction between Cyt c and Apaf-1 is still not clearly defined. Here we identified multiple lysine residues including K72, which are also known to interact with ATP, to play a key role in Cyt c-Apaf-1 interaction. Mutation of these lysine residues abrogates the apoptosome formation causing inhibition of caspase activation. Using in-silico molecular docking, we have identified Cyt c-binding interface on Apaf-1. Although mutant Cyt c shows higher affinity for Apaf-1, the presence of Cyt c-WT restores the apoptosome activity. ATP addition modulates only mutant Cyt c binding to Apaf-1 but not WT Cyt c binding to Apaf-1. Using TCGA and cBioPortal, we identified multiple mutations in both Apaf-1 and Cyt c that are predicted to interfere with apoptosome assembly. We also demonstrate that transcript levels of various enzymes involved with dATP or ATP synthesis are increased in various cancers. Silencing of nucleotide metabolizing enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) and ATP-producing glycolytic enzymes PKM2 attenuated ATP production and enhanced caspase activation. These findings suggest important role for lysine residues of Cyt c and nucleotides in the regulation of apoptosome-dependent apoptotic cell death as well as demonstrate how these mutations and nucleotides may have a pivotal role in human diseases such as cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, pro- versus anti-tumor signaling is also affected by tumor cell-macrophage interactions. While these cell-cell interactions are partly regulated by NO, the functional effects of NO flux on proinflammatory (M1) macrophages are unknown. Using a triple negative murine breast cancer model, we explored the potential role of macrophage Nos2 on 4T1 tumor progression. The effects of NO on macrophage phenotype were examined in bone marrow derived macrophages from wild type and Nos2 mice following in vitro stimulation with cytokine/LPS combinations to produce low, medium, and high NO flux. Remarkably, Nos2 induction was spatially distinct, where Nos2 cells expressed low cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) and vice versa. Importantly, in vitro M1 polarization with IFNγ+LPS induced high NO flux that was restricted to cells harboring depolarized . This flux altered the magnitude and spatial extent of hypoxic gradients. Metabolic and single cell analyses demonstrated that single cell Nos2 induction limited the generation of hypoxic gradients in vitro, and Nos2-dependent and independent features may collaborate to regulate M1 functionality. It was found that Cox2 expression was important for Nos2 cells to maintain NO tolerance. Furthermore, Nos2 and Cox2 expression in 4T1 mouse tumors was spatially orthogonal forming distinct cellular neighborhoods. In summary, the location and type of Nos2 cells, NO flux, and the inflammatory status of other cells, such as Cox2 cells in the tumor niche contribute to Nos2 inflammatory mechanisms that promote disease progression of 4T1 tumors.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698065>Preclinical and clinical results regarding the effects of a plant-based antidiabetic formulation versus well established antidiabetic molecules.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex syndrome with debilitating long-term complications, comprising alterations of carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolisms, along increased oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation.

We devised a preclinical study protocol to examine the impact of the PBAF, along metformin and gliclazide, on tissue histology as well as on the redox status of tissue, , serum and serum lipoproteins of alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Subsequently, we assessed their long-term impact on the redox status of serum and isolated serum lipoproteins of type 2 DM (T2DM) patients, taking into consideration their cardiometabolic profile. In the preclinical stage, we found that PBAF was able to enhance total serum antioxidant defense, while metformin yielded the best results regarding the advanced glycation and protein/lipid oxidation of serum and of serum lipoproteins. The latter also improved overall serum redox status and HDL redox function. Also, antidiabetic treatment seemed to increase mitochondrial redox activity, without overturning overall tissue redox balance. Histologically, liver and brain tissues of treated diabetic rats were fairly similar to those of non-diabetic rats. In T2DM patients, the most striking results involved the effects on serum lipoproteins. The tested PBAF exerted protective antioxidant effects on low-density and, especially, on high density lipoproteins. We conclude that this formulation might constitute a good addition to the well-established pharmacological approach of DM, contributing to the reduction of overall oxidative burden.Copyright © 2019.

These are still the major challenges in this field. Regarding the identification of the most appropriate cell source, aging as a factor that affects both somatic and stem cells and limits their function and applications is a preventable and, at least to some extents, a reversible phenomenon. Here, we reviewed different stem cell types, namely embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and genetically modified stem cells, as well as their sources, . autologous, allogeneic, and xenogeneic sources. Afterward, we approached aging by discussing the functional decline of aged stem cells and different intrinsic and extrinsic factors that are involved in stem cell aging including replicative senescence and Hayflick limit, autophagy, epigenetic changes, miRNAs, mTOR and AMPK pathways, and the role of  in stem cell senescence. Finally, various interventions for rejuvenation and geroprotection of stem cells are discussed. These interventions can be applied in cell therapy and tissue engineering methods to conquer aging as a limiting factor, both in original cell source and in the  proliferated cells.©The Author(s) 2019.

Endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial metabolism. Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, α-synuclein (α-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (HS), which also acts through the potassium (K/K) ion channel and calcium (Ca) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of HS is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize HO-induced oxidative damage in . The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of HS to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668383>Metformin prevents the pathological browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Browning, the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to a beige phenotype, has gained interest as a strategy to induce weight loss and improve insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Resveratrol triggers signaling dependent on the protein kinase activated by adenosine monophosphate (AMPK), the sensor of cellular energy metabolism that regulates autophagy, eliminates damaged , and increases energy sources. In the present study, we investigated the participation of AMPK activation in the protective effect of resveratrol on cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity. We found that resveratrol increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in primary cultured neurons exposed to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Resveratrol (1.8 mg/Kg; i. v.; administered at the beginning of reperfusion) decreased the infarct area and increased survival of rats subjected to MCAO. In neuronal cultures, resveratrol treatment (40 μM, after excitotoxicity) reduced the production of superoxide anion, prevented the overload of intracellular Ca associated to mitochondrial failure, reduced the release of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, and reduced death. It also promoted mitophagy (increased Beclin 1 level, favored the recruitment of LC3-II, reduced LAMP1, and reduced mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60 levels). In both models, inhibition of AMPK activation with Compound C obstructed the effect of resveratrol, showing that its protective effect depends, partially, on the activation of the AMPK/autophagy pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677499>Protective effects of a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist on airway epithelial  dysfunction in asthmatic mice via Nrf2/HO-1 activation.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669102>Aglaia odorata Lour. extract inhibit ischemic neuronal injury potentially via suppressing p53/Puma-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.</a></h2><p>Aglaia odorata Lour. is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant possessing properties of improving blood circulation, and it is widely used in the treatment of dizziness, traumatic injuries and bruises.In this study, we are aimed to investigate the cerebral protection effect of the extracts from leaves of Aglaia odorata Lour.

In vivo experiments, ELA exerted significant protective effect on MCAO model. TTC staining showed that ELA could reduce cerebral infarction area against MCAO insult. HE and Nissl's staining indicated that ELA could reverse the damage of cortex and hippocampus caused by MCAO. In vitro experiments, ELA showed significant protective effect on OGD/R-induced PC12 cells by reducing the number of apoptotic cells, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and reducing superoxide aggregation, further suppressing mitochondrial caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway. Moreover, protective effect of ELA on mitochondrial function may be exerted by inhibiting p53/Puma signal pathway.Our results suggest that ELA exerts a marked neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia potentially via suppressing p53/Puma-mediated mitochondrial caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway.Copyright © 2019.

This continual and highly coordinated trafficking process, which takes place via the axon, has fascinated researchers since the early twentieth century. Ramon y Cajal first proposed the existence of axonal trafficking of biological material after observing that dissociation of the axon from the cell body led to neuronal degeneration. Since these first indirect observations, the field has come a long way in its understanding of this fundamental process. However, these advances in our knowledge have been aided by breakthroughs in other scientific disciplines, as well as the parallel development of novel tools, techniques and model systems. In this review, we summarise the evolution of tools used to study axonal transport and discuss how their deployment has refined our understanding of this process. We also highlight innovative tools currently being developed and how their addition to the available axonal transport toolkit might help to address key outstanding questions.

Lately, the development of chemiluminescence-based reactive oxygen species monitoring has gained increased attention due to the advantages posed by chemiluminescence, including its rapid measurement and high sensitivity. In this respect, specific organelle-targeting trackers with strong chemiluminescence performance are of high importance. We herein report the synthesis and chemiluminescence properties of eight novel phosphonium-functionalized amino-acylated luminol and isoluminol derivatives, designed as mitochondriotropic chemiluminescence reactive oxygen species trackers. Three different phosphonium cationic moieties were employed (phenyl, -tolyl, and cyclohexyl), as well as two alkanoyl chains (hexanoyl and undecanoyl) as bridges/linkers. Synthesis is accomplished via the acylation of the corresponding phthalimides, as phthalhydrazide precursors, followed by hydrazinolysis. This method was chosen because the direct acylation of (iso)luminol was discouraging. The new derivatives' chemiluminescence was evaluated and compared with that of the parent molecules. A relatively poor chemiluminescence performance was observed for all derivatives, with the isoluminol-based ones being the poorest. This result is mainly attributed to the low yield of the fluorescence species formation during the chemiluminescence oxidation reaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679688>Autophagic flux defect in diabetic kidney disease results in megamitochondria formation in podocytes.</a></h2><p>Podocyte injury is an important factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Podocytes are characterized by large numbers of . However, mitochondrial dysfunction as it relates to kidney pathology remains poorly understood. The present study found that podocyte  in different animal models of diabetes mellitus became elongated with the development of albuminuria, suggesting a change in mitochondrial dynamics. We then treated cells with a combination of glucose, fatty acids, and angiotensin II (GFA) to mimic the diabetic milieu. Cultured podocytes exposed to GFA showed megamitochondria formation and decreased autophagosome degradation. We also found that GFA treatment decreased the binding of the autophagosome to the lysosome. Our results suggest that megamitochondria are common in podocytes during diabetic nephropathy and that insufficient autophagy flux may underlie this effect. These findings have expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and identified a potential pharmacological target for treatment.Copyright © 2019.

This local thermogenesis and the resulting temperature gradient could facilitate the development of persistent, self-organizing convection currents in the cytoplasm of large eukaryotes. Using 3-dimensional computational simulations of intracellular fluid motion, we quantify the convective velocities that could result from the temperature differences observed experimentally. Based on these velocities, we identify the conditions necessary for this temperature-driven bulk flow to dominate over random thermal diffusive motion at the scale of a single eukaryotic cell. With temperature gradients of the order 1°C and diffusion coefficients comparable to those described in the literature, Péclet numbers ≥ 1 are feasible and permit comparable or greater effects of convection than diffusion in determining intracellular mass flux. In addition to the temperature gradient, the resulting flow patterns would also depend on the spatial localization of the heat source, the shape of the cell membrane, and the complex intracellular structure including the cytoskeleton. While this intracellular convection would be highly context-dependent, in certain settings, convective motion could provide a previously unrecognized mechanism for directed, bulk transport within eukaryotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671612>Successful Targeting of the Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer by Glucose-Conjugated 1,4-Naphthoquinones.</a></h2><p>Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains challenging due to the development of drug resistance. The Warburg effect describes the ability of cancer cells to consume larger amounts of glucose compared to normal tissues. We identified derivatives of natural 1,4-naphthoquinones to be active in CRPC and further synthetically modified them via glucose conjugation to increase selectivity by Warburg effect targeting. Mechanisms of action were examined by quantitative proteomics followed by bioinformatical analysis and target validation. Four synthesized molecules revealed the highest selectivity towards human CRPC cells, which correlated with higher GLUT-1 activity and expression. The compounds were able to induce pro-apoptotic signs and to inhibit the pro-survival processes and mechanisms of drug resistance (i.e., AR-signaling and autophagy). Proteome analysis suggested a disruption of the /oxidative phosphorylation, which was validated by further functional analysis: thus,  depolarization, elevated levels of cytotoxic ROS, an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as release of mitochondrial AIF and cytochrome C to cytoplasm were observed. In conclusion, glucose-conjugated 1,4-naphthoquinones show potent activity and selectivity in human CRPC exerted via mitochondrial targeting. The compounds can overcome drug resistance against current standard therapies and suppress pro-survival mechanisms. This unique combination of properties makes them new promising candidates for the treatment of CRPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667702>Seawater Immersion Aggravates Early Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Increases Neuronal Apoptosis After Traumatic Brain Injury.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability in naval warfare. Due to the unique physiochemical properties of seawater, immersion in it exacerbates TBI and induces severe neural damage and complications. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of seawater-immersed TBI remain unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major cause of TBI-associated brain damage because it leads to oxidative stress, decrease in energy production, and apoptosis. Thus, the present study aimed to further elucidate the current understanding of the pathology of seawater-immersed TBI, particularly the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, using a well-defined rat model of fluid percussion injury and a stretch injury model comprising cultured neurons. The biochemical and pathological markers of brain-related and neuronal injuries were evaluated. Histological analysis suggested that seawater immersion enhanced brain tissue injury and induced a significant increase in apoptosis in rats with TBI. Additionally, lactate dehydrogenase release occurred earlier and at higher levels in stretched neurons at 24 h after seawater immersion, which was consistent with more severe morphological changes and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, seawater immersion induced more rapid decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and H-ATPase activity in the cortices of TBI rats. In addition, the immunochemical results revealed that seawater immersion further attenuated mitochondrial function in neurons exposed to stretch injury. The increases in neuronal damage and apoptosis triggered by seawater immersion were positively correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction in both in vivo and in vitro models. Thus, the present findings strengthen the current understanding of seawater-immersed TBI. Moreover, because seawater immersion aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction and contributes to post-traumatic neuronal cell death, it is important to consider  as a therapeutic target for seawater-immersed TBI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669061>The impact of nandrolone decanoate abuse on experimental animal model: Hormonal and biochemical assessment.</a></h2><p>Nandrolone decanoate (ND) is one of the most commonly abused anabolic androgenic steroids compounds in the world owing to its ability to improve physical performance but its abuse is associated with several adverse effects. The current study was performed to evaluate the effect of recommended and overdose of nandrolone decanoate (ND) for short and long term on the alterations of biochemical markers related to kidney, liver, adrenal, thyroid gland functions and oxidant and antioxidant activities. Sixty male rats were randomly assigned into two major groups. The first was treated with ND for 6 weeks and the second was treated with same drug for 12 weeks. Each of these groups was further subdivided into three sub groups: 1-Control (untreated rats), 2- Rats intraperitoneally injected with ND 3 mg/kg weekly, 3- Rats intraperitoneally injected with ND 15 mg/kg weekly. Administration of high ND dose for either short or long term significantly elevated kidney function biomarkers , liver enzymes both in serum ,cytosol and  , insignificantly increased thyroid function ,significantly increased adrenal function while, decreased ACTH. Moreover, oxidative stress biomarkers were significantly upregulated associated with depression in antioxidants activities.

However, recent evidence suggests that PKA signaling can be initiated by cAMP-independent events, especially within the context of cellular oxidative stress such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We determined whether RIα is actively involved in the regulation of PKA activity via Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) dependent mechanisms during I/R stress in the heart. Induction of  global I/R injury in mouse hearts selectively down-regulated RIα protein expression, whereas RII subunit expression appears to remain unaltered. Cardiac myocyte cell culture models were used to determine that oxidant stimulus (i.e. HO) alone is sufficient to induce RIα protein down-regulation. Transient increase of RIα expression (via adenoviral overexpression) negatively affects cell survival and function upon oxidative stress as measured by increased induction of apoptosis and decreased mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, analysis of mitochondrial subcellular fractions in heart tissue showed that PKA associated proteins are enriched in subsarcolemmal  (SSM) fractions, and that loss of RIα is most pronounced at SSM upon I/R injury. These data were supported via electron microscopy in AKAP1-KO mice, where loss of AKAP1 expression leads to aberrant mitochondrial morphology manifested in SSM but not interfibrillar  (IFM). Thus, we conclude that modification of RIα via ROS-dependent mechanisms induced by I/R injury has the potential to sensitize PKA signaling in the cell without the direct use of the canonical cAMP-dependent activation pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687966>[DYNAMICS OF CHANGES IN THE MACROSTRUCTURE OF MACROPHAGE CELLS OF THE WOUND CHANNEL AFTER A GUNSHOT WOUND].</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to identify the features of skeletal muscle macrophagocytic submicroscopic architectonics, the dynamics of transformations of organelles and intracellular membranes at different time after the simulated gunshot wound.

The course of catabolic processes caused by the presence in the wound channel of toxic components, destroyed myosymplasts and heavy metal ions of the damaging element.

Further mechanism research display that Ir1 and Ir2 can suppress the proliferation of GSCs, penetrate into GSCs efficiently, localize to , and induce -mediated apoptosis, including the loss of mitochondrial membrane (MMP), elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspases activation. Moreover, Ir1 and Ir2 can destroy the GSCs self-renewal and unlimited proliferation capacity by affecting the GSCs colony formation.

When leak respiration rates were standardized to the same membrane potential, NMR  had lower complex II-stimulated state 2 respiration rates than mice. Both mice and NMRs responded similarly to an in vitro anoxia-recovery challenge and decreased state 3 respiration rate post-anoxia. Finally, NMRs had overall lower maximal complex enzyme activities compared with mice, but the magnitude of the difference did not correspond with observed differences in respiratory fluxes.

Therefore to investigate, we treated Raw264.7 cells with IL-6 (1hr prior to irradiation) and examined the glycolytic flux. Increased expression of mRNA and protein levels of key glycolytic enzymes was observed after IL-6 treatment, which conferred glycolysis dependent resistance from radiation induced cell death. We further established that IL-6 induced glycolysis is activated by Akt signaling and knocking down Akt or inhibition of pan Akt phosphorylation significantly abrogated the IL-6 induced radio-resistance. Moreover, reduction of IL-6 induced pAkt level suppressed the expression of Hexokinase-2 and its translocation to the , thereby inhibiting the glycolysis induced resistance to radiation. IL-6 induced glycolysis also minimized the radiation induced mitochondrial damage. These results suggest that IL-6 induced glycolysis observed in cells may be responsible for IL-6 mediated therapeutic radio-resistance in cancer cells, partly by activation of Akt signaling.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the therapeutic effect of ADSCs from patients with diabetes is impaired due to oxidative stress. Given that diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders and  are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it is possible that mitochondrial ROS plays an important role in the induction of diabetic ADSC (dADSC) dysfunction. ADSCs isolated from diabetic mice were treated with mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS scavenger, or TEMPO, a universal ROS scavenger, for three passages. The results showed that pretreatment with mitoTEMPO increased the proliferation, multidifferentiation potential, and the migration and proangiogenic capacities of dADSCs to levels similar to those of ADSCs from control mice, whereas pretreatment with TEMPO showed only minor effects. Mechanistically, mitoTEMPO pretreatment enhanced the mitochondrial antioxidant capacity of dADSCs, and knockdown of superoxide dismutase reduced the restored mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and attenuated the proangiogenic effects induced by mitoTEMPO pretreatment. In addition, mitoTEMPO pretreatment improved the survival of dADSCs in diabetic mice with critical limb ischemia, showing protective effects similar to those of control ADSCs. Pretreatment of dADSCs with mitoTEMPO decreased limb injury and improved angiogenesis in diabetic mice with critical limb ischemia. These findings suggested that short-term pretreatment of dADSCs with a mitochondrial ROS scavenger restored their normal functions, which may be an effective strategy for improving the therapeutic effects of ADSC-based therapies in patients with diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676734>Metabolic dependencies and vulnerabilities in leukemia.</a></h2><p>Leukemia cell proliferation requires up-regulation and rewiring of metabolic pathways to feed anabolic cell growth.

Graft function, injury, perfusion kinetics, oxidative stress, and cytoskeletal integrity were assessed.In the UW group, severe ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) was shown by histopathology, higher liver enzymes leakage, portal resistance, and apoptotic index, oxygen consumption, less bile production, energy charge, and reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio (versus control).

In conclusion, we report substantial differences between the secretomes of brown and white human adipocytes and identify novel candidate batokines that can be important regulators of human metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating apoptosis during mycobacterial infection are not well known. Recent reports suggest that bacterial infection regulates mitochondrial fusion and fission in various ways. Here, we investigated the role of  in  (Mtb)-infected macrophages. Mtb H37Rv (Rv) infection induced mitofusin 2 (MFN2) degradation, leading to mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, Mtb H37Ra (Ra) infection induced significantly greater mitochondrial fragmentation than Rv infection. Mtb-mediated Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributed to the degradation of MFN2. To evaluate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the production of Parkin during Mtb infection, we analyzed Parkin production in 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)-pretreated macrophages. Pretreatment with 4-PBA reduced Parkin production in Mtb-infected macrophages. In contrast, the level of MFN2 production recovered to a level similar to that of the unstimulated control. In addition, Ra-infected macrophages had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) compared to those infected with Rv. Interestingly, intracellular survival of mycobacteria was decreased in siMFN2-transfected macrophages; in contrast, overexpression of MFN2 in macrophages increased Mtb growth compared with the control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693752>The lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2 is dispensable for PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Selective autophagy for elimination of aberrant , termed mitophagy, can be regulated by the kinase PINK1 and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin.

New therapeutic interventions are gaining prominence as the morbidity and mortality of AD increases exponentially every year. Treating AD with antihypertensive drugs is thought to be a promising intervention; however, its mechanism of action of ameliorating AD needs further investigation. In this context, the present study explores the protective effect of verapamil, an antihypertensive agent of Ca channel blocker (CCB) class against scopolamine-induced in vitro neurotoxicity and in vivo cognitive impairment. Supplementation of verapamil was found to attenuate oxidative stress by preventing mitochondrial injury, and augment the expression of genes involved in the cholinergic function (mACR1), synaptic plasticity (GAP43, SYP) and Ca-dependent memory-related genes (CREB1, CREBBP, BDNF). Further, verapamil treatment in mice attenuated the cognitive and behavioural deficits induced by scopolamine as measured by the elevated plus maze and passive avoidance test (P < 0.05). Thus, the present study demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of verapamil against the pathogenesis of AD such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive decline. These observations emphasize the importance of ‛Ca dysregulation' and ‛mitochondrial dysfunction' theories in AD and recommends the supplementation of compounds that regulate Ca homeostasis and mitochondrial function in susceptible AD individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669601>Alteration of mitochondrial DNA homeostasis in drug-induced liver injury.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for 13 proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process. In liver, genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease fatty acid oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to liver failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) impair cellular function by oxidizing cell components containing proteins, lipids, and DNA. Tumor oxidant status is elevated due to high metabolic activity under influence of abnormal growth factors, cytokines and function ROS-producing enzymes, including nitric oxide synthases, cyclooxygenases, and lipoxygenases. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcriptional master regulator element which is believed to recognize cellular oxidative stress followed by binding to promoter of cyto-protective and anti-oxidative genes to maintain cellular redox status through promoting antioxidant response participants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, ferritin, NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1). However, Nrf2 signaling protects malignant cells from ROS damage against tumor growth and chemoresistance. In addition, Nrf2 is able to participate in differentiation of certain stem cells by modulating autophagy procedure, also NRF2 provokes DNA damage response and facilitates drug metabolism and drug resistance by controlling of downstream enzyme and transporter members.

Identifying cellular pathways that contribute to axon vulnerability may identify new therapeutic strategies for maintenance of neural circuits. Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) is an axonal stress response MAP3K that is chronically activated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Activated DLK transmits an axon injury signal to the neuronal cell body to provoke transcriptional adaptations. However, the consequence of enhanced DLK signaling to axon vulnerability is unknown. We find that stimulating DLK activity predisposes axons to SARM1-dependent degeneration. Activating DLK reduces levels of the axon survival factors NMNAT2 and SCG10, accelerating their loss from severed axons. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction independently decreases the levels of NMNAT2 and SCG10 in axons, and in conjunction with DLK activation, leads to a dramatic loss of axonal NMNAT2 and SCG10 and evokes spontaneous axon degeneration. Hence, enhanced DLK activity reduces axon survival factor abundance and renders axons more susceptible to trauma and metabolic insult.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684984>Prohibitin (PHB) expression is associated with aggressiveness in DLBCL and flavagline-mediated inhibition of cytoplasmic PHB functions induces anti-tumor effects.</a></h2><p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are aggressive lymphomas accounting for approximately a third of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2) are scaffold proteins that promote  homeostasis and consequently cell survival, but biological functions of cytoplasmic PHBs remain largely unknown in DLBCL.PHB expression was analyzed in 82 DLBCL biopsies and five DLBCL cell lines by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting. Pharmacological inhibition of PHB using the synthetic flavagline FL3 was realized in vitro to gain insight PHB cellular functions. Effects of FL3 on DLBCL cell line viability, apoptosis, C-Raf-ERK-MNK-eIF4E signaling pathway and eIF4F complex formation and activity were evaluated by XTT assay, annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining and Western blotting respectively. Subcutaneous DLBCL xenograft model in SCID mice was also performed to determine in vivo FL3 effect.As in DLBCL cell lines, PHB1 and PHB2 were expressed in germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtypes. In patient samples, high PHB levels were associated with higher serum LDH (PHB1 and PHB2), IPIaa (PHB2), and Ki-67 (PHB2) expression. Higher PHB1 expression tends to be associated with shorter event-free survival (EFS) in patients, especially in male patients. FL3 induced apoptosis of DLBCL cell lines that was associated with inhibition of the ERK-MNK-eIF4E signaling pathway, including aggressive double/triple-hit DLBCL cell lines. This resulted in altered eIF4F complex formation and activity leading to a reduction of Bcl-2 and c-Myc expression levels. Moreover, FL3 strongly downregulated DLBCL cellular levels of Akt protein and AKT mRNA. FL3 antitumor activity was also confirmed in vivo in a murine xenograft model.Our data indicate that PHB overexpression is associated with markers of tumor aggressiveness in DLBCL, and that targeting PHBs may be a therapeutic option, notably in aggressive subtypes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697708>Evolutionarily conserved susceptibility of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to SDHI pesticides and its consequence on the impact of SDHIs on human cultured cells.</a></h2><p>Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitors (SDHIs) are used worldwide to limit the proliferation of molds on plants and plant products. However, as SDH, also known as respiratory chain (RC) complex II, is a universal component of  from living organisms, highly conserved through evolution, the specificity of these inhibitors toward fungi warrants investigation. We first establish that the human, honeybee, earthworm and fungal SDHs are all sensitive to the eight SDHIs tested, albeit with varying IC50 values, generally in the micromolar range. In addition to SDH, we observed that five of the SDHIs, mostly from the latest generation, inhibit the activity of RC complex III. Finally, we show that the provision of glucose ad libitum in the cell culture medium, while simultaneously providing sufficient ATP and reducing power for antioxidant enzymes through glycolysis, allows the growth of RC-deficient cells, fully masking the deleterious effect of SDHIs. As a result, when glutamine is the major carbon source, the presence of SDHIs leads to time-dependent cell death. This process is significantly accelerated in fibroblasts derived from patients with neurological or neurodegenerative diseases due to RC impairment (encephalopathy originating from a partial SDH defect) and/or hypersensitivity to oxidative insults (Friedreich ataxia, familial Alzheimer's disease).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic lipid mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte  were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction.

Therefore, autophagy represents a pro-survival stress response in the majority of cases. However, the role of autophagy in cell survival and cell death decisions is highly dependent on its extent, duration, and on the respective cellular context. An alternative pro-death function of autophagy has been consistently observed in different settings, in particular, in developmental cell death of lower organisms and in drug-induced cancer cell death. This cell death is referred to as autophagic cell death (ACD) or autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD), a type of cellular demise that may act as a backup cell death program in apoptosis-deficient tumors. This pro-death function of autophagy may be exerted either via non-selective bulk autophagy or excessive (lethal) removal of  via selective mitophagy, opening new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of autophagy/mitophagy in cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668496>The NADH Dehydrogenase Nde1 Executes Cell Death after Integrating Signals from Metabolism and Proteostasis on the Mitochondrial Surface.</a></h2><p>The proteolytic turnover of mitochondrial proteins is poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of dynamic isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to gain a global overview of mitochondrial protein turnover in yeast cells. Intriguingly, we found an exceptionally high turnover of the NADH dehydrogenase, Nde1. This homolog of the mammalian apoptosis inducing factor, AIF, forms two distinct topomers in , one residing in the intermembrane space while the other spans the outer membrane and is exposed to the cytosol. The surface-exposed topomer triggers cell death in response to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The surface-exposed topomer is degraded by the cytosolic proteasome/Cdc48 system and the mitochondrial protease Yme1; however, it is strongly enriched in respiratory-deficient cells. Our data suggest that in addition to their role in electron transfer, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases such as Nde1 or AIF integrate signals from energy metabolism and cytosolic proteostasis to eliminate compromised cells from growing populations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As an alternative, we describe the use of target proteins displayed as surface fusions on magnetized yeast cells. In our strategy, the target protein is co-expressed on the yeast surface with an iron oxide binding protein; incubation of these yeast cells with iron oxide nanoparticles results in their magnetization. Subsequently, binder cells that interact with the magnetized target cells can be isolated using a magnet. Using a known binder-target pair with modest binding affinity (K ~ 400 nM), we showed that a binder present at low frequency (1 in 10) could be enriched >100-fold, in a single round of screening, suggesting feasibility of screening combinatorial libraries. Subsequently, we screened yeast display libraries of Sso7d and nanobody variants against yeast displayed targets to isolate binders specific to the cytosolic domain of the mitochondrial membrane protein TOM22 (K ~ 272-1934 nM) and the extracellular domain of the c-Kit receptor (K ~ 93 to K >2000 nM). Additional studies showed that the TOM22 binders identified using this approach could be used for the enrichment of  from cell lysates, thereby confirming binding to the native mitochondrial protein. The ease of expressing a membrane protein or a domain thereof as a yeast cell surface fusion - in contrast to recombinant soluble expression - makes the use of yeast-displayed targets particularly attractive.

We applied the machine learning algorithm treeClust to reveal functional associations between co-regulated human proteins from ProteomeHD, a compilation of our own data and datasets from the Proteomics Identifications database. This produced a co-regulation map of the human proteome. Co-regulation was able to capture relationships between proteins that do not physically interact or colocalize.

Its expression was previously shown to be modulated by nutritional or immune cues, but nothing is known about its impact on the lipid landscape and ensuing functional consequences. In the present work, we used mutants lacking LIPL-5 protein and found that lipl-5 is important for normal lipidome composition as well as its remodeling in response to food deprivation. Particularly, lipids with signaling functions such as ceramides and mitochondrial lipids were affected by lipl-5 silencing. In comparison with wild type worms, animals lacking LIPL-5 were enriched in cardiolipins linked to polyunsaturated C20 fatty acids and coenzyme Q-9. Differences in mitochondrial lipid composition were accompanied by differences in mitochondrial activity as  from well-fed lipl-5 mutants were significantly more able to oxidize respiratory substrates when compared with  from well-fed wild type worms. Strikingly, starvation elicited important changes in mitochondrial activity in wild type worms, but not in lipl-5 worms. This indicates that this lipase is a determinant of mitochondrial functional remodeling in response to food withdrawal.Copyright © 2019.

MiR-92a is negatively correlated with the activity of brown adipocytes. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of miR-92a on brown adipocytes. The expression of miR-92a in C2C12 cell was detected by a quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). C2C12 cells were induced to brown adipocytes. The direct target gene of miR-92a was determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Brown adipocytes were treated with isoprenaline (Iso) and transfected by miR-92a inhibitor and siSMAD7. The expression of heat-producing genes and adipose differentiation genes related to brown adipocytes were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The expression of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 were detected using Western blot analysis. The mitochondrial content was measured by mitotracker fluorescent staining. MiR-92a inhibitor significantly decreased the expression of miR-92a in C2C12 cells. MiR-92a inhibitor could upregulate the expression of Ucp1, Cox7a1, Elovl3, Ppargc1α, PPARγ, and FABP4, and its effect on Ucp1 was increased after the treatment of isoprenaline. Moreover, miR-92a inhibitor increased mitochondrial content, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the expression of SMAD7 and suppressed the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3, whereas miR-92a directly targeted SMAD7 to exert its inhibitory effects. SiSMAD7 reversed the effects of the inhibitor on heat-producing genes, mitochondrial content, OCR and the expressions of SMAD7, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 in brown adipocytes. Blocking miR-92a might promote brown adipocytes differentiation, mitochondrial oxidative respiration, and thermogenesis by targeting SMAD7 to inhibit the expressions of p-SMAD2 and p-SMAD3.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670384>Keeping  happy - benefits of a pore choice in acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672544>Hydrogen peroxide permeability of cellular membranes in insulin-producing cells.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen peroxide (HO) plays a central role in redox signalling and in oxidative stress-mediated cell death. It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and . Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Due to the little exchange of seawater and to anoxic conditions, S. constricta is exposed to considerable amounts of sulfide during low tide, but exhibits strong sulfide tolerance. Mitochondrial sulfide oxidation is a particular defense strategy against sulfide toxicity of sulfide-tolerant organisms, for which sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is the first key enzyme. In order to investigate the mechanism of sulfide tolerance in S. constricta, its SQR (designated as ScSQR), was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of ScSQR was 3698 bp and encoded 443 amino acids. The deduced ScSQR protein contained conserved FAD-binding domains, two cysteine residues, two histidines, and one glutamic acid, which are the essential elements for the catalytic mechanism of SQR. Subcellular localization analysis by the TargetP 1.1 prediction and the Western blot confirmed that ScSQR was only located in the . The response of ScSQR in the gill and liver of S. constricta were investigated during sulfide exposure (50, 150, and 300 μM sulfide) for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the time-course expressions of ScSQR protein in the S. constricta gill were detected when exposed to 150 μM sulfide by Western blot. The expression level of ScSQR increased significantly and showed a time-dependent pattern. In addition, under sulfide stress, the expression level of the gill was higher than that of liver. Together, our results suggest that ScSQR may perform important roles in protecting cells from sulfide stress by participating in mitochondrial sulfide detoxification and providing high sulfide tolerance to S. constricta.Copyright © 2019.

Total cell counts, differential cell counts were performed using automated cell counter and flow cytometry respectively. Further, the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were measured using ELISA.

Seahorse flux analyzer was used to measure the oxidative-phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the BEAS2B cells and BEAS2B + mMSC co-culture experiments.CS exposure increased the inflammatory cellular infiltrations in the lungs of the mt-Keima mice. MSC + EXO treatment showed protection compared to individual treatments (MSC or EXO alone). There were no changes in the mitophagy proteins like Pink1 and Parkin, which was also found using the mitoQC mice. CS exposure led to significant increase in the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 and other DAMPs pathway mediators like S100A4 and S100A8, HMGB1, RAGE and AGE. MSC + EXO treatment increased the gene expression of (fusion genes) like mfn1, mfn2 and opa1. Additionally, the rhot1 gene expression was increased in MSC + EXO treatment group compared to Air- and CS exposed groups. BEAS2B-MSC co-cultures showed protective response against the CSE-altered mitochondrial respiration parameters, confirming the beneficial effect of MSC towards human bronchial lung epithelial cells.CS affects some of early mitochondrial genes involved in the fission/fusion process, enhancing the damage response along with altered cytokine levels.

In this work, we demonstrate that mTERF8 is associated with the PEP complex. An mTERF8 knockout line displayed a wild type-like phenotype under standard growth conditions, but showed impaired efficiency of photosystem II electron flow. Transcription of most chloroplast genes was not substantially affected in the mterf8 mutant; however, the level of the psbJ transcript from the psbEFLJ polycistron was increased. RNA blot analysis showed that a larger transcript accumulates in mterf8 than in the wild type. Thus, abnormal transcription and/or RNA processing occur for the psbEFLJ polycistron. Circular reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis showed that the psbJ transcript terminates 95 nucleotides downstream of the translation stop codon in the wild type, whereas its termination is aberrant in mterf8. Both electrophoresis mobility shift assays and chloroplast chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that mTERF8 specifically binds to the 3' terminal region of psbJ.

Based on this, we constructed a two-step precise targeting nanoplatform which can realize the drug release and drug action triggered by the microenvironment of lysosomes (endosomes) and , respectively. To begin with, the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were modified with triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and loaded with 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH). Then, folic acid (FA) targeted pH-sensitive liposomes containing docetaxel (Lipo/DTX-FA) were prepared by thin-film dispersion method, and the core-shell AIPH/MSN-TPP@Lipo/DTX-FA nanoparticles were constructed by self-assembly during the hydration of the liposomes. When this nanoplatform entered into the tumor cells through FA receptor-mediated endocytosis, the pH-sensitive liposomes were destabilized in the lysosomes, resulting in the release of DTX and AIPH/MSN-TPP nanoparticles. After that, AIPH was delivered to  by AIPH/MSN-TPP, and the alkyl radicals produced by AIPH under the high temperature environment can cause oxidative damage to . Not only that, the DTX could enhance the anti-tumor effect of AIPH by downregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that this delivery system could induce apoptosis based on organelles' s own microenvironment, which provides a new approach for tumor therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Here we measure mitochondrial membrane potential in non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo using a voltage-sensitive, positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer known as 4-[F]fluorobenzyl-triphenylphosphonium (F-BnTP). By using PET imaging of F-BnTP, we profile mitochondrial membrane potential in autochthonous mouse models of lung cancer, and find distinct functional mitochondrial heterogeneity within subtypes of lung tumours.

Several cases of renal injury and serum electrolytes disturbances have been reported in IFO-treated patients. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are suspected of being involved in the mechanism of IFO nephrotoxicity. Carnosine is a dipeptide which its antioxidant and  protecting properties have been mentioned in different experimental models. The current study aimed to evaluate the nephroprotective properties of carnosine against IFO-induced renal injury.Rats were treated with IFO (50 mg/kg, i.p) alone or in combination with carnosine. Serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury in addition to kidney markers of oxidative stress were evaluated. Moreover, kidney  were isolated, and some mitochondrial indices were assessed.Elevated serum creatinine and BUN, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia, in addition, to an increase in urine glucose, protein, γ-GT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were evident in IFO-treated animals. IFO also caused an increase in kidney reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Renal GSH levels and antioxidant capacity were also depleted with IFO therapy. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, GSH level, membrane potential, and ATP content were decreased while mitochondrial LPO and permeabilization were increased in IFO group. Carnosine (250 and 500 mg/kg, i.p) mitigated IFO-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in renal tissue.Our data suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as fundamental mechanisms of renal injury induced by IFO. On the other hand, carnosine supplementation protected kidneys against IFO-induced injury through regulating mitochondrial function and mitigating oxidative stress.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676684>Multiple mitochondrial thioesterases have distinct tissue and substrate specificity, and CoA regulation, suggesting unique functional roles.</a></h2><p>Acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoA esters. Acots in the mitochondrial matrix are poised to mitigate β-oxidation overload and maintain CoA availability. Several Acots associate with , but whether they all localize to the matrix, are redundant, or have different roles is unresolved. Here, we compared the suborganellar localization, activity, expression, and regulation among mitochondrial Acots (Acot2, 7, 9, and 13) in  from multiple mouse tissues and from a model of Acot2 depletion. Acot7, 9, and 13 localized to the matrix, joining Acot2 that was previously shown to localize there.  from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney robustly expressed Acot2, 9, and 13; Acot9 levels were substantially higher in brown adipose tissue and kidney , as was activity for C4:0-CoA, a unique Acot9 substrate. In all tissues, Acot2 accounted for about half of the thioesterase activity for C14:0-CoA and C16:0-CoA. In contrast, liver  from fed and fasted mice expressed little Acot activity, which was confined to long-chain CoAs and due mainly to Acot7 and Acot13 activities. Matrix Acots occupied different functional niches, based on substrate specificity (Acot9 vs. Acot2 and 13) and strong CoA inhibition (Acot7, 9, and 13, but not Acot2). Interpreted in the context of β-oxidation, CoA inhibition would prevent Acot-mediated suppression of β-oxidation, while providing a release valve when CoA is limiting. In contrast, CoA-insensitive Acot2 could provide a constitutive syphon for long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. These results reveal how the family of matrix Acots can mitigate β-oxidation overload and prevent CoA limitation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692338>A RNA-targeted Two-photon Bio-probe with High Selective Permeability into Nuclear Pore Complexes for Dynamically Tracking the Autophagy Process among Multi-Organelles.</a></h2><p>Dynamic tracking of the spatiotemporal coordination among various organelles to in-depth understanding of the mechanism of autophagy have attracted considerable attentions.

HFF rats exhibited a significant increase in the gain of body weight, energy, and lipids compared to LF rats. HFF rats also showed hepatic insulin resistance, together with an increase in plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Hepatic lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol were higher in HFF rats, while a significant decrease in Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was found in this tissue. A marked increase in the protein amount of complex I, concomitant to a decrease in its contribution to mitochondrial respiration, was found in HFF rats. Lipid peroxidation and Nitro-Tyrosine content, taken as markers of oxidative stress, as well as NADPH oxidase activity, were significantly higher in HFF rats, while the antioxidant enzyme catalase decreased in these rats. Myeloperoxidase activity and lipocalin content increased, while peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma decreased in HFF rats. The present results provide evidence that middle-aged rats show susceptibility to a short-term "Western diet", exhibiting altered redox homeostasis, insulin resistance, and early mitochondrial alterations in the liver. Therefore, this type of dietary habits should be drastically limited to pursue a "healthy aging".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670803>PPR20 is required for the cis-splicing of mitochondrial nad2 intron 3 and seed development in maize.</a></h2><p>Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are helical repeat RNA binding proteins that function in RNA processing by conferring sequence-specific RNA binding activity. Owing to lethality of PPR mutants, functions of many PPR proteins remain obscure. Here, we report the function of PPR20 in intron splicing in  and its role in maize seed development. PPR20 is a P-type PPR protein targeted to . The ppr20 mutants display slow embryo and endosperm development. Null mutation of PPR20 severely reduces the cis-splicing of mitochondrial nad2 intron 3, resulting in reduction in the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I. The ppr20-35 allele with a Mu insertion in the N-terminal region shows a much weaker phenotype.

The origin of cancer at the molecular and cellular levels is not well understood. Is the primary cause of the origin of cancer the genomic instability or impaired energy metabolism? An attempt was made to present cancer etiology originating from life's major evolutionary transition. The first evolutionary transition went from simple to complex cells when eukaryotic cells with glycolytic energy production merged with the oxidative mitochondrion (The Endosymbiosis Theory first proposed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s). The second transition went from single-celled to multicellular organisms once the cells obtained , which enabled them to obtain a higher amount of energy. Evidence will be presented that these two transitions, as well as the decline of NAD+ and ATP levels, are the root of cancer diseases. Restoring redox homeostasis and reactivation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism are important factors in cancer prevention.Copyright © 2019 B.

In the present study, we investigated the antitumor effect of Polyphyllin VI against human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) and the underlying molecular mechanisms.The U2OS cell lines were used to determine the antiproliferative effect of Polyphyllin VI by CCK8 assay. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The Polyphyllin VI-induced apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-APC/7-AAD apoptosis detection kit and JC-1 staining. Meanwhile, the autophagy was determined by acridine orange staining. The apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins were monitored by Western blot assay. Subsequently, intracellular hydrogen peroxide (HO) and the activation of ROS/JNK pathway were detected.Polyphyllin VI could potently inhibit cell proliferation by causing G2/M phase arrest. Polyphyllin VI induced -mediated apoptosis with the upregulation of proapoptotic proteins Bax and poly ADP-ribose polymerase, and downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in U2OS cells. Concomitantly, Polyphyllin VI provoked autophagy with the upregulation of critical Atg proteins and accumulation of LC3B-II. Intracellular HO production was triggered upon exposure to Polyphyllin VI, which could be blocked by ROS scavenger. Polyphyllin VI dramatically promoted JNK phosphorylation, whereas it decreased the levels of phospho-p38 and ERK.Our results reveal that Polyphyllin VI may effectively induce apoptosis and autophagy to suppress cell growth via ROS/JNK activation in U2OS cells, suggesting that Polyphyllin VI is a potential drug candidate for the treatment of osteosarcomas.© 2019 Yuan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669759>Role of reactive oxygen species in atherosclerosis: Lessons from murine genetic models.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial chronic and inflammatory disease of medium and large arteries, and the major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involves a number of risk factors and complex events including hypercholesterolemia, endothelial dysfunction, increased permeability to low density lipoproteins (LDL) and their sequestration on extracellular matrix in the intima of lesion-prone areas. These events promote LDL modifications, particularly by oxidation, which generates acute and chronic inflammatory responses implicated in atherogenesis and lesion progression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) (which include both free radical and non-free radical oxygen intermediates), play a key-role at each step of atherogenesis, in endothelial dysfunction, LDL oxidation, and inflammatory events involved in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis lesions. Most advanced knowledge supporting the "oxidative theory of atherosclerosis" i.e. the nature and the cellular sources of ROS and antioxidant defences, as well as the mechanisms involved in the redox balance, is based on the use of genetically engineered animals, i.e. transgenic, genetically modified, or altered for systems producing or neutralizing ROS in the vessels. This review summarizes the results obtained from animals genetically manipulated for various sources of ROS or antioxidant defences in the vascular wall, and their relevance (advance or limitation), for understanding the place and role of ROS in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019.

We have previously demonstrated that mitochondrial transplantation is an efficacious therapy to replace or augment  damaged by IRI, allowing for enhanced muscle viability and function in cardiac tissue. Here, we investigate the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation in a murine lung IRI model using male C57BL/6J mice. Transient ischemia was induced by applying a microvascular clamp on the left hilum for 2 hours. Upon reperfusion mice received either vehicle or vehicle containing  either by vascular delivery (Mito V) through the pulmonary artery or by aerosol delivery (Mito Neb) via the trachea (nebulization). Sham control mice underwent thoracotomy without hilar clamping and were ventilated for 2 hours before returning to the cage. Following 24 hours recovery, lung function was assessed and lungs were collected for analysis. Our results demonstrated that at 24 hours of reperfusion dynamic compliance was significantly increased and resistance, peak inspiratory pressure, inspiratory capacity and tissue damping were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in mito groups as compared to their respective vehicles. Neutrophil infiltration, interstitial edema and apoptosis were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in mito groups as compared to vehicles. No significant differences in cytokines and chemokines between groups were shown. All functional results in Mito groups except peak inspiratory pressure in Mito Neb showed no significant differences (P>0.05) as compared to Sham. These results conclude that mitochondrial transplantation by vascular delivery or nebulization improves lung function and decreases lung tissue injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676491>NK Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment Have Fragmented .</a></h2><p>Tumor-infiltrating natural killer cells from patients with liver cancer had fragmented .©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698548>Cholesterol Metabolism in the Brain and Its Association with Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the aging population after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Defects in the lysosomal systems and  have been suspected to cause the pathogenesis of PD. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of PD remains obscure. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism is linked to numerous disorders, including atherosclerosis. The brain contains the highest level of cholesterol in the body and abnormal cholesterol metabolism links also many neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, PD, Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The blood brain barrier effectively prevents uptake of lipoprotein-bound cholesterol from blood circulation. Accordingly, cholesterol level in the brain is independent from that in peripheral tissues. Because cholesterol metabolism in both peripheral tissue and the brain are quite different, cholesterol metabolism associated with neurodegeneration should be examined separately from that in peripheral tissues. Here, we review and compare cholesterol metabolism in the brain and peripheral tissues. Furthermore, the relationship between alterations in cholesterol metabolism and PD pathogenesis is reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693390>: at the crossroads of regulating lung epithelial cell function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</a></h2><p>Disturbances in mitochondrial structure and function in lung epithelial cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such disturbances not only affect cellular energy metabolism, but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which  are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death pathways and cellular remodeling to physical barrier function and innate immunity, all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective  are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell function, innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial barrier function in COPD.

CdCl also induces mitochondrial fission by increasing dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression as well as the -dependent apoptosis pathway by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. However, it remains unclear whether mechanisms linked to the mitochondrial damage signal via CdCl-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) cause damage to spermatocytes. In this study, increased intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) depolarization, and mitochondrial fragmentation and swelling were observed at 5 μM of CdCl exposure, resulting in increased apoptotic cell death. Moreover, CdCl-induced cell death is closely associated with the ERK/Drp1/p38 signaling axis. Interestingly, SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, effectively prevented CdCl-induced apoptotic cell death by reducing ∆Ψm depolarization and intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels. Knockdown of Drp1 expression diminished CdCl-induced mitochondrial deformation and ROS generation and protected GC-2spd cells from apoptotic cell death. In addition, electron microscopy showed that p38 inhibition reduced CdCl2-induced mitochondrial interior damage more effectively than N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger; ERK inhibition; or Drp1 knockdown. Therefore, these results demonstrate that inhibition of p38 activity prevents CdCl-induced apoptotic GC-2spd cell death by reducing depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial ROS levels via ERK phosphorylation in a signal pathway different from the CdCl-induced ERK/Drp1/p38 axis and suggest a therapeutic strategy for CdCl-induced male infertility.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It's unknown whether long-term consumption of maleic acid-modified starch is harmful to the human. However, many studies have indicated that maleic acid causes renal tubular damage in animal models, even as the associated pathways remain unclear. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) is the most innovative of the label-free quantitative technologies, which have better quantification performance. Therefore, SWATH technology was used to investigate the effect of maleic acid on rat kidney proteome in this study.SD rats were treated with 0 mg/kg (control), 6 mg/kg (low-dose), 10 mg/kg (medium-dose) and 60 mg/kg (high-dose) of maleic acid. After kidney protein extraction, 28% SDS-PAGE was used, followed by in-gel digestion and desalting. Next, the samples were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with Q-TOF MS, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH technology were also used. The gene ontology and pathway analysis were accomplished. Ultimately, these protein biomarkers were validated by using scheduled high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM ).Comparisons of the control group with the other three groups revealed that 95, 130, and 103 proteins were expressed at significantly different levels from in the control group in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. According to the gene ontology analysis, the major processes that these proteins were involved in were metabolic processes, biological regulation, cellular processes, and responses to stimuli; the major functions these proteins were involved in were binding, hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and oxidoreductase activity; and the major cellular components they were involved in were the cytoplasm, extracellular region, membrane, and . According to the KEGG pathway analysis, these proteins were involved in 35 pathways, 5 of which, including the carbohydrate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, renal tubular resorption, amino acid metabolism, and Ras signaling pathways, are discussed in this study. Ultimately, 19 proteins involved in 12 important pathways were validated by sMRM .It was demonstrated that maleic acid caused insufficient energy production, which might lead to a decrease in the activity of the sodium-potassium ATP pump and hydrogen ion ATP pump, which could have in turn caused renal tubular resorption and hydrogen ion regulation to be blocked, thus leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules, which would then result in renal tubular acidification followed finally by Fanconi syndrome.This article is protected by copyright.

HCMV can result in severe direct and indirect pathologies under immunosuppressed conditions and is the leading cause of birth defects related to infectious disease. Currently, the effect of HCMV infection on host cell metabolism as an increase in glycolysis during infection has been defined. We have observed that oxidative phosphorylation is also increased. We have identified morphological and functional changes to host  during HCMV infection. The mitochondrial network undergoes fission events after HCMV infection. Interestingly, the network does not undergo fusion. At the same time mitochondrial mass and membrane potential increase. The electron transport chain (ETC) functions at an elevated rate resulting in the release of increased reactive oxygen species. Surprisingly, despite the stress applied to the host , the network is capable of responding to and meeting the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands placed on it. When mitochondrial DNA is depleted from the cells, we observed severe impairment of viral replication. Mitochondrial DNA encodes many of the ETC components. These findings suggest that the host cell ETC is essential to HCMV replication. Our studies suggest the host cell  may be a therapeutic target. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus present in up to 85% of some populations. Like all herpesviruses, HCMV infection is for life. There is no vaccine currently available, neutralizing antibody therapies are ineffective and current antivirals have limited long-term efficacy due to side effects and potential for viral mutation and resistance. The significance of this research is in understanding how HCMV manipulates the host  to support bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements for replication. Despite a large genome, HCMV relies exclusively on host cells for metabolic functions. By understanding the dependency of HCMV on the , we could exploit these requirements and develop novel antivirals.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669412>Extracellular matrix/ pathway: a novel potential target for sarcopenia.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome characterized by a progressive and generalized loss of muscle mass, strength, and endurance. Although the mitochondrial hypothesis of sarcopenia has been proposed, it remains a highly debated topic. The age-related declines in skeletal muscle regenerative capacity have been attributed to the changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Therefore, mitochondrial deterioration in the muscle may be implicated in the sarcopenic process, and a possible link between ECM remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction may be suggested. While exercise training improves elderly muscle function, the contradictory results obtained from different studies, the lack of a well-defined training program as well as age-related falls may raise questions regarding the overall benefits of this interventional strategy for sarcopenic elderly who have limited ability to perform physical exercise. Thus, it remains important to be able to offer less cumbersome but equally effective alternatives such as pharmacological approaches to help elderly patients. In this review, we discuss the involvement of  dysfunction as well as the ECM remodeling in sarcopenia and we suggest that the future of sarcopenia drug development may be targeting ECM/ pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and  Research Society.
