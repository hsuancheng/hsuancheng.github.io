However, it is difficult to control the unsaturated copper-nitrogen constructions as well as compare their ORR performance in a similar carbon matrix by a simple but efficient way. Herein, we easily attained two types of Cu + -N 2 and Cu 2+ -N 4 constructions just by etching the pyrolyzed Cu-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework nanoleaf (Cu-ZIF-L) with sulfuric  or nitric , respectively. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were adopted to further confirm the different copper-nitrogen constructions after different  treatment. By comparison, electrochemical studies demonstrate that Cu + -N 2 sites get higher activity for boosting the ORR performance than that of Cu 2+ -N 4 sites. Furthermore, Cu-N/C-H 2 SO 4 acted as air cathode in the Zinc-air battery exhibits an excellent performance and stability.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614581>Coordination Complex Formation and Redox Properties of Kynurenic and Xanthurenic  Can Affect Brain Tissue Homeodynamics.</a></h1><p>Reactive  species (ROS) are known for their participation in various physiological and pathological processes in organisms, including ageing or degeneration. Kynurenine pathway metabolites, such as kynurenic (KYNA) or xanthurenic (XA) , can affect neurodegenerative diseases due to their ROS scavenging and Fe ion coordination complex formation but insights are still incomplete. Therefore, we investigated the formation and antioxidant capabilities of KYNA- and XA-Fe complexes by nano-electrospray-mass spectrometry, differential pulse voltammetry, deoxyribose degradation and Fe autoxidation assays. XA formed coordination complexes with Fe or Fe ions and was an effective antioxidant. By contrast, only Fe-KYNA complexes could be detected. Moreover, KYNA showed no antioxidant effects in the FeCl/ascorbic  deoxyribose degradation assay variant and only negligible activities in the Fe autoxidation assay. Coordination complexes of Fe ions with KYNA probably stabilize KYNA in its keto tautomer form. Nevertheless, both KYNA and XA exhibited sufficient antioxidant activities in some of the employed assay variants. The results provide evidence that both have the potential to alleviate neurodegenerative diseases by helping to maintain tissue redox homeodynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680647>Improved neuroprotective effects of gallic -loaded chitosan nanoparticles against ischemic stroke.</a></h1><p>Ischaemic stroke is a typical cerebrovascular illness with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nevertheless, strategies for the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) are limited. Gallic  (GA) is a plant polyphenol that has been used against CIRI. However, the pharmacokinetic properties of GA, such as its low absorption, poor bioavailability and quick elimination, have had negative effects on its scientific application. To strengthen its effectiveness, a delivery system of GA-loaded o-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles (GA-NPs) was synthesized in our study. GA nanoparticles were prepared, and their effects were evaluated. We measured the in vitro and in vivo effects of the GA-NPs in the  glucose deprivation (OGD) model and the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. We established an OGD model to study the neuroprotective effects of GA-NPs. We established an in vivo MCAO model to measure neurological deficit scores with the Zea Longa neurological deficit scale, infarct size by TTC staining, apoptosis by TUNEL staining, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory indicators by ELISA. The results showed that GA-NPs improved neurological defects, reduced infarct size, decreased TUNEL-positive cells, and alleviated pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. In conclusion, GA-NPs may be used as an efficacious delivery vehicle for GA in the treatment of CIRI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635017>Synergetic activation of peroxymonosulfate by MnO-loaded β-FeOOH catalyst for enhanced degradation of organic pollutant in water.</a></h1><p>In this paper, manganese dioxide (MnO) loaded iron oxyhydroxide (β-FeOOH) was synthesized aiming to improve the catalytic performance of β-FeOOH as peroxymonosulfate activator. The β-FeOOH@MnO/PMS system exhibited excellent performance and its reaction rate constant of  Orange 7 (AO7) degradation (0.0533 min) was approximately 2.3 times as that in β-FeOOH/PMS system (0.0232 min). β-FeOOH@MnO possessed superior properties as catalyst than β-FeOOH, owing to the higher surface hydroxyl density with higher specific surface area, redox ability and electronic transmission rate. Moreover, on the basis of the analysis from FTIR and XPS, it was found that the redox reaction of Fe/Fe and Mn/Mn synergistically activated PMS as well as the generation of FeOH and MnOH accelerated activating PMS in the β-FeOOH@MnO/PMS system. Thus, MnO and FeOOH synergistically activated PMS to reactive  species (ROS). And O, O and OH were identified as predominant ROS in the β-FeOOH@MnO/PMS system on the basis of the result from quenching experiments and ESR. As a result, TOC removal rate was increased up to 22.62%. Additionally, β-FeOOH@MnO exhibited good stability with low iron dissolution and manganese dissolution. Generally, this study proposed that β-FeOOH@MnO was an efficient and environmental catalyst as PMS activator for organic pollutant degradation in water.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, NO and NO accumulation during nitrite denitrification in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were investigated. Results showed that low pH (< 7) and high influent loading (> 360:90) (COD:NO-N) caused serious NO and NO accumulation. The maximal NO accumulation of 4.96 mg L was observed at influent loading of 720:180 and the maximal NO accumulation of 46.29 mg L was found at pH of 6. The NO accumulation was far higher than the values reported in previous studies. In addition, the high NO accumulation could completely inhibit the activities of reductases involved in denitrification. High NO and NO accumulation were mainly caused by significant free nitrous  (FNA) and NO inhibition at low pH and high influent loading. There were significant differences on NO and NO accumulation at different carbon to nitrogen (COD/N). Low COD/N (≤ 4) could mitigate NO accumulation, but led to high NO accumulation. It is speculated that NO accumulation is related to the rapid denitrification with accumulated electron in anaerobic stage at high COD/N. NO accumulation is attributed to intense electron competition at low COD/N. High dissolved  (DO) of 4.04 mg L was detected during NO detoxification in this experiment, which is speculated to be partly caused by NO dismutation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658614>Inducible Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Sirt1 in Male Mice Reveals Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Sensitization of the Heart to Pressure Overload.</a></h1><p>Heart failure is associated with profound alterations of energy metabolism thought to play a major role in the progression of this syndrome. SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629789>Evaluation of apoptotic potential of glyphosate metabolites and impurities in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (in vitro study).</a></h1><p>Glyphosate is used for cereal, vegetable and fruit crops for reducing or inhibiting the growth of weeds as well as a desiccant for various grain crops. That is why, glyphosate has been shown to be accumulated in humans and animals through ingestion of food of both plant and animal origin. The study aimed to assessed the effect of glyphosate, its metabolites: aminomethylphosphonic  (AMPA), methylphosphonic  and its impurities: PMIDA, N-methylglyphosate, hydroxymethylphosphonic  and bis(phosphonomethyl)amine on apoptosis induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were exposed to the compounds studied at the concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 mM for 4 h. We have observed an increase in reactive  species (including hydroxyl radical) and cytosolic calcium ions levels as well as reduction of transmembrane mitochondrial potential (ΔΨm) in PBMCs exposed to the compounds examined. All substances studied changed PBMCs membrane permeability, activated caspase-8, -9, -3 and caused chromatin condensation, which showed that they were capable of inducing apoptosis both via extrinsic and particularly intrinsic pathway. Generally the study demonstrated that there were no differences between apoptotic changes induced by glyphosate, its metabolites or impurities, and observed changes were provoked by high concentrations of investigated compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to examine protective properties of AKBA against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. To investigate the effects of AKBA (2.5-10 µM) on glutamate injury in neuron-like cells PC12 and N2a, two treatment regimens (incubation for 2 or 0 hours before glutamate exposure) were used. Then, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method was used to determine viability of the cells. Cellular redox status was evaluated using fluorimetry and comet assays. Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and Western blot analysis of relative apoptotic proteins were conducted. Based on the results, 24 hours incubation with glutamate (8 mM) increased the cell mortality of PC12 and N2a (P < .001). However, AKBA (2.5-10 µM) enhanced the cell viability in both treatment regimens (P < .001). Also co- and pretreatment with AKBA significantly attenuated lipid peroxidation, reactive  species production, and DNA injury (P < .05 and P < .001). AKBA also restored the activity of cellular superoxide dismutase under glutamate toxicity; this effect was seen to be more significant during the pretreatment regimen (P < .001). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that AKBA inhibited glutamate-induced programmed cell death through depressing the elevation of the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins, concentration-dependently. Overall, the present findings suggest the neuroprotective activities of AKBA against glutamate-induced cell injury probably by inhibiting oxidative damage and reducing apoptotic cell death.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678673>The effect of benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic  S-methyl ester (BTH) treatment on regulation of reactive  species metabolism involved in wound healing of potato tubers during postharvest.</a></h1><p>Benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic  S-methyl ester (BTH) can improve wound healing of potato tubers; however, how the chemical regulates reactive  species (ROS) generation and scavenging during wound healing is not completely understood. BTH at 100 mg·L regulated changes in ROS generation and scavenging in healing tissues of potato tubers. A higher HO content was presented in healing tissues of potato tubers, while cell membrane permeability and malondialdehyde content declined due to BTH treatment. Additionally, the activities and transcript level of enzymes related with ROS generation, including NADPH oxidase, peroxidase and polyamine oxidase, as well as enzymes involved in ROS scavenging, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, were significantly enhanced by BTH treatment. It is suggested that ROS metabolism might play a crucial role in wound healing of potato tubers mediated by BTH during postharvest.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidative stress is involved in the pathological mechanism of -induced gastritis and gastric cancer induction. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress may be beneficial for preventing the development of -associated gastric diseases. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a crucial regulator for the expression of antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which protects cells from oxidative injury. α-Lipoic  (α-LA), a naturally occurring dithiol, shows antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in various cells. In the present study, we examined the mechanism by which α-LA activates the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukine-8 (IL-8), and reduces reactive  species (ROS) in -infected AGS cells. α-LA increased the level of phosphorylated and nuclear-translocated Nrf2 by decreasing the amount of Nrf2 sequestered in the cytoplasm by complex formation with Kelch-like ECH1-associated protein 1 (KEAP 1). By using exogenous inhibitors targeting Nrf2 and HO-1, we showed that up-regulation of activated Nrf2 and of HO-1 results in the α-LA-induced suppression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) and ROS. Consumption of α-LA-rich foods may prevent the development of -associated gastric diseases by decreasing ROS-mediated IL-8 expression in gastric epithelial cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632961>NFκB/Orai1 Facilitates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by Oxidative Stress in the Pathogenesis of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Non-esterified fatty  (NEFAs) promote  lipogenesis, which caused abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation, by the NFκB-Orai1 pathway. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive  species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the liver of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682046>Evaluation of Charge-Regulated Supramolecular Copolymerization to Tune the Time Scale for Oxidative Disassembly of β-Sheet Comonomers.</a></h1><p>A multistimuli-responsive supramolecular copolymerization is reported. The copolymerization is driven by hydrogen bond encoded β-sheet-based charge co-assembly into 1D nanorods in water, using glutamic  or lysine residues in either of the peptide comonomers. The incorporation of methionine as hydrophobic amino  supports β-sheet formation, but oxidation of the thioether side-chain to a sulfoxide functional group destabilizes the β-sheet ordered domains and induces disassembly of the supramolecular polymers. Using H O as reactive  species, the time scale and kinetics of the oxidative disassembly are probed. Compared to the charge neutral homopolymers, it is found that the oxidative disassembly of the charged ampholytic copolymers is up to two times faster and is operative at neutral pH. The strategy is therefore an important addition to the growing field of amphiphilic polythioether containing (macro)molecular building blocks, particularly in view of tuning their oxidation induced disassembly which tends to be notoriously slow and requires high concentrations of reactive  species or acidic reaction media.© 2019 The Authors.

From the experimental investigation, it could be concluded that maximum COD removal efficiency of 99% and hydrogen production rate of 6570 mL/d was achieved at 7.00 kg COD/md and 24 h HRT. To validate this, a back propagation ANN configuration of 4-12-4-2 was opted. The modelling was performed using the input parameters like time, influent chemical  demand (COD), effluent pH and volatile fatty  (VFA). The correlation coefficient between the experimental and predicted hydrogen production rate was 0.996. The result of the tested data for hydrogen production rate was successful. The calculated average percentage error (APE) for hydrogen production rate was 0.0004.

Nanocomposites were created by evaporation of the water-albumin dispersion with nanotubes using diode laser with temperature control. Two types of nanotubes were used. SWCNT I were synthesized using the electric arc method, SWCNT II were synthesized using the gas phase method. SWCNT I had a diameter and length less than SWCNT II. The mechanism of interaction between BSA and SWCNT in solid nanocomposites is considered. An experimental and theoretical studies of the interaction between aspartic (Asp) and glutamic (Glu) amino  located on the outer surface of BSA and nanotubes using of vibrational spectroscopy (Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy) was carried out. The possibility of nanotubes functionalization by  atoms of negative amino  residues Asp and Glu, which are on the outer surface of BSA, is shown by molecular modeling. The formation of covalent bonds between BSA and SWCNT in nanocomposites with different concentrations of nanotubes (0.01, 0.1 and 1 g/l) was confirmed by vibrational spectra. The covalent interaction between BSA with SWCNT under the laser irradiation leads to the conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of albumin. This is confirmed by a significant decrease in the intensity of the absorption bands in the high-frequency region. The calculation of the vibrational spectra of the three Glycine:Glycine, Glutamic :Threonine and Aspartic :Lysine complexes, which take into account hydrogen, ion-dipole and ion-ion bonds, showed that a disturbance in the intermolecular interaction between amino  residues led to significant decrease in the intensity of absorption bands in the region of stretching vibrations bonds OH and NH. From the Raman spectra, it was found that a significant number of defects in SWCNT is caused by the covalent attachment of  atoms to the graphene surface of nanotubes. An increase in the diameter of nanotubes (4 nm) has practically no effect on the absorption spectrum of nanocomposite, while measuring the concentration of SWCNT affects the FTIR spectra. This confirmed the hydrophobic interaction between BSA and SWCNT. Thus, it was shown that BSA solid nanocomposites with CNTs can interact either with the help of hydrophobic forces or with the formation of covalent bonds, which depends on the diameter of the used nanotubes. The viability of connective fibroblast tissue cells on nanocomposites with both types of SWCNT was demonstrated. It was found that nanocomposites based on SWCNT I provide slightly better compatibility of their structure with fibroblasts. It allows to achieve better cell adhesion to the nanocomposite surface. These criteria make extensive use of scaffold nanocomposites in biomedicine, depending on the requirements for their quality and application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is industrially produced by chemical route; however, a more economical and environmentally friendly production process is of interest. In this context, this study aimed to select wild yeasts able to produce xylitol and compare their performance in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate. For this, 960 yeast strains, isolated from soil, wood, and insects have been prospected and selected for the ability to grow on defined medium containing xylose as the sole carbon source. A total of 42 yeasts was selected and their profile of sugar consumption and metabolite production were analyzed in microscale fermentation. The six best xylose-consuming strains were molecularly identified as  spp The fermentative kinetics comparisons on defined medium and on sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate showed physiological differences among these strains. Production yields vary from Y = 0.25 g/g to Y = 0.34 g/g in defined medium and from Y = 0.41 g/g to Y = 0.60 g/g in the hydrolysate. Then, the xylitol production performance of the best xylose-consuming strain obtained in the screening, which was named   B12, was compared with the previously reported xylitol producing yeasts   A3,  sp. JA1, and   740 in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate under -limited conditions. All the yeasts were able to metabolize xylose, but   740 showed the highest xylitol production yield, reaching a maximum of 0.83 g xylitol/g of xylose in hydrolysate. The screening strategy allowed identification of a new   strain that efficiently grows in xylose even in hydrolysate with a high content of acetic  (~6 g/L). In addition, this study reports, for the first time, a high-efficient xylitol producing strain of  , which achieved, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest xylitol production yields in hydrolysate reported in the literature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675578>Flyash augmented FeO as a heterogeneous catalyst for degradation of stabilized landfill leachate in Fenton process.</a></h1><p>In this study magnetite (FeO) was augmented over coal flyash and analyzed for the effectiveness as a catalyst in heterogeneous Fenton process for the degradation of persistent organic pollutant present in stabilized landfill leachate. FeO and flyash augmented FeO was prepared by simple chemical precipitation method and both had magnetic nature. XRD, FTIR and SEM with EDX characterization were consummated for both catalysts. The Fenton experiments were performed in batch mode and to identify the optimal operating condition for effective COD removal the leachate pH, catalysts and HO dosages were varied. The reusability of the catalysts was studied. To understand the degradation mechanism adsorption study, Fenton oxidation of benzoic  and scavenging experiments with KI and NaF were performed. It was witnessed that flyash augmented FeO exhibited 84.7% of COD degradation which was 12.3% of higher removal efficiency than FeO at optimum pH 3, 0.05 M HO and 1000 mg/L of catalyst dosage in 100 min reaction time. This flyash augmented FeO showed 68% of TOC removal and good increment in biodegradability. Poor NH-N removal was observed in the Fenton treatment process. Decrease in aromaticity was found based on SUVA value and also indicated the removal of organic matter. Similarly, reusability and stability were higher than FeO. The results indicate that flyash augmented FeO is a competent catalyst in heterogeneous Fenton process for treatment of mature leachate. The usage of waste material flyash with FeO decreases the co-aggregation of FeO and improves the catalytic performance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although high-valent Mn(V)-oxo complexes have been proposed as the active oxidants that afford high regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectivities in the catalytic oxidation reactions, the importance of the spin state (e.g.,  = 0 or 1) of the proposed Mn(V)-oxo species is an area that requires further study. In the present study, we have theoretically demonstrated that a mononuclear nonheme Mn(V)-oxo species with an  = 1 ground spin state is the active oxidant that effects the stereo- and enantioselective alkane hydroxylation reaction; it is noted that synthetic octahedral Mn(V)-oxo complexes, characterized spectroscopically and/or structurally, possess an  = 0 spin state and are sluggish oxidants. In an experimental approach, we have investigated the catalytic hydroxylation of alkanes by a mononuclear nonheme Mn(II) complex, [(-PMB)Mn], and HO in the presence of carboxylic ; alcohol is the major product with high stereo- and enantioselectivities. A synthetic Mn(IV)-oxo complex, [(-PMB)Mn(O)], is inactive in C-H bond activation reactions, ruling out the Mn(IV)-oxo species as an active oxidant. DFT calculations have shown that a Mn(V)-oxo species with an  = 1 spin state, [(-PMB)Mn(O)(OAc)], is highly reactive and capable of oxygenating the C-H bond via  rebound mechanism; we propose that the triplet spin state of the Mn(V)-oxo species results from the consequence of breaking the equatorial symmetry due to the binding of an equatorial  from an acetate ligand. Thus, the present study reports that, different from the previously reported  = 0 Mn(V)-oxo species, Mn(V)-oxo species with a triplet ground spin state are highly reactive oxidants that are responsible for the regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectivities in the catalytic hydroxylation of alkanes by mononuclear nonheme manganese complexes and terminal oxidants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670612>Mammalian transient receptor potential TRPA1 channels: from structure to disease.</a></h1><p>The Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin TRPA channels are Ca-permeable non-selective cation channels remarkably conserved through the animal kingdom. Mammals have only one member, TRPA1, which is widely expressed in sensory neurons and in non-neuronal cells (such as epithelial cells and hair cells). TRPA1 owes its name to the presence of 14 ankyrin repeats located in the N-terminus of the channel, an unusual structural feature that may be relevant to its interactions with intracellular components. TRPA1 is primarily involved in the detection of an extremely wide variety of exogenous stimuli that may produce cellular damage. This include a plethora of electrophilic compounds that interact with nucleophilic amino  residues in the channel, and many other chemically-unrelated compounds whose only common feature seems to be their ability to partition in the plasma membrane. TRPA1 has been reported to be activated by cold, heat and mechanical stimuli, and its function is modulated by multiple factors, including Ca, trace metals, pH, and reactive , nitrogen and carbonyl species. TRPA1 is involved in acute and chronic pain, inflammation, plays a role in the pathophysiology of nearly all organ systems and is an attractive target for the treatment of related diseases. Here we review the current knowledge about the mammalian TRPA1 channel, linking its unique structure, widely tuned sensory properties and complex regulation to its roles in multiple pathophysiological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654767>Universal stress proteins contribute Edwardsiella piscicida adversity resistance and pathogenicity and promote blocking host immune response.</a></h1><p>Universal stress proteins (Usps) exist ubiquitously in bacteria and other organisms. Usps play an important role in adaptation of bacteria to a variety of environmental stresses. There is increasing evidence that Usps facilitate pathogens to adapt host environment and are involved in pathogenicity. Edwardsiella piscicida (formerly included in E. tarda) is a severe fish pathogen and infects various important economic fish including tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In E. piscicida, a number of systems and factors that are involved in stress resistance and pathogenesis were identified. However, the function of Usps in E. piscicida is totally unknown. In this study, we examined the expressions of 13 usp genes in E. piscicida and found that most of these usp genes were up-regulated expression under high temperature, oxidative stress,  stress, and host serum stress. Particularly, among these usp genes, usp13, exhibited dramatically high expression level upon several stress conditions. To investigate the biological role of usp13, a markerless usp13 in-frame mutant strain, TX01Δusp13, was constructed. Compared to the wild type TX01, TX01Δusp13 exhibited markedly compromised tolerance to high temperature, hydrogen peroxide, and low pH. Deletion of usp13 significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis showed that the inactivation of usp13 significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida to invade into host cell and infect host tissue. Introduction of a trans-expressed usp13 gene restored the lost virulence of TX01Δusp13. In support of these results, host immune response induced by TX01 and TX01Δusp13 was examined, and the results showed reactive  species (ROS) levels in TX01Δusp13-infected macrophages were significantly higher than those in TX01-infected cells. The expression level of several cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and CC2) in TX01Δusp13-infected fish was significantly higher than that in TX01-infected fish. These results suggested that the deletion of usp13 attenuated the ability of bacteria to overcome the host immune response to pathogen infection. Taken together, our study indicated Usp13 of E. piscicida was not only important participant in adversity resistance, but also was essential for E. piscicida pathogenicity and contributed to block host immune response to pathogen infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, porous dendritic PtRuPd nanospheres (PtRuPd NSs) were synthesized by a facile hexadecylpyridinium chloride (HDPC)-mediated one-pot aqueous method with ascorbic  (AA) as the reducing agent. The as-obtained PtRuPd NSs displayed high-efficient catalytic activity and durability for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and  reduction reaction (ORR). It exhibited enlarged mass activity (MA, 1.368 A mg) compared to commercial Pt/C (1.100 A mg) for EGOR. Besides, the onset potential (E, 0.930 V) and half-wave potential (E, 0.852 V) of PtRuPd NSs were more positive relative to homemade PtPd NSs (0.905 and 0.840 V), PdRu NSs (0.895 and 0.839 V), and commercial Pt/C (0.910 and 0.822 V) toward ORR.

A wide variety of neuroprotective herbs have been reported in Ayurveda. Brahmi, Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic ayurvedic herb known to be effective in neurological disorders from ancient times. Numerous approaches including natural and synthetic compounds have been applied against Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β and Tau are the hallmarks proteins of several neuronal dysfunctions resulting in Alzheimer's disease. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein known to be involved in progression of Alzheimer's disease. The generation of reaction  species, increased neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity are the major physiological dysfunctions associated with Tau aggregates, which leads to dementia and behavioural deficits. Bacoside A, Bacoside B, Bacosaponins, Betulinic , etc; are the bioactive component of Brahmi belonging to various chemical families. Each chemical component known have its significant role in neuroprotection. The neuroprotective properties of Brahmi and its bioactive components including reduction of ROS, neuroinflammation, aggregation inhibition of Amyloid-β and improvement of cognitive and learning behaviour. Here on basis of earlier studies we hypothesize the inhibitory role of Brahmi against Tau-mediated toxicity. The overall studies have concluded that Brahmi can be used as a lead formulation for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, which causes skin photodamage, is considered as an extrinsic skin aging factor. It reduces skin hydration, and increases wrinkle formation and reactive  species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the anti-aging effects of an ethanol extract of Oc (Oc.Ex).A UVB-irradiated hairless mouse model was used to examine relevant changes in skin hydration, wrinkle formation, and skin epidermal thickness. Also, antioxidant markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were analyzed, and Oc. Ex skin protective effects against UVB irradiation-induced photoaging were examined by determining the levels of skin hydration factors.Oc.Ex improved epidermal barrier dysfunctions such as increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and capacitance reduction in UVB-irradiated mice. It upregulated skin hydration-related markers, including hyaluronic  (HA), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and pro-collagen, in UVB-irradiated mice, compared with the vehicle control group. It also reduced UVB-induced wrinkle formation, collagen degradation, and epidermal thickness. Additionally, it remarkably suppressed the increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and restored the activity of SOD and CAT in UVB-irradiated mice, compared with the vehicle control group. Furthermore, Oc. Ex treatment downregulated the production of inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway activated by UVB irradiation.This study revealed that Oc. Ex reduced skin thickness and the degradation of collagen fibers by increasing hydration markers and collagen-regulating factors in the skin of UVB-irradiated mice. It also inhibited UVB-induced antioxidant enzyme activity and inflammatory cytokine expression via MAPK signaling downregulation, suggesting that it prevents UVB-induced skin damage and photoaging, and has potential for clinical development in skin disease treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661119>Glutamine affects T24 bladder cancer cell proliferation by activating STAT3 through ROS and glutaminolysis.</a></h1><p>Changes in metabolism are common phenomena in tumors. Glutamine (Gln) has been documented to play a critical role in tumor growth. In this study, we aimed to to explore the mechanisms through which bladder cancer cells utilize Gln to fulfill their biosynthetic needs during proliferation. In addition, the roles of Gln in the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, reactive  species (ROS) regulation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression were examined in vitro in the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a metabolic fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln metabolism, as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS. Thus, on the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Gln promotes the proliferation of the Gln‑dependent bladder cancer cell line, T24, by supplementing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and neutralizing ROS to activate the STAT3 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677009>Effects of Docosahexaenoic  and Its Peroxidation Product on Amyloid-β Peptide-Stimulated Microglia.</a></h1><p>Growing evidence suggests that docosahexaenoic  (DHA) exerts neuroprotective effects, although the mechanism(s) underlying these beneficial effects are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that DHA, but not arachidonic  (ARA), suppressed oligomeric amyloid-β peptide (oAβ)-induced reactive  species (ROS) production in primary mouse microglia and immortalized mouse microglia (BV2). Similarly, DHA but not ARA suppressed oAβ-induced increases in phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (p-cPLA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in BV2 cells. LC-MS/MS assay indicated the ability for DHA to cause an increase in 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and suppress oAβ-induced increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Although oAβ did not alter the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, exogenous DHA, ARA as well as low concentrations of 4-HHE and 4-HNE upregulated this pathway and increased production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in microglial cells. These results suggest that DHA modulates ARA metabolism in oAβ-stimulated microglia through suppressing oxidative and inflammatory pathways and upregulating the antioxidative stress pathway involving Nrf2/HO-1. Understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial effects of DHA on microglia should shed light into nutraceutical therapy for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665431>PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE 3 (PIP3) modulates immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h1><p>Small post-translationally modified peptides are important signalling components of plant defence responses against phytopathogens, acting both as positive and negative modulators. PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE (PIP) 1 and 2 has been shown to amplify plant immunity. Here we investigate the role of the related peptide PIP3 in the regulation of immune response in Arabidopsis. Treatment with synthetic PIP peptides led to similar transcriptome reprogramming, indicating an effect on innate immunity-related processes and phytohormones, including jasmonic  (JA) biosynthesis and signalling. PIP3 overexpressing (OX) plants showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to flg22 exposure. In addition, flg22-induced production of reactive  species and callose deposition were significantly reduced in PIP3-OX plants. Interestingly, PIP3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility both toward Botrytis cinerea and the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of both JA and salicylic  biosynthesis and signalling genes was more induced during B. cinerea infection in PIP3-OX plants compared with wild-type plants. Promoter and ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the transcription factors WRKY18, WRKY33 and WRKY40 cooperatively act as repressors for PIP3. The results point to a fine-tuning role for PIP3 in modulation of immunity through the regulation of SA and JA biosynthesis and signalling pathways in Arabidopsis.© The Author(s) 2019.

This method is based on the simultaneous administration of [1-C]glycine and [N]glycine followed by the measurement of excretion kinetics of breath CO and urinary N. The basic idea of the DLAAM is that the unknown C recovery RF(C) of the 1-C amino , essential for the calculation of the net CO production, can be approximated by the easily measureable N recovery RF(N) of the α-NH labelled amino . In four healthy adult men (76-97 kg) the DLAAM was tested parallel to the IC and in one man (74 kg) parallel to the DLWM. Using the approximation RF(C) ≈ RF(N) the RCO (in l CO d) was calculated to 387.0 ± 30.3 (DLAAM) vs. 382.8 ± 22.6. (IC). The Bland-Altman plot shows that the difference between the DLAAM and IC of individual RCO is within the 95 % confidence interval (mean ± 2 SD): +4.3 ± 37.5 l CO d. We conclude that the DLAAM and IC may be used interchangeably. The physical activity level (PAL) was calculated based on the DLAAM vs. DLWM to about 1.5.

The Graphene Oxide (GO) films are deposited on substrates and patterned using plasma-enhanced liftoff techniques. The substrate is initially treated with  plasma to increase surface energy and enhance wettability thus increasing the bond between the GO flakes and the substrate.

The potential energy surfaces obtained from IRC calculations on transition state geometries are subjected to reaction force and reaction work calculations. The estimated reaction works of structural and electronic activities in the progress of reaction reflect the unfavorable formation of diol intermediate and preferential formation of formamide. While 91% of the activation energy comes from structural changes in preparative region of TS1 path, the structural and electronic rearrangements respectively, share 57.6% and 42.4% of total activation energy of TS2 pathway.

Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive  species (ROS) and lactic . Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of glycolysis with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of glycolysis inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and glycolysis dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant energy expenditure, -base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for  mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of  and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641425>Elevated H2AX Phosphorylation Observed with kINPen Plasma Treatment Is Not Caused by ROS-Mediated DNA Damage but Is the Consequence of Apoptosis.</a></h1><p>Phosphorylated histone 2AX (H2AX) is a long-standing marker for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) from ionizing radiation in the field of radiobiology. This led to the perception of H2AX being a general marker of direct DNA damage with the treatment of other agents such as low-dose exogenous ROS that unlikely act on cellular DNA directly. Cold physical plasma confers biomedical effects majorly via release of reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS). , increase of H2AX has often been observed with plasma treatment, leading to the conclusion that DNA damage is a direct consequence of plasma exposure. However, increase in H2AX also occurs during apoptosis, which is often observed with plasma treatment as well. Moreover, it must be questioned if plasma-derived ROS can reach into the nucleus and still be reactive enough to damage DNA directly. We investigated H2AX induction in a lymphocyte cell line upon ROS exposure (plasma, hydrogen peroxide, or hypochlorous ) or UV-B light. Cytotoxicity and H2AX induction was abrogated by the use of antioxidants with all types of ROS treatment but not UV radiation. H2AX phosphorylation levels were overall independent of analyzing either all nucleated cells or segmenting H2AX phosphorylation for each cell cycle phase. SB202190 (p38-MAPK inhibitor) and Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) significantly inhibited H2AX induction upon ROS but not UV treatment. Finally, and despite H2AX induction, UV but not plasma treatment led to significantly increased micronucleus formation, which is a functional read-out of genotoxic DNA DSBs. We conclude that plasma-mediated and low-ROS H2AX induction depends on caspase activation and hence is not the cause but consequence of apoptosis induction. Moreover, we could not identify lasting mutagenic effects with plasma treatment despite phosphorylation of H2AX.Copyright © 2019 Sander Bekeschus et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655487>Free radicals and neonatal encephalopathy: mechanisms of injury, biomarkers, and antioxidant treatment perspectives.</a></h1><p>Neonatal encephalopathy (NE), most commonly a result of the disruption of cerebral  delivery, is the leading cause of neurologic disability in term neonates. Given the key role of free radicals in brain injury development following hypoxia-ischemia-reperfusion, several oxidative biomarkers have been explored in preclinical and clinical models of NE. Among these, antioxidant enzyme activity, uric  excretion, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and non-protein-bound iron have shown promising results as possible predictors of NE severity and outcome. Owing to high costs and technical complexity, however, their routine use in clinical practice is still limited. Several strategies aimed at reducing free radical production or upregulating physiological scavengers have been proposed for NE. Room-air resuscitation has proved to reduce oxidative stress following perinatal asphyxia and is now universally adopted. A number of medications endowed with antioxidant properties, such as melatonin, erythropoietin, allopurinol, or N-acetylcysteine, have also shown potential neuroprotective effects in perinatal asphyxia; nevertheless, further evidence is needed before these antioxidant approaches could be implemented as standard care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619699>Isolation and characterization of an atypical LEA gene (IpLEA) from Ipomoea pes-caprae conferring salt/drought and oxidative stress tolerance.</a></h1><p>Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins belong to a large family that exists widely in plants and is mainly involved in desiccation processes during plant development or in the response to abiotic stresses. Here, we reported on an atypical LEA gene (IpLEA) related to salt tolerance from Ipomoea pes-caprae L. (Convolvulaceae). Sequence analysis revealed that IpLEA belongs to the LEA_2 (PF03168) group. IpLEA was shown to have a cytoplasmic localization pattern. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that IpLEA was widely expressed in different organs of the I. pes-caprae plants, and the expression levels increased following salt, osmotic, oxidative, freezing, and abscisic  treatments. Analysis of the 1,495 bp promoter of IpLEA identified distinct cis-acting regulatory elements involved in abiotic stress. Induction of IpLEA improved Escherichia coli growth performance compared with the control under abiotic stresses. To further assess the function of IpLEA in plants, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing IpLEA were generated. The IpLEA-overexpressing Arabidopsis seedlings and adult plants showed higher tolerance to salt and drought stress than the wild-type. The transgenic plants also showed higher oxidative stress tolerance than the wild-type Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the expression patterns of a series of stress-responsive genes were affected. The results indicate that IpLEA is involved in the plant response to salt and drought, probably by mediating water homeostasis or by acting as a reactive  species scavenger, thereby influencing physiological processes under various abiotic stresses in microorganisms and plants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644601>Constitutive expression of an A-5 subgroup member in the DREB transcription factor subfamily from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus enhanced abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis.</a></h1><p>Dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of stress-inducible gene expression in plants. Anthocyanins, an important class of flavonoids, protect plants from reactive  species produced under abiotic stresses. However, regulation of DREBs on anthocyanin accumulation is largely unknown. Here, an A-5 subgroup DREB gene (AmDREB3) isolated from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a desert broadleaf shrub with very high tolerance to harsh environments, was characterized in terms of both abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation. AmDREB3 does not contain the transcriptional repression motif EAR, and the protein was located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation capacity. The transcription of AmDREB3 was differentially induced in the shoots and roots of A. mongolicus seedlings under drought, salt, heat, cold, ultraviolet B, and abscisic  treatments. Moreover, the transcript levels in twigs, young leaves, and roots were higher than in other organs of A. mongolicus shrubs. Constitutively expressing AmDREB3 improved the tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis to drought, high salinity and heat, likely by inducing the expression of certain stress-inducible genes. The transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings also exhibited an obvious purple coloration and significant increases in anthocyanin accumulation and/or oxidative stress tolerance under drought, salt, and heat stresses. These results suggest that the AmDREB3 TF may be an important positive regulator of both stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683362>Hyperbaric oxygenation affects acetylcholine-induced relaxation in female diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>We aimed to assess the effects of intermittent hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO2 at 2 bars for 120 minutes a day for four successive days) on acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation (AChIR) in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (N=80) that were randomized into four groups: healthy controls (CTR); diabetic rats (DM); and control and diabetic rats that underwent hyperbaric oxygenation (CTR+HBO and DM+HBO), respectively. AChIR was measured in vitro in aortic rings, with/without L-NAME, MS-PPOH, HET0016 or indomethacin. mRNA expression of eNOS, iNOS, COX-1, COX-2, thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1), CYP4A1, CYP4A3 and CYP2J3 was assessed by qPCR. Systemic oxidative stress and plasma antioxidative capacity were determined with the thiobarbituric -reactive substances (TBARS) and the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assays, respectively. There was no significant difference in AChIR among experimental groups of rats. In CTR and DM group of rats, AChIR was mediated by NO and EETs pathway, while in the CTR+HBO and DM+HBO groups, NO-pathway prevailed. iNOS expression was upregulated in the DM group compared to CTR, while HBO2 upregulated eNOS in CTR group and TBXAS1 in DM group of rats. In both, CTR and DM group of rats, the sensitivity to ACh in the presence of L-NAME or in the presence of MSPPOH was significantly decreased compared to the response to ACh in the absence or presence of indomethacin or HET0016. DM and DM+HBO rats had increased TBARS compared to their respective controls. In conclusion, HBO2 presumably alters vasorelaxation in response to ACh from NO-EETs mediated pathways to solely NO-pathway, without affecting oxidative status of DM rats.Copyright© Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616386>, a Peroxisome Biogenesis Factor, Is Involved in Regulating Vegetative Growth, Conidiation, Sexual Development, and Virulence in .</a></h1><p>Peroxisomes are involved in a wide range of important cellular functions.

Previously, we have shown that low amounts of PRDXs are associated with male infertility and that PRDX6 is the primary antioxidant defence in human spermatozoa, maintaining survival and DNA integrity (Gong et al., 2012, Fernandez and O'Flaherty, 2018). Oxidative stress can trigger different pathway cascades in the spermatozoa, including truncated apoptosis. It has been reported that the phosphorylation status of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its target AKT (protein kinase B) prevent the spermatozoon from entering the truncated apoptotic cascade. Here, we aim to study the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by PRDX6 and assess its role in maintaining sperm viability. Human semen samples were obtained over 1 year from 20 healthy non-smoking volunteers aged 22-30 years old. Sperm viability, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis-like changes were determined by flow cytometry while phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT substrates were assessed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-PI3K and anti-phospho-AKT substrates antibodies. We found that the addition of arachidonic  and lysophosphatidic , products of PRDX6 calcium independent phospholipase A2 (Ca2+-iPLA2), prevented loss of sperm viability and maintained the phosphorylation of PI3K. Antioxidant compounds such as D-penicillamine partially prevented the oxidative damage on spermatozoa that led to a reduction of their viability. Thus, other pathways can also participate in sperm survival and be regulated by PRDXs. In conclusion, PRDX6 contributes to the regulation of ROS production and the PI3K/AKT pathway for the maintenance of sperm survival.© The Author(s) 2019.

This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of this combined therapy on lung dysfunction following esophagectomy.In this retrospective before-after study, we compared the clinical course of consecutive patients undergoing thoracoscopic esophagectomy treated with the combination of corticosteroids, ascorbic , and thiamine between June and December 2018 with a control group treated with corticosteroids alone between January 2016 and May 2018. Outcomes included oxygenation (arterial partial pressure of  (PaO)/fractional concentration of inspired  (FiO) ratios), duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.In all, 17 patients were included in this study (6 in the combination therapy group and 11 patients in the control group). Mean PaO/FO ratios in the combined therapy group were significantly higher than in the control group at all points during the observation period (p <0.001). In the combined therapy group, the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay were significantly shorter (p <0.001, p = 0.009).This study suggests that combined therapy including corticosteroids, ascorbic , and thiamine may be effective in improving oxygenation after esophagectomy. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661494>Hyaluronic  and epidermal growth factor improved the bovine embryo quality by regulating the DNA methylation and expression patterns of the focal adhesion pathway.</a></h1><p>Focal adhesion pathway is one of the key molecular pathways affected by suboptimal culture conditions during embryonic development. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hyaluronic  (HA) are believed to be involved in the focal adhesion pathway function by regulating the adherence of the molecules to the extracellular matrix. However, regulatory and molecular mechanisms through which the EGF and HA could influence the embryo development is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of continued or stage specific supplementation of EGF and/or HA on the developmental competence and quality of bovine preimplantation embryos and the subsequent consequences on the expression and DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway. The results revealed that, the supplementation of EGF or HA from zygote to the blastocysts stage reduced the level of reactive  species and increased hatching rate after thawing. On the other hand, HA decreased the apoptotic nuclei and increased blastocyst compared to EGF supplemented group. Gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in the resulting blastocysts indicated that, combined supplementation of EGF and HA increased the expression of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway while supplementation of EGF, HA or a combination of EGF and HA during the entire preimplantation period changed the DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway. On the other hand, blastocysts developed in culture media supplemented with EGF + HA until the 16-cell stage exhibited higher expression level of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway compared to those supplemented after the 16-cell stage. Conversely, the DNA methylation level of candidate genes was increased in the blastocysts obtained from embryos cultured in media supplemented with EGF + HA after 16-cell stage. In conclusion, supplementation of bovine embryos with EGF and/or HA during the entire preimplantation period or in a stage specific manner altered the DNA methylation and expression patterns of candidate genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway which was in turn associated with the observed embryonic developmental competence and quality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632027>Photoluminescent And Self-Assembled Hyaluronic -Zinc Oxide-Ginsenoside Rh2 Nanoparticles And Their Potential Caspase-9 Apoptotic Mechanism Towards Cancer Cell Lines.</a></h1><p>Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are used in modern cancer therapy based on their specific target, efficacy, low toxicity and biocompatibility. The photocatalytic performance of Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites with hyaluronic  (HA) was used to study anticancer properties against various human cancer cell lines.Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites functionalized by hyaluronic  (HA) were prepared by a co-precipitation method (HA-ZnONcs). The submicron-flower-shaped nanocomposites were further functionalized with ginsenoside Rh2 by a cleavable ester bond via carbodiimide chemistry to form Rh2HAZnO. The physicochemical behaviors of the synthesized ZnO nanocomposites were characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques. We carried out 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to evaluate the toxicity of Rh2HAZnO in various human cancer cells (A549, MCF-7, and HT29). Furthermore, to confirm the apoptotic effects of Rh2HAZnO and to determine the role of the Caspase-9/p38 MAPK pathways by various molecular techniques such as RT-PCR and Western blotting. Furthermore, Rh2HAZnO induced morphological changes of these cell lines, mainly intracellular reactive  species (ROS) were observed by ROS staining and nucleus by Hoechst staining.We confirmed that Rh2HAZnO exhibits the anti-cancer effects on A549 lung cancer, HT29 colon cancer, and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Moreover, intracellular reactive  species (ROS) were observed in three cancer cell lines. Rh2HAZnO induced apoptotic process through p53-mediated pathway by upregulating p53 and BAX and downregulating BCL2. Specifically, Rh2HAZnO induced activation of cleaved PARP (Asp214) in A549 lung cancer cells and upregulated Caspase-9/phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in other cell lines (HT29 and MCF-7). Furthermore, Rh2HAZnO induced morphological changes in the nucleus of these cell lines.These results suggest that the potential anticancer activity of novel Rh2HAZnO nanoparticles might be linked to induction of apoptosis through the generation of ROS by activation of the Caspase-9/p38 MAPK pathway.© 2019 Kim et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649278>The natural compound gracillin exerts potent antitumor activity by targeting mitochondrial complex II.</a></h1><p>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in cancer bioenergetics and are considered a potential target for anticancer therapy. Considering the limited efficacy and toxicity of currently available mitochondria-targeting agents, it is necessary to develop effective mitochondria-targeting anticancer drugs. By screening a large chemical library consisting of natural products with diverse chemical entities, we identified gracillin, a steroidal saponin, as a mitochondria-targeting antitumor drug. Gracillin displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on the viability of a large panel of human cancer cell lines, including those carrying acquired resistance to chemotherapy or EGFR-targeting drugs, by inducing apoptosis. We show that gracillin attenuates mitochondria-mediated cellular bioenergetics by suppressing ATP synthesis and by producing reactive  species (ROS). Mechanistically, gracillin disrupts complex II (CII) function by abrogating succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity without affecting the succinate:ubiquinone reductase. The gracillin-induced cell death was potentiated by 3-nitropropionic  (3-NPA) or thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which inhibit CII by binding to the active site of SDHA or to the ubiquinone-binding site, respectively. Finally, we show that gracillin effectively suppressed the mutant-Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis and the growth of xenograft tumors derived from cell lines or patient tissues. Gracillin displayed no obvious pathophysiological features in mice. Collectively, gracillin has potential as a CII-targeting antitumor drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652670>Transcription Factor  Is Involved in Salt Stress Response in Diploid Cotton Species ( L.).</a></h1><p>Cotton is one of the most economically important crops in the world, and it is exposed to various abiotic stresses during its lifecycle, especially salt stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cotton tolerance to salt stress are still not fully understood due to the complex nature of salt response. Therefore, identification of salt stress tolerance-related functional genes will help us understand key components involved in stress response and provide valuable genes for improving salt stress tolerance via genetic engineering in cotton. In the present study, virus-induced gene silencing of  in cotton showed enhanced salt sensitivity compared to wild-type plants under salt stress. Overexpression of  in  positively regulated salt tolerance at the stages of seed germination and vegetative growth. Additionally, -overexpressing plants exhibited higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) under salt stress. The transcriptome sequencing analysis of transgenic  plants and wild-type plants revealed that there was enriched coexpression of genes involved in reactive  species (ROS) scavenging (including glutamine S-transferases (GSTs) and SODs) and altered response to jasmonic  and salicylic  in the -OE lines.  is involved in salt stress response by the jasmonic - or salicylic -mediated signaling pathway based on overexpression of  in  and virus-induced gene silencing of  in cotton.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641181>Rising CO enhances hypoxia tolerance in a marine fish.</a></h1><p>Global environmental change is increasing hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems. During hypoxic events, bacterial respiration causes an increase in carbon dioxide (CO) while  (O) declines. This is rarely accounted for when assessing hypoxia tolerances of aquatic organisms. We investigated the impact of environmentally realistic increases in CO on responses to hypoxia in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We conducted a critical  (O) test, a common measure of hypoxia tolerance, using two treatments in which O levels were reduced with constant ambient CO levels (~530 µatm), or with reciprocal increases in CO (rising to ~2,500 µatm). We also assessed blood -base chemistry and haemoglobin-O binding affinity of sea bass in hypoxic conditions with ambient (~650 μatm) or raised CO (~1770 μatm) levels. Sea bass exhibited greater hypoxia tolerance (~20% reduced O), associated with increased haemoglobin-O affinity (~32% fall in P) of red blood cells, when exposed to reciprocal changes in O and CO. This indicates that rising CO which accompanies environmental hypoxia facilitates increased O uptake by the blood in low O conditions, enhancing hypoxia tolerance. We recommend that when impacts of hypoxia on aquatic organisms are assessed, due consideration is given to associated environmental increases in CO.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644947>Protective effects of syringic  on neurobehavioral deficits and hippocampal tissue damages induced by sub-chronic deltamethrin exposure.</a></h1><p>Recent developments in the field of insecticide exposure have led to a renewed interest in alternative antioxidant therapy. The present study was to investigate the neuroprotective role of syringic  (SA, 25 mg/kg/day) on the neurotoxicity and oxidative damage induced by deltamethrin (DTM, 1.28 mg/kg/day during two months) in CA1/3 pyramidal neurons. Animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 16/group) (250-270 g) for control, DTM, SA and DTM + SA. DTM and SA were administered by oral gavage daily. Rats that were given sub-chronic DTM had revealed a significant increase in caspase-3 levels, impaired recognition memory, reduced antioxidant activity and enhanced free radicals in the hippocampus. The results showed that SA ameliorated neurobehavioral alterations, reduced reactive /nitrogen species, pyknosis in the CA1/3 and increased antioxidant enzyme activity. In conclusion, SA (25 mg/kg/day) had potential neuroprotective and therapeutic impacts against sub-chronic DTM exposure via its antioxidant and antiapoptotic efficacy. Therefore, it can be used as a neuroprotective natural plant-derived agent against DTM-induced neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The adaptations of fishes to deep-sea environment apparently have occurred independently many times. The genetic basis of adaptation for obtaining their energy remains unknown. Mitochondria play a central role in aerobic respiration. Analyses of the available 2,161 complete mitochondrial genomes of 1,042 fishes, including 115 deep-sea species, detect signals of positive selection in mitochondrial genes in nine branches of deep-sea fishes. Aerobic metabolism yields much more energy  unit of source material than anaerobic metabolism. The adaptive evolution of the mtDNA may reflect that aerobic metabolism plays a more important role than anaerobic metabolism in deep-sea fishes, whose energy sources (food) are extremely limited. This strategy maximizes the usage of energy sources. Eleven mitochondrial genes have convergent/parallel amino  changes between branches of deep-sea fishes. Thus, these amino  sites may be functionally important in the acquisition of energy, and reflect convergent evolution during their independent invasion of the harsh deep-sea ecological niche.Copyright © 2019 Shen, Pu, Chen, Murphy and Shen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644277>Physiological and Metabolomics Analyses Reveal the Roles of Fulvic  in Enhancing the Production of Astaxanthin and Lipids in  under Abiotic Stress Conditions.</a></h1><p>In this study, it was found that fulvic  (FA) enhanced the contents of astaxanthin and lipids in  under high light and nitrogen starvation conditions by 2- and 1.2-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, the carbohydrate and chlorophyll contents were decreased by FA induction, whereas the levels of reactive  species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) as well as the expression of astaxanthin and lipid biosynthetic genes were increased. To further explore the interrelation between FA and the biosynthesis of astaxanthin and lipids, a metabolomics analysis of  by combined FA and abiotic stress exposure was conducted by using LC-MS/MS. The contents of some cytoprotective metabolites and signal molecules, including d-maltose, succinate, malic , melatonin (MT), and some amino , were increased under FA induction and abiotic stress conditions. These metabolites are intermediates in the TCA cycle and Calvin cycle, providing more precursors for the synthesis of astaxanthin and lipids.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor and plays an important role in fatty  metabolism. Our previous study found that 1-O-alkyl glycerophosphate (AGP), a naturally occurring ether analog of lysophosphatidic , is a high-affinity, partial agonist of PPARγ. In this study, we investigated the role of AGP in microglial activation and illustrated the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that AGP treatment increased the production of intracellular reactive  species and induced PPARγ activation in microglial cells. Interestingly, AGP also up-regulated the expression levels of the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) scavenger receptor, a high-affinity receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins. The findings suggest that AGP induces PPARγ activation, enhances CD36 expression and increases the production of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) in microglial cells.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we report an atomically dispersed Ru-N site anchored on nitrogen-carbon support (Ru-N-C) as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for acidic OER. The single-atom Ru-N-C catalyst delivers an exceptionally intrinsic activity, reaching a mass activity as high as 3571 A g and turnover frequency of 3348 O h with a low overpotential of 267 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm. The catalyst shows no evident deactivation or decomposition after 30-hour operation in acidic environment. Operando synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy identify the dynamic adsorption of single  atom on Ru site under working potentials, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the O-Ru-N site is responsible for the high OER activity and stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623788>Phenylalanine roles in the seed-to-seedling stage: Not just an amino .</a></h1><p>Phenylalanine is an aromatic amino  that provides the carbon skeleton for the phenylpropanoid pathway, making many diverse chemicals used for structure, defense, and yet undiscovered functions. The identification of the arogenate dehydratase (ADT) enzymes in the genetic model Arabidopsis thaliana provided a platform to explore the roles of phenylalanine in all stages of life: germination, in the seed-to-seedling transition stage, organelle function, and in generation of defense mechanisms, enabling further studies in other plants. From the literature, data indicate that phenylalanine produced by ADT may have direct roles in organellar and tissue development. Recent studies implicate ADTs in cell division and protection from Reactive  Species, and in signaling and growth. Research in phenylalanine and subsequent phenylpropanoids also point to a role of phenylalanine as a purveyor of C and N nutrients. The understanding of phenylalanine action in plant cells is enhanced by recent research on phenylalanine in animal cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive  species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643134>Manganese-doped green tea-derived carbon quantum dots as a targeted dual imaging and photodynamic therapy platform.</a></h1><p>In this work, manganese-doped carbon quantum dots (Mn-CQDs) have been synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method by using waste green tea. The Mn dopants were introduced to impart magnetic resonance capability. Upon optimization of the experimental conditions, magnetofluorescent Mn-CQDs exhibit an excitation-dependent blue emission. The abundant functional groups on Mn-CQDs not only promote water solubility but also allow straightforward functionalization with amine groups. The amine-terminated Mn-CQDs were then subsequently conjugated to folic  (FA) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) to obtain the Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 magnetofluorescent photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent. in vitro studies using three different cells indicated specific targeting of Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 to the overexpressing folate receptor human epithelial carcinoma cell line (HeLa) cancer cells. Furthermore, Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal with an r /r ratio of 5.77. Favorably, by using the Mn-CQDs@FA delivery system, active Ce6 can reach the cellular interior while its red fluorescence (FL) and reactive  species generation can be retained, as has been verified by confocal microscopy. in vitro cell viability studies verified the biocompatibility of Mn-CQDs@FA/Ce6 nanohybrid with no significant toxicity up to 500 ppm while PDT treatment with 5 min irradiation (671 nm, 1 W cm ) was effective in killing >90% of cells.

Throat swab specimens of the patients were determined for nucleic  detection of influenza A (H1N1) virus, and all of the patients were confirmed. The gender, age, course of disease, underlying diseases, symptoms, body temperature, hospital stays, chest CT findings and laboratory results were collected, and the treatments and prognosis were recorded.Of 54 patients, 38 patients were enrolled in severe group, and 16 in critical group. Fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath and so on could be found in the two groups. The CD4T lymphocytes were less than normal reference value (410-1 590/μL) in both groups. The chest CT findings manifestations of severe group were scattered patchy shadows and ground glass appearance, all of them were cured and discharged after antiviral, antibiotics, and  treatment.

Nonetheless, their low bioavailability forecasts controversy about mechanisms on their in vivo scavenging activity against reactive  species (ROS). It has been proposed that PC reduce directly ROS concentration. An alternative or complementary action of PC could be the activation of the cell's antioxidant pathway, involving the regulation of gene expression, like that initiated by the Nrf2 transcription factor. To date there is not enough experimental data to support or discard this possibility. In the present study, we evaluated the use of several PC to prevent peroxidation of macromolecules and to elicit the activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor in HO-stresed IEC-6 enterocytic cell line. Synchrotron microspectroscopy demonstrated that PC compounds protected proteins, lipids and nucleic  against oxidation induced by HO. Immunofluorescence results showed that treatment with quercetin (Qc), catechin (Cat) and capsaicin (Cap) induced the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus, at the same level as did HO treatment, thus mimicking the action of the endogenous cell response to peroxidation. Even though the detailed mechanism still needs to be elucidated, we demonstrated the activation of Nrf2 by PCs in response to oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

At light doses of 3 and 5 J/cm, the viability of 5-ALA-PDT-treated cells significantly decreased with ART ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01) and ARM treatment ( < 0.01 and  < 0.01). Besides, the number of annexin V-FITC and ethidium homodimer III-positive cells was greater in the 5-ALA-PDT with ARM group than that in the other groups. -acetylcysteine could not significantly inhibit the percentages of apoptotic cells or inviable cells induced by 5-ALA-PDT with ARM. These reactive  species-independent mechanisms might enhance cytotoxicity in 5-ALA-PDT with ARM-treated tumor cells, suggesting that the use of 5-ALA-PDT with ARM could be a new strategy to enhance PDT cytotoxicity against tumor cells.

Doxorubicin (DOX)-coordinated titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TNP) were encapsulated with polymeric phenyboronic  (pPBA) via phenylboronic ester bond between pPBA and DOX. Loaded DOX was readily released under US irradiation due to the ROS-cleavable characteristics of phenylboronic ester bond. The size of nanoparticles was around 200nm, and DOX was released by ROS generated under US irradiation. Tumor targeting by PBA moiety, intracellular ROS generation, and combined therapeutic effect against tumor cells were confirmed in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated high tumor accumulation and efficient tumor growth inhibition in tumor-bearing mice under US irradiation, which revealed potential as a multi-functional agent for sonodynamic chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019.

The binary oxides of hafnium present a rich diversity of crystal structures and are of considerable technological importance given their high dielectric constants, refractory characteristics, radiation hardness, and anion conductivity; however, high-symmetry tetragonal and cubic polymorphs of HfO2 are accessible only at substantially elevated temperatures (1720 and 2600 °C, respectively). Here, we demonstrate that the core-shell arrangement of VO2 and amorphous HfO2 promotes outwards  diffusion along an electropositivity gradient and yields an epitaxially matched V2O3/HfO2 interface that allows for the unprecedented stabilization of the metastable cubic polymorph of HfO2 under ambient conditions. Free-standing cubic HfO2, otherwise accessible only above 2600 °C, is stabilized by  etching of the vanadium oxide core. In contrast, interdiffusion under oxidative conditions yields the negative thermal expansion material HfV2O7. Variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction demonstrate that the prepared HfV2O7 exhibits pronounced negative thermal expansion in the temperature range between 150 and 700 °C.

Molecular hydrogen or organic substances did not support growth. Nitrate was reduced to N. The dominant fatty  were Cω7, C and C  ω7. The total size of the genome of the novel isolate was 2 209 279 bp and the genomic DNA G+C content was 38.8 mol%. Results of phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the novel isolate belonged to the genus  and was most closely related to  DSM 1251 (96.74 %). Based on its physiological properties and results from phylogenetic analyses, including average nucleotide identity and  DNA-DNA hybridization values, the isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the genus , for which the name  sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SN118 (=DSM 109248=VKM B-3378).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629267>Simultaneous removal of As(III) and Cu(II) from real bottom ash leachates by manganese-oxidizing aerobic granular sludge: Performance and mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Manganese-oxidizing aerobic granular sludge (Mn-AGS) is a novel extension of AGS technology to treat arsenic (As) in organic wastewater. In this study, Mn-AGS was first applied to treat real wastewater (bottom ash leachates) containing high levels of As(III) and Cu(II) in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for 91 days. Influent and effluent As(III), As(V), Cu(II), as well as pH and chemical  demand (COD) were monitored daily, and sludge was collected regularly for morphological observation, chemical characterization, and microbial analysis. The results indicated that As(III) and Cu(II) could be efficiently removed from wastewater (∼83% and ∼100%, respectively), but the performance was sensitive to pH variation, especially for As(III). The removed As and Cu were mostly bound to carbonates (60.2 ± 2.0% and 70.0 ± 0.6%, respectively) and Fe/Mn oxides (28.2 ± 1.6% and 14.6 ± 0.5%, respectively) in the final sludge. Influent As(III) was partially oxidized into As(V), and high fractions of As(V) were obtained in the Fe/Mn oxide-bound phase. Unexpectedly, microbial analysis revealed that community richness was only slightly changed when the influent was acidized (pH 4.0) but greatly reduced after the influent pH back to 6.0. It could be explained by that -fast bacteria rapidly grew after pH recovery and eliminated non--fast bacteria. This work further supported the practical application of Mn-AGS to treat As(III)-containing organic wastewaters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the recognized importance of  O -mediated protein modifications, little is known about the role of this oxidant in cross-link formation and protein aggregation. Thus, using lysozyme as a model, the present study, sought to investigate the involvement of  O in cross-link formation. Lysozyme was photochemically oxidized in the presence of Rose Bengal or chemically oxidized using [ O]-labeled  O released from thermolabile endoperoxides. It was concluded that both  O generating systems induce lysozyme crosslinking and aggregation. Using SDS-PAGE and nano-scale liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry the results clearly demonstrated that  O is directly involved in the formation of covalent cross-links involving the amino  Histidine, lysine and Tryptophan.This article is protected by copyright.

The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs.Eleven studies involving 858 patients in total (629 female and 229 male) were included. Patients in the control groups received different treatments: placebo in 1 trial; hyaluronic  in 2 studies; hyaluronic  and PRP in 1 trial; corticosteroids in 4; and hypertonic dextrose, radiofrequency, or celecoxib + glucosamine in the remaining 3 trials. In looking at the quality of the available literature, we found that none of the studies included reached "good quality" standard, 2 were ranked as "fair," and the rest were considered "poor." No major complications or serious adverse events were reported following intra-articular OOT, which provided encouraging pain relief at short term. On the basis of the available data, no clear indication emerged from the comparison of OOT with other established treatments for KOA.The analysis of the available RCTs on OOT for KOA revealed poor methodologic quality, with most studies flawed by relevant bias, thus severely limiting the possibility of drawing conclusions on the efficacy of OOT compared with other treatments. On the basis of the data available, OOT has, however, proven to be a safe approach with encouraging effects in pain control and functional recovery in the short-middle term.Systematic review of Level I and III studies.Copyright © 2019 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher  radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg body weight) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino  sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high  radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663542>Tannic -based nanogel as an efficient anti-inflammatory agent.</a></h1><p>Biologically produced reactive  species (ROS) are important signaling molecules in the human body. Despite their importance under normal conditions, abnormal overproduction of ROS under unbalanced or irregular homeostasis can cause severe inflammatory diseases. Various antioxidants have been developed in the biomedical field to resolve high levels of ROS; however, high doses of natural antioxidants such as polyphenol can induce side effects on health. Further, synthetic antioxidants are still controversial in regards to their safety and their complicated synthesis. Inspired from our previous work, a nitric oxide-scavenging nanogel designed for treating rheumatoid arthritis, we report herein a biocompatible tannic  (TA)-based nanogel as an effective ROS scavenger. A polymeric phenylboronic -tannic  nanogel (PTNG) was prepared by simply mixing through to the formation of phenylboronic ester bonds between polymeric phenylboronate and TA. We focused on the reaction of phenylboronic ester with H2O2, which readily consumes H2O2 molecules, and applied it as an antioxidant. In addition, TA is a well-known antioxidant, specifically a free radical scavenger; thus, we expected combinatory ROS scavenging effects for PTNG. Various ROS scavenging assays revealed the significant antioxidant effects of PTNG. Under an induced inflammation model in vitro, our PTNG showed high biocompatibility as well as strong anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, in the zymosan-induced peritonitis mouse model, a representative acute inflammation model in vivo, PTNG reduced significant neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating successful alleviation of inflammation. On the basis of these results, we suggest that PTNG has great potential as an antioxidant and should find application in the treatment of further ROS-overproducing inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638792>Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics Reveals the Multitargeted Antibacterial Mechanisms of Lactobionic  against Methicillin-Resistant  (MRSA) using SWATH-MS Technology.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present study was to reveal the antibacterial mechanism of lactobionic  (LBA) against methicillin-resistant  (MRSA) using quantitative proteomics by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) to analyze 100 differentially expressed proteins after LBA treatment. Furthermore, multiple experiments were conducted to validate the results of the proteomic analysis including reactive  species (ROS), virulence-associated gene expression, and the relative quantification of target proteins and genes by parallel reaction monitoring and quantitative real-time PCR. Combining the ultrastructure observations, proteomic analysis, and our previous research, the mode of LBA action against MRSA was speculated as cell wall damage and loss of membrane integrity; inhibition of DNA repair and protein synthesis; inhibition of virulence factors and biofilm production; induction of oxidative stress; and inhibition of metabolic pathways. These results suggest potential applications for LBA in food safety and pharmaceuticals, considering its multitarget effects against MRSA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635261>Phenolic Composition of Hydrophilic Extract of Manna from Sicilian  Vahl and its Reducing, Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Activity in Vitro.</a></h1><p>Manna, a very singular vegetable product derived from the spontaneous solidification of the sap of some  species, has long been known for its mild laxative and emollient properties. In this work, a hydro-alcoholic extract of manna (HME) from Sicilian  Vahl was investigated using HPLC-DAD to find phenol components and using chemical and biological in vitro assays to determine its reducing, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. We identified elenolic , tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, catechin, fraxetin, verbascoside, gallic , procyanidin-B1, and luteolin 3,7 glucoside, in order of abundance. Measurements of total antioxidant activity by Folin-Ciocalteu reaction and ferric reducing ability (FRAP), as well as of scavenger activity towards ABTS•, DPPH•, and perferryl-myoglobin radicals, showed that the phytocomplex effectively reduced oxidants with different standard potentials. When compared with vitamin E, HME also behaved as an efficient chain-breaking antioxidant against lipoperoxyl radicals from methyl linoleate. In cellular models for oxidative stress, HME counteracted membrane lipid oxidation of human erythrocytes stimulated by -butyl hydroperoxide and prevented the generation of reactive  species, as well as the GSH decay in IL-1β-activated intestinal normal-like cells. Moreover, in this in vitro intestinal bowel disease model, HME reduced the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These findings may suggest that manna acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory natural product in humans, beyond its well-known effects against constipation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635117>Basic Properties of a New Polymer Gel for 3D-Dosimetry at High Dose-Rates Typical for FFF Irradiation Based on Dithiothreitol and Methacrylic  (MAGADIT): Sensitivity, Range, Reproducibility, Accuracy, Dose Rate Effect and Impact of  Scavenger.</a></h1><p>The photon induced radical-initiated polymerization in polymer gels can be used for high-resolution tissue equivalent dosimeters in quality control of radiation therapy. The dose (D) distribution in radiation therapy can be measured as a change of the physical measurement parameter T2 using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The detection by T2 is relying on the local change of the molecular mobility due to local polymerization initiated by radicals generated by the ionizing radiation. The dosimetric signals R2 = 1/T2 of many of the current polymer gels are dose-rate dependent, which reduces the reliability of the gel for clinical use. A novel gel dosimeter, based on methacrylic , gelatin and the newly added dithiothreitol (MAGADIT) as an -scavenger was analyzed for basic properties, such as sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy and dose-rate dependence. Dithiothreitol features no toxic classification with a difference to THPC and offers a stronger negative redox-potential than ascorbic . Polymer gels with three different concentration levels of dithiothreitol were irradiated with a preclinical research X-ray unit and MR-scanned (T2) for quantitative dosimetry after calibration. The polymer gel with the lowest concentration of the  scavenger was about factor 3 more sensitive to dose as compared to the gel with the highest concentration. The dose sensitivity (α = ∆R2/∆D) of MAGADIT gels was significantly dependent on the applied dose rate D ˙ (≈48% reduction between D ˙ = 0.6 Gy/min and D ˙ = 4 Gy/min). However, this undesirable dose-rate effect reduced between 4-8 Gy/min (≈23%) and almost disappeared in the high dose-rate range (8 ≤ &nbsp; D ˙ ≤ &nbsp; 12 Gy/min) used in flattening-filter-free (FFF) irradiations. The dose response varied for different samples within one manufacturing batch within 3%-6% (reproducibility). The accuracy ranged between 3.5% and 7.9%. The impact of the dose rate on the spatial integrity is demonstrated in the example of a linear accelerator (LINAC) small sized 5 × 10 mm 10 MV photon field. For MAGADIT the maximum shift in the flanks in this field is limited to about 0.8 mm at a FFF dose rate of 15 Gy/min. Dose rate sensitive polymer gels likely perform better at high dose rates; MAGADIT exhibits a slightly improved performance compared to the reference normoxic polymer gel methacrylic and ascorbic  in gelatin initiated by copper (MAGIC) using ascorbic .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669668>Protective efficacy of Tinospora sinensis against streptozotocin induced pancreatic islet cell injuries of diabetic rats and its correlation to its phytochemical profiles.</a></h1><p>Tinospora sinensis Lour. (Merr.) belongs to the family Menispermaceae and its stem extract have been used traditionally in broad aspects of therapeutic remedies including debility, dyspepsia, fever, jaundice, ulcer, bronchitis, urinary disease, skin disease, liver disease and diabetes.The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effects of methanol extract of stem of Tinospora sinensis (METS) on streptozotocin induced pancreatic islet cell injuries of diabetic rats and its correlation to its phytochemical profiles.A high-performance liquid chromatography technique (HPLC) was used to identify and quantify the major phytochemicals present in the METS. Diabetic rats were administered with METS at a dose of (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively orally) and standard drug Metformin (300 mg/kg) was given orally to group serving positive control. Effect of the METS on glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, antioxidant status, histopathology of pancreas and also on intracellular reactive  species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, cell cycleof pancreatic islet cells were studied in diabetic rats.The major phytochemicals identified and quantified by HPLC in the extract were berberine, caffeic , myricetin and ferulic . This result showed that methanol extract exhibited good antioxidant effect. The methanol extract of the plant prevented the diabetogenic effect of STZ and significantly lowered the fasting blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin and increased insulin and C-peptide level in treated rats. METS reduced apoptosis of STZ treated islet cells by significantly decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL6), intracellular ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) production and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and sub-G peak area, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.The results revealed that the methanol extract of the stem of the plant possesses protective effects against diabetes and associated complications.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, we wondered whether rifampicin has a beneficial effect such as an anti-oxidant in the liver, because the efficacy of some drugs sometimes relates with their toxicity as well as protective effects. The present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant effect of rifampicin against arachidonic  (AA) plus iron (AA + iron) cotreatment and against acetaminophen (APAP, 500 mg/kg)-induced oxidative stress, in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In vivo, oral administration of rifampicin (100 or 200 mg/kg) attenuated elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), serum liver injury markers, against APAP treatment and, histologically, ameliorated tissue damage. Under in vitro examination, MTT assays were used to assess the cell death inhibitory effect of rifampicin against AA + iron-induced oxidative stress. In addition, DCFH-DA and Rh 123 staining showed that rifampicin treatment reduced reactive  species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane damage, which had been induced by AA + iron treatment. Further, we explored whether rifampicin treatment enhanced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by activation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the upstream kinase of AMPKα. Activated AMPKα induced activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which are proteins functioning in redox balance. Moreover, we confirmed a reversed cell protective effect of rifampicin under compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) treatment. Overall, our data demonstrate that rifampicin effectively protects the liver against cellular oxidative stress through AMPKα and Nrf2 pathway.Copyright © 2019.

Yr36, which encodes the Wheat Kinase START1 (WKS1), is an effective high-temperature adult-plant resistance gene and confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races. We previously showed that WKS1 phosphorylates the thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) protein and reduces its ability to detoxify peroxides, which may contribute to the accumulation of reactive  species (ROS). WKS1-mediated Pst resistance is accompanied by leaf chlorosis in the Pst-infected regions, but the underlying mechanisms remain still elusive. Here, we show that WKS1 interacts with and phosphorylates PsbO, an extrinsic member of photosystem II (PSII), to reduce photosynthesis and regulate leaf chlorosis in conferring Pst resistance. A point mutation in PsbO-A1 or reductions in its transcript levels by RNA interference resulted in chlorosis and reduced Pst sporulation. Biochemical analyses revealed that WKS1 phosphorylates PsbO at two conserved amino  involved in its physical interactions with PSII and reduces the binding affinity of PsbO to PSII. Phosphorylated PsbO dissociated from the PSII protein complex, and underwent fast degradation by cysteine and aspartic proteases. Taken together, these results demonstrate that perturbations of wheat PsbO by point mutation or its phosphorylation by WKS1 reduce photosynthesis rate and delays the growth of Pst pathogen before the induction of ROS.Copyright © 2019 The Author.

Because the intensity and quality of sunlight can change dramatically throughout the day, various regulatory mechanisms help plants adjust their photosynthetic output accordingly, including the regulation of light energy accumulation to prevent the generation of damaging reactive  species. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a regulatory mechanism that dissipates excess light energy, but how it is regulated is not fully elucidated. Herein, we report a new NPQ-regulatory protein named Day-Length-dependent Delayed-Greening1 (DLDG1). The Arabidopsis DLDG1 associates with the chloroplast envelope membrane, and the dldg1 mutant had a large NPQ value compared with wild type. The mutant also had a pale-green phenotype in developing leaves but only under continuous light; this phenotype was not observed when dldg1 was cultured in the dark for ≥8 h per day. DLDG1 is a homolog of the plasma-membrane-localizing cyanobacterial proton-extrusion-protein A that is required for light-induced H+ extrusion, and also shows similarity in its amino- sequence to that of Ycf10 encoded in the plastid genome. Arabidopsis DLDG1 enhances the growth-retardation phenotype of the Escherichia coli K+/H+ antiporter mutant, and the everted membrane vesicles of the E. coli expressing DLDG1 show the K+/H+ antiport activity. Our findings suggest that DLDG1 functionally interacts with Ycf10 to control H+ homeostasis in chloroplasts, which is important for the light-acclimation response, by optimizing the extent of NPQ.© The Author(s) 2019.

The heated rutin-Lys system exhibited highest brown intensity and in vitro antioxidant activities. The 30-50 kDa rutin-Lys fraction had higher in vitro antioxidant activities than the other fractions, and at a dose of 0.4 mg/ml preserved over 90% cell viability for HepG2 cells exposed to H O . The dose-dependent protective effects against H O -induced oxidative stress of the rutin-Lys MRPs may involve the inhibition of reactive  species generation, enhancement of the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, along with the activation of the Nrf2-dependent pathway and upregulation of phase II antioxidant genes (including NQO1, HO-1, GCLG, and GCLM). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Rutin is widely distributed in vegetables and grains. The Maillard reaction is a common reaction occurring during food processing, and produces Maillard reaction products (MRPs) with distinct processing and biological properties. This study shows that a 30-min thermal treatment at 120°C generates antioxidative MRPs in the rutin-Lys, rutin-His, rutin-Ile and rutin-Glu model systems, which can directly inhibit reactive  species generation and enhance SOD and CAT activities while activating the Nrf2-dependent pathway and upregulating the expression of phase II detoxifying antioxidant genes. Therefore, for food systems containing phenolic antioxidants and proteins (such as rutin and Lys), one may enhance the antioxidant properties of these food systems through a 30-min thermal treatment at 120°C. Also, the resultant rutin-Lys MRPs may be isolated and used as commercial preparations of natural antioxidants.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677268>Is there an optimal irradiation dose for PDT: 37 Jcm or 75 Jcm ?</a></h1><p>Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) is widely used for the treatment of Bowen's disease (BD) and superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

Such monomer has been selected to elucidate the reactivity of primary and secondary hydroxyl groups and their contribution to the structure and properties of the polyester. Resulting polyaleuritate films have been produced using an open mold in one-step, solvent-free self-polycondensation in melt state and directly in air to evaluate the effect of  in their final physical and chemical properties. These polymers are amorphous, insoluble, and thermostable, being therefore suitable for solvent, and heat resistant barrier materials. Structurally, most of primary hydroxyls are involved in ester bonds, but there is some branching arising from the partial participation of secondary O-H groups. The oxidative cleavage of the vicinal diol moiety and a subsequent secondary esterification had a noticeable effect on the amorphization and stiffening of the polyester by branching and densification of the ester bond network. A derivation of such structural modification was the surface compaction and the reduction of permeability to water molecules. The addition of Ti(OiPr) as a catalyst had a moderate effect, likely because of a poor diffusion within the melt, but noticeably accelerated both the secondary esterification and the oxidative processes. Primary esterification was a high conversion bulk reaction while oxidation and secondary esterification was restricted to nearby regions of the air exposed side of cast films. The reason was a progressive hindering of  diffusion as the reaction progresses and a self-regulation of the altered layer growth. Despite such a reduced extent, the oxidized layer noticeably increased the UV-vis light blockage capacity. In general, characterized physical properties suggest a high potential of these polyaleuritate polyesters as food preserving materials.Copyright © 2019 Benítez, Guzman-Puyol, Cruz-Carrillo, Ceseracciu, González Moreno, Heredia and Heredia-Guerrero.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663590>Sulfosalicylic /Fe based nanoscale coordination polymers for effective cancer therapy by the Fenton reaction: an inspiration for understanding the role of aspirin in the prevention of cancer.</a></h1><p>Fenton reaction-based reactive  species (ROS) generation provides a new idea for the design of ROS-mediated anticancer agents. Finding ways to increase iron uptake and to elevate the level of H2O2 in cells simultaneously is thus crucial to this strategy. Meanwhile, salicylic  (SA) or its analogue, as the major metabolite of aspirin, has been reported to be closely associated with an intracellular redox-active product. In this work, a PEG-modified nanoscale coordination polymer (PFNC) via the self-assembly of 5-sulfosalicylic  (SSA) with Fe3+ ions has been designed for the first time. The results show that the SSA dissociated from the PFNC can lead to the decrease of GSH and the accumulation of H2O2 in cancer cells, and thus elevate cellular ROS via the Fenton reaction. Owing to such intracellular oxidative stress, PFNC-induced ferroptotic cell death was further confirmed. In vitro cytotoxicity studies show that PFNCs display higher cytotoxicity on cancer cells than on normal cells. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that PFNCs not only possess high tumor accumulation, but also significantly inhibit the tumor growth without obvious damage toward the major organs. Based on the results, we expect that this work will provide an inspiration for understanding the role of SA, even aspirin, in the prevention of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619228>Tissue-specific responses of antioxidant pathways to poor hygiene conditions in growing pigs divergently selected for feed efficiency.</a></h1><p>Poor hygiene of housing induces a systemic inflammatory response. Because inflammation and oxidative stress are processes that can sustain each other, the ways pigs are able to activate their antioxidant defenses are critical for production performance and health during periods when the immune system is solicited. Selection for production performance can also influence reactive  species (ROS) production and expression levels of genes involved in cellular response to oxidative stress in different tissues. To establish the extent by which poor hygiene and selection for feed efficiency affected redox status, pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were housed in poor or good hygiene during 6 weeks. At the end, blood was collected in all pigs, and half of them were killed for tissue sampling. The remaining pigs were reared in good hygiene conditions during a recovery period of 7-8 weeks.At week 6, poor hygiene was associated with a lower total antioxidant capacity assessed by plasma ferric reducing ability in all pigs, and with greater plasma levels of hydrogen peroxides in the high RFI pigs (less efficient). Adipose tissue of high RFI pigs exhibited higher activities of catalase and glutathione reductase, and greater thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations when compared with the low RFI pigs (more efficient). Poor hygiene conditions activated the antioxidant enzymes activities (glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in adipose tissue of both lines, but led to higher ROS production by mature adipocytes isolated from the high RFI pigs only. In liver and muscle, there were only minor changes in antioxidant molecules due to genetics and hygiene conditions. After the resilience period, adipose tissue of pigs previously challenged by poor hygiene maintained higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and for the high RFI line, displayed higher TBARS concentrations.Pigs selected for improved feed efficiency showed a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions. This could led to a lower inflammatory response and less impaired growth when these pigs are facing sanitary challenges during the production period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638999>Inhibition of the key metabolic pathways, glycolysis and lipogenesis, of oral cancer by bitter melon extract.</a></h1><p>Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer which favours rapid energy production, biosynthetic capabilities and therapy resistance.

RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and glycolysis rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In lipogenesis pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty  biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited lipid raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive  species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits glycolysis and lipid metabolism and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651708>Protective effects of fusidic  against sodium nitroprusside-induced apoptosis in C6 glial cells.</a></h1><p>Fusidic , a steroidal antibiotic, possesses antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the effect of fusidic  against neurodegenerative disease-related cell death has not been studied. Here, we investigated the protective effects of fusidic  on sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced toxicity in C6 glial cells. Fusidic  (5-20 μM) prevented SNP (100 μM)-induced cell death dose dependently, and effectively attenuated SNP-induced generation of nitric oxide (NO), total reactive  species (ROS), and peroxynitrite (ONOO). Fusidic  (20 μM) pretreatment significantly suppressed SNP (100 μM)-induced apoptotic events, such as nuclear condensation and caspase-3 activation. In addition, fusidic  effectively attenuated SNP-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, such as GRP78, IRE1, ATF6, PERK, XBP1s, eIF2α, CHOP, and caspase-12. A specific adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, compound C (10 μM), reversed the preventive effects of fusidic  against SNP-induced cytotoxicity, CHOP elevation, and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that fusidic  can protect C6 glial cells against cytotoxicity, through the regulation of AMPK pathway and apoptotic events.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657393>The synergistic effects of Cu clusters and InO on ethanol synthesis from acetic  hydrogenation.</a></h1><p>The development of high efficiency catalysts for acetic  hydrogenation to ethanol could ameliorate the petroleum crisis and acetic  overproduction. Cu and In2O3 catalysts both show catalytic activity for acetic  hydrogenation. However, monometallic Cu catalysts are less active in the dissociative adsorption of acetic  through C-O bond breaking, while the H2 adsorption and dissociation ability of In2O3 is weak. In this work, Cu4/In2O3 is designed to enhance the dissociation of both acetic  and H2. The detailed mechanism of acetic  hydrogenation to ethanol on Cu4/In2O3 is explored using periodic density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the H2 adsorption and dissociation are enhanced by the Cu cluster, while the H atom spillover from Cu to In2O3 is favorable on the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface. Additionally, a synergistic effect exists between the Cu cluster and In2O3 surface: H2 adsorbs on the Cu cluster and the dissociated H atoms react with acetic  activated by the In2O3  vacancy. Finally, compared with a Cu2In(100) surface, the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface possesses higher catalytic activity owing to the reduced energy barriers of acetic  dissociation and hydrogenation of the intermediates (CH3COO*, CH3CHO*, and CH3CH2O*). The Cu4/In2O3 catalyst proposed in this work can provide promising guidance for related catalyst design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676375>Vitamin c: One compound, several uses.

(Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides metabolism have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

Antifungal and entomotoxic effects were demonstrated for Jaburetox, an intrinsically disordered polypeptide derived from jack bean () urease. Here we describe the properties of Soyuretox, a polypeptide derived from soybean () ubiquitous urease. Soyuretox was fungitoxic to , leading to the production of reactive  species. Soyuretox further induced aggregation of  hemocytes, indicating an interference on the insect immune response. No relevant toxicity of Soyuretox to zebrafish larvae was observed. These data suggest the presence of antifungal and entomotoxic portions of the amino  sequences encompassing both Soyuretox and Jaburetox, despite their small sequence identity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic data revealed that Soyuretox, in analogy with Jaburetox, possesses an intrinsic and largely disordered nature. Some folding is observed upon interaction of Soyuretox with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles, taken here as models for membranes. This observation suggests the possibility for this protein to modify its secondary structure upon interaction with the cells of the affected organisms, leading to alterations of membrane integrity. Altogether, Soyuretox can be considered a promising biopesticide for use in plant protection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632331>Energy Metabolism and Redox State in Brains of Wistar Audiogenic Rats, a Genetic Model of Epilepsy.</a></h1><p>The Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is a genetic model of epilepsy, specifically brainstem-dependent tonic-clonic seizures, triggered by acute auditory stimulation. Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher  consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino  transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624141>Complement C5a Induces Renal Injury in Diabetic Kidney Disease Via Disruption in Mitochondrial Metabolic Agility.</a></h1><p>The sequelae of diabetes mellitus include microvascular complications such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which involves glucose-mediated renal injury that is associated with a disruption in mitochondrial metabolic agility, inflammation and fibrosis. We explored the role of the innate immune complement component C5a, a potent mediator of inflammation, in the pathogenesis of DKD in clinical and experimental diabetes. Marked systemic elevation in C5a activity was demonstrated in patients with diabetes which was not therapeutically targeted by conventional renoprotective agents. C5a and its receptor (C5aR1) were upregulated early in the disease process and prior to manifest kidney injury in several diverse rodent models of diabetes. Genetic deletion of C5aR1 in mice conferred protection against diabetes-induced renal injury. Transcriptomic profiling of kidney revealed diabetes-induced downregulation of pathways involved in mitochondrial fatty  metabolism. Interrogation of the lipidomics signature revealed abnormal cardiolipin remodelling in the diabetic kidney, a cardinal sign of disrupted mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics. In vivo delivery of an orally active inhibitor of C5aR1 (PMX53) reversed the phenotypic changes and normalized the renal mitochondrial fatty  profile, cardiolipin remodelling and citric  cycle intermediates. In vitro exposure of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells to C5a led to altered mitochondrial respiratory function and reactive  species generation. These studies provide evidence for a pivotal role of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in propagating renal injury in the development of DKD via disruption of mitochondrial agility, establishing a new immunometabolic signalling pathway in DKD.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678414>Ginkgo diterpene lactones inhibit cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced inflammatory response in astrocytes via TLR4/NF-κB pathway in rats.</a></h1><p>Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) is a traditional Chinese medicine known to treating stroke and other cardio-cerebrovascular diseases for thousands of years in China. Ginkgo diterpene lactones (GDL) attracted much attention because of their neuroprotective properties.To uncover the effects of GDL, which consist of ginkgolide A (GA), ginkgolide B (GB), and ginkgolide K (GK), on ischemic stroke, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms.We used middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) models mimicking the process of ischemia/reperfusion in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Anticoagulant effects of GDL were investigated on platelet activating factor (PAF), arachidonic  (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation both in vivo and in vitro. We also evaluated the effects of GDL on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in primary cultured rats' astrocytes. Infarct size, neurological deficit score, and brain edema were measured at 72 h after MCAO. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to analyze neurons necrosis and astrocytes activation. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrotic factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real time PCR. The levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) were assessed by real time PCR or Western blot.Compared with MCAO/R rats, GDL significantly reduced infarct size and brain edema, improved neurological deficit score. Meanwhile, GDL suppressed platelet aggregation, astrocytes activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing, TLR4 mRNA expression and transfer of NF-κB from cytoplasm to nucleus. Furthermore, GDL alleviated OGD/R injury and LPS-induced inflammatory responses in primary astrocytes, characterized by promoting cell viability, decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and inhibiting IL-1β and TNF-α releasing.In summary, GDL attenuate cerebral ischemic injury, inhibits platelet aggregation and astrocytes activation. The anti-inflammatory activity might be associated with the downregulation of TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway. Our present findings provide an innovative insight into the novel treatment of GDL in ischemic stroke therapy.Copyright © 2019.

However, their efficacy against solid tumors is still poor and further studies are required to improve it. One of the major restrictions for NK cell activity is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). There, tumor and other immune cells create the appropriate conditions for tumor proliferation while, among others, preventing NK cell activation. Furthermore, NK cell metabolism is impaired in the TME, presumably due to nutrient and  deprivation, and the higher concentration of tumor-derived metabolic end products, such as lactate. This metabolic restriction of NK cells limits their effector functions, and it could represent a potential target to focus on to improve the efficacy of NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors. In this review, we discuss the potential effect of TME into NK cell metabolism and its influence in NK cell effector functions.Copyright © 2019 Terrén, Orrantia, Vitallé, Zenarruzabeitia and Borrego.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661838>Fatty -Binding Protein 3 is Critical for α-Synuclein Uptake and MPP-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Cultured Dopaminergic Neurons.</a></h1><p>α-Synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that accumulates in insoluble inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Fatty  partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty -binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive  species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h1><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and mitochondria through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic -Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). From the above, our research indicates that CA is a promising antifungal candidate when applied to C. albicans infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652571>GLYI4 Plays A Role in Methylglyoxal Detoxification and Jasmonate-Mediated Stress Responses in .</a></h1><p>Plant hormones play a central role in various physiological functions and in mediating defense responses against (a)biotic stresses. In response to primary metabolism alteration, plants can produce also small molecules such as methylglyoxal (MG), a cytotoxic aldehyde. MG is mostly detoxified by the combined actions of the enzymes glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII) that make up the glyoxalase system. Recently, by a genome-wide association study performed in Arabidopsis, we identified GLYI4 as a novel player in the crosstalk between jasmonate (JA) and salicylic  (SA) hormone pathways. Here, we investigated the impact of  knock-down on MG scavenging and on JA pathway. In  mutant plants, we observed a general stress phenotype, characterized by compromised MG scavenging, accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), stomatal closure, and reduced fitness. Accumulation of MG in  plants led to lower efficiency of the JA pathway, as highlighted by the increased susceptibility of the plants to the pathogenic fungus . Moreover, MG accumulation brought about a localization of GLYI4 to the plasma membrane, while MeJA stimulus induced a translocation of the protein into the cytoplasmic compartment. Collectively, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that GLYI4 is a hub in the MG and JA pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652773>Modern Extraction and Purification Techniques for Obtaining High Purity Food-Grade Bioactive Compounds and Value-Added Co-Products from Citrus Wastes.</a></h1><p>Citrus contains a range of highly beneficial bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamins that show antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and help in building the body's immune system. On consumption or processing, approximately 50% of the fruit remains as inedible waste, which includes peels, seeds, pulp, and segment residues. This waste still consists of substantial quantities of bioactive compounds that cause environmental pollution and are harmful to the ecosystem because of their high biological  demand.

Seed longevity is a key trait in agriculture, which directly influences seed germination and ultimately determines crop productivity and hence food security. Numerous studies have demonstrated that seed deterioration is regulated by complex interactions between diverse endogenous genetically controlled factors and exogenous environmental cues, including temperature, relative humidity, and  partial pressure during seed storage. The endogenous factors, including the chlorophyll concentration, the structure of the seed coat, the balance of phytohormones, the concentration of reactive  species, the integrity of nucleic  and proteins and their associated repair systems, are also involved in the control of seed longevity. A precise understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying seed longevity is becoming a hot topic in plant molecular biology. In this review, we describe recent research into the regulation of seed longevity and the interactions between the various environmental and genetic factors. Based on this, the current state-of-play regarding seed longevity regulatory networks will be presented, particularly with respect to agricultural seed storage, and the research challenges to be faced in the future will be discussed.This article is protected by copyright.

Although many studies have indicated that SMF have positive effects on bone tissue, there were limited studies investigate the effects of HiSMF on bone cells, including osteoclasts. To illustrate the effect of HiSMF on osteoclast differentiation, and whether iron involve in the altered osteoclast formation and resorption ability under HiSMF. 16 T HiSMF generated from a superconducting magnet was used. Osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, acting ring formation, mRNA expression, and protein expression were determined by tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (TRAP) staining, pits formation assay, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidine staining, qRT-PCR, and western blot, respectively. The changes induced by HiSMF in the level of iron, and the concentration of mitochondrial protein, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive  species (ROS), malonaldehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) was examined by atomic absorption spectrometry, and corresponding commercial kits, respectively. The results showed HiSMF significantly inhibited osteoclastic formation and resorption ability, and reduced cellular iron content during osteoclast differentiation. Mitochondrial concentration and oxidative stress levels in osteoclasts was decreased under HiSMF. Mechanistically, HiSMF markedly blocked the expression of osteoclast-associated transcription factors and osteoclast marker genes, and inhibited iron absorption and iron storage-related protein expression. These findings demonstrated that the effect of HiSMF on iron metabolism of osteoclasts was involved in the inhibition of HiSMF on osteoclast differentiation.This article is protected by copyright.

However, long-term dynamic changes of LDs and their relative activity remain unclear. Here, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe named 2-DPAN was prepared and employed to visualize dynamic processes of LDs in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD for the first time, and LDs' accumulation-peak/plateau-decrease were confirmed. We further found a close relationship between LDs and variation in mitochondrial activity. Strikingly, the progression of cell death was accelerated by lipase, whereas pre-stimulation of LDs by unsaturated fatty -oleic  decreased the death process by inhibiting excessive reactive  species (ROS) and fatty  production, thereby protecting mitochondria. The utilization of 2-DPAN demonstrates the importance of LDs in neuronal homeostasis, and effective tuning of LDs may prevent or inhibit PD progression.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Oxidative stress in cells arises from both external agents and endogenous processes that generate reactive species, either purposely (e.g. during pathogen killing or enzymatic reactions) or accidently (e.g. exposure to radiation, pollutants, drugs, or chemicals). As proteins are highly abundant and react rapidly with many oxidants, they are highly susceptible to, and major targets of, oxidative damage. This can result in changes to protein structure, function, and turnover and to loss or (occasional) gain of activity. Accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins, due to either increased generation or decreased removal, has been associated with both aging and multiple diseases. Different oxidants generate a broad, and sometimes characteristic, spectrum of post-translational modifications. The kinetics (rates) of damage formation also vary dramatically. There is a pressing need for reliable and robust methods that can detect, identify, and quantify the products formed on amino , peptides, and proteins, especially in complex systems. This review summarizes several advances in our understanding of this complex chemistry and highlights methods that are available to detect oxidative modifications-at the amino , peptide, or protein level-and their nature, quantity, and position within a peptide sequence. Although considerable progress has been made in the development and application of new techniques, it is clear that further development is required to fully assess the relative importance of protein oxidation and to determine whether an oxidation is a cause, or merely a consequence, of injurious processes.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659544>Phytotoxic and genotoxic effect of Aluminum to date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) in vitro cultures.</a></h1><p>Al is a common metallic element found in earth's crust and is a toxic pollutant present at high concentrations in acidic soil, thus affecting plant growth. Despite being well studied as a toxic element, the effects of Al on date palm have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the toxic effects of different Al concentrations on the development and growth of date palm callus and evaluate the biochemical and molecular response of date palm cells under Al stress.Our study revealed the phytotoxicity of Al concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l) on date palm callus. The fresh and dry weight and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino  were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino  in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive  species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression. These data showed that the tissue culture technique can be used as a valuable approach in heavy metal toxicity studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627065>Enhancement of pyruvic  production in Candida glabrata by engineering hypoxia-inducible factor 1.</a></h1><p>Dissolved  (DO) supply plays essential roles in microbial organic  production. Candida glabrata, as a dominant strain for producing pyruvic , principally converts glucose to pyruvic  through glycolysis. However, this process relies excessively on high extracellular DO content. In this study, in combination with specific motif analysis of gene promoters, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) was engineered to improve the transcription level of some enzymes related to pyruvic  synthesis under low DO level and directly led to increased pyruvic  production and glycolysis efficiency. Moreover, the intracellular stability of HIF1 was further optimized from different aspects to maximize pyruvic  accumulation. Finally, the pyruvic  titer in a 5-L batch bioreactor with 10% DO level reached 53.1 g/L. As pyruvic  is involved in the biosynthesis of various products, these findings suggest that HIF1-enabled regulation method has significant potential for increasing the synthesis of other chemicals in microorganisms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The occurrence and environmental control factors of lipophilic marine algal toxins (LMATs) in the surface seawater of the Changjiang estuary (CJE) and the adjacent East China Sea (ECS) were investigated. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), okadaic  (OA), dinophysistoxin-1(DTX1), and gymnodimine (GYM) were detected in the CJE surface seawater in summer, with concentration ranges of not detected (ND)-105.54 ng/L, ND-13.24 ng/L, ND-5.48 ng/L, and ND-12.95 ng/L, respectively. DTX1 (ND-316.15 ng/L), OA (ND-16.13 ng/L), and PTX2 (ND-4.97 ng/L) were detected in the ECS during spring. LMATs formed a unique low-concentration band in the Changjiang diluted water (CJDW) coverage area in the typical large river estuary. PTX2, OA, and DTX1 in seawater were mainly derived from  and , while GYM was suspected to be from . Correlation analyses showed that LMAT levels in seawater were positively correlated with dissolved  and salinity, but negatively correlated with temperature and nutrients, indicating that the hydrological condition and nutritional status of seawater and climatic factors exert significant effects on the distribution of LMATs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625253>A novel long-range n to π* interaction secures the smallest known α-helix in water.</a></h1><p>An amide bond linking side chains of the first and fifth amino  forms a cyclic pentapeptide that optimally stabilizes the smallest known alpha helix in water. The origin of stabilization is unclear. Dependence of alpha helicity on solvent and cyclization linker led us to discover a novel long-range n to p* interaction between a mainchain amide  and a uniquely positioned carbonyl group in the linker of cyclic pentapeptides. CD and NMR spectra, NMR and X-ray structures, modelling and MD simulations reveal this first example of a synthetically incorporated long-range n to p* CO…C=O interaction that uniquely enforces an almost perfect and remarkably stable peptide alpha helix in water, but not in DMSO. This unusual interaction with a covalent amide bond outside the helical backbone suggests new approaches to synthetically stabilize peptide structures in water.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, mature human sperm were in vitro exposed to different concentrations of PFOA (0.25, 2.5 or 25 μg/ml) alone or in combination with progesterone (P4) to evaluate the toxicity and the potential mechanism of action. Exposure to high-dose PFOA (25 μg/ml) alone for 4 h caused a decline in capacity of human spermatozoa to penetrate synthetic mucus, with an increased production of reactive  species (ROS). Furthermore, PFOA treatment (2.5 and 25 μg/ml) evoked a transient rise in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca] by activating the sperm-specific CatSper channel. However, preincubation with PFOA (2.5-25 μg/ml) for 4 h significantly suppressed P4-stimulated extracellular Ca influx in human spermatozoa. Moreover, PFOA pretreatment at all concentrations evaluated markedly compromised P4-induced acrosome reaction and sperm penetration into viscous medium. Taken together, these results suggest that PFOA exposure may impair human sperm function through inducing oxidative stress and disturbing P4-induced Ca signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Neurons contain high concentrations of polyamines, which are prone to various pathological states in the brain and are perturbed after cerebral ischemia. Acrolein, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been suggested as the primary culprit of neuronal damage in stroke patients. However, the mechanism by which acrolein induces neuronal damage during ischemic stroke is not clear.Urinary 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic  (3-HPMA), an acrolein-glutathione (GSH) metabolite, plasma acrolein-protein conjugates (Acr-PC) and plasma GSH levels were analyzed to correlate disease severity and prognosis of stroke patients compared with control subjects. In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal models and an in vitro  glucose deprivation (OGD) stroke model were used to investigate the mechanisms of acrolein-induced neuronal damage.A deregulated acrolein metabolism, including significantly increased plasma Acr-PC levels, decreased urinary 3-HPMA levels and decreased plasma GSH levels, was found in stroke patients compared to control subjects. We further observed that acrolein was produced during ischemia resulting in brain damage in in vivo MCAO animal model. The induction of acrolein in neuronal cells during OGD occurred due to the increased expression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) by NF-kB pathway activation. In addition, acrolein elicited a vicious cycling of oxidative stress resulting in neurotoxicity. Finally, N-acetylcysteine effectively prevented OGD-induced neurotoxicity by scavenging acrolein.Overall, our current results demonstrate that acrolein is a culprit of neuronal damage through GSH depletion in stroke patients. The mechanism underlying the role of acrolein in stroke-related neuronal damage occurs through SSAT-induced polyamine oxidation by NF-kB pathway activation. These results provide a novel mechanism of neurotoxicity in stroke patients, aid in the development of neutralizing or preventive measures, and further our understanding of neural protection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the structures of Pb-BHA complexes adsorbed on a mineral surface remain unclear. In this work, the adsorption behavior of Pb-BHA complexes on the scheelite surface was studied by flotation experiments and adsorption capacity measurements, and the structures of the adsorbed Pb-BHA complexes were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The adsorption capacity results showed that more BHA was adsorbed on the scheelite surface in Pb-BHA flotation, and the XPS and TOF-SIMS analysis showed that the species of Pb-BHA complexes adsorbed on the scheelite surface were similar in activation flotation and Pb-BHA flotation. Therefore, the different contents of the complexes on the scheelite surface were responsible for the flotation behavior. XPS and TOF-SIMS showed that BHA combined with lead ions to form complexes with different structures, such as five- and four-membered ring structures. Structure fragment inference based on the measurements indicated that lead ions formed monomer complexes with two BHAs, and that lead hydroxide polymers with a certain degree of polymerization bonded with  atoms in the complexes. The Pb-BHA complexes combine with  atoms on the scheelite surface to form an adsorbate, rendering the surface hydrophobic.Copyright © 2019 Wei, Sun, Hu, Han, Sun, Wang, Zhu, Li and Song.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676352>Antimicrobial peptides conjugated with fatty  on the side chain of D-amino  promises antimicrobial potency against multidrug-resistant bacteria.</a></h1><p>With the alarming burden of antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) seem to be novel antimicrobial alternatives for infection treatment due to their rapid broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and low tendency for bacterial resistance. To obtain promising AMPs, a series of new peptides were designed and synthesized by conjugating various lengths of fatty  chains onto the side chain of the position 4 or 7 D-amino  of Ano-D4,7 (analogue of anoplin with D-amino  substitutions at positions 4 and 7). The new peptides exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against a range of bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria in contrast to conventional antibiotics. Moreover, the new peptides conjugated with fatty  chains ranging from 8 to 12 carbons in length presented preferable antimicrobial selectivity and anti-biofilm activity. Additionally, the new peptides also exerted high stability to trypsin, serum, salts and different pH environments. Most notably, the new peptides showed a low tendency to develop bacterial resistance and they displayed optimal antimicrobial activity against the obtained resistant strains. Furthermore, the results from the outer/inner membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic membrane depolarization assays and flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that the new peptides exert antimicrobial effects by typical non-receptor-mediated membrane mechanisms, as well as intracellular targets characterized by gel retardation and reactive  species (ROS) generation assays. Furthermore, the new peptides presented remarkable in vivo antimicrobial potency, anti-inflammatory activity, and endotoxin neutralization. Collectively, the conjugation of fatty  to the side chains of D-amino  is a potential strategy for designing hopeful antimicrobial alternatives to tackle the risk of bacterial resistance.Copyright © 2019.

The goal of this study was to compare aspects of ROS metabolism in response to O variability (6 hr hypoxia or hyperoxia, with subsequent normoxic recovery) in two species of intertidal sculpin fishes (Cottidae, Actinopterygii) that can experience O fluctuations in their natural environment and differ in whole animal hypoxia tolerance. To assess ROS metabolism, we measured the ratio of glutathione and glutathione disulfide as an indicator of tissue redox environment, MitoP/MitoB ratio to assess  mitochondrial ROS generation, thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) for lipid peroxidation, and total oxidative scavenging capacity (TOSC) in the liver, brain, and gill. In the brain, the more hypoxia tolerant  showed large increases in TBARS levels following hypoxia and hyperoxia exposure that were generally not associated with large changes in mitochondrial HO In contrast, the less-tolerant  showed no significant changes in TBARS or mitochondrial HO in the brain. More moderate responses were observed in the liver and gill of  exposed to hypoxia and hyperoxia with normoxic recovery, whereas  showed more responses to O variability in these tissues. Our results show that the relationship between hypoxia tolerance and ROS metabolism is species and tissue specific.© 2019.

In order to determine the effect of the stability of a lanthanide complex on its affinity for anions, five different complexes featuring different bidentate chelating moieties were synthesized, and their affinity for anions in water at neutral pH were evaluated by longitudinal relaxometry measurements. The chelates comprise both  and nitrogen donors including maltol, 1,2-hydroxypyridinone, hydroxamic , pyridin-2-ylmethanol, and carbamoylmethylphosphonate diester. They were chosen to span a range of basicities all the while maintaining a similar tripodal tris-bidentate architecture, thereby allowing for a direct study of the role of the coordinating motif on the supramolecular recognition of anions by the corresponding Gd complex. Overall, for ligands containing the same number of protonation steps, and therefore the same charge at neutral pH, the lower the acidity of the chelate (higher ∑p's), the less stable the corresponding Gd complex, and the higher its affinity for anions. Regardless of the number of protonation steps, the more stable Gd complexes form ternary or quaternary assemblies with coordinating anions. In contrast, the same anions readily displace the chelate of the least stable complexes, resulting instead in the formation of Gd·anion precipitates. Irrespective of the chelate, in the absence of steric hindrance at the open coordination site, the affinity of Gd complexes for anions follows the order phosphate > arsenate > bicarbonate > fluoride. Hence, the selectivity and affinity of Gd complexes of tripodal tris-bidentate chelates for anions is a function of the stability of the Gd complex and the basicity of the anion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647212>Conformal Solution Deposition of Pt-Pd Titania Nanocomposite Coatings for Light-Assisted Formic  Electrooxidation.</a></h1><p>Many nanofabrication processes require sophisticated equipment, elevated temperature, vacuum or specific atmospheric conditions, templates, and exotic chemicals, which severely hampers their implementation in real-world applications. In this study, we outline a fully wet-chemical procedure for equipping a 3D carbon felt (CF) substrate with a multifunctional, titania nanospike supported Pt-Pd nanoparticle (Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF) layer in a facile and scalable manner. The nanostructure, composition, chemical speciation and formation of the material was meticulously investigated, evidencing the conformal coating of the substrate with a roughened layer of nanocrystalline rutile spikes by chemical bath deposition from Ti3+ solutions. The spikes are densely covered by bimetallic nanoparticles of 4.4 ± 1.1 nm size, which were produced by autocatalytic Pt deposition onto Pd seeds introduced by Sn2+ ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The as-synthesized nanocomposite was applied to the (photo)electrooxidation of formic  (FA), exhibiting a superior performance compared to Pt-plated, Pd-seeded CF (Pt-Pd@CF) and commercial Pt-C, indicating the promoting electrocatalytic role of the TiO2 support. Upon UV-Vis illumination, the performance of the Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF electrode is remarkably increased (22-fold), generating a current density of 110 mA cm-2, distinctly outperforming titania-free Pt-Pd@CF (5 mA cm-2) and commercial Pt-C (6 mA cm-2) reference catalysts. In addition, the Pt-Pd-TiO2@CF showed a much better stability, characterized by a very high poisoning tolerance for in-situ generated CO intermediates, whose formation is hindered in the presence of TiO2. This overall performance boost is attributed to a dual enhancement mechanism (~30% electrocatalytic, ~70% photoelectrocatalytic). The photo-generated electrons from the TiO2 conduction band enrich the electron density of the Pt nanoparticles, promoting the generation of active  species on their surfaces from adsorbed  and water molecules, which facilitate the direct FA electrooxidation into CO2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680956>-Inositol and Its Derivatives: Their Emerging Role in the Treatment of Human Diseases.</a></h1><p>-inositol has been established as an important growth-promoting factor of mammalian cells and animals. The role of -inositol as a lipotropic factor has been proven, in addition to its involvement as co-factors of enzymes and as messenger molecules in signal transduction. -inositol deficiency leads to intestinal lipodystrophy in animals and "inositol-less death" in some fungi. Of late, diverse uses of -inositol and its derivatives have been discovered in medicinal research. These compounds are used in the treatment of a variety of ailments from diabetes to cancer, and continued research in this direction promises a new future in therapeutics. In different diseases, inositols implement different strategies for therapeutic actions such as tissue specific increase or decrease in inositol products, production of inositol phosphoglycans (IPGs), conversion of -inositol (MI) to D--inositol (DCI), modulation of signal transduction, regulation of reactive  species (ROS) production, etc. Though inositol pharmacology is a relatively lesser-known field, recent years of research has generated a critical mass of information on the subject.

In this study, we used hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced injury in human hepatic L02 cells to investigate the mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of γ-oryzanol. The injuries produced by HO in L02 cells include increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive  species (ROS), decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased protein expressions of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with γ-oryzanol enhanced the ROS scavenging activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased lipid peroxidation in HO treated cells. Moreover, pretreatment with γ-oryzanol inhibited HO-induced apoptosis by restoring MMP, upregulating the expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings show that γ-oryzanol can prevent HO-induced apoptosis by suppressing intracellular accumulation of ROS and impeding ROS-activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Due to the high graphitic degree and built-in few-layer nanotubes, the as-synthesized carbonaceous materials possess a higher catalytic ozonation activity than that of the state-of-the-art carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and LaMnO perovskite catalysts for the destruction of different aqueous contaminants. For recalcitrant oxalic  removal, 50 mg L oxalic  was completely degraded in 20 min. Compared with other nanocarbons, the as-synthesized materials also demonstrated robust structural stability and reusability. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and selective radical quenching tests revealed that the destruction of the aqueous organics predominantly relied on surface-adsorbed complexes (O* and O*) from activated ozone molecules. Owing to the occurrence of this surface oxidation pathway, the compatibility of the CPGs/O system was significantly enhanced for treatment of real wastewater, where the inorganic anions and organic natural organic matter would inhibit radical oxidation as radical scavengers. Furthermore, by employing organics with different ionization potentials (IPs) as the target pollutants, the CPGs/O system was discovered to obtain a high oxidation potential.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Inflammatory is considered driving the progression of AKI. Salvianolic  A (SA), one of the major ingredients of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, displays plenty of biological effects. Herein, the effect of SA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI in mice and further related mechanism in inflammatory cells were explored. In vivo experiments demonstrated that SA significantly ameliorated LPS-challenged AKI by preventing glomerulus atrophy and decreasing plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Meanwhile, SA significantly decreased the release of serum inflammatory cytokines and blocked macrophage infiltration in damaged renal tissue. In in vitro studies, SA significantly decreased TNF-α and IL-6 release levels and altered the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in LPS-stimulated macrophages, which were consistent with the results from in vivo experiments. Furthermore, SA that bound to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) was able to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive  species (ROS) generation in response to LPS stimulation. All silence of TLR4 gene, ROS scavenger and Ca chelator decreased inflammatory cytokines releases. Taken together, SA could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing AKI by suppressing inflammatory responses.Copyright © 2019.

The animals were exposed to Cd (5 mg/kg) and Ni (150 μg/L in drinking water) singly or co-exposed to both metals and ω-3FA at 20 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Results showed that hepatorenal injury resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was not aggravated in the co-exposure group. Moreover, ω-3FA markedly abrogated the reduction in the antioxidant enzyme activities, the increase in reactive  and nitrogen species, and lipid peroxidation induced by Cd and Ni co-exposure. Additionally, ω-3FA administration markedly suppressed the increase in hepatic and renal myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 β levels in the co-exposure group. Genotoxicity resulting from individual exposure to Cd or Ni was intensified in the co-exposure group. However, ω-3FA administration markedly ameliorated the genotoxicity and histological lesions in the co-exposure group.

Recent nucleic  analyses indicate that Trichodesmium colonies with their diverse epibionts support various nitrogen (N) transformations beyond N fixation. However, rates of these transformations and concentration gradients of N compounds in Trichodesmium colonies remain largely unresolved. We combined isotope-tracer incubations, micro-profiling and numeric modelling to explore carbon fixation, N cycling processes as well as , ammonium and nitrate concentration gradients in individual field-sampled Trichodesmium colonies. Colonies were net-autotrophic, with carbon and N fixation occurring mostly during the day. Ten percent of the fixed N was released as ammonium after 12-h incubations. Nitrification was not detectable but nitrate consumption was high when nitrate was added. The consumed nitrate was partly reduced to ammonium, while denitrification was insignificant. Thus, the potential N transformation network was characterised by fixed N gain and recycling processes rather than denitrification.  concentrations within colonies were ~60-200% air-saturation. Moreover, our modelling predicted steep concentration gradients, with up to 6-fold higher ammonium concentrations, and nitrate depletion in the colony centre compared to the ambient seawater. These gradients created a chemically heterogeneous microenvironment, presumably facilitating diverse microbial metabolisms in millimetre-sized Trichodesmium colonies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645375>Cardiac mitochondrial function, nitric oxide sensitivity and lipid composition following hypoxia acclimation in sablefish.</a></h1><p>In fishes, the effect of O limitation on cardiac mitochondrial function remains largely unexplored. The sablefish ) encounters considerable variations in environmental  availability, and is an interesting model for studying the effects of hypoxia on fish cardiorespiratory function. We investigated how  hypoxic acclimation (6 months at 40%+3 weeks at 20% air saturation) and  anoxia-reoxygenation affected sablefish cardiac mitochondrial respiration and reactive  species (ROS) release rates using high-resolution fluorespirometry. Further, we investigated how hypoxic acclimation affected the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to nitric oxide (NO), and compared mitochondrial lipid and fatty  (FA) composition between groups. Hypoxic acclimation did not alter mitochondrial coupled or uncoupled respiration, or respiratory control ratio, ROS release rates, P or superoxide dismutase activity. However, it increased citrate synthase activity (by∼20%), increased the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to NO inhibition [i.e., the NO IC was 25% lower], and enhanced the recovery of respiration (by 21%) and reduced ROS release rates (by 25-30%) post-anoxia. Further, hypoxic acclimation altered the mitochondria's FA composition [increasing arachidonic  (20:4ω6) and eicosapentaenoic  (20:5ω3) proportions by 11 and 14%, respectively], and SIMPER analysis revealed that the phospholipid: sterol ratio was the largest contributor (24%) to the dissimilarity between treatments. Overall, these results suggest that hypoxic acclimation may protect sablefish cardiac bioenergetic function during or after periods of O limitation, and that this may be related to alterations in the mitochondria's sensitivity to NO and to adaptive changes in membrane composition (fluidity).© 2019.

Aβ42O also regulate the proliferative and differentiative properties of stem cells.We aimed to study whether Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage is involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation.Human iPSCs-derived neural stem cell (NSC) was applied to investigate the effect of Aβ42O on reactive  species (ROS) production and DNA damage using mitoSOX staining and long-range PCR lesion assay, respectively. mtDNA repair activity was measured by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in vitro assay using mitochondria isolates and the expression and localization of NHEJ components were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. The expressions of Tuj-1 and GFAP, detected by immunofluorescence and qPCR, respectively, were examined as an index of neurons and astrocytes production.We show that in NSC Aβ42O treatment induces ROS production and mtDNA damage and impairs DNA end joining activity. NHEJ components, such as Ku70/80, DNA- PKcs, and XRCC4, are localized in mitochondria and silencing of XRCC4 significantly exacerbates the effect of Aβ42O on mtDNA integrity. On the contrary, pre-treatment with Phytic  (IP6), which specifically stimulates DNA-PK-dependent end-joining, inhibits Aβ42O-induced mtDNA damage and neuronal differentiation alteration.Aβ42O-induced mtDNA repair impairment may change cell fate thus shifting human NSC differentiation toward an astrocytic lineage.

HA is widely used in agriculture but is known to have therapeutic properties, which are still poorly explored. Previous studies have shown the potential of biotechnological processes in the production of HA in submerged fermentation (SF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) using pre-treated fibers of oil palm of empty fruit bunch (EFB) for the cultivation of  strains.

Results showed efficient HA production in the raw fibers of the EFBs. HA production followed the cellular protein (6 g HA per 100 g of fibers) evolution of the fermentations in the absence of lipids, while the composition of lipids greatly affected its production. The best HA production (350 mg HA per 100 g of fibers) was obtained from EFB that was richer in lignocellulosics and the residual lipids were similar to the fractions of palm and kernel oils, while EFB with lower lignocellulosic presented a production 110 mg HA per 100 g of fibers.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676393>Are the beneficial effects of 'antioxidant' lipoic  mediated through metabolism of reactive sulfur species?</a></h1><p>The health benefits of lipoic  (LA) are generally attributed to mitigating the harmful effects of reactive  species (ROS). ROS are chemically similar to reactive sulfur species (RSS) and signal through identical mechanisms. Here we examined the effects of LA on RSS in HEK293 cells using HS and polysulfide (PS) specific fluorophores, AzMC and SSP4. We show that LA concentration-dependently increased both HS and PS. Physioxia (5% O) augmented the effects of LA on HS production but decreased PS production. Thiosulfate, a known substrate for reduced LA, and an intermediate in the catabolism of HS enhanced the effects of LA on HS and PS production. Inhibiting peroxiredoxins with conoidin A and gluraredoxins with tiopronin augmented the effects of LA on PS and HS, respectively while decreasing glutathione with buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) or diethyl maleate (DEM) decreased the stimulatory effect of LA on HS production but augmented LA's effect on PS. Aminooxyacetate (AOA) and propargylglycine (PPG), inhibitors of HS production from cysteine partially inhibited LA augmentation of HS production and further decreased the LA effect when applied concurrently with BSO and DEM. The selective and cell-permeable HS scavenger, SS20, inhibited the effects of LA on cellular HS. Estimates of single-cell HS production suggest that 0.1-0.2% of O consumption is used to metabolize HS and these requirements may increase to 1-2% with 1 mM LA. Collectively, these results suggest that LA rescues HS from irreversible oxidation and that the effects of LA on RSS directly confer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective responses. They also suggest that TS may be an effective supplement to increase the efficacy of LA in clinical settings.Copyright © 2019.

IA was produced in batch system by systematically varying the  content of the aeration gas (from 21 to 31.5 vol% O) and the stirring rate (from 150 to 600 rpm). The data were analyzed kinetically to characterize the behavior of the process, and besides, the performances were evaluated comparatively with the literature. It turned out that the operation of the bioreactor with either the higher inlet O concentration (31.5 vol% O) or faster stirring (600 rpm) could enhance biological IA generation the most, resulting in yield and volumetric productivity of 0.31 g IA/g glucose and 0.32 g IA/g glucose and 3.15 g IA/L day and 4.26 g IA/L day, respectively. Overall, the significance of fermentation settings was shown in this work regarding IA production catalyzed by A. terreus and notable advances could be realized by adjusting the aeration and stirring towards an optimal combination.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676437>The lipoxygenase pathway of Tupaia belangeri representing Scandentia. Genomic multiplicity and functional characterization of the ALOX15 orthologs in the tree shrew.</a></h1><p>The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a rat-sized mammal, which is more closely related to humans than mice and rats. However, the use of tree shrew to explore the patho-mechanisms of human inflammatory disorders has been limited since nothing is known about eicosanoid metabolism in this mammalian species. Eicosanoids are important lipid mediators exhibiting pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, which are biosynthesized via lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. When we searched the tree shrew genome for the presence of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase isoforms we found copies of functional COX1, COX2 and LOX genes. Interestingly, we identified four copies of ALOX15 genes, which encode for four structurally distinct ALOX15 orthologs (tupALOX15a-d). To explore the catalytic properties of these enzymes we expressed tupALOX15a and tupALOX15c as catalytically active proteins and characterized their enzymatic properties. As predicted by the Evolutionary Hypothesis of ALOX15 specificity we found that the two enzymes converted arachidonic  predominantly to 12S-HETE and they also exhibited membrane oxygenase activities. However, their reaction kinetic properties (K for arachidonic  and , T- and pH-dependence) and their substrate specificities were remarkably different. In contrast to mice and humans, tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms are highly expressed in the brain suggesting a role of these enzymes in cerebral function. The genomic multiplicity and the tissue expression patterns of tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms need to be considered when the results of in vivo inflammation studies obtained in this animal are translated into the human situation.Copyright © 2019.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate liver diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic  (PA)-induced hepatic insulin resistance model in vitro.Insulin resistance in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive  species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic insulin resistance via preserving insulin signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Meanwhile, benzoic  functionalized graphene (BFG) was synthetized as a synergist. A "four-source flame-retardant system" (KC-IFR/BFG) was constructed with KC-IFR and BFG. KC-IFR/BFG was blended with waterborne epoxy resin (EP) to prepare flame-retardant coatings. The effects of different ratios of KC-IFR and BFG on the flame-retardant properties of EP were investigated. The results showed that the limiting  index (LOI) values increased from 19.7% for the waterborne epoxy resin to 28.7% for the EP1 with 20 wt% KC-IFR. The addition of BFG further improved the LOI values of the composites. The LOI value reached 29.8% for the EP5 sample with 18 wt% KC-IFR and 2 wt% BFG and meanwhile, UL-94 test reached the V-0 level. In addition, the peak heat release (pHRR) and smoke release rate (SPR) of EP5 decreased by 63.5% and 65.4% comparing with EP0, respectively.

Ghrelin stimulates food intake and increases gastric movement. In rat model, injected β‑hydroxybutyric  (β‑HB) leads to a decrease in body weight. It has been reported that patients with gastric erosions are slower to evacuate the stomach. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ghrelin and β‑HB on motility and inflammation in rat gastric antral smooth muscle cells (GASMCs). GASMCs were extracted from rat gastric antrum. Cell viability was determined using the Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. A reactive  species (ROS) assay kit was used to analyze the levels of ROS using flow cytometry. Protein levels were determined using western blotting, and the expression levels of mRNAs were evaluated using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. β‑HB inhibited the expression of myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9 (MYL9), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), transforming protein RhoA (RhoA), Rho‑associated protein kinase‑1 (ROCK‑1) and growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS‑R). By contrast, ghrelin increased the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA, ROCK‑1 and GHS‑R in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. β‑HB increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑6 and ROS, and decreased the levels of manganese (Mn) superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper/zinc (Cu/Zn)SOD and catalase. Ghrelin decreased the expression of TNF‑α, IL‑6, ROS and catalase, whereas ghrelin promoted the expression of MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD in β‑HB‑treated GASMCs. Short interfering RNA targeting GHS‑R inhibited the expression of MYL9, MLCK, RhoA and ROCK‑1, and increased the levels of TNF‑α, IL‑6 and ROS in β‑HB‑treated or ghrelin‑treated GASMCs. The present study provided preliminary evidence that β‑HB inhibits the motility of GASMCs and promotes inflammation in GASMCs, whereas ghrelin decreases these effects. GHS‑R acted as a primary regulator of motility and inflammation in GASMCs treated with β‑HB and ghrelin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657228>Nitric Oxide-Dependent Protein Posttranslational Modifications Impair Mitochondrial Function and Metabolism to Contribute to Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h1><p>Most brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases manifest mitochondrial dysfunction as well as elevated production of reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to synapse loss and neuronal injury.

The major prenylated phenolic compound in BPG is (E)-artepillin C, along with its precursor (E)-p-coumaric , both contributing to the biological effects of BGP. Taking that into account, it was evaluated the effect of light, temperature and air  in their content to establish the best storage and transport conditions for crude BGP and the pure compounds. For that, (E)-artepillin C and (E)-p-coumaric  were initially submitted to degradation for five days under sunlight and high temperature (50 °C), furnishing three major (E)-Artepillin C isomers and one from (E)-p-coumaric . Then, it was developed and validated a Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for quantifying these compounds in crude BGP and in its extracts. In the stability studies, it was used a Full Factorial and Central Composite Design to establish the desirable storage conditions. (E)-Artepillin C, both pure and in BGP should be kept protected from light and storage below -2.5 °C. (E)-p-Coumaric  can be stored at room temperature. Therefore, the best storage and transport conditions to keep the content of both compounds in BGP are protection from light at low temperatures.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, 120 sows were divided into six groups based on backfat thickness (≤16, 17-18, 19-20, 21-22, 23-24, and ≥25 mm) in late gestation. The placental lipids, reactive  species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels, inflammatory-related cytokine and angiogenesis were determined. The concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and free fatty  (FFA) linearly increased ( < 0.05) associated with increased late gestation backfat. ROS and MDA increased and TAC decreased ( < 0.05) as the backfat thickness increased. The mRNA expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, TLR4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 increased with increased backfat in late gestation. There were no differences in IL-8 and IL-10 mRNA expression among sows with different backfat thickness. Placental vessel density initially increased and then decreased with increasing backfat thickness of sows. Similarly, the mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also increased and then decreased.

However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for  consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour metabolism from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour metabolism to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these metabolic alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626374>Electrolyte effects on the electrocatalytic performance of iridium-based nanoparticles for  evolution in rotating disc electrodes.</a></h1><p>Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers are very promising renewable energy conversion devices that produce hydrogen from sustainable feedstocks. These devices are mainly limited by the sluggish kinetics of the  evolution reaction (OER). Ir-based nanoparticles are both reasonably active and stable for the OER in acidic media. The electrolyte composition and the pH may play a crucial role in electrocatalysis, yet they have been widely overlooked for the OER. Herein, we present a study on the effects of the composition and concentration of the electrolyte on commercial Ir black nanoparticles using concentrations of 0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.5 M of both sulphuric and perchloric . The results show an important effect of the electrolyte composition on the catalytic performance of the Ir nanoparticles. The concentration of H 2 SO 4 interferes on the oxidation of Ir and decreases the catalytic performance of the catalyst. HClO 4 does not show strong interferences in the electrochemistry of Ir.

The structure has been confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. There are two pyridyl-N and one hydrazino-imine-N donor centers in , where two pyridyl-Ns bind simultaneously to two Zn(II) to serve as a bridging agent to form a coordination polymer. The 1,4-benzene dicarboxylato () is ligated via the aromatic dicarboxylato-O to form a one-dimensional (1D) chain. These two 1D chains about Zn(II) constitute a two-dimensional structure, which undergoes noncovalent interactions (C-H···π and π···π) to generate a three-dimensional supramolecular assembly. Electrical conductivity of  is higher by 1 order (1.37 × 10 S/cm) than that of the free ligand,  (6.2 × 10 S/cm). Especially, the responsivity of the compound  was 56.21 mA/W, which is 11 times higher than that of the ligand  (5.12 mA/W).

Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of  demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino  concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino  nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced  competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed. Samples exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity through clinorotation behaved similarly to the static controls. Overall, nitrate production from urea was successfully demonstrated with synthetic microbial communities under terrestrial and simulated space gravity conditions, corroborating the application of this process in space.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680945>Salsolinol Attenuates Doxorubicin-Induced Chronic Heart Failure in Rats and Improves Mitochondrial Function in H9c2 Cardiomyocytes.</a></h1><p> Salsolinol (SAL), a plant-based isoquinoline alkaloid, was initially isolated from Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (ALRP) and identified as the active cardiotonic component of ALRP. This study was aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism by which SAL attenuates doxorubicin (DOX)-induced chronic heart failure (CHF) in rats and improves mitochondrial function in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.  Rats were intraperitoneally injected with DOX to establish CHF model. Therapeutic effects of SAL on hemodynamic parameters, serum indices, and the histopathology of the heart were analyzed . Moreover, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with SAL for 2 h before DOX treatment in all procedures . Cell viability, cardiomyocyte morphology, proliferation, and mitochondrial function were detected by a high-content screening (HCS) assay. In addition, a Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XFp) analyzer was used to evaluate the cell energy respiratory and energy metabolism function. To further investigate the potential mechanism of SAL, relative mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes in the tricarboxylic  cycle  and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) signaling pathway-related molecules  were detected.  The present data demonstrated the pharmacological effect of SAL on DOX-induced CHF, which was through ameliorating heart function, downregulating serum levels of myocardial injury markers, alleviating histological injury to the heart, increasing the relative mRNA expression levels of key enzymes downstream of the tricarboxylic  cycle , and thus enhancing myocardial energy metabolism. In addition, SAL had effects on increasing cell viability, ameliorating DOX-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and increasing mitochondrial  consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in H9c2 cardiomyocyte. Moreover, we found that SAL might have an effect on improving mitochondrial respiratory function and energy metabolism  inhibiting excessive activation of MCU pathway in H9c2 cells. However, the protective effect could be ameliorated by ruthenium red (an MCU inhibitor) and abrogated by spermine (an MCU activator) .  The therapeutic effects of SAL on CHF are possibly related to ameliorating cardiomyocyte function resulting in promotion of mitochondrial respiratory and energy metabolism. Furthermore, the potential mechanism might be related to downregulating MCU pathway. These findings may provide a potential therapy for CHF.Copyright © 2019 Wen, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Li, Yang, Wang, Cai, Li and Zhao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642580>A Versatile 3D and 4D Printing System through Photocontrolled RAFT Polymerization.</a></h1><p>Reversible-addition fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a valuable tool for synthesizing macromolecules with controlled topologies and diverse chemical functionalities. However, the application of RAFT polymerization to additive-manufacturing processes has been prevented due to the slow polymerization rates of typical systems. In this work, we developed a rapid visible light mediated RAFT polymerization process and applied it to a 3D printing system. The photosensitive resins contained a metal-free dye (erythrosin B) in conjunction with a tertiary amine co-catalyst (triethanolamine) and a trithiocarbonate RAFT agent (2-(butylthiocarbonothioylthio) propanoic ) to afford polymerization without prior deoxygenation. The reaction components are non-toxic, metal free and environmentally friendly (water based photosensitive resin), which tailors these systems toward the fabrication of biomaterials. Following optimization of the resin formulation by varying the ratio of photocatalyst and tertiary amine, a variety of 3D printing conditions were investigated to prepare functional materials using green light ( λ max = 525 nm, I 0 = 0.32 mW/cm 2 ). Furthermore, the mechanical properties of these 3D printed materials were tested under different conditions. Interestingly, the concentration of trithiocarbonate impacts the mechanical properties and the performance of these materials. Remarkably, the use of a photoinduced polymerization process provided facile spatial control over the network structure by varying the light dose to each layer of the 3D printed material; using this strategy, a 4D printing process was demonstrated via 3D printing and subsequent swelling and dehydration induced actuation. Furthermore, the trithiocarbonate species incorporated in the polymer networks were able to be reactivated after the initial 3D printing process, which enabled post functionalization of the printed materials via secondary photopolymerization processes.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, it is not clear what would happen when the nitrogen hydrogen of BHA was substituted with methyl and other alkyl groups. Here we show that N-methyl benzohydroxamic  (N-MeBHA, a simple model compound for the classic iron-chelator deferoxamine, which is a typical N-alkyl trihydroxamic ) could react with 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) to form a relatively stable initial carbon- bonding conjugation intermediate CBQ-O-N-MeBHA. However, the major final product was identified, unexpectedly, as a carbon-nitrogen bonding conjugate CBQ(OH)-N(CH)-COAr, which is the rearranged isomer of CBQ-O-N-MeBHA. Interestingly, a new 18-line nitrogen-centered radical and a carbon-centered quinone ketoxy radical were observed by the ESR spin-trapping method, which was further confirmed by HPLC-MS and N-isotope labeling methods. We further found that both new DNA adducts and DNA strand breaks could be produced by the reactive nitrogen-centered radical. Taken together, we propose that the reaction between DCBQ and N-MeBHA was not via the Lossen rearrangement, but rather through a novel radical homolysis and recoupling pathway. Analogous results were observed for other chlorinated quinones and N-alkyl hydroxamic  including the widely-used trihydroxamate iron-chelating drug deferoxamine. This represents the first report of unexpected radical pathway for the reaction between chlorinated quinones and N-alkyl hydroxamic  under normal physiological conditions, which may have broad biological and environmental significance for future study of carcinogenic chloroquinones and hydroxamic  drugs.Copyright © 2019.

However, it is not clear whether the magnitude of the vasomotor responses depends of the vessel network exposed to IH. To test the hypothesis that the magnitude of IH-induced reduction in peripheral blood flow may differ from the hypoperfusion response observed in the cerebral vascular network under -enriched conditions, nine healthy men (25±3 years) underwent 10 min of IH during either saline or vitamin C (3g) infusion, separately. Femoral artery (FA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) blood flow (BF, Doppler ultrasound), as well as arterial oxidant (8-isoprostane), antioxidant (ascorbic , AA) and NO bioavailability (nitrite) markers were simultaneously measured. IH increased 8-isoprostane and reduced nitrite; these responses were followed by a reduction in both FABF and ICABF, whereas VABF did not change. Absolute and relative reductions in FABF were greater than IH-induced changes in ICA and VA perfusion. Vitamin C infusion increased the arterial AA, abolished IH-induced increase in 8-isoprostane and the reduction in nitrite levels. While ICA and VA blood flow did not change during the Vitamin C-IH trial, FA perfusion increased and reached similar levels to that observed during normoxia with saline infusion. Therefore, the magnitude of IH-induced reduction in femoral blood flow is greater than that observed in the vessel network of the brain, which might involve the determinant contribution that NO has in the regulation of peripheral vascular perfusion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628200>Targeting the kynurenine pathway for the treatment of cisplatin resistant lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Cisplatin resistance is a major barrier in the effective treatment of lung cancer. Cisplatin resistant (CR) lung cancer cells do not primarily use glucose, but rather consume amino  such as glutamine and tryptophan (TRP) for survival. CR cells activate the kynurenine (KYN) pathway (KP) to cope with excessive reactive  species (ROS) and maintain homeostasis for growth and proliferation. Consequently, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) becomes an essential enzyme for CR cells' survival since it initiates and regulates the first step in the KP. Increased IDO1 activities and ROS levels are found in CR cells vs. cisplatin sensitive lung cancer. Importantly, significantly greater KYN/TRP ratio (p=0.005) is detected in serum of patients who fail cisplatin when compared to naive treatment. Knocking down IDO1 using shRNA or IDO1 inhibitors heightens ROS levels and results in a significant growth inhibitory effect only on CR cells and not cisplatin sensitive cells. Exposing CR cells to antioxidant (TIRON) results in suppression of IDO1 activity and confers resistance to IDO1 inhibition, indicating an interrelationship between ROS and IDO1. Since KYN plays a critical role in reprogramming naïve T-cells to the immune suppressive regulatory T-cell (T-reg) phenotype, we observed higher expression of T-reg (TGFβ, FoxP3 and CD4+CD25+) in mice bearing CR tumors compared to tumors from cisplatin sensitive counterparts. Implications: Findings suggest that the enzyme inhibitory activity and anti-tumor efficacy of IDO1 inhibitors rely in part on ROS levels, arguing that IDO1 expression alone may be insufficient to determine the clinical benefits for this class of experimental cancer drugs. Importantly, IDO1 inhibitors maybe more suitable to treat lung cancer patients who failed cisplatin therapy than naïve treatment patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656084>Ascorbic  2-glucoside stably promotes the primitiveness of embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells through TET- and CREB1-dependent mechanisms.</a></h1><p>The naïve or primitive states of stem-cells (SCs) residing in specific niches are unstable and difficult to preserve in vitro.

We found that a VitC derivative, ascorbic  2-glucoside (AA2G), stably maintains the naïve pluripotency of murine embryonic-SCs (mESCs) and the primitiveness of human mesenchymal-SCs (hMSCs) without cellular toxicity.The beneficial effects of AA2G and related molecular mechanisms were evaluated in mESCs, induced pluripotent SCs (iPSCs), and hMSCs. AA2G was stable in aqueous solution and barely induced cellular toxicity in cultured SCs, unlike VitC. AA2G supplementation recapitulated the well-known effects of VitC, including induction of ten-eleven translocation (TET)-dependent DNA demethylation in mESCs and suppression of p53 during generation of murine iPSCs. Furthermore, supplementation of hMSCs with AA2G improved therapeutic outcomes in an asthma mouse model by promoting their self-renewal, engraftment, and anti-inflammatory properties. Particularly, activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-1 (CREB1) pathway contributed to the ability of AA2G to maintain naïve pluripotency of mESCs and functionality of hMSCs. Innovation and Conclusion: Given its long-lasting effects and low cellular toxicity, AA2G supplementation is useful to support the naïve pluripotency of mESCs and the primitiveness of hMSCs, which affects their developmental potency and therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the significance of the CREB1 pathway in the mechanism of action of AA2G.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664750>Unconventional Route to  Vacancies-Enabled Highly Efficient Electron Extraction and Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells.</a></h1><p>The ability to effectively transfer photoexcited electrons and holes represents an important endeavor toward achieving high-efficiency solar energy conversion. Herein, we develop a simple yet robust -treatment strategy to judiciously create an amorphous TiO 2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO 2 surface as electron transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile  treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO 2 , thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO 2 surface. Such amorphous TiO 2 -coated ETL possesses an increased electron density due to the presence of  vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO 2 . Compared to pristine TiO 2 -based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with -treated TiO 2 ETL exhibit enhanced short circuit current and power conversion efficiency. These findings demonstrate an unconventional route to crafting effective ETLs by deliberately creating an intimate, tailored amorphous semiconductor buffer layer for high-performance PSCs. This study may provide insights into the importance of rational design of efficient electron transporting layers in PSCs.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the presence of 0.4 g/g TSS APG, the concentrations of soluble chemical  demand (SCOD), soluble carbohydrate and soluble protein in dissolved organic matters (DOM) were 0.4, 2.4 and 1.3 times of that without APG addition, respectively. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the addition of APG led to the increase of soluble microbial materials and the decrease of fulvic -like substances in DOM, which was beneficial for the subsequent process of anaerobic digestion. Using APG promoted the releasing of enzymes trapped in saline waste sludge and improved the activity of enzymes during hydrolysis. The activities of α-glucosidase and protease increased by 8.8% and 21.3% respectively in the presence of 0.4 g/g TSS APG comparing no APG addition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

SA treatment caused apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 cells, but not in SW480 cells, with mitochondria playing a key role. We checked for dysfunctional mitochondria after SA treatment. Mitochondria of HT29 cells were swollen, indicating damage, whereas in HCT116 cells, several mitochondria had a diminished size. Damaged mitochondria decreased ATP production and induced reactive  species (ROS) in the cells. To understand SA-induced reduction in ATP production, we investigated the electron transfer chains (ETC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity, which prevents the transfer of acetyl-CoA to the TCA (tricarboxylic ) cycle by inhibiting PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) activity. In each cell line, the inhibitory mechanism of ATP by SA was different. The activity of complex III consisting of the mitochondrial ETCs in HT29 cells was decreased. In contrast, PDH activity in HCT116 cells was reduced. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)-removing reactive  species (ROS) was upregulated in HT29 cells, but not in HCT116 cells, indicating that in HT29 cells, a defense mechanism was activated against ROS. Collectively, our study showed a differential mechanism occurs in response to SA in colon cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624823>Single mutation in a novel bacterial LOV protein yields a singlet  generator.</a></h1><p>Mr4511 from Methylobacterium radiotolerans is a 164 amino  protein built of a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binding, blue-light responsive LOV (Light, , Voltage) core domain plus flanking regions. In contrast to the majority of LOV domains, Mr4511 lacks a tryptophan residue that was previously identified as a major quencher for the FMN triplet state in photosensitizers for singlet  (SO) engineered from these photoreceptors. Here we show that for Mr4511 it is sufficient to only mutate the reactive cysteine responsible for the photocycle (Cys71) in the native protein to generate an efficient SO photosensitizer: both C71S and C71G variants exhibit SO quantum yields of formation, ΦΔ, around 0.2 in air-saturated solutions. Under  saturated conditions, ΦΔ reaches ∼0.5 in deuterated buffer. The introduction of Trp112 in the canonical position for LOV domains dramatically lowers ΦΔ to values comparable to miniSOG, one of the early FMN binding proteins touted as a SO sensitizer. Besides its SO properties, Mr4511 is also exceedingly robust against denaturation with urea and is more photostable than free FMN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621967>Fructose metabolism as a common evolutionary pathway of survival associated with climate change, food shortage and droughts.</a></h1><p>Mass extinctions occur frequently in natural history. While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in  availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to glycolysis, fructose reduced  demands to aid survival in situations where  availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric . Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671836>Metabolomic Dynamics Reveals Oxidative Stress in Spongy Tissue Disorder During Ripening of  L. Fruit.</a></h1><p>Spongy tissue disorder, a mesocarp specific malady, severely affects the flavor and pulp characters of Alphonso mango fruit reducing its consumer acceptability. Here, we investigated comparative metabolomic changes that occur during ripening in healthy and spongy tissue-affected fruits using high resolution mass spectrometric analysis. During the spongy tissue formation, 46 metabolites were identified to be differentially accumulated. These putative metabolites belong to various primary and secondary metabolic pathways potentially involved in maintaining the quality of the fruit. Analysis revealed metabolic variations in tricarboxylic  cycle and gamma amino butyric  shunt generating reactive  species, which causes stressed conditions inside the mesocarp. Further, reduced levels of antioxidants and enzymes dissipating reactive  species in mesocarp deteriorate the fruit physiology. This oxidative stress all along affects the level of amino , sugars and enzymes responsible for flavor generation in the fruit.

This model reproduces a similar situation to MS, as well as its relationship with intestinal microbiota starting from the changes in bacterial lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) in the outer wall of the gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the administration of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytirosol (HT), and oleic  (OA) exert beneficial effects. Twenty-five Dark Agouti two-month-old male rats, weighing around 190 g, were distributed into the following groups: Control, EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis group), EAE + EVOO, EAE + HT, and EAE + OA. The glutathione redox system with the EAE was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and small and large intestines. The LPS and the correlation with oxidative stress in the small and large intestines were also investigated. The results showed that (1) the oxidative damage in the EAE model affects non-nervous organs and tissues; (2) The LPS is related to inflammatory phenomena and oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue and in other organs; (3) The administration of EVOO, HT, and OA reduces the LPS levels at the same time as minimizing the oxidative damage; (4) EVOO, HT, and OA improve the disease's clinical score; and (5) on balance, EVOO offers a better neuroprotective effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651674>Factors Associated with Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation and Re-Ventilation in Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury Patients.</a></h1><p>Patients who had suffered from acute blunt cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) and admitted our hospital within 24 hours after injury were included in the study.We compared the respiratory function and serum reactive oxidative stress (ROS) after acute cervical SCI, and tried to find out the valuable predictors of weaning in acute cervical SCI patients.Ventilation impairment is a major complication of acute cervical SCI. Evidence of  radical formation in secondary injury from animal SCI models demonstrates an immediate post-injury increase in ROS production after SCI. We hypothesis the serum ROS is associated with the severity of patients with acute cervical SCI.38 adult patients who had acute cervical SCI and 58 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Respiratory function at admission, at the time of extubation and at 48 hours after extubation, serum oxidative stress, Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score at admission were compared.The most notable predictor of mechanical ventilator > 48 hours was serum thiobarbituric -reactive substances (TBARS) level at admission (p = 0.027), and the cut-off value of serum TBARS level was 731.7 μmol/L (sensitivity 87.5% and specificity 78.9%). For the re-ventilation ≤ 5 days, the notable predictors were respiratory function at the time of extubation (maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), p = 0.040; maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), p = 0.020; and tidal volume (TV), p = 0.036) and serum TBARS level at admission (p = 0.013), the cut-off value of serum TBARS level at admission was 762.3 μmol/L (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.0%).In this study, respiratory function (MIP, MEP and TV) at the time of extubation can be useful optimal clinical guidelines for weaning and extubation attempts in patients with acute cervical SCI.

Considering the enhanced biofilm resistance and toxicity of synthetic antifungal drugs, the search for efficient, nontoxic, and cost-effective natural therapeutics has received a major boost. Phenolic (thymol and carvacrol) and aldehydic (citral) terpenes are natural and safe alternatives capable of efficient microbial biofilm inhibition. However, the biofilm inhibition mechanism of these terpenes still remains unclear. In this study, we adopted an integrative biophysical and biochemical approach to elucidate the hierarchy of their action against  biofilm cells. The microscopic analysis revealed disruption of the biofilm cell surface with elevation in surface roughness and reduction in cell height. Although all terpenes acted through ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition, the phenolic terpenes also selectively interacted via ergosterol binding. Further, the alterations in the fatty  profile in response to terpenes attenuated the cell membrane fluidity with enhanced permeability, resulting in pore formation and efflux of the K/intracellular content. Additionally, mitochondrial depolarization caused higher levels of reactive  species, which led to increased lipid peroxidation and activation of the antioxidant defense system. Indeed, the oxidative stress caused a significant decline in the amount of extracellular polymeric matrix and capsule sugars (mannose, xylose, and glucuronic ), leading to a reduced capsule size and an overall negative charge on the cell surface. This comprehensive data revealed the mechanistic insights into the mode of action of terpenes on biofilm inhibition, which could be exploited for formulating novel anti-biofilm agents.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676791>Essentiality of fatty  synthase in the 2D to anchorage-independent growth transition in transforming cells.</a></h1><p>Upregulation of fatty  synthase (FASN) is a common event in cancer, although its mechanistic and potential therapeutic roles are not completely understood. In this study, we establish a key role of FASN during transformation. FASN is required for eliciting the anaplerotic shift of the Krebs cycle observed in cancer cells. However, its main role is to consume acetyl-CoA, which unlocks isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-dependent reductive carboxylation, producing the reductive power necessary to quench reactive  species (ROS) originated during the switch from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) growth (a necessary hallmark of cancer). Upregulation of FASN elicits the 2D-to-3D switch; however, FASN's synthetic product palmitate is dispensable for this process since cells satisfy their fatty  requirements from the media. In vivo, genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of FASN before oncogenic activation prevents tumor development and invasive growth. These results render FASN as a potential target for cancer prevention studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665666>CaWRKY27 negatively regulates salt and osmotic stress responses in pepper.</a></h1><p>WRKY transcription factors are key regulatory components of plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In pepper (Capsicum annuum), CaWRKY27 positively regulates resistance to the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and negatively regulates thermotolerance. Here, we report that CaWRKY27 functions in the response to salinity and osmotic stress. CaWRKY27 transcription was induced by salinity, osmotic, and abscisic  (ABA) treatments, as determined using qPCR and GUS assays. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants heterologously expressing CaWRKY27 had an increased sensitivity to salinity and osmotic stress, with a higher inhibition of both root elongation and whole plant growth, more severe chlorosis and wilting, lower germination rates, and an enhanced germination sensitivity to ABA than the corresponding wild-type plants. Furthermore, most marker genes associated with reactive  species (ROS) detoxification and polyamine and ABA biosynthesis, as well as stress-responsive genes NtDREB3, were downregulated in plants transgenically expressing CaWRKY27 upon exposure to salinity or osmotic stress. Consistently, silencing of CaWRKY27 using virus-induced gene silencing conferred tolerance to salinity and osmotic stress in pepper plants. These findings suggest that CaWRKY27 acts as a molecular link in the antagonistic crosstalk regulating the expression of defense-related genes in the responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses by acting either as a transcriptional activator or repressor in pepper.Copyright © 2019.

However, vitamin C is not only an antioxidant, since it is also a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in plant and human metabolism. In humans, vitamin C takes part in various physiological processes, such as iron absorption, collagen synthesis, immune stimulation, and epigenetic regulation. Due to the functional loss of the gene coding for l-gulonolactone oxidase, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C; thus, they principally utilize plant-based foods for their needs. For this reason, increasing the vitamin C content of crops could have helpful effects on human health. To achieve this objective, exhaustive knowledge of the metabolism and functions of vitamin C in plants is needed. In this review, the multiple roles of vitamin C in plant physiology as well as the regulation of its content, through biosynthetic or recycling pathways, are analyzed. Finally, attention is paid to the strategies that have been used to increase the content of vitamin C in crops, emphasizing not only the improvement of nutritional value of the crops but also the acquisition of plant stress resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645575>Acetic : a cost-effective agent for mitigation of seawater-induced salt toxicity in mung bean.</a></h1><p>The current study sought the effective mitigation measure of seawater-induced damage to mung bean plants by exploring the potential roles of acetic  (AA). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that foliar application of AA under control conditions improved mung bean growth, which was interlinked to enhanced levels of photosynthetic rate and pigments, improved water status and increased uptake of K, in comparison with water-sprayed control. Mung bean plants exposed to salinity exhibited reduced growth and biomass production, which was emphatically correlated with increased accumulations of Na, reactive  species and malondialdehyde, and impaired photosynthesis, as evidenced by PCA and heatmap clustering. AA supplementation ameliorated the toxic effects of seawater, and improved the growth performance of salinity-exposed mung bean. AA potentiated several physio-biochemical mechanisms that were connected to increased uptake of Ca and Mg, reduced accumulation of toxic Na, improved water use efficiency, enhanced accumulations of proline, total free amino  and soluble sugars, increased catalase activity, and heightened levels of phenolics and flavonoids. Collectively, our results provided new insights into AA-mediated protective mechanisms against salinity in mung bean, thereby proposing AA as a potential and cost-effective chemical for the management of salt-induced toxicity in mung bean, and perhaps in other cash crops.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634818>Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase reduces NADPH oxidase expression, oxidative stress and the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice; potential implications for human atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive  species (ROS) are instrumental in all inflammatory phases of atherosclerosis. Dysregulated histone deacetylase (HDAC)-related epigenetic pathways have been mechanistically linked to alterations in gene expression in experimental models of cardiovascular disorders. Hitherto, the relation between HDAC and Nox in atherosclerosis is not known. We aimed at uncovering whether HDAC plays a role in mediating Nox up-regulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerotic lesion progression. Human non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic arterial samples, ApoE-/- mice, and in vitro polarized monocyte-derived M1/M2-macrophages (Mac) were examined. Male ApoE-/- mice, maintained on normal or high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet, were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg suberoylanilide hydroxamic  (SAHA), a pan-HDAC inhibitor, or its vehicle, for 4 weeks. In the human/animal studies, real-time PCR, Western blot, lipid staining, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were employed. The protein levels of class I, class IIa, class IIb, and class IV HDAC isoenzymes were significantly elevated both in human atherosclerotic tissue samples and in atherosclerotic aorta of ApoE-/- mice. Treatment of ApoE-/- mice with SAHA reduced significantly the extent of atherosclerotic lesions, and the aortic expression of Nox subtypes, NADPH-stimulated ROS production, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers. Significantly up-regulated HDAC and Nox subtypes were detected in inflammatory M1-Mac. In these cells, SAHA reduced the Nox1/2/4 transcript levels. Collectively, HDAC inhibition reduced atherosclerotic lesion progression in ApoE-/- mice, possibly by intertwined mechanisms involving negative regulation of Nox expression and inflammation. The data propose that HDAC-oriented pharmacological interventions could represent an effective therapeutic strategy in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The roles of these ligands in the water oxidation mechanism remain largely unknown. In this study, we constructed a D1-D170H mutant, in which the Asp ligand bridging Mn and Ca ions was replaced with His, in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and analyzed isolated PSII core complexes using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). The S-minus-S FTIR difference spectrum of the PSII complexes of the D1-D170H mutant showed features virtually identical to those of the wild-type PSII. MS analysis further showed that ~70% of D1 proteins from the PSII complexes of D1-D170H possessed the wild-type amino  sequence, although only the mutated sequence was detected in genomic DNA in the same batch of cells for PSII preparations. In contrast, a D1-S169A mutant as a control showed a modified FTIR spectrum and only a mutated D1 protein. It is thus concluded that the FTIR spectrum of the D1-D170H mutant actually reflects that of wild-type PSII, whereas the MnCaO cluster is not formed in PSII with D1-D170H mutation. Although the mechanism of production of the wild-type D1 protein in the D1-D170H mutant is unknown at present, a caution is necessary in the analysis of site-directed mutants of crucial residues in the D1 protein, and mutation has to be confirmed not only at the DNA level but also at the amino  level.Copyright © 2019.

HepG2 cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) mixture (oleic : palmitic , 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro fatty liver. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce fatty liver in vivo. Intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and fatty  transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW. These results suggest that CLW could be a potentially useful agent for the prevention of NAFLD through modulating fatty  uptake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674636>A tannic -modified fluoride pre-treated Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloy with antioxidant and platelet-repellent functionalities for vascular stent application.</a></h1><p>Vascular stent interventional therapy, as a regular and effective therapy, has been widely used to treat coronary artery diseases. However, adverse events occur frequently after stent intervention, especially restenosis and late stent thrombosis. The targeted implanting site will suffer from severe atherosclerosis, which is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease. Meanwhile, with the over-expanding use of endovascular mechanical intervention, vascular injury has become an increasingly common issue. Lesions and newly induced vascular injury result in inflammatory and oxidative stress; meanwhile, activated macrophages and granulocytes generate high levels of reactive  species (ROS), contributing to endothelial dysfunction and neointima hyperplasia. Therefore, attenuating oxidative stress and reducing ROS generation in the inflammatory response represent reasonable strategies to inhibit intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. Herein, we have developed a multifunctional surface for the MgZnYNd alloy with tannic  (TA) coating, and the pH dependence of the coating deposition is also demonstrated. The phenolic hydroxyl groups on the coatings endow the modified surface with excellent antioxidant functions. We found that the coating can be recycled, and the scavenging activity hardly weakened within five cycles. Also, the TA coating has a promising strong antioxidant activity as it shows a radical scavenging activity over 80% in long term. Moreover, the TA coating possesses platelet-repellent capability. No significant inflammatory response was observed for the TA modified sample in the rat subcutaneous implantation test. Combining these performances, we envision that the vascular stent modified with TA coating can have great potential in various applications by virtue of its simplicity and effectiveness.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636808>Comparison of Oxidative Stress Parameters in Heart Failure Patients Depending on Ischaemic or Nonischaemic Aetiology.</a></h1><p>Abnormalities in the oxidative and antioxidant states causing oxidative stress were both found in heart failure (HF) of various aetiologies and atherosclerosis.The goals of the study were as follows: comparison of oxidative stress parameters (OSP) in ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) ( = 479) and nonischaemic cardiomyopathy (nICM) ( = 295) patients; assessment of the relationships of OSP with functional capacity (NYHA class), maximal  consumption (max.O2), left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), and NT-proBNP concentration; and determination of the mutual relations of OSP in subgroups of patients with ICM and n-ICM.Serum concentrations of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), uric  (UA), bilirubin, albumin, protein sulfhydryl groups (PSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. The oxidative stress index (OSI) and MDA/PSH ratio were calculated.Higher concentrations of TAC (1.14 vs 1.11 mmol/l;  < 0.001) and MDA (1.80 vs 1.70 mol/l;  < 0.05) and higher MDA/PSH ratios (0.435 vs 0.358;  < 0,001) were observed in ICM than in nICM patients. Simultaneously, lower values of the OSI index (4.27 vs 4.6;  < 0, 05), PSH (4.10 vs 4.75 mol/g of protein;  < 0,001), and bilirubin (12.70 vs 15.40 mol/l;  < 0,001) concentrations were indicated in ICM patients. There were no differences in TOS, UA, and albumin between the examined groups. The NYHA class and VO2max correlate with MDA, bilirubin, and albumin in both groups, while with UA only in the ICM group. Correlations between the NYHA class, VO2max, and PSH were indicated in nICM. The association of LVEF with UA, bilirubin, and albumin has been demonstrated in the ICM group. The study showed negative correlations between TAC, MDA, and PSH and positive between TAC and MDA in both groups. In ICM patients, MDA positively correlated with UA. A negative correlation between PSH and concentrations of UA and bilirubin was expressed only in the nICM group.The obtained results confirm the relationship between the severity of HF and oxidative stress. The mechanisms of oxidative stress and antioxidant defence are partially different in the ICM and the nICM patients.Copyright © 2019 Ewa Romuk et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664828>Redetermination of the Structure of a Water-Soluble Hypervalent Iodine(V) Reagent AIBX and Its Synthetic Utility in the Oxidation of Alcohols and Synthesis of Isoxazoline -Oxides.</a></h1><p>The structure of a water-soluble hypervalent iodine(V) reagent AIBX is re-examined through its single-crystal X-ray analysis and theoretical calculations including Mayer bond order and localized orbital locator (LOL) and AIBX is believed to be a  iodylarene because of the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trimethylammonium cation on its phenyl ring, which would decrease the electron density of carboxylic anion and make the -carboxyl  anion incapable to form hypervalent bond with iodine atom. However, the cyclic benziodoxole structure of AIBX could be obtained by adding a Brønsted , which was supported by the calculation result including the increase of Mayer bond order and the shortening of the I-O bond length. Moreover, the fact that the system of AIBX and TFA could oxidize various alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds would indicate that AIBX constitutes a cyclic benziodoxole structure under acidic conditions.

Given its Al binding capacity, malate allows internal as well as external detoxification strategies to cope with Al stress, but little is known about the metabolic processes involved in this response. Here, we analyzed the relevance of NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME), which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate, in Al tolerance. Plants lacking NADP-ME1 (nadp-me1) display lower inhibition of root elongation after Al treatment, compared to the wild type (wt). Moreover, wt roots exposed to Al show a drastic decrease in NADP-ME1 transcript level. Although malate levels in seedlings and root exudates are similar in nadp-me1 and wt, a significant increase of intracellular malate is observed in roots of nadp-me1 after a long exposure to Al. The nadp-me1 plants also show lower H O content in the root apices treated with Al and no inhibition of root elongation when exposed to glutamate, an amino  implicated in Al signaling. Proteomic studies showed several differentially expressed proteins involved in signal transduction, primary metabolism, protection against biotic and other abiotic stimulus and redox processes in nadp-me1, which may participate directly or indirectly in Al tolerance. The results indicate that NADP-ME1 is involved in adjusting the malate levels in the root apex, and its loss results in an increased content of this organic . Furthermore, the results suggest that NADP-ME1 affects signaling processes, such as the generation of reactive  species and those that involve glutamate, which could lead to root growth inhibition.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681873>Solvent Effect on the Solvothermal Synthesis of Mesoporous NiO Catalysts for Activation of Peroxymonosulfate to Degrade Organic Dyes.</a></h1><p>In this work, we successfully prepared three different mesoporous NiO nanostructures with preferential (111) planes using three different solvents-water, a water-ethanol mixture, and a water-ethylene glycol mixture. The NiO nanosheets prepared from the water-ethylene glycol mixture and denoted as NiO-EG showed a nanosheet morphology thinner than 10 nm, whereas the water-ethanol and water samples were 30-40 nm and above 100 nm thick, respectively. The NiO-EG catalyst was found to exhibit a high catalyzing ability to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for decoloring dyes, by which 94.4% of  orange 7 (AO7) was degraded under the following reaction conditions: AO7 = 50 mg/L, catalyst = 0.2 g/L, PMS = 0.8 g/L, pH = 7, and 30 min reaction time. The dye degradation rate was investigated as a function of the catalyst dosage, pH, and dye concentration. According to quenching experiments, it was found that SO , HO, and O  were the dominant radicals for AO7 degradation, and  vacancies played a significant role in the generation of radicals. High surface area, thin flaky structure, rich  vacancies, fast charge transport, and low diffusion impedance all enhanced the catalytic activity of NiO-EG, which exhibited the highest degradation ability due to its abundant accessible active sites for both adsorption and catalysis.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637230>Surface Study of FeO Nanoparticles Functionalized With Biocompatible Adsorbed Molecules.</a></h1><p>Surfaces of iron oxide of ferrimagnetic magnetite (FeO) nanoparticles (MNPs) prepared by Massart's method and their functionalized form (f-MNPs) with succinic , L-arginine, oxalic , citric , and glutamic  were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-S), UV-vis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS). The XPS analysis of elements and their chemical states at the surface of MNPs and f-MNPs revealed differences in chemical bonding of atoms, content of carbon- groups, iron oxide forms, iron oxide magnetic properties, adsorbed molecules, surface coverage, and overlayer thickness, whereas the Auger parameters (derived from XPS and Auger spectra) and elastic and inelastic scattering probabilities of electrons on atoms and valence band electrons (derived from REELS spectra) indicated modification of surface charge redistribution, electronic, and optical properties. These modified properties of f-MNPs influenced their biological properties. The surfaces biocompatible for L929 cells showed various cytotoxicity for HeLa cells (10.8-5.3% of cell death), the highest for MNPs functionalized with oxalic . The samples exhibiting the largest efficiency possessed smaller surface coverage and thickness of adsorbed molecules layers, the highest content of  and carbon- functionalizing groups, the highest ratio of lattice O and OH to C sp hybridizations on MNP surface, the highest ratio of adsorbed O and OH to C sp hybridizations on adsorbed molecule layers, the closest electronic and optical properties to FeO, and the lowest degree of admolecule polymerization. This high cytotoxicity was attributed to interaction of cells with a surface, where increased content of  groups, adsorbed O, and OH may play the role of additional adsorption and catalytic sites and a large content of adsorbed molecule layers of carboxylic groups facilitating Fenton reaction kinetics leading to cell damage.Copyright © 2019 Lesiak, Rangam, Jiricek, Gordeev, Tóth, Kövér, Mohai and Borowicz.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671098>Photodynamic Therapy Combined with Antifungal Drugs against Chromoblastomycosis and the Effect of ALA-PDT on Fonsecaea In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic skin and subcutaneous fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi and is associated with low cure and high relapse rates. In southern China, Fonsecaea monophora and Fonsecaea pedrosoi are the main causative agents.We treated 5 refractory and complex cases of chromoblastomycosis with 5-aminolevulinic  photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) combined with oral antifungal drugs. The lesions improved after 4 to 9 sessions of ALA-PDT treatment at an interval of one or two weeks, and in some cases, mycological testing results became negative. The isolates were assayed for susceptibility to antifungal drugs and ALA-PDT in vitro, revealing sensitivity to terbinafine, itraconazole and voriconazole, with ALA-PDT altering the cell wall and increasing reactive  species production.These results provide the basis for the development of a new therapeutic approach, and ALA-PDT combined with oral antifungal drugs constitutes a promising alternative method for the treatment of refractory and complex cases of chromoblastomycosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642452>Tetrahedral framework nucleic  prevent retina ischemia-reperfusion injury from oxidative stress via activating the Akt/Nrf2 pathway.</a></h1><p>Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries are involved in the universal pathological processes of many ophthalmic diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal arterial occlusion. The reason is that the ischemia-reperfusion injury is accompanied by the abnormal accumulation of reactive  species (ROS), which can cause damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), promote their apoptosis, and finally lead to the irreversible loss of the visual field. RGCs are specialized projection neurons that are situated in the inner retinal surface of the eye, and they transmit visual images into certain areas of the brain in the form of action potentials. Therefore, any damage that affects the viability of RGCs can cause visual field defects or even irreversible vision loss. There is no effective drug treatment in clinical practice for the loss of the visual field that is caused by the oxidation and apoptosis of RGCs. Hence, finding a drug with neuroprotective and antioxidant functions is urgently needed. As a new type of nanomaterial, tetrahedral framework nucleic  (tFNAs) exhibit outstanding biocompatibility and have been shown in our previous studies to participate in the positive regulation of cell behavior. In this experiment, we first established a cellular model of oxidative stress in RGCs with tert-butyl peroxide (TBHP). Then, we primarily explored the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of tFNAs after TBHP-induced oxidative stress and the main mechanisms by which the tFNAs function. Our research showed that tFNAs could reduce the production of reactive  species (ROS) in cells and protect the cells from oxidative stress by regulating intracellular oxidation-related enzymes. In addition, tFNAs could simultaneously improve oxidative stress-induced apoptosis significantly via affecting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Finally, we confirmed by western blotting that the mechanism by which tFNAs prevent damage caused by oxidative stress involves activating the Akt/Nrf2 pathway. Our findings provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of a series of diseases that are caused by oxidative stress to RGCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671675>Natural Sulfur-Containing Compounds: An Alternative Therapeutic Strategy against Liver Fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Liver fibrosis is a pathophysiologic process involving the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins as collagen deposition. Advanced liver fibrosis can evolve in cirrhosis, portal hypertension and often requires liver transplantation. At the cellular level, hepatic fibrosis involves the activation of hepatic stellate cells and their transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Numerous pro-fibrogenic mediators including the transforming growth factor-β1, the platelet-derived growth factor, endothelin-1, toll-like receptor 4, and reactive  species are key players in this process. Knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic fibrosis development need to be extended to find novel therapeutic strategies. Antifibrotic therapies aim to inhibit the accumulation of fibrogenic cells and/or prevent the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. Natural products from terrestrial and marine sources, including sulfur-containing compounds, exhibit promising activities for the treatment of fibrotic pathology. Although many therapeutic interventions are effective in experimental models of liver fibrosis, their efficacy and safety in humans are largely unknown. This review aims to provide a reference collection on experimentally tested natural anti-fibrotic compounds, with particular attention on sulfur-containing molecules. Their chemical structure, sources, mode of action, molecular targets, and pharmacological activity in the treatment of liver disease will be discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638739>5-Aminolevulinic -Loaded Hyaluronic  Dissolving Microneedles for Effective Photodynamic Therapy of Superficial Tumors with Enhanced Long-Term Stability.</a></h1><p>5-Aminolevulinic  (5-ALA) is one of the most widely used prodrug in clinical photodynamic therapy of dermatological diseases and cancers; yet, its clinical application is still limited by the shallow skin penetration and unsatisfied stability in any existed formulations. Here, 5-ALA-loaded hyaluronic  dissolving microneedles (5-ALA@HAMNs) are prepared for photodynamic therapy of superficial tumors. The HAMNs can not only assist the loaded 5-ALA to effectively penetrate the stratum corneum but also provide 5-ALA with an acidic and -free environment to reduce the dimerization of 5-ALA molecules via Schiff-base bonds and formation of inactive pyrazine derivatives, thus maintaining its chemical structure and biological activity. The chemical stability of 5-ALA in HAMNs is confirmed by UV-vis spectra and mass spectra measurements. The 5-ALA@HAMNs display remarkable tumor elimination both in vitro and in vivo, even after storage at room temperature for nine months, making it a highly potential device for effective delivery of 5-ALA in cancer photodynamic therapy.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure,  consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

However, studies have failed to control for habitual physical activity levels, which directly influences both mtDNA copy number and insulin sensitivity. We, therefore, examined whether physical conditioning status (maximal  uptake, V̇O) was associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume and mtDNA, and was predictive of T2DM in overweight, middle-aged men.Whole-body physiological (ISI-insulin sensitivity index, HOMA-IR, V̇O) and muscle biochemical/molecular (vastus lateralis; mtDNA, mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes activity, lipid content and markers of lipid peroxidation) measurements were performed in three groups of overweight, middle-aged male volunteers (n = 10 per group): sedentary T2DM (ST2DM); sedentary control (SC) and non-sedentary control (NSC), who differed in aerobic capacity (ST2DM < SC < NSC).mtDNA was greater in NSC versus SC and ST2DM (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), and less in ST2DM versus SC (P < 0.01). Across all groups, mtDNA positively correlated with ISI (P < 0.001; r = 0.688) and V̇O (normalised to free fat mass; r = 0.684, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated to HOMA-IR (r = -0.544, P < 0.01). The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (GluDH, CS and β-HAD) was greater in NSC than ST2DM (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) and SC (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but similar between ST2DM and SC. Intramuscular-free fatty , triglycerides and malondialdehyde contents were similar between ST2DM and SC.Body composition and indices of muscle mitochondrial volume/function were similar between SC and ST2DM. However, mtDNA differed and was positively associated with ISI, HOMA-IR and V̇O across all groups. Collectively, the findings support the contention that habitual physical activity is a key component of T2DM development, possibly by influencing mtDNA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678903>Molecular traits of phenolic moieties in dissolved organic matter: Linkages with membrane fouling development.</a></h1><p>Phenolic moieties are important constituents in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural and engineered systems. However, their roles in membrane fouling mechanism during drinking water treatment by ultrafiltration (UF) have remained elusive. Herein, by using water insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) resins, we sequestered the phenolic moieties from a model DOM (Suwannee River DOM, SRDOM) and characterized their molecular profiles using electrospray ionization coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Subsequently, their roles in UF membrane fouling propensity were investigated using reconstituted DOM solutions with various concentrations of phenolic moieties. The results showed that the phenolic moieties were of higher molecular weight and rich in unsaturation cyclic structures and -rich groups. Van Krevelen diagrams revealed that the sequestered sample was rich in aromatics structures and tannins-like compounds while contained less alicyclic organic  in comparison with the original SRDOM, which was consistent with the aromaticity index (AI) analysis. UF experiments showed that the more phenolic moieties in DOM solution, the severer decline of flux was observed. The phenolic moieties played a significant role in membrane irremovable fouling due to the hydrophobic interactions and their higher molecular weight as evidenced by membrane cleaning tests. By surface characterization, the SRDOM fouled membrane was identified to have a higher water contact angle value and abundant C-O groups, likely due to the adsorption of more hydrophobic phenolic moieties. Overall, these findings highlighted links between phenolic moieties and membrane fouling development, and implied that membrane performance could be improved by pre-removal of phenolic moieties in DOM.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In liver, genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease fatty  oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to liver failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive  species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty  which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680276>In vitro and in vivo inhibition of maillard reaction products using amino , modified proteins, vitamins, and genistein: A review.</a></h1><p>Maillard reaction is known to result in loss of nutrients, particularly that of essential amino ; decrease in digestibility and safety issues due to the development of toxic compounds. Maillard reaction products are also known to cause oxidation of tissues and inflammation, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The aim of this review is to present a detailed information about the role of foodborne constituents as antibrowning agents to significantly reduce the harmful compounds like advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during food processing. This review includes strategies involving addition of amino , aromatic compounds, vitamins, modification of amino , and reducing sugars as antibrowning agents to reduce the AGEs. The role of Food borne functional ingredients such as catechin, epicathechin, luteolin, and ferulic  as inhibitors of AGEs is also discussed. Among the naturally occurring inhibitors, genistein could be a crucial and safe agent to reduce reactive intermediates. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Maillard reaction leads to changes in food color, protein functionality, protein digestibility, and loss of nutrient from foods. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) is also reported to be associated with various inflammatory conditions and may contribute to the progress of chronic diseases, including diabetes. It is hence necessary to reduce the MRPs, in both food and biological products, to offset this phenomenon. Among the strategies adopted till date, chemical agents could inhibit reactive carbonyl species and reactive  species, but also are known to elicit serious side effects. Dietary flavonoids could be a very good inhibitor of MRPs both in biological and in food systems. It could be suggested that dietary flavonoids and isoflavones can be used as antibrowning agents in food and pharmaceutical industries particularly for targeted and sustained release of hypoglycemic drug in the intestines.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666518>Redox-governed charge doping dictated by interfacial diffusion in two-dimensional materials.</a></h1><p>Controlling extra charge carriers is pivotal in manipulating electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various two-dimensional materials.

The impact on neuro-inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and the brain levels of monoamines and GABA were investigated.Rats were divided into the following: normal control, hypoxia model induced by sodium nitrite (75 mg/kg s.c), and hypoxic rats pre-treated with CAR (250 mg/kg), ARG (200 mg/kg), and their combination.Data revealed that hypoxia induced significant elevation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its receptor reflecting the stimulation of angiogenesis. Hypoxia also resulted in increased inflammatory mediators-including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, hypoxia initiates cerebral apoptosis as revealed by increased caspase-3 and BAX with reduced Bcl-2. These changes were associated with reduced brain levels of GABA and monoamines including noradrenaline (NADR), dopamine (DOP), and serotonin (SER). Pre-treatment with ARG and/or CAR significantly mitigated the neural changes induced by hypoxia and attenuated the elevated levels of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, caspase-3, and BAX, while ameliorated the reduced levels of Bcl-2, NADR, DOP, SER, and GABA, with the best improvement observed with the combination. Further elevation of the angiogenic markers was observed indicating their role in boosting  delivery to brain.CAR, ARG, and, importantly, their combination could effectively protect against hypoxia-induced neurotoxicity, via their angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties in addition to reversing the effect on GABA and monoamines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656961>Adsorption of aromatic carboxylic  on carbon nanotubes: impact of surface functionalization, molecular size and structure.</a></h1><p>A large quantity of emerging contaminants are ionizable, and the ionized compounds display different adsorption behaviors than their neutral counterparts. In particular, a strong intermolecular force, negative charge assisted hydrogen bonding ((-)CAHB), was recently identified, which explains the unusually strong adsorption of negatively charged compounds on carbon nanotubes with -containing functional groups. However, most previous studies only probed molecules with one benzene ring. The adsorption of ionizable compounds with more than one benzene ring and additional functional groups has not been examined. This study investigated the effect of surface functionalization, molecular size and structure of six aromatic carboxylic  on their adsorption on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in batch reactors. In addition, the short-range interactions of the neutral  with MWNTs were calculated to evaluate the effect of aromaticity and bulkiness. Hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions dominate the intermolecular forces between ionized contaminants and MWNT surfaces. pH dependent octanol/water partitioning coefficient (Dow) is a more precise indicator of the adsorption of ionizable compounds on MWNTs. (-)CAHB is a significant force only for compounds with one benzene ring. Hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups displayed similar capacity to form (-)CAHB, as indicated by the release of hydroxide ions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h1><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino  fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino  fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical  demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino  fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638263>miR‑455 targets FABP4 to protect human endometrial stromal cells from cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress and dysregulation of antioxidant systems are associated with various complications in pregnancy. Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease that affects women of reproductive age. Recent studies have indicated that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. It has been reported that microRNAs can regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress, and mounting evidence indicates that fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4) plays an essential role in the regulation of systemic redox capacity. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR‑455 is a putative FABP4‑targeting miRNA. A luciferase activity assay revealed that miR‑455 can successfully bind to the 3'‑UTR of FABP4. Overexpression of miR‑455 led to the downregulation of FABP4 at both the mRNA and protein levels in a human endometrial stromal cell line. Then, the roles of miR‑455 and FABP4 in oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human endometrial stromal cells were examined. We found that ectopic expression of miR‑455 protected cells from damage caused by H2O2. Further investigation found that forced expression of miR‑455 reduced the level of reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), while the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH‑Px) were promoted. Silencing of FABP4 also generated cytoprotective effects against H2O2 in human endometrial stromal cells. Moreover, overexpression FABP4 abrogated the miR‑455‑mediated antioxidative stress effects in cells. Taken together, we propose that miR‑455 protects human endometrial stromal cells from oxidative stress at least partly via regulation of FABP4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661289>Enhanced Reactive  Species Levels by Active Benzothiazole Complex mediated Fenton Reaction for Highly Effective Anti-tumor Therapy.</a></h1><p>Breaking the threshold of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) levels can cause non-specific oxidative damage to proteins, and lead to the Fenton reaction-mediated exogenous ROS production to be a new promising anticancer strategy. However, the problems including the inefficient transport of metal catalysts and insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in cells still need to be improved. In this study, functional nanosystem encapsulated with benzothiazole complexes (FeTB2) and the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was designed for highly effective antitumor therapy. The surface of the nanocarriers was modified with dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-grafted polyglutamic . The induced hyperthermia enables the lipid-polymer shell to depolymerize, releasing FeTB2. The released FeTB2 could kill tumor cells in two different ways by inhibiting DNA replication and catalyzing H2O2 to produce active •OH. Moreover, the conjugated DHA could increase the amount of peroxides in tumor cells and significantly enhance ROS yield. This work has provided solid evidence that the present nanosystem enables significant effect on tumor killing through the combined inhibition of DNA replication and ROS mediated oxidative damage by regulation of tumor microenvironment, providing a ROS-mediated high efficiency antitumor strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664454>High Glucose Provokes Microvesicles Generation from Glomerular Podocytes via NOX4/ROS Pathway.</a></h1><p>Microvesicles (MVs) were involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone 5 (MPC-5) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive  species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic  (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC-5 cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA.

In this study we investigated the spatio-temporal variation of salicylic  (SA), hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (catalase, CAT-EC 1.11.1.6-, and ascorbate peroxidase, APX-EC1.11.1.11-) in embryonic axis and cotyledons of dry and imbibed seeds of dormant (B123) and nondormant (B91) sunflower lines. The results showed that embryonic axis had higher level of SA and H O than cotyledons in both lines. In dry seeds, B123 embryo (embryonic axis + cotyledons) showed a higher SA content than B91. After dry storage at room temperature, SA decreased in B123 embryos to a value close to that registered in B91embryos. B123 embryonic axis of dry seeds presented higher H O levels than B91. Dry storage led to an increase of H O levels and a decrease of CAT activity in B123 embryonic axis. During imbibition, B123 seeds stored for 33 days displayed an increase in SA level in the embryonic axis (3 h of imbibition) and this lower level correlated with a decrease in H O (6 h of imbibition). Thus, the embryo-imposed dormancy in B123 dry seeds was associated with high levels of SA and low H O , whereas the dormancy release was linked with SA decrease and increase of H O as a consequence of lower CAT activity.

The results indicated that ASM enhanced the hydrogen peroxide (HO) content, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), glutathione reductase (GR) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). ASM also increased the contents of ascorbic  (AsA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide ademine dinucleotidephosphate (NADPH), MdSOD and MdAPX expression, but decreased MdMDHAR and dehydroascorbate reductase (MdDHAR) expression. DHEA suppressed HO accumulation and POD, APX, MDHAR, G6PDH activities, but increased SOD, CAT and GR activities compared to the control. ASM and DHEA treatments suppressed the contents of AsA, GSH and NADPH, and expression of MdSOD, MdAPX and MdMDHAR. These results suggest that DHEA treatment prevented ROS metabolism induced by ASM which showed the important role of G6PDH in maintaining redox homeostasis in apple exocarp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To that end, we report a strategy for the ready fabrication of -doped graphitic carbon nitride (CN) with engendered nitrogen deficiencies. The addition of KOH and oxalic  during the thermal condensation of urea led to a material that exhibits a significantly higher pseudo-first-order rate constant for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) (0.0225 min) compared to that of CN (0.00222 min). The enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of BPA exhibited by the dual-defect-modified CN (Bt-OA-CN) is ascribable to a considerable red-shift in its light absorption compared to that of CN, as well as its modulated energy band structure and more-efficient charge separation. Furthermore, we confirmed that the in-situ-formed cyano groups in the Bt-OA-CN photocatalyst act as strong electron-withdrawing groups that efficiently separate and transfer photo-generated charge carriers to the surface of the photocatalyst. This study provides novel insight into the in-situ dual-defect strategy for g-CN, which is extendable to the modification of other photocatalysts; it also introduces Bt-OA-CN as a potential highly efficient visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for use in environmental-remediation applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637540>Dietary GABA enhances hypoxia tolerance of a bottom-dwelling carp, Cirrhinus mrigala by modulating HIF-1α, thyroid hormones and metabolic responses.</a></h1><p>The Indian major carp, mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala), is a bottom-dwelling fish that can survive hypoxic episodes in its natural environment. We hypothesise that it can better survive hypoxic conditions by altering metabolic responses through GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric ) supplementation. In the first experiment, the hypoxia tolerance time of the fishes was evaluated under extreme anoxic conditions after feeding with GABA, which showed that GABA had improved survival time under hypoxia. To study the response of dietary GABA in hypoxia-exposed fish, the branchial HIF-1α expression levels, serum thyroid hormone levels and hepatic metabolic responses were assessed in the subsequent experiment. The treatment groups were fed for 60 days with experimental diets containing 4 levels of GABA (0.00% G, 0.50% G, 0.75% G and 1.0%G) and were subjected to 72-h hypoxia exposure (0.5 ± 0.02 mg L dissolved  (DO)) whereas a control group was maintained under normoxic conditions (6.0 ± 0.21 mg L DO). The five treatment groups with three replicates were C0 (0% G + normoxia), H0 (0% G + hypoxia), H0.5 (0.50% G + hypoxia), H0.75 (0.75% G + hypoxia) and H1.0 (1.00% G + hypoxia). The results indicated that GABA supplementation triggered downregulation of HIF 1 alpha expression. When compared with the control group, decreased thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels were observed in the GABA-fed hypoxic groups. However, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level remained unchanged in all the treatments. The LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) level in hypoxia-exposed groups was decreased by GABA supplementation. Our study demonstrated that GABA supplementation restores acute hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression, thyroid hormone levels and LDH activities. On the other hand, it enhanced the citrate synthase (CS) activities at 0.5-1.00%, which showed a sharp decline in hypoxia. Hypoxia caused increase in the serum metabolites such as glucose, lactate, cholesterol and triglycerides. However, GABA supplementation was partially effective in reducing glucose and lactate level while triglycerides and cholesterol values remained unchanged. Overall, our results suggested a potential role of GABA in suppressing metabolism during hypoxia exposure, which can increase the chances of survival of the species Cirrhinus mrigala during hypoxia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622161>Chronic effects of high intensity interval training on postprandial lipaemia in healthy males.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to determine thechronic (≥72h post-exercise) effects of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on postprandial lipaemia and metabolic markers in healthy volunteers. Eight physically active young males (Mean ± SD: age 22 ± 3years, height 1.77 ± 0.07m, body mass 67.7 ± 6.2kg) underwent two 6h mixed-meal tolerance tests and resting vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, before the first- and ≥72h after the final-session of four weeks of HIIT (16 sessions in total; 10x60s bouts of cycling at 90% maximal  uptake [V̇O], interspersed by 60s intervals at 45% V̇O). Arterialised and deep venous blood samples across the forearm, brachial artery blood flow measurements, and whole-body indirect calorimetry data were obtained before, and at regular intervals for 6h after, consumption of a standardised mixed-meal. The main findings revealed that, when assessed ≥72h post-exercise, postprandial free fatty  (FFA) uptake across the forearm was increased in response to exercise training (= 0.025). However, four weeks of HIIT did not alter fasting or postprandial circulating triglyceride (TAG) concentrations, or their tissue uptake, despite a 10.2 ± 7.7% improvement in V̇O(= 0.004). Protein content of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in the vastus lateralis at rest was reduced by 25 ± 21% (= 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest that 4 weeks of HITT enhances postprandial clearance of FFA, when assessed ≥72h post-exercise, but does not confer persisting (training) adaptations in postprandial triglyceridaemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670182>Potential of esterase DmtH in transforming plastic additive dimethyl terephthalate to less toxic mono-methyl terephthalate.</a></h1><p>Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) is a primary ingredient widely used in the manufacture of polyesters and industrial plastics; its environmental fate is of concern due to its global use. Microorganisms play key roles in the dissipation of DMT from the environment; however, the enzymes responsible for the initial transformation of DMT and the possible altered toxicity due to this biotransformation have not been extensively studied. To reduce DMT toxicity, we identified the esterase gene dmtH involved in the initial transformation of DMT from the AOPP herbicide-transforming strain Sphingobium sp. C3. DmtH shows 24-41% identity with α/β-hydrolases and belongs to subfamily V of bacterial esterases. The purified recombinant DmtH was capable of transforming DMT to mono-methyl terephthalate (MMT) and potentially transforming other p-phthalic  esters, including diallyl terephthalate (DAT) and diethyl terephthalate (DET). Using C. elegans as an assay model, we observed the severe toxicity of DMT in inducing reactive  species (ROS) production, decreasing locomotion behavior, reducing lifespan, altering molecular basis for oxidative stress, and inducing mitochondrial stress. In contrast, exposure to MMT did not cause obvious toxicity, induce oxidative stress, and activate mitochondrial stress in nematodes. Our study highlights the usefulness of Sphingobium sp. C3 and its esterase DmtH in transforming p-phthalic  esters and reducing the toxicity of DMT to organisms.Copyright © 2019.

Cytotoxic mechanism of a novel nitric oxide (NO) inducing-Pt coated Au nanoparticle (NP) has been comparatively studied with the well-established ROS inducing Pt-based anticancer drug cisplatin in human lung A549 carcinoma cells.Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, thiobarbituric  substances (TBARS) and C11-Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY). ROS (O and HO) was measured with dihydroethidium (DHE) and HO-specific sensor. Nitric oxide (NO) and mitochondrial dysfunction were evaluated respectively by NO-specific probe DAR-1 and JC-1. Autophagy was determined by lysotracker (LTR) and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) applied tandemly whereas apoptosis/necrosis by Hoechst/PI and caspase 3 activity.IC50 (concentration that inhibited cell viability by 50%) of Pt coated Au NP came to be 0.413 μM whereas IC50 of cisplatin came out to 86.5 μM in A549 cells treated for 24 h meaning NPs toxicity was over 200 times higher than cisplatin. However, no significant stimulation of intracellular ROS was observed at the IC50 of Pt coated Au NPs in A549 cells. However, markers like LDH release, TBARS, BODIPY and ROS were significantly higher due to cisplatin in comparison to Pt coated Au NP.Pt coated Au NP caused NO-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy. Mode of cell death due to NP was much different from ROS-inducing cisplatin.Pt coated Au NP offer promising opportunity in cancer therapeutic and warrants advanced study in vivo models of cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is an excellent breeding system for exploitation of heterosis, which has great potential to increase crop yields. To understand the molecular mechanism of CMS in cotton, we compared transcriptome, cytomorphological, physiological and bioinformatics data between the CMS line C2P5A and its maintainer line C2P5B. By using high-throughput sequencing technology, 178,166 transcripts were assembled and 2013 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified at three different stages of C2P5A anther development. In this study, we identified DEGs associated with reactive  species (ROS), peroxisomes, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), cytochrome oxidase subunit VI, and cytochrome P450, and DEGs associated with tapetum development, Jojoba acyl-CoA reductase-related male sterility protein, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and MYB transcription factors. The abnormal expression of one of these genes may be responsible for the CMS C2P5A line. In gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, DEGs were mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism, amino  metabolism, transport and catabolism, and signal transduction. Carbohydrate metabolism provides energy for anther development, starch and sucrose metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis and metabolism and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. These results showed that numerous genes and multiple complex metabolic pathways regulate cotton anther development. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that three modules, 'turquoise,' 'blue,' and 'green,' were specific for the CMS C2P5A line. The 'turquoise' and 'blue' modules were mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism, amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, peroxisomes, pyruvate metabolism as well as fatty  degradation. The 'green' module was mainly related to energy metabolism, carbon metabolism, translation, and lipid metabolism. RNA-sequencing and WGCNA polymerization modules were screened for key genes and pathways related to CMS in cotton. This study presents a new perspective for further research into the metabolic pathways of pollen abortion in the CMS C2P5A line and also provides a theoretical basis for its breeding and production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658544>[Preliminary study on effect of intraoperative goal-directed fluid management on pulmonary function and  dynamics in patients with severe burns].</a></h1><p> To preliminarily investigate the effect of intraoperative goal-directed fluid management (GDFM) on pulmonary function and  dynamics in patients with severe burns.  From February 2017 to May 2018, 30 patients admitted to Burn Department of our hospital with severe burns who met the criteria for inclusion and needed escharectomy and skin grafting were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into group GDFM of 15 cases [14 males and 1 female, (45±14) years old] and conventional liquid management group of 15 cases [12 males and 3 females, (42±10) years old] according to the random number table. During escharectomy and skin grafting, volume of patients in group GDFM was managed according to the GDFM scheme, based on cardiac output index, stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, hemoglobin, central venous  saturation (ScvO(2)), and other parameters; volume of patients in conventional liquid management group was managed according to clinical experience and conventional liquid management scheme, based on mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, hemoglobin, and other parameters. At post operation hour (POH) 1, 6, 12, and 24, arterial and venous blood was collected from patients of the two groups to determine the levels of extravascular lung water index (ELWI), global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI), oxygenation index, ScvO(2), central venous-to-arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (Pcv-aCO(2)), lactic , pH value, bicarbonate ion, and base excess routinely. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test,  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, and least significant difference test.  (1) The ELWI of patients in group GDFM was (4.3±1.1) mL/kg at POH 1, which was significantly lower than (6.5±3.6) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=2.26, <0.05). The ELWI levels of patients in group GDFM at POH 6, 12, and 24 were (6.8±2.2), (6.6±2.0), and (6.9±1.6) mL/kg, respectively, significantly higher than the level at POH 1 within the same group (<0.01), and similar to (8.5±3.1), (7.8±2.3), and (8.0±3.5) mL/kg in conventional liquid management group (=1.73, 1.53, 1.10, >0.05).

In conventional liquid management group, the oxygenation index of patients at POH 6 was significantly higher than that at POH 1, 12, or 24 (<0.01).

The ScvO(2) levels of patients in the two groups at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than those levels at POH 1 within the same group (<0.01), and the ScvO(2) of patients in conventional liquid management group at POH 24 was significantly higher than that at POH 6 or 12 within the same group (<0.05 or <0.01). The Pcv-aCO(2) levels of patients in group GDFM were significantly lower than those in conventional liquid management group at POH 1 and 6 (=2.55, 2.71, <0.05). The Pcv-aCO(2) of patients in group GDFM at POH 12 was significantly lower than that at POH 6 or 24 within the same group (<0.05). (3) The blood lactic  levels and pH values between patients of the two groups were similar at POH 1, 6, 12, and 24 (=0.89, 0.19, 0.26, 0.23; 1.55, 0.71, 0.77, 0.77, >0.05). In conventional liquid management group, the blood lactic  levels of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly lower than the level at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05), and the pH values of patients at POH 6, 12, and 24 were significantly higher than the value at POH 1 within the same group (<0.05).

On the other hand, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) were known to be able to promote heme synthesis in erythroid cells. Nevertheless, the effect of HDACi on heme homeostasis in non-erythrocytes remains unknown. We envisioned that the combination of HDACi and artesunate (ARS) might have synergistic antitumor activity through modulating heme synthesis.  studies revealed that combination of ARS and HDACi exerted synergistic tumor inhibition by inducing cell death. Moreover, this combination exhibited more effective antitumor activity than either ARS or HDACi monotherapy in xenograft models without apparent toxicity. Importantly, mechanistic studies revealed that HDACi coordinated with ARS to increase 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1) expression, and subsequent heme production, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity of ARS. Notably, knocking down  significantly blunted the synergistic effect of ARS and HDACi on tumor inhibition, indicating a critical role of ALAS1 upregulation in mediating ARS cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study revealed the mechanism of synergistic antitumor action of ARS and HDACi. This finding indicates that modulation of heme synthesis pathway by the combination based on ARTs and other heme synthesis modulators represents a promising therapeutic approach to solid tumors.© 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Of these complexes, Ru-PhenISA and Ru-PhenAN are polymer conjugates containing less than 5%, (on a molar basis), photoactive units. Their performance is compared with that of a small [Ru(phen)] compound, [Ru(phen)BAP](OTf) (BAP = 4-(4'-aminobutyl)-1,10-phenanthroline, OTf = triflate anion), used as a model of the photoactive units. The polymer ligands, PhenISA and PhenAN, are polyamidoamines with different -base properties. At physiological pH, the former is zwitterionic, the latter moderately cationic, and both intrinsically cytocompatible. The photophysical characterizations show that the complexation to macromolecules does not hamper the Ru(phen) ability to generate toxic singlet  upon irradiation, and phosphorescence lifetimes and quantum yields are similar in all cases. All three compounds are internalized by HeLa cells and can induce cell death upon visible light irradiation. However, their relative PDT efficiency is different: the zwitterionic PhenISA endowed with the Ru-complex lowers the PDT efficiency of the free complex, while conversely, the cationic PhenAN boosts it. Flow cytometry demonstrates that the uptake efficiency of the three agents reflects the observed differences in PDT efficacy. Additionally, intracellular localization studies show that while [Ru(phen)BAP](OTf) remains confined in vesicular structures, Ru-PhenISA localization is hard to determine due to the very low uptake efficiency. Very interestingly, instead, the cationic Ru-PhenAN accumulates inside the nucleus in all treated cells. Overall, the results indicate that the complexation of [Ru(phen)BAP](OTf) with a cationic polyamidoamine to give the Ru-PhenAN complex is an excellent strategy to increase the Ru-complex cell uptake and, additionally, to achieve accumulation at the nuclear level. These unique features together make this compound an excellent photosensitizer with very high PDT efficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619684>Metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from boreal potential and actual  sulfate soil materials.</a></h1><p>Natural sulfide rich deposits are common in coastal areas worldwide, including along the Baltic Sea coast.

In this study, the protective effects of M. serratulum was investigated through airway inflammation in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma murine model and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and possible mechanism were studied.Phytochemicals in the methanolic extract of M. serratulum (MEMS) were identified using RP-HPLC analysis. For evaluating in vitro anti inflammatory activity, LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage method was adopted and to estimate the levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive  species (ROS) and group of proinflammatory cytokines by ELISA. Allergic asthma was induced in Female BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of OVA on days 0 and 14 and then challenged with OVA from days (21-23). The MEMS at 200 & 400 mg/kg was administered by oral gavage 1 h before the OVA challenge. The airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was measured after 24 h OVA challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) & lung tissues were collected after 48 h last OVA challenge. Total cell count, differential cell eosinophil peroxidase assay, NO, Prostoglandin (PGE2), ROS assay and the cytokine release (IL-4, IL-5 & IL-13), were performed in BALF. Serum total IgE level and histopathological changes of lung tissues and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were detected by Western blot.From the chromatographic identification, the gallic , protocatechuic , catechin, ellagic , rutin, p-coumaric , quercetin, naringenin, apigenin were found in MEMS. In LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, MEMS (125,250 μg/mL) treatment significantly reduced the levels of NO, ROS and proinflammatory cytokines including IL1α, IL1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IFN-γ, TNF-α, G-CSF and GM-CSF). MEMS (200 & 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of inflammatory cells, NO,PGE2, ROS and L-4, IL-5, IL-13 in BAL fluid, IgE in serum of OVA-sensitized/challenged mice and also inhibit the COX-2 & iNOS protein expression in lung tissues of OVA-sensitized/challenged mice.From this finding it was suggested that the MEMS exhibited significant effects on airway inflammation by reducing the level of oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the COX-2, iNOS protein expression.Copyright © 2019.

Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and xanthine oxidase (XO) are related to impaired neovasculogenesis in CRI. Hydralazine is suggested for blood pressure control in CRI. This study aimed to investigate whether hydralazine could improve ischemia-induced neovasculogenesis in CRI animals by reducing reactive  species (ROS) levels. Mice underwent subtotal nephrectomy or sham surgery. Nitrendipine, probenecid, and allopurinol were used to reduce blood pressure, uric  (UA), and XO activity levels, respectively, for comparison. Blood pressure, XO activity and UA levels that were increased after subtotal nephrectomy were reduced by hydralazine treatment. Allopurinol decreased blood XO activity and UA levels. Only hydralazine and allopurinol increased the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and improved neovasculogenesis in CRI mice. IS activated XO mRNA and ROS and inhibited the functions of EPCs and endothelial cells, which could be reversed by hydralazine. However, no additional beneficial effects were observed when XO was inhibited with both hydralazine and siRNA. In conclusion, hydralazine, as a potential XO inhibitor, not only reduced blood pressure and UA levels but also increased the number of circulating EPCs and improved neovasculogenesis in CRI animals. Hydralazine directly inhibited IS-induced ROS and XO activation in EPCs and endothelial cells, and restored their functions in vitro. Future studies should evaluate whether hydralazine could provide additional vascular protection in patients with CRI.Copyright © 2019.

In this work, a simple and efficient method of reduction of bicarbonate to formate on a simple Ni powder catalyst with water as the facile hydrogen source and Zn as the regenerable reductant is proposed. The Ni catalyst and in situ formed Zn/ZnO exhibited a synergetic catalytic activity in the conversion of bicarbonate into formate, and a good formate yield of 81% was obtained. Detailed studies revealed that the synergetic catalytic activity between Ni and the in situ formed Zn/ZnO was mainly attributed to (i) the inhibited oxidation of Zn by Ni, leading to more interface of Zn/ZnO; (ii) the decreased growth of ZnO crystal along the [0001] direction, and thus increasing the more polar (0001) Zn face and the (0001̅) O face, which have high activity; and (iii) the enhanced generation of more  vacancies at the Zn/ZnO interface to promote the formate yield. This research demonstrates an efficient method of using a simple and nonprecious metal catalyst for the CO reduction into value-added chemicals and provides a better understanding of the synergistic catalytic mechanism of Ni and Zn/ZnO.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647665>Low Temperature Oxidation of Ethane to Oxygenates by  over Iridium-Cluster Catalysts.</a></h1><p>Direct selective oxidation of light alkanes, such as ethane, into value-added chemical products under mild reaction conditions remains a challenge in both industry and academia. Herein, the iridium cluster and atomically dispersed iridium catalysts have been successfully fabricated using nanodiamond as support. The obtained iridium cluster catalyst shows remarkable performance for selective oxidation of ethane under  at 100 °C, with an initial activity as high as 7.5 mol/mol/h and a selectivity to acetic  higher than 70% after five in situ recycles. The presence of CO in the reaction feed is pivotal for the excellent reaction performance. On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the critical role of CO was revealed, which is to maintain the metallic state of reactive Ir species during the oxidation cycles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647248>Redox Proteomes in human physiology and disease mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Redox proteomics is a field of proteomics which is concerned with the characterization of the oxidation state of proteins in order to gain information about their modulated structure, function, activity and involvement in different physiological pathways. Oxidative modiﬁcations of proteins have been shown to be implicated in normal physiological processes of cells, as well as in pathomechanisms leading to the development of cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare hereditary metabolic diseases, like classic galactosemia. Reactive  species (ROS) generate a variety of reversible and irreversible modiﬁcations of amino  residue side chains, and within the protein backbone. These oxidative post-translational modiﬁcations (Ox-PTMs) can participate in the activation of signal transduction pathways, and mediate the toxicity of harmful oxidants. Thus, the application of advanced redox proteomics technologies is important for gaining insights into molecular mechanisms of diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics is one of the most powerful methods that can be used to give detailed qualitative and quantitative information on protein modifications and allows to characterize redox proteomes associated with diseases. The current review illustrates the role and biological consequences of Ox- PTMs under basal and oxidative stress (OS) conditions by focussing on protein carbonylation and S-glutathionylation, two abundant modifications with impact on cellular pathways that were intensively studied during the last decade.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650720>Tetrabromobisphenol A Promotes the Osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 Cells Induced by Receptor Activator of NF-kappa B Ligand In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), one of the most widely used brominated flame-retardants, is a representative persistent organic pollutants group. Studies on TBBPA toxicity have been conducted using various target cells; however, few studies have investigated TBBPA toxicity in bone cells. Therefore, this study investigated the in vitro effects of TBBPA on osteoclasts, a cell type involved in bone metabolism.RAW264.7 cells were cultured in medium containing 50 ng/mL receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and varying concentrations of TBBPA. To evaluate the effects of TBBPA on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts, osteoclast-specific gene expression, tartrate-resistant  phosphatase (TRAP) activity, bone resorbing activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial superoxide were measured.The presence of 20 μ TBBPA significantly increased TRAP activity in RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, the bone resorbing activity of osteoclasts, and the gene expression of Akt2, nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1, and chloride channel voltage-sensitive 7. However, TBBPA treatment caused no change in the expression of carbonic anhydrase II, cathepsin K, osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1, , extracellular signal-related kinase, , , or matrix metalloproteinase 9. Furthermore, 20 μ TBBPA caused a significant decrease in MMP and a significant increase in mitochondrial superoxide production.This study suggests that TBBPA promotes osteoclast differentiation and activity. The mechanism of TBBPA-stimulated osteoclastogenesis might include increased expression of several genes involved in osteoclast differentiation and reactive  species production.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632416>An Optimized Screen Reduces the Number of GA Transporters and Provides Insights Into Nitrate Transporter 1/Peptide Transporter Family Substrate Determinants.</a></h1><p>Based on recent in vitro data, a relatively large number of the plant nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF) proteins have been suggested to function as gibberellic  (GA) transporters. Most GA transporting NPF proteins also appear to transport other structurally unrelated phytohormones or metabolites. Several of the GAs used in previous in vitro assays are membrane permeable weak organic  whose movement across membranes are influenced by the pH-sensitive ion-trap mechanism. Moreover, a large proportion of in vitro GA transport activities have been demonstrated indirectly via long-term yeast-based GA-dependent growth assays that are limited to detecting transport of bioactive GAs. Thus, there is a need for an optimized transport assay for identifying and characterizing GA transport. Here, we develop an improved transport assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes, wherein we directly measure movement of six different GAs across oocyte membranes over short time. We show that membrane permeability of GAs in oocytes can be predicted based on number of  atoms and that several GAs do not diffuse over membranes regardless of changes in pH values. In addition, we show that small changes in internal cellular pH can result in strongly altered distribution of membrane permeable phytohormones. This prompts caution when interpreting heterologous transport activities. We use our transport assay to screen all Arabidopsis thaliana NPF proteins for transport activity towards six GAs (two membrane permeable and four non-permeable). The results presented here, significantly reduce the number of bona fide NPF GA transporters in Arabidopsis and narrow the activity to fewer subclades within the family. Furthermore, to gain first insight into the molecular determinants of substrate specificities toward organic molecules transported in the NPF, we charted all surface exposed amino  residues in the substrate-binding cavity and correlated them to GA transport. This analysis suggests distinct residues within the substrate-binding cavity that are shared between GA transporting NPF proteins; the potential roles of these residues in determining substrate specificity are discussed.Copyright © 2019 Wulff, Ernst, Jørgensen, Lambertz, Maierhofer, Belew, Crocoll, Motawia, Geiger, Jørgensen, Mirza and Nour-Eldin.</p></html>
