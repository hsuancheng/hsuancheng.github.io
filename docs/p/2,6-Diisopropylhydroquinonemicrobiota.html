A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and %) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by  profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in weight gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty acids. The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and % of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590758>Impact of dietary ingredients on the interpretation of various fecal parameters in rats fed inulin.</a></h1><p>In the present study, the influences of diets (i.e. chow and AIN-93 diets) on the interpretation of various fecal parameters including viable , moisture, weight, and short-chain fatty acids in rats fed different amounts of inulin (0.5- g/kg). Eight groups of rats (n = 8/group) were fed, for 4 weeks, chow or AIN-93 diets with or without inulin supplementation. Fecal samples were analyzed for different fecal parameters. After a -week adaptation, apparent differences in some fecal parameters were observed between the chow and AIN-93 diet groups. Throughout the 4-week intervention period, significantly (p < 0.05) higher Lactobacillus spp. counts, fecal moisture (∼.7-fold), and fecal weight (∼5.8-fold) were observed with chow diet over AIN-93 diet. More specifically, significant elevations in the levels of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., fecal moisture, and fecal weight could be observed at low-dose (0.5 g/kg) of inulin in chow diet groups, while most of these changes could merely be seen at medium-dose (1 g/kg) in AIN-93 diet groups. These results demonstrated that the choice of experimental diets would affect the comparison of fecal parameters as well as the interpretation of effective dosage of prebiotic in intestinal health assessments.Copyright © 2019.

The use of various types of mouthrinses plays an important role in maintaining proper oral hygiene and in removing some of the microbial components from the oral cavity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of selected mouthrinses on the reference strains of Trichomonas tenax and Entamoeba gingivalis which can be a part of the oral cavity . Two standard strains Trichomonas tenax (ATCC 30207) and Entamoeba gingivalis (ATCC 30927) were used and metronidazole as a drug used in the treatment of infections caused by protozoa as well as fourteen agents used as mouthwashes were tested, with two pure compounds acting as mouthrinse ingredients, i.e. 20% benzocaine and 0.% chlorhexidine, as well as 12 commercially-available formulas: Azulan, Colgate Plax Complete Care Sensitive, Corsodyl 0.%, Curasept ADS 205, Dentosept, Dentosept A, Eludril Classic, Listerine Total Care, Octenidol, Oral-B Pro-Expert Clinic Line, Sylveco and Tinctura salviae. The protozoonicidal activity of the preparations was evaluated on the basis of the ratio of dead to living ratios after incubation in an incubator (37°C) for 1, 10 and 30 min. Protozoa were counted in the Bürker chamber in each case up to 100 cells in an optical microscope (over 400×). The criterion for the death of protozoa was the lack of movement and changes in the shape and characteristics of cell disintegration. The curves of activity were obtained after experiments conducted for 5–7 different solutions of each preparation. On the basis of the curves, the solution killing 50% of the population (CL50) was calculated. All mouthrinses tested in this work in their undiluted form acted lethally on both protozoa. Benzocaine, used as a local anesthetic, has etiotropic properties which can be useful for supporting antiprotozoal treatment. Chlorhexidine confirmed its high efficiency in the eradication of potentially pathogenic protozoa. The use of mouthrinses is an important complement for other procedures intended to maintain correct oral hygiene.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671720>The Human Milk  is Modulated by Maternal Diet.</a></h1><p>Human milk microorganisms contribute not only to the healthy development of the immune system in infants, but also in shaping the gut .

In the present study, we evaluated the potential anticancer activities of tRNAs from Escherichia coli MRE 600 to investigate the relationship between non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain and colorectal cancer. To purify individual tRNAs, we firstly developed a two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) and successfully obtained two pure tRNAs. Nuclease mediated base-specific digestions coupled with UHPLC-MS/MS techniques led to an identification of these two tRNAs as tRNA-Val(UAC) and tRNA-Leu(CAG) with typical cloverleaf-like secondary structure. MTT assay demonstrated that both tRNA-1 and tRNA- exhibit strong cytotoxicity with IC of 113.0 nM and 124.8 nM on HCT-8 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further clonogenic assay revealed that the purified tRNAs exhibit significant inhibition in colony formation with survival percentage of 79.0 ± 1.6 and 71. ± . at the concentration of 100 nM. These findings provided evidences of anticancer activities of tRNAs from non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain, indicating that the pharmacological effects of these neglected biomacromolecules from microorganisms should be emphasized. This study put new insights into the therapeutic effects of intestinal microorganism on human diseases, therefore broadened our knowledge of the biological functions of gut .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The research was carried out in selected lakes located within the administrative boundaries of the city of Olsztyn, the largest city in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The experiment was conducted in three summer seasons near bathing sites in three lakes, which are the most popular as recreational sites (Lake Kortowskie, Lake Tyrsko, and Lake Skanda). Microfungi isolated from the phyllosphere of 13 plant species of the littoral zone from dropped leaves of coast plants with no disease symptoms were used as the study material. The isolated fungi were identified in accordance with the accepted diagnostic procedures applied in mycological laboratories. A total of 36 yeast species of 16 genera were identified. Fungi found earlier at the bathing sites of the lakes were identified in 60% of the cases. Nine species were categorised as class BSL- fungi.

In this study, we aim to identify the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy in birds using chickens as a model. We collected 1,026 samples from 206 chickens, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and feces samples, for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analyses. In this study, the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy was partitioned to microbial community membership and community structure. Most taxa in the small intestine (84.11-87.28%) and ceca (99.39%) could be identified in feces. Microbial community membership was reflected with a gut anatomic feature, but community structure was not. Excluding shared microbes, the small intestine and ceca contributed 34.12 and 5.83% of the total fecal members, respectively. The composition of Firmicutes members in the small intestine and that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria members in the ceca could be well mirrored by the observations in fecal samples (ρ = 0.54-0.71 and 0.71-0.78, respectively,  < 0.001). However, there were few significant correlations for each genus between feces and each of the four gut segments, and these correlations were not high (ρ = -0.-0.4,  < 0.05) for most genera. Our results suggest that fecal microbial community has a good potential to identify most taxa in the chicken gut and could moderately mirror the microbial structure in the intestine at the microbial population level with phylum specificity. However, it should be interpreted with caution by using feces as a proxy to study associations for microbial structure at individual microorganism level.Copyright © 2019 Yan, Sun, Zheng, Wen, Ji, Zhang, Chen, Hou and Yang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576430>Adhesion mechanisms of lactic acid bacteria: conventional and novel approaches for testing.</a></h1><p>Adhesion ability is a primary criterion for the selection of probiotic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria contribute the majority of microorganisms with probiotic properties. They have several important mechanisms for intestinal epithelial cell adhesion. In order to adhere to the intestinal cells, they generally use various structures such as flagella, pili, S layer proteins, lipoteichoic acid, exopolysaccharides and mucus binding proteins. Various in vitro experiments were designed or study models were developed to reveal the mechanisms they utilize for binding to the intestinal cells, yet, the mechanisms for their adhesion are not fully explained. The major disadvantage of conventional models is the lack of layers forming the intestinal mucosa. Besides, these models omit the presence of natural , digestive conditions and the presence of a food matrix. Because of the disadvantages of existing models, natural tissues or novel applications like 3D organ cultures, which are better able to mimic in vivo conditions, are preferred.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640890>The probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum 296 attenuates cardiometabolic disorders in high fat diet-treated rats.</a></h1><p>High-fat (HF) diet consumption has been associated with gut dysbiosis and increased risk of dyslipidemia, type  diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal  of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection, microbiome studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3.5.). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular volatile fatty acids (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001). Despite performing consecutive repetitions, the factor experimental replication contributed more to the differences of microbial composition in comparison to the factor age at infection.Copyright © 2019 Hankel, Jung, Kuder, Keller, Keller, Galvez, Strowig and Visscher.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610731>Bone Marrow-Derived Cells Restore Functional Integrity of the Gut Epithelial and Vascular Barriers in a Model of Diabetes and ACE2 Deficiency.</a></h1><p> There is incomplete knowledge of the impact of bone marrow (BM) cells on the gut microbiome and gut barrier function.  We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut barrier function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut barrier integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted barrier was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut barrier integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut barrier dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty acid binding protein- (FABP-) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type  diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor- (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut barrier function and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h1><p>The impact of gut  and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut  and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg; :  × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal  diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut  on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582017>Involvement of TLR4/ CXCL9/ PREX- pathway in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the promising role of early administration of lactobacillus plantarum in Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>Improvement of gut  may help in preventing the progression of cirrhosis.

However, most psychotropic medications are currently intended for adult patients, and early psychopharmacological approaches aimed at reverting aberrant neurodevelopmental trajectories are missing. Psychopharmacologic intervention at an early age faces the challenge of operating in a highly plastic system and requires a comprehensive knowledge of neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Recently the systems biology approach has contributed to the understanding of neuroplasticity mechanisms from a new perspective that interprets them as the result of complex and dynamic networks of signals from different systems. This approach is creating opportunities for developmental psychopharmacology, suggesting novel targets that can modulate the course of development by interfering with neuroplasticity at an early age. We will discuss two interconnected systems-the immune and gut -that regulate neurodevelopment and that have been implicated in preclinical research as new targets in the prevention of aberrant brain development. .© 2019, AICH – Servier Group﻿Copyright © 2019 AICH – Servier Group.

In the present study, we have explored the effect of long-term supplementation with a non-dairy fermented food product (FFP) in Zucker Diabetic and Fatty (ZDF) rats T2D model. The supplementation with FFP induced an improvement in glucose homeostasis according to the results obtained from fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, and pancreatic function. Importantly, a significantly reduced intestinal glucose absorption was found in the FFP-treated rats. Supplemented animals also showed a greater survival suggesting a better health status as a result of the FFP intake. Some dissimilarities have been observed in the gut  population between control and FFP-treated rats, and interestingly a tendency for better cardiometabolic markers values was appreciated in this group. However, no significant differences were observed in body weight, body composition, or food intake between groups.

This research evaluates (1) the effectiveness of organic acids dissolved in saline solutions to reduce the counts of pathogenic microorganisms in soft and hard wheat, and also investigates the effect of seasonal temperature on () survivability of pathogens in wheat kernels and on (3) pathogen inactivation during tempering with saline organic acid solutions. Wheat samples were inoculated with cocktails of either 5 serovars of Salmonella enterica, 5 E. coli O157:H7 or 6 non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains to achieve a concentration of ~7 log CFU/g. Inoculated samples were allowed to stand for 7-days at temperatures (.0, 10.8, 24., 32 °C) corresponding to those experienced during winter, spring/fall, and summer (average and maximum) in the main wheat growing regions in the state of Nebraska, USA. Besides water, solutions containing acid (acetic or lactic .5% or 5.0% v/v) and NaCl (~26% w/v) were used for tempering the wheat to 15.0% (soft) and 15.5% (hard) moisture at the different seasonal temperatures. The survival of pathogenic microorganisms throughout the resting period, and before and after tempering was analyzed by plating samples on injury-recovery media. The survival rate of pathogenic microorganisms on wheat kernels was higher at temperatures experienced during the winter (.0 °C) and spring/fall (10.8 °C) months. Regardless of tempering temperature, the initial pathogen load was reduced significantly by all solutions when compared to the control tempered with water (P ≤ .05). The combination of lactic acid (5.0%) and NaCl was the most effective treatment against Salmonella enterica, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC, with average reduction values of 1.8, 1.8 and 1.6 log CFU/g for soft wheat and .6, .4 and .4 log CFU/g for hard wheat, respectively. Implementation of organic acids and NaCl in tempering water may have the potential to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in milled products.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Antibiotics perturb the bacterial gut composition but the extent of these changes and potential consequences for animal and human health is still debated. Six calves were housed in a controlled environment. Three animals received an injection of the antibiotic florfenicol (Nuflor), and three received no treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 3 and 7 days, and bacterial communities were profiled to assess the impact of a therapy on the gut . Phylogenetic analysis (16S-rDNA) established that at day 7, antibiotic-treated  showed a 10-fold increase in facultative anaerobic Escherichia spp, a signature of imbalanced , dysbiosis. The antibiotic resistome showed a high background of antibiotic resistance genes, which did not significantly change in response to florfenicol. However, the maintenance of Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded quinolone, oqxB and propagation of mcr-, and colistin resistance genes were observed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that gut dysbiosis, peripheral inflammation, and peripheral insulin resistance occur before the brain inflammatory response, hippocampal synaptic dysplasticity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cognitive impairment in HFD-fed rats.Male Wistar rats received either a normal diet or an HFD for , 8, 12, 20, or 40 wk. At the end of each time point, cognitive functions and metabolic parameters were determined. Gut , brain immune cell activity, amyloid-β level, microglia morphology, hippocampal reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and dendritic spine density were measured.We found that HFD-fed rats developed gut dysbiosis at week  and peripheral insulin resistance at week 8. Rats fed an HFD for 12 wk displayed hippocampal synaptic dysplasticity, decreased dendritic spine density, an elevation of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 cells, increased hippocampal reactive oxygen species levels and hippocampal apoptosis with cognitive decline. The decreased percentage of resident microglia and increased percentage of infiltrated macrophage were observed at weeks 20 and 40. Surprisingly, brain amyloid-β levels were increased after 40 wk of an HFD diet.These findings demonstrated that gut dysbiosis develops in the earliest phase of consumption of an HFD, followed by brain pathology, which leads to cognitive decline in obese insulin-resistant rats. Therefore, an improvement in gut dysbiosis should provide beneficial effects in the prevention of neuropathology and cognitive decline in the obese.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

With the growing interest of the use of mastic oil in the food and pharmaceutical industry, systematic in vivo studies are needed to address controlled usage and safety issues. In the present work we evaluated the safety of mastic oil using as a model the zebrafish lateral line system. In addition, we studied the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with mastic oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the hair cells of lateral line neuromasts are functional upon exposure of zebrafish larvae up to 20 ppm of mastic essential oil, while treatment with higher concentrations, 100 and 200 ppm, resulted in increased larvae mortality. Dietary supplementation of zebrafish with mastic essential oil led to differential expression of interferon response-related genes as well as the immune responsive gene 1 () that links cellular metabolism with immune defense. Notably, , a constituent of the mucus hydrogel that protects the host against invading pathogens, was up-regulated. Our in vivo work provides information concerning the safety of mastic essential oil use and suggests dietary effects on gene expression related with the physical and immunochemical properties of the gastrointestinal system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652267>Comparative characterization of bacterial communities in geese consuming of different proportions of ryegrass.</a></h1><p>Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut  will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = :1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636904>Dietary fibre enrichment of supplemental feed modulates the development of the intestinal tract in suckling piglets.</a></h1><p>Commercial pre-weaning diets are formulated to be highly digestible and nutrient-dense and contain low levels of dietary fibre. In contrast, pigs in a natural setting are manipulating fibre-rich plant material from a young age. Moreover, dietary fibre affects gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development and health in older pigs. We hypothesised that supplemental diets that contain vegetal fibres are accelerating GIT development in suckling piglets in terms of size and functionality. From d  of life, sow-suckled piglets had access to a low fibre diet (CON), a diet with a fermentable long-chain arabinoxylan (lc-AXOS), a diet with a largely non-fermentable purified cellulose (CELL), or a diet containing both fibres. During the initial  weeks, the control diet was a high-density milk replacer, followed by a dry and highly digestible creep meal. Upon weaning at 25 d, 15 piglets from each treatment group, identified as eaters and originating from six or seven litters, were sacrificed for post-mortem examination of GIT morphology, small intestinal permeability and metabolic profile of the digesta. The  composition of the mid-colon was evaluated in a sub-set of ten piglets.No major statistical interactions between the fibre sources were observed. Piglets consumed the fibre-containing milk supplements and creep diets well. Stomach size and small intestinal permeability was not affected. Large intestinal fill was increased with lc-AXOS only, while relative large intestinal weight was increased with both fibre sources ( < 0.050). Also, CELL decreased ileal pH and tended to increase ileal DM content compared to CON ( < 0.050). Moreover, the concentration of volatile fatty acids was increased in the caecum ( < 0.100) and mid-colon ( < 0.050) by addition of CELL. lc-AXOS only stimulated caecal propionate ( < 0.050). The  composition showed a high individual variation and limited dietary impact. Nonetheless, CELL induced minor shifts in specific genera, with notable reductions of -.Adding dietary fibres to the supplemental diet of suckling piglets altered large intestinal morphology but not small intestinal permeability. Moreover, dietary fibre showed effects on fermentation and modest changes of microbial populations in the hindgut, with more prominent effects from the low-fermentable cellulose.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668878>Polyphasic characterization of two novel Lactobacillus spp. isolated from blown salami packages: Description of Lactobacillus halodurans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus salsicarnum sp. nov.</a></h1><p> analysis of blown pack spoiled salami revealed five distinguishable Lactobacillus isolates we could not assign to a known species. Two of the isolates (TMW 1.2172 and TMW 1.1920) are rod-shaped, whilst three isolates (TMW 1.2098, TMW 1.2118 and TMW 1.2188) appear coccus shaped or as short rods. All isolates are Gram-stain positive, facultative anaerobic, catalase and oxidase negative, non-motile and non-sporulating. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, dnaK, pheS and rpoA gene sequences revealed two distinct lineages within the genus Lactobacillus (L.). The isolates are members of the Lactobacillus alimentarius group with Lactobacillus ginsenosidimutans DSM 24154 (99.4% 16S similarity), Lactobacillus versmoldensis DSM 14857 (97.9%) and Lactobacillus furfuricola DSM 27174 (97.7%) as phylogenetic closest related species and L. alimentarius DSM 20249 (97.7%) and Lactobacillus paralimentarius DSM 13961 (97.5%) as closest relatives, respectively. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between the isolates and their close related type strains are lower than 80% and 25%, respectively. For both designated type strains, the peptidoglycan type is A4α l-Lys-d-Asp and the major fatty acids are C, C and summed feature 7. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analysis we demonstrated that the investigated isolates belong to two novel Lactobacillus species for which we propose the names Lactobacillus salsicarnum with the type strain TMW 1.2098=DSM 109451=LMG 31401and Lactobacillus halodurans with the type strain TMW 1.2172=DSM 109452=LMG 31402.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

We studied a model collembolan () and found that the ingestion of microplastics (polystyrene, -.9 μm) substantially altered the gut microbiome, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, and the isotopic fractionation in the soil collembolan tissue. Importantly, collembolans exposed to polystyrene microplastics loaded with sulfamethoxazole (MA) presented a distinctive gut microbiome, ARG profile, and isotopic fractionation compared to those exposed to polystyrene alone (MH). We observed that the abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the MA-treated collembolan guts was significantly higher than in the MH and the control treatments. There were also strong interactions between the gut microbiome and ARGs in the collembolan guts. We further found that bacterial β-diversity correlated significantly with the δC and δN values in collembolan body tissues. Together, our results indicate that changes in isotopic fractionation and ARG profiles in the collembolan were induced by the changes in gut  and suggest that microplastics from diverse sources may have profound influences on soil fauna and soil food webs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678855>An antibiotic depleted microbiome drives severe Campylobacter jejuni-mediated Type 1/17 colitis, Type  autoimmunity and neurologic sequelae in a mouse model.</a></h1><p>The peripheral neuropathy Guillain-Barré Syndrome can follow Campylobacter jejuni infection when outer core lipooligosaccharides induce production of neurotoxic anti-ganglioside antibodies.

Kyotango, one of the longevity areas with various centenarians, is a provincial city located in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture in Japan. To understand the relationship between gut  and urbanization, we compared the diversity, abundance, and function of gut  in older healthy subjects between Kyotango and Kyoto cities; Kyoto is an urban city located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture. In total, 51 subjects at Kyotango and 51 subjects at Kyoto matched by age and gender were recruited, and their fecal samples were obtained to analyze the gut  using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis for β-diversity revealed significant differences in the gut  between two cities. In contrast, the analysis of α-diversity revealed no significant differences between the groups. On comparison at the phylum levels, the abundance of Firmicutes was decreased with the urbanization, whereas that of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased. On comparison at the genus levels, with urbanization, a significant decrease was observed in Lachnospiraceae families including genus  and , and significant increases was observed in , , , and . The most markedly increased functional pathway with urbanization was lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and decreased pathway was transporters and ABC transporters.

Whether this phenomenon exists in cattle is largely unknown. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to evaluate the impact of maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-pregnancy in dairy cows on fecal  and metabolome in neonatal calves, and their association with body development and growth performance during the preweaning period. To achieve this, heifer calves, i.e., neonatal female offspring, born to Holstein cows receiving either a control (CON) diet ( = 13) or CON plus rumen-protected methionine (MET; Evonik Nutrition & Care GmbH) during the last 28 days of pregnancy were used. Fecal samples from heifers were collected from birth until 6 weeks of age, i.e., the preweaning period. Fecal  was analyzed with QIIME  whereas fecal metabolites were measured using an untargeted LC-MS approach. At birth, MET heifers had greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH, and WH. During the preweaning period, no differences between groups were detected for starter intake ( = 0.77). However, MET heifers maintained greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH and tended ( = 0.06) to have greater WH and average daily gain (ADG) ( = 0.10). Fecal  and metabolome profiles through 42 days of age in MET heifers indicated greater capacity for hindgut production of endogenous antibiotics and enhanced hindgut functionality and health. Enhancing maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-gestation in dairy cows has a positive effect on hindgut functionality and health in their offspring through alterations in the fecal  and metabolome without affecting feed intake. Those alterations could limit pathogen colonization of the hindgut while providing essential nutrients to the neonate. Together, such responses contribute to the ability of young calves to achieve better rates of nutrient utilization for growth.Copyright © 2019 Elolimy, Alharthi, Zeineldin, Parys, Helmbrecht and Loor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581733>Specific Wheat Fractions Influence Hepatic Fat Metabolism in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Low whole grain consumption is a risk factor for the development of non-communicable diseases such as type  diabetes. Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased liver triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids. The effects on hepatic lipid metabolism might thus at least partially be mediated by -dependent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600256>Positive effect of an electrolyzed reduced water on gut permeability, fecal  and liver in an animal model of Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>There is growing awareness within the scientific community of the strong connection between the inflammation in the intestine and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). In previous studies we developed a PD animal model exposing pup rats to permethrin (PERM) pesticide. Here, we intended to explore whether in our animal model there were changes in gut permeability, fecal  and hepatic injury. Moreover, we tested if the co-treatment with an electrolyzed reduced (ERW) was effective to protect against alterations induced by PERM. Rats (from postnatal day 6 to 21) were gavaged daily with PERM, PERM+ERW or vehicle and gut, liver and feces were analyzed in -months-old rats. Increased gut permeability, measured by FITC-dextran assay, was detected in PERM group compared to control and PERM+ERW groups. In duodenum and ileum, concentration of occludin was higher in control group than those measured in PERM group, whereas only in duodenum ZO-1 was higher in control than those measured in PERM and PERM+ERW groups. Number of inflammatory focis and neutrophils as well as iNOS protein levels were higher in livers of PERM-treated rats than in those of PERM+ERW and control rats. Fecal  analysis revealed that Lachnospira was less abundant and Defluviitaleaceae more abundant in the PERM group, whereas the co-treatment with ERW was protective against PERM treatment since the abundances in Lachnospira and Defluviitaleaceae were similar to those in the control group. Higher abundances of butyrate- producing bacteria such as Blautia, U.m. of Lachnospiraceae family, U.m. of Ruminococcaceae family, Papillibacter, Roseburia, Intestinimonas, Shuttleworthia together with higher butyric acid levels were detected in PERM+ERW group compared to the other groups. In conclusion, the PD animal model showed increased intestinal permeability together with hepatic inflammation correlated with altered gut .

The rat model of sepsis was reproduced by injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via tail vein, the rats in the NS control group was given the same amount of NS. The rats in the fecal  transplantation group received nasogastric infusion of feces from healthy donor on the 1st day,  mL each time, for 3 times a day, the other two groups were given equal dose of NS by gavage. Fecal samples were collected on the 7th day after modeling, the levels of intestinal  composition was determined using the 16SrDNA gene sequencing technology. The brain function was evaluated by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the proportion of each waveform in EEG was calculated. After sacrifice of rats, the brain tissues were harvested, the levels of protein expression of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) were determined by Western Blot, and positive cells of Iba-1 in brain tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry method. The levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Seven days after the reproduction of the model, all rats in the NS control group survived, while 10 rats and 8 rats died in the sepsis model group and fecal  transplantation group, respectively, with mortality rates of 50% and 40% respectively. Finally, there were 20 rats in the NS control group, 10 in the sepsis model group and 12 in the fecal  transplantation group. Compared with the NS control group, the diversity and composition of intestinal flora were changed, the incidence of abnormal EEG increased significantly, the expression of α7nAchR in the cortex decreased significantly, and the levels of Iba-1, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β were significantly increased in the model group, suggested that the intestinal flora was dysbiosis, and severe inflammatory reaction occurred in the cerebral cortex, and brain function was impaired.

Two previous cohort studies of the association between talc use and uterine cancer have reported weak positive associations, but we know of no previous evaluations of the relationship between douching and uterine cancer.Using a large prospective cohort, we examined the relationship between incident uterine cancer and self-reported use of talc or douche using Cox proportional hazards models.After excluding those with prior hysterectomy, 271 of 33,609 women reported incident uterine cancer (mean follow-up = 8.3 years in noncases; maximum 12.6 years). Overall, 26% of women reported ever using talc and 15% reported ever having douched. Ever talc use was associated with an increase in risk of uterine cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94, 1.6), with some evidence of a dose-response for frequency of talc use (P-for-trend = 0.07). Ever douching was not associated with uterine cancer risk (HR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.72, 1.5), with no evidence of a frequency dose-response (P = 0.96). The estimates were similar when we restricted to invasive endometrial cancers, but not when we further restricted to endometroid adenocarcinomas.The positive association we observed between talc use and uterine cancer risk is consistent with findings from previous prospective cohort studies of endometrial cancer. The relationships between uterine cancer and both douching and talc use merit further consideration, particularly as both exposures are preventable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608347>Metabolomics for improved treatment monitoring of phenylketonuria: urinary biomarkers for non-invasive assessment of dietary adherence and nutritional deficiencies.</a></h1><p>Management of phenylketonuria (PKU) requires lifelong restriction of phenylalanine (Phe) intake using specialized medical foods to prevent neurocognitive impairment in affected patients. However, dietary adherence is challenging to maintain while ensuring adequate nutrition, which can lead to sub-optimal clinical outcomes. Metabolomics offers a systematic approach to identify new biomarkers of disease progression in PKU when using urine as a surrogate for blood specimens that is more accurate than self-reported diet records. Herein, the plasma and urine metabolome of a cohort of classic PKU patients (median age = 11 years; n = 22) mainly prescribed (78%) a Phe-restricted diet were characterized using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Overall, there was good mutual agreement between plasma Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations measured from PKU patients when using an amino acid analyzer based on UPLC-UV as compared to MSI-CE-MS with a mean bias of 12% (n = 82). Longitudinal measurements of recently diagnosed PKU infants (n = 3) revealed good long-term regulation of blood Phe with dietary management, and only occasional episodes exceeding the recommended therapeutic range (>360 μM) unlike older PKU patients. Plasma metabolomic studies demonstrated that non-adherent PKU patients had lower circulating concentrations of Tyr, arginine, -aminobutyric acid, and propionylcarnitine (q < 0.05, FDR) that were inversely correlated to Phe (r ≈ -0.600 to -0.830). Nontargeted metabolite profiling also revealed urinary biomarkers associated with poor dietary adherence among PKU patients, including elevated concentrations of catabolites indicative of Phe intoxication (e.g., phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, hydroxyphenylacetic acid). Additionally, PKU patients with poor blood Phe control had lower excretion of urinary compounds derived from co-metabolism of Tyr due to  activity (e.g., cresol sulfate, phenylsulfate), as well as several metabolites associated with inadequate nutrient intake, including low carnitine and B vitamin status (e.g., folic acid, vitamin B12). Interestingly, an unknown urinary metabolite was strongly correlated with Phe excretion in PKU patients (r = 0.861), which was subsequently identified as imidazole lactic acid when using high resolution MS/MS. Overall, urine profiling offers a non-invasive approach for better treatment monitoring of individual PKU patients, which can also guide the design of novel therapies that improve adherence to Phe-restricted diets without acquired nutritional deficiencies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600928>Prevalence of Resistance to β-Lactam Antibiotics and  Genes Among Commensal  Isolates from Respiratory  in Poland.</a></h1><p>(1) Background: Beta-lactams are the most frequently used antimicrobials, and are the first-line drugs in many infectious diseases, e.g., pneumonia, otitis media.

This review aims to 1) describe the physiologic aspects of collaborative bile acid metabolism by the host and gut ; ) to evaluate how gut microbes influence bile acid pools, and in turn how bile acid pools modulate the gut microbial community structure; 3) to compare species differences in bile acid pools; and lastly, 4) discuss the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) administration, a common therapeutic bile acid, on the gut -bile acid-host axis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636122>Gut microbiome-derived β-glucuronidases are components of the estrobolome that reactivate estrogens.</a></h1><p>Gut microbial β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes have been suggested to be involved in the estrobolome, the collection of microbial reactions involving estrogens. Furthermore, bacterial GUS enzymes within the gastrointestinal tract have been postulated to contribute to hormone-driven cancers. However, to date, there has been no experimental evidence to support these hypotheses. Here, we provide the first in vitro analysis of the ability of 35 GUS enzymes from the human gut microbiome to reactivate two distinct estrogen glucuronides, estrone-3-glucuronide and estradiol-17-glucuronide, to estrone and estradiol, respectively. We show that certain members within the loop 1, mini-loop 1, and FMN-binding classes of gut microbial GUS enzymes can reactivate estrogens from their inactive glucuronides. We present molecular insights into key interactions that facilitate these catalytic processes and present the structures of two human gut microbiome-derived GUS enzymes associated with the estrobolome at .-.7 Å resolutions. Further, we demonstrate that estrogen reactivation by loop 1-type bacterial GUS enzymes can be inhibited both in purified enzymes and in fecal preparations of mixed murine fecal . However, in spite of these in vitro and ex vivo findings, a loop 1 GUS-specific inhibitor could not reduce tumor development in the PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. These findings confirm that gut microbial GUS enzymes participate in the estrobolome. However, they also suggest that the estrobolome is a multidimensional set of ongoing processes within the mammalian gastrointestinal tract that likely involves many enzymes, including several distinct GUS proteins.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626319>A Comparison of Pneumococcal Nasopharyngeal Carriage in Very Young Fijian Infants Born by Vaginal or Cesarean Delivery.</a></h1><p>Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage is a prerequisite for pneumococcal disease. The main transmission route is from toddlers, who commonly carry pneumococci. However, neonatal pneumococcal disease case reports suggest that vertical pneumococcal transmission may also occur.To describe and compare pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage and density by infant mode of delivery in young Fijian infants.Annual cross-sectional surveys were performed in Suva, Fiji, before the introduction of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10), from September 14 to December 20, 2012, and after PCV10 was introduced, from July 11 to November 19, 2013; July 15 to December 9, 2014; and August 13 to November 19, 2015. Caregivers of 2006 infants aged 5 to 8 weeks participated in the surveys. Statistical analysis was performed from May 24, 2018, to August 12, 2019.Caregivers provided data on infant mode of delivery and demographics via interviewer-led survey.Pneumococci in swab samples were detected and quantified by lytA quantitative polymerase chain reaction with molecular serotyping by microarray. Pneumococci were categorized as PCV10 or non-PCV10 serotypes.Of the 2006 infants (976 girls and 1030 boys; mean [SD] age, 6.1 [0.02] weeks]), 1742 (86.8%) were born vaginally and 264 were born by cesarean delivery. Infants delivered vaginally, compared with those born by cesarean delivery, had a higher prevalence of overall pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage (470 of 1722 [27.3%; 95% CI, 25.%-29.4%] vs 47 of 260 [18.1%; 95% CI, 13.6%-23.3%]; P = .002), PCV10 carriage (113 of 1698 [6.7%; 95% CI, 5.5%-7.9%] vs 8 of 256 [3.1%; 95% CI, 1.4%-6.1%]; P = .03), and non-PCV10 carriage (355 of 1698 [20.9%; 95% CI, 19.0%-22.9%] vs 38 of 256 [14.8%; 95% CI, 10.7%-19.8%]; P = .02), and had higher median densities of overall pneumococci (4.9 log10 genome equivalents [GE]/mL [interquartile range, 4.8-5.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4.5 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.1-4.6 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 pneumococci (4.9 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.7-5.0 log10 GE/mL] vs 4.4 log10 GE/mL [interquartile range, 4.0-4.7 log10 GE/mL]; P = .01). Vaginal delivery was associated with overall (adjusted odds ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.10-.23]; P = .01) and non-PCV10 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.01-.20]; P = .04]) pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage. Vaginal delivery was not associated with PCV10 carriage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.80-3.51]; P = .17). After adjustment, vaginal delivery was not associated with density.Pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence and density were higher in infants delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by cesarean birth. After adjustment, vaginal delivery was associated with pneumococcal carriage. Differences in carriage by mode of delivery may be due to differential exposure to the vaginal  during delivery and the effect of intrapartum antibiotics during cesarean delivery on the infant microbiome. Our findings also raise the hypothesis that vertical transmission may contribute to pneumococcal acquisition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571038>Nest composition, stable isotope ratios and  unravel the feeding behaviour of an inquiline termite.</a></h1><p>Termites are eusocial insects having evolved several feeding, nesting and reproductive strategies. Among them, inquiline termites live in a nest built by other termite species: some of them do not forage outside the nest, but feed on food stored by the host or on the nest material itself. In this study, we characterized some dimensions of the ecological niche of Cavitermes tuberosus (Termitidae: Termitinae), a broad-spectrum inquiline termite with a large neotropical distribution, to explain its ecological success. We used an integrative framework combining ecological measures (physico-chemical parameters, stable isotopic ratios of N and C) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene to identify bacterial communities and to analyse termites as well as the material from nests constructed by different termite hosts (the builders). Our results show that (1) nests inhabited by C. tuberosus display a different physico-chemical composition when compared to nests inhabited by its builder alone; () stable isotopic ratios suggest that C. tuberosus feeds on already processed, more humified, nest organic matter; and (3) the gut microbiomes cluster by termite species, with the one of C. tuberosus being much more diverse and highly similar to the one of its main host, Labiotermes labralis. These results support the hypothesis that C. tuberosus is a generalist nest feeder adapted to colonize nests built by various builders, and explain its ecological success.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h1><p>Evidence has proven that the gut  is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host energy harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. -Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed. Theabrownin has high potential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622235> sp. nov., isolated from beef.</a></h1><p>Two  isolates derived independently from raw refrigerated processing meat of bovine origin intended for the manufacture of Bologna-type cooked sausage could be distinguished from other known species in subsequent phylogenetic analyses.

Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.5% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.5%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues. Our data are consistent with routine use of  and  combination probiotics having a beneficial effect on NEC prevention in very preterm neonates.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal  in order to achieve, restore, and maintain favorable balance in the ecosystem, and the activity of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract is necessary for the improved health condition of the host. The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and immunity.A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at 5 weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time ). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods. The results confirmed that the probiotic supplementation was effective in increasing the overall blood biomarkers levels of vitamins, calcium, and mineral absorption from baseline to 10 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo.Probiotics may be suggested as supplements to improve biomarkers serum concentration if administered for a period of at least ≥ 5 weeks.

The gut of children with optimum growth is enriched in certain species, especially  and  and ommensal  both contribute to formation of acidic stool, and an elevated faecal pH indicates reduction of these species in the gut. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of faecal pH with childhood stunting.In this cross-sectional study, 100 children with length-for-age Z score (LAZ) <-1 aged between 12 and 18 months were enrolled from the ongoing Bangladesh Environmental Enteric Dysfunction study conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. LAZ was measured by anthropometry and data on factors affecting linear growth were recorded. Faecal pH measurement was done using pH metre on freshly collected non-diarrhoeal faecal samples following standard procedure. Multiple quantile regression was done to quantify the relation between faecal pH and LAZ scores.The mean LAZ and faecal pH of the children were -.12±0.80 and 5.84±1.11, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed a statistically significant negative correlation between stool pH and the LAZ scores (p<0.01). After inclusion of other factors affecting linear growth into the regression model, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between faecal pH and LAZ score (p<0.01).Elevated faecal pH was found to have a significant association with stunted growth.

Given the importance of the spinal cord as a locomotor control center and the public perception that paralysis is the defining feature of SCI, this "spinal-centric" focus is logical. Unfortunately, such a focus likely will not yield new discoveries that reverse other devastating consequences of SCI including cardiovascular and metabolic disease, bladder/bowel dysfunction and infection. The current review considers how SCI changes the physiological interplay between the spinal cord, the gut and the immune system. A suspected culprit in causing many of the pathological manifestations of impaired spinal cord-gut-immune axis homeostasis is the gut . After SCI, the composition of the gut  changes, creating a chronic state of gut "dysbiosis". To date, much of what we know about gut dysbiosis was learned from 16S-based taxonomic profiling studies that reveal changes in the composition and abundance of various bacteria. However, this approach has limitations and creates taxonomic "blindspots". Notably, only bacteria can be analyzed. Thus, in this review we also discuss how the application of emerging sequencing technologies can improve our understanding of how the broader ecosystem in the gut is affected by SCI. Specifically, metagenomics will provide researchers with a more comprehensive look at post-injury changes in the gut virome (and mycome). Metagenomics also allows changes in microbe population dynamics to be linked to specific microbial functions that can affect the development and progression of metabolic disease, immune dysfunction and affective disorders after SCI. As these new tools become more readily available and used across the research community, the development of an "ecogenomic" toolbox will facilitate an Eco-Systems Biology approach to study the complex interplay along the spinal cord-gut-immune axis after SCI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that manipulation of the  in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the  in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the  revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which -derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that -derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires -derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612240>Quorum sensing for population-level control of bacteria and potential therapeutic applications.</a></h1><p>Quorum sensing (QS), a microbial cell-to-cell communication process, dynamically regulates a variety of metabolism and physiological activities.

We sequenced the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of gut  and detected metabolites based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in faecal samples.The composition of both the gut  and faecal metabolites changed significantly with T2D patients. The abundance of Proteobacteria and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were higher in T2D patients than healthy subjects, and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids and lipids of T2D patients were significantly disordered. Moreover, the abundances of certain SCFA-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae etc.) were significantly increased in T2D patients, while the faecal SCFAs concentrations were significantly decreased. It's suggested that the role of SCFA-producing bacteria was not simply to produce SCFAs. Then we identified 44 microbial modules to explore the correlations between the gut  and metabolic traits.

A total of 60 multiparous sows (4 ±1 parity; Landrace × Yorkshire) were fed either control diet (sCON, n=30) or a diet containing 400 mg kg-1 MOS (sMOS, n = 30) from d 86 of gestation until weaning (d 20 of postpartum). On d 7 of age, offspring (Duroc × Landrace Yorkshire) were assigned within sow treatments and fed control diet (pCON) or diet containing 800 mg kg-1 MOS (pMOS) for 28 days (end at 35 d of age), resulting in four piglet diet groups (n=15 litters per diet group): sCON-pCON, sCON-pMOS, sMOS-pCON, and sMOS-pMOS. Results found that piglet diet MOS increased or tend to increase Lactobacillus amount in the ileum digesta (P < 0.01) and jejunum digesta (P = 0.07), respectively; while tend to decrease E. coli amount in jejunum digesta (P =0.06) and cecum digesta (P = 0.08). Both sow and piglet diets add MOS (sMOS-pMOS) increased Lactobacillus amount but decreased E. coli amount in jejunum digesta (P < 0.05) compared with the sCON-pCON diet group. In addition, sow diet MOS (rather than piglet diet MOS) increased sIgA content in piglet jejunum mucosa compared with control (P = 0.04). Sow diet MOS decreased toll-like receptor  (TLR2), TLR4 and interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA levels (P < 0.05) and tended to decrease nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65) mRNA level (P = 0.07) in piglet intestinal lymphatic. The interaction effects between sow and piglet diets were found on the mRNA levels of NF- κB p65 (P = 0.03) and IL-8 (P = 0.02) in piglet jejunum. Finally, the sow diet MOS decreased proinflammatory cytokines IL- (P < 0.01) and IL-4 (P < 0.01) concentrations in piglet serum. Piglets diet MOS decreased the contents of IL- (P = 0.03), IL-4 (P = 0.01) and interferon (IFN)-γ (P < 0.01) while increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (P < 0.01) content in serum. The interaction effects between sows and piglet diets on IL-4 (P = 0.02), IL-10 (P < 0.01) and IFN-γ (P = 0.08) were observed. In conclusion, sow and/or piglet diet MOS could improve intestinal , enhance intestinal mucosal immune competence, and suppress intestinal and systemic inflammation in the piglet.© The Author(s) 2019.

After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner.

The Cln3 mouse model displays characteristic features of the human disease including motor deficits. When mice received acidified drinking water (pH .5-.9) instead of normal tap water (pH 8.4) for several generations, the motor skills of Cln3 mice normalized to control levels, indicating a disease-modifying effect of acidified water. Here we investigated if acidified water administered from postnatal day 21 has therapeutic benefits in Cln3 mice. Indeed, acidified water temporarily attenuated the motor deficits, had beneficial effects on behavioral parameters and prevented microglial activation in the brain of Cln3 mice. Interestingly, in control mice, acidified drinking water caused brain region-specific glial activation and significant changes in motor performance. Since the gut  can influence neurological functions, we examined it in our disease model and found that the gut  of Cln3 mice was markedly different from control mice, and acidified water differentially changed the gut  composition in these mice. These results indicate that acidified water may provide therapeutic benefit to CLN3 Batten disease patients, and that the pH of drinking water is a major environmental factor that strongly influences the results of murine behavioral and pathological studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673418>Cartilage-gut-microbiome axis: a new paradigm for novel therapeutic opportunities in osteoarthritis.</a></h1><p>DNA of gut  can be found in synovium of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This finding could result from the translocation of still alive bacteria from gut to joints through blood, since the diversified dormant  of healthy human blood can be transiently resuscitated in vitro. The recent finding of gut microbiome in human cartilage, which differed between osteoarthritis and controls, suggests that a similar trafficking of dead or alive bacteria from gut  physiologically occurs between gut and epiphysial bone marrow. Subchondral  could enhance cartilage healing and transform components of deep cartilage matrix in metabolites with immunosuppressive properties. The differences of microbiome observed between hip and knee cartilage, either in osteoarthritis or controls, might be the counterpart of subtle differences in chondrocyte metabolism, themselves in line with differences in DNA methylation according to joints. Although bacteria theoretically cannot reach chondrocytes from the surface of intact cartilage, some bacteria enter the vascular channels of the epiphysial growth cartilage in young animals, whereas others can infect chondrocytes in vitro. In osteoarthritis, the early osteochondral plate angiogenesis may further enhance the ability of  to locate close to the deeper layers of cartilage, and this might lead to focal dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation, cartilage degradation, epigenetic changes in chondrocytes and worsening of osteoarthritis. More studies on cartilage across different ethnic groups, weights, and according to age, are needed, to confirm the silent presence of gut  close to human cartilage and better understand its physiologic and pathogenic significance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Indian mustards were grown for two months in V-contaminated soil with three treatments (control, inoculation with Serratia PRE01 or Arthrobacter PRE05). Inoculation with PRE01 and PRE05 increased organic matter content by 6.94% and 4.6% respectively and significantly increased bioavailability of heavy metals in rhizosphere soils. Despite the endophyte inocula failed to flourish as stable endophytes, they significantly affected the specific composition and diversity of endophytic bacterial communities in roots, with no significant effect on rhizosphere bacterial communities. The test strains could greatly increase plant growth promotion-related biomarkers in the endosphere, especially those associated with Pseudomonas and Microbacterium genera. PICRUSt analysis predicted high relative abundances of functional genes related to environmental information processing especially in the endophytic . More biomass production (12.0%-17.4%) and total metals uptake (24.%-32.0%) were acquired in inoculated treatments. We conclude that endophyte PRE01 or PRE05 inoculation could effectively enhance phytoremediation of V-contaminated soil by improving the rhizosphere and endosphere microecology without causing any ecological damage.Copyright © 2019.

Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut , while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut , and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and .5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; () effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut  in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut , gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut . There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  ( = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut  response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644908>Cutaneous Immune Cell- Interactions Are Controlled by Epidermal JunB/AP-1.</a></h1><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a multi-factorial skin disease with a complex inflammatory signature including type  and type 17 activation. Although colonization by S. aureus is common in AD, the mechanisms rendering an organism prone to dysbiosis, and the role of IL-17A in the control of S. aureus-induced skin inflammation, are not well understood. Here, we show several pathological aspects of AD, including type /type 17 immune responses, elevated IgE, barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and importantly, spontaneous S. aureus colonization in JunB mice, with a large transcriptomic overlap with AD. Additionally, using Rag1 mice, we demonstrate that adaptive immune cells are necessary for protection against S. aureus colonization. Prophylactic antibiotics, but not antibiotics after established dysbiosis, reduce IL-17A expression and skin inflammation, examined using Il17a-eGFP reporter mice. Mechanistically, keratinocytes lacking JunB exhibit higher MyD88 levels in vitro and in vivo, previously shown to regulate S. aureus colonization. In conclusion, our data identify JunB as an upstream regulator of -immune cell interactions and characterize the IL-17A response upon spontaneous dysbiosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

TSG has protective effects on the liver, reduces cholesterol and possesses anti-oxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-atherosclerotic properties. However, the pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action of Polygonum multiflorum on atherosclerosis (AS) have not been studied yet.The aim of this research was to study the effects of Polygoni Multiflori Radix Praeparata (PMRP) and its major active chemical constituent TSG on AS in ApoE-deficient (ApoE) mice fed with high fat diets to provide a scientific basis in the use of PMRP and TSG against cardiovascular diseases.High fat diet induced AS in ApoE mice were treated with PMRP, TSG (low and high doses), and simvastatin (SIM) for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment, mouse serum lipid levels, triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured by an oxidase method (other indicators were determined by ELISA), while the content in oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and the expression of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the serum and aortic samples were measured by ELISA. Atherosclerotic plaque morphology was evaluated by oil red O in thoracic aorta. In addition, 16S rDNA-V4 hypervariable region genome sequence of all microbes in the fecal sample from each group was analyzed to evaluate potential structure changes in the gut  after treatment with PMRP and TSG.TSG markedly inhibited AS plaque formation in ApoE mice. Furthermore, PMRP and TSG improved lipid accumulation by reducing TG and ox-LDL levels. TSG inhibited inflammation by the down-regulation of IL-6, TNF-α, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 expression in serum, and PMRP inhibited inflammation by reducing VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and CCRA expression in aortic tissue. In addition, TSG reduced or prevented AS by the regulation of the composition of the overall gut , such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, Proteobacteria phyla, Akkermensia genera and Helicobacter pylori.PMRP and TSG improved lipid accumulation and inflammation, and regulated the intestinal microbial imbalance in ApoE mice. TSG exerted a preventive effect in the development and progression of AS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Statistical analyses focused on intraindividual and interindividual bacterial diversity and identification of differentially abundant taxa.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls had similar microbiome profiles of the gut  regarding intraindividual bacterial diversity, OTU distribution, ratio between regional and local species diversity when testing all OTUs, and genera with a relative abundance greater than 0.5%. Similarly, the subgroup of NMDAR encephalitis patients with an ovarian teratoma (n = 3) showed no differences in microbiome variation compared with controls. Patients in the acute encephalitis stage (n = 8) showed significant differences in the numbers of , , , , and ; however, significance was lost after correction for multiple testing.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls both had a normal gut microbiome. The lack of overabundance of certain bacterial species in patients suggests that microbiome changes are no major contributors to the pathogenesis, disease course, or prognosis in NMDAR encephalitis. Despite the small sample size and heterogeneous groups, findings indicate differences to other neuroimmunologic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Improvements in our knowledge of the diseases' underlying biology have illuminated previously unrecognized aspects of their pathogenesis. Importantly, the key role of the oral (supragingival and subgingival) microbiome is now well recognized, and both diseases are now best understood as dysbiotic. From a host susceptibility standpoint, some progress has been made in dissecting the "hyperinflammatory" trait and other pathways of susceptibility underlying periodontitis, and novel susceptibility loci have been reported for dental caries. Nevertheless, there is a long road to the translation of these findings and the realization of precision oral health. There is promise and hope that the rapidly increasing capacity of generating multiomics data layers and the aggregation of study samples and cohorts comprising thousands of participants will accelerate the discovery and translation processes. A first key element in this process has been the identification and interrogation of biologically informed disease traits-these "deep" or "precise" traits have the potential of revealing biologically homogeneous disease signatures and genetic susceptibility loci that might present with overlapping or heterogeneous clinical signs. A second key element has been the formation of international consortia with the goals of combining and harmonizing oral health data of thousands of individuals from diverse settings-these "wide" collaborative approaches leverage the power of large sample sizes and are aimed toward the discovery or validation of genetic influences that would otherwise be impossible to detect. Importantly, advancements via these directions require an unprecedented engagement of systems biology and team science models. The article highlights novel insights into the molecular basis of dental caries and chronic periodontitis that have been gained from recent and ongoing studies involving "deep" and "wide" analytical approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649627>Composition and Drivers of Gut Microbial Communities in Arctic-Breeding Shorebirds.</a></h1><p>Gut  can have important effects on host health, but explanatory factors and pathways that determine gut microbial composition can differ among host lineages. In mammals, host phylogeny is one of the main drivers of gut , a result of vertical transfer of  during birth. In birds, it is less clear what the drivers might be, but both phylogeny and environmental factors may play a role. We investigated host and environmental factors that underlie variation in gut  composition in eight species of migratory shorebirds. We characterized bacterial communities from 375 fecal samples collected from adults of eight shorebird species captured at a network of nine breeding sites in the Arctic and sub-Arctic ecoregions of North America, by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Firmicutes (55.4%), Proteobacteria (13.8%), Fusobacteria (10.%), and Bacteroidetes (8.1%) dominated the gut  of adult shorebirds. Breeding location was the main driver of variation in gut  of breeding shorebirds (  = 11.6%), followed by shorebird host species (  = 1.8%), and sampling year (  = 0.9%), but most variation remained unexplained. Site variation resulted from differences in the core bacterial taxa, whereas rare, low-abundance bacteria drove host species variation. Our study is the first to highlight a greater importance of local environment than phylogeny as a driver of gut  composition in wild, migratory birds under natural conditions.Copyright © 2019 Grond, Santo Domingo, Lanctot, Jumpponen, Bentzen, Boldenow, Brown, Casler, Cunningham, Doll, Freeman, Hill, Kendall, Kwon, Liebezeit, Pirie-Dominix, Rausch and Sandercock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659420>Effects of sialylated lactulose on the mouse intestinal microbiome using Illumina high-throughput sequencing.</a></h1><p>Sialylated oligosaccharides are known to have beneficial effects, such as increasing the level of bifidobacteria, reducing the levels of blood endotoxin and blood ammonia, and enhancing the body's immune system. However, it is unknown whether sialylated lactuloses have modulatory effects on the intestinal . In this study, 60 healthy mice were randomly divided into six groups, namely, a normal control group, a lactulose group, a Kdn-α,3-lactulose group, a Kdn-α,6-lactulose group, a Neu5Ac-α,3-lactulose group, and a Neu5Ac-α,6-lactulose group. After 14 days of lactulose administration, the feces of three mice from each group were collected, and the intestinal  were detected by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the sialylated lactulose groups, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased. At the family level, sialylated lactulose intervention decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidales S24-7 group and Helicobacteraceae and enhanced the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, which reflects the modulatory effect of sialylated lactulose on intestinal . Diversity analysis indicated that the index of Chao was higher in the sialylated lactulose groups than in the normal control group, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were higher in the Kdnα-,6-lactulose group and the Neu5Ac-α,3-lactulose group than in the normal control group. The results of the intestinal  sample composition indicated that there were differences between the sialylated lactulose groups and the normal control group. Thus, sialylated lactulose could be used as a functional food component with potential therapeutic applications in manipulating intestinal  to exert beneficial effects on the host's health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636780>Influence of the Lung  Dysbiosis in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations: The Controversial Use of Corticosteroid and Antibiotic Treatments and the Role of Eosinophils as a Disease Marker.</a></h1><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating lung disease associated with loss of lung function, poorer quality of life, co-morbidities, significant mortality, and higher health care costs. Frequent acute exacerbations of COPD are sudden worsening of symptoms, the nature of which is associated with bacterial or viral infections. However, one-third of exacerbations remain of undetermined origin. Although it is largely discussed and controversial, current guidelines recommend treatment of exacerbations with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and systemic corticosteroids; this is despite being associated with limited benefits in term of reducing mortality, side effects and without paying attention to the heterogeneity of these exacerbations. Increasing evidence suggests that the lung  plays an important role in COPD and numerous studies have reported differences in the  between healthy and disease states, as well as between exacerbations and stable COPD, leading to the hypothesis that frequent acute exacerbation is more likely to experience significant changes in lung  composition. These findings will need further examination to explain the causes of lung dysbiosis, namely microbial composition, the host response, including the recruitment of eosinophils, lifestyle, diet, cigarette smoking and the use of antibiotics and corticosteroids. It is now important to assess: 1) Whether alterations in the lung  contribute to disease pathogenesis, especially in exacerbations of unknown origin; ) The role of eosinophils; and 3) Whether the  of the lung can be manipulated therapeutically to improve COPD exacerbation event and disease progression. In summary, we hypothesize that the alterations of the lung  may explain the undetermined origins of exacerbations and that there is an urgent need to facilitate the design of intervention studies that aim at conserving the lung microbial flora.Copyright 2019, Toraldo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649632>Plant Growth and Soil Microbial Impacts of Enhancing Licorice With Inoculating Dark Septate Endophytes Under Drought Stress.</a></h1><p>This study mainly aimed to investigate the effects of dark septate endophytes (DSE) (, , and ) on the growth and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil of a medicinal plant, licorice (), grown in the non-sterile soil under drought stress. The results showed that three DSE strains could effectively colonize the plant roots and form a strain-dependent symbiosis with licorice. Although drought stress declined the growth of licorice plants, these decreases were partly recovered by DSE inoculation. Specifically, the inoculation of  and  significantly increased the biomass and glycyrrhizin content, whereas  and  increased glycyrrhizic acid content of host plants under drought stress. However, the inoculation of  showed significant negative effects on the shoot, root, and total biomass of licorice plants. In addition, the effects of DSE inoculation on the morphological, photosynthetic, and antioxidant parameters of licorice plants, and mineral nutrient and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil were dependent on the DSE species as well as water regime. Interestingly, DSE inoculation significantly increased AM fungi content under drought stress. In addition, DSE associated with water had a significant positive influence on soil organic matter, available phosphorus (P), AM fungi, leaf number, soluble protein, SOD activity, total root length, root branch, and glycyrrhizic acid content. Based on the results of variance partitioning analysis, 17.0, 34.0, 14.9, 40.1, 28., and 18.0% variations in shoot morphology, root morphology, plant biomass, active ingredient, photosynthetic parameters, and antioxidant parameters, respectively, were attributable to the presence of certain soil microorganisms. These findings suggest the possibility that DSE inoculation improved the root development and nutrient absorption of host plants, altered the soil , and might also contribute to plant growth and survival under drought conditions. As  exhibited positive effects on the plant biomass, morphological and physiological parameters, and active ingredient content in licorice plants under drought stress, it was considered to be the best fungus for licorice cultivation. These results contribute to the understanding of the ecological function of DSE fungi in dryland agriculture.Copyright © 2019 He, Wang and Hou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640819>Laminarin rich extract improves growth performance, small intestinal morphology, gene expression of nutrient transporters, and the large intestinal microbial composition of piglets during the critical post-weaning period.</a></h1><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds which can prevent the post-weaning growth check and enhance gastrointestinal health in the absence of in-feed medications is an urgent priority for the swine industry. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of increasing dietary inclusion levels of laminarin in the first 14 days post-weaning on pig growth performance and weaning associated intestinal dysfunction. At weaning, 96 pigs (8.4 (SD 1.09) kg) (meatline boars x (large white x landrace sows) were blocked by live weight, litter and sex and randomly assigned to: 1) basal diet; ) basal + 100ppm laminarin; 3) basal + 200ppm laminarin; 4) basal + 300ppm laminarin (3 pigs/pen). The appropriate quantity of a laminarin rich extract (65% laminarin) was added to the basal diet to achieve the above dietary inclusion levels of laminarin. After 14 days of supplementation, 8 pigs from the basal group and the best performing laminarin group were euthanised for sample collection. The 300ppm laminarin group was selected as this group had higher ADFI compared to all other groups and higher ADG than the basal group (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased villus height in the duodenum and jejunum (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased the expression of SLC2A8/GLUT8 in the duodenum, SLC2A2/GLUT2, SLC2A7/GLUT7, SLC15A1/PEPT1 and FABP2 in the jejunum, and SLC16A1/MCT1 in the colon. Laminarin supplementation reduced Enterobacteriaceae numbers in the caecum (P<0.05), and increased lactobacilli numbers (P<0.05), total volatile fatty acid concentrations and the molar proportions of butyrate (P<0.01) in the colon. In conclusion, 300ppm laminarin from a laminarin rich extract has potential, as a dietary supplement, to improve performance and prevent post-weaning intestinal dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581743>Primary Outcomes of a Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial to Explore the Effects of a High Chlorophyll Dietary Intervention to Reduce Colon Cancer Risk in Adults: The Meat and Three Greens (M3G) Feasibility Trial.</a></h1><p>Preclinical and observational research suggests green leafy vegetables (GLVs) may reduce the risk of red meat (RM)-induced colonic DNA damage and colon cancer (CC). We sought to determine the feasibility of a high GLV dietary intervention in adults with an increased risk of CC () via a 12-week randomized controlled crossover trial. Participants were randomized to immediate or delayed (post-4-week washout) intervention groups. During the 4-week intervention period, participants were given frozen GLVs and counseled to consume one cooked cup equivalent daily. The primary outcomes were: accrual-recruiting 50 adults in 9 months; retention-retaining 80% of participants at completion; and adherence-meeting GLV intake goals on 90% of days. Adherence data were collected twice weekly and 24-h dietary recalls at each time point provided nutrient and food group measures. The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ) was completed to determine acceptability. On each of the four study visits, anthropometrics, stool, saliva, and blood were obtained. Fifty adults were recruited in 44 days. Participants were 48 ± 13 years of age, 62% female, and 80% Caucasian, with an average BMI at screening of 35.9 ± 5.1. Forty-eight (96%) participants were retained and completed the study. During the intervention phase, participants consumed GLVs on 88.8% of days; the adherence goal of one cup was met on 73.% of days. Dietary recall-derived Vitamin K and GLVs significantly increased for all participants during the intervention periods. Overall satisfaction did not differ between intervention and control periods ( = 0.214). This feasibility trial achieved accrual, retention and acceptability goals, but fell slightly short of the benchmark for adherence.

At week 26 of gestation, women were randomized to receive dietary advice from their doctor (n=45), or additionally receive a dietary intervention (n=45). The intervention included an educational workshop and  support calls aiming to align participants' diets with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increase intakes of prebiotic and probiotic foods.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × .0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata.

This study systematically reviews the effects of the oral intake of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on  spp. counts (colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) in oral and palatal samples. A literature search was conducted. Twelve studies, eight randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and four pre-post studies, resulted as eligible for the meta-analysis, which was performed through a Bayesian random-effects model. All studies analyzed probiotics, and none of them analyzed prebiotics or synbiotics. The treatments effects were measured in terms of odds ratio (OR) of OC (CFU/mL >10, 10, or 10). The meta-analytic OR was 0.71 (95% credibility interval (CrI): 0.37, 1.32), indicating a beneficial effect of treatment; the  index was 56.3%.

The rumen of ruminants expands in size with the colonization of  by  months of age. This process is promoted by alfalfa intervention. To elucidate the mechanism of this promotion, we performed transcriptomic analyses using a cohort of 23 lambs to evaluate the effects of starter diets plus alfalfa on the development of the rumen wall from the pre- to the postweaning period. The quantitative PCR analyses were used to validate selected genes that were differentially expressed in the transcriptome mapping. We found that several metabolic processes associated with rumen tissue development were affected by solid feed intake, with genes linked to the calcium signaling transduction pathway and the metabolism of pteridine-containing compounds and homocysteine metabolic process being upregulated in the group with alfalfa intervention. The results suggest that the pteridine-containing compounds and calcium signaling are targets for precise regulation of rumen development.Copyright © 2019 Yang, Chen, Cao, He, Wang, Luo and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602221>Dysbiosis of Gram-negative gut  and the associated serum lipopolysaccharide exacerbates inflammation in type  diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease.</a></h1><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent endotoxin present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, causes chronic immune responses associated with inflammation. In the present study, the association between LPS and the dysbiosis of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome was determined in patients with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (T2DM-CKD; stages 4 and 5, not on dialysis) compared with healthy individuals. Microbiome diversity was analyzed in patients with T2DM-CKD and healthy controls by sequencing the hypervariable sub-regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from stool samples. Serum samples were assayed by ELISA for LPS, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL6) and endothelin-1. A total of four gut Gram-negative phyla (Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia) were identified in the gut microbiome of the T2DM-CKD and control groups. Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in patients with T2DM-CKD when compared with controls (P<0.05). The levels of serum LPS were significantly increased in patients with T2DM-CKD compared with controls (P<0.05). Elevated serum LPS was significantly correlated with increased levels of TNFα, IL6 and CRP. The dysbiosis of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome of patients with T2DM-CKD may contribute to the elevated serum levels of LPS and the consequential effects on the inflammatory biomarkers in these patients. The association between the dysbiosis of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiome of patients with T2DM-CKD, increased LPS levels and the effects on inflammatory biomarkers may provide insight into potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the treatment of T2DM-CKD.Copyright: © Salguero et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587913>Symposium review: The uterine microbiome associated with the development of uterine disease in dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Until 2010, our knowledge of the uterine microbiome in cows that developed uterine disease relied almost exclusively on culture-dependent studies and mostly included cows with clinical endometritis (i.e., with purulent uterine discharge). Those studies consistently found a strong positive correlation between Trueperella pyogenes and clinical endometritis, whereas other pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Bacteroides spp. were also commonly cocultured. In contrast, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Bacillus spp. were usually isolated from healthy cows. Starting in 2010, culture-independent studies using PCR explored the microbiome of cows with metritis and clinical endometritis, and observed that E. coli was a pioneer pathogen that predisposed cows to infection with F. necrophorum, which was strongly associated with metritis, and to infection with T. pyogenes, which was strongly associated with clinical endometritis. Starting in 2011, culture-independent studies using metagenomic sequencing expanded our knowledge of the uterine microbiome. It has been shown that cows have bacteria in the uterus even before calving, they have an established uterine microbiome within 20 min of calving, and that the microbiome structure is identical between cows that develop metritis and healthy cows until  d postpartum, after which the bacterial structure of cows that developed metritis deviates in favor of greater relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria and lesser relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Tenericutes. The shift in the uterine microbiome in cows that develop metritis is characterized by a loss of heterogeneity and a decrease in bacterial richness. At the genus level, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium have the strongest association with metritis. At the species level, we observed that Bacteroides pyogenes, Porphyromonas levii, and Helcococcus ovis were potential emerging uterine pathogens. Finally, we have shown that the hematogenous route is a viable route of uterine infection with uterine pathogens. Herein, we propose that metritis is associated with a dysbiosis of the uterine  characterized by decreased richness, and an increase in Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, particularly Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut -derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy microbiome, specific functions of -derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new -based therapies to treat obesity and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the -host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut  Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h1><p>Gut  play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different  is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the  and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different  but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different  but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type  diabetes. The gut  in type  diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut  induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut . Still, these different gut  have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

Recently, it has been found that oral  are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral  and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, and psoriasis), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral  and intestinal  in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut  seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA.

Here we evaluate the responses to different levels of fat in the diet using both chow diet (CD, 13-18% fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD, 45-60% fat). We studied cohorts of BXD strains, both inbred parents C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (commonly known as B6 and D2, respectively), as well as B6D2 and D2B6 reciprocal F1 hybrids. The comparative impact of genetic and dietary factors was analyzed by profiling a range of phenotypes, most prominently their cecum bacterial composition. The parents of the BXDs and F1 hybrids express limited differences in terms of weight and body fat gain on CD. In contrast, the strain differences on HFD are substantial for percent body fat, with DBA/2J accumulating 12.5% more fat than C57BL/6J (P < 0.0001). The F1 hybrids born to DBA/2J dams (D2B6F1) have 10.6% more body fat (P < 0.001) than those born to C57BL/6J dams. Sequence analysis of the cecum  reveals important differences in bacterial composition among BXD family members with a substantial shift in composition caused by HFD. Relative to CD, the HFD induces a decline in diversity at the phylum level with a substantial increase in Firmicutes (+13.8%) and a reduction in Actinobacteria (-7.9%). In the majority of BXD strains, the HFD also increases cecal sIgA (P < 0.0001)-an important component of the adaptive immunity response against microbial pathogens. Host genetics modulates variation in cecum bacterial composition at the genus level in CD, with significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Oscillibacter mapped to Chr 3 (18.7-19. Mb, LRS = 21.4) and for Bifidobacterium mapped to Chr 6 (89.21-89.37 Mb, LRS = 19.4). Introduction of HFD served as an environmental suppressor of these QTLs due to a reduction in the contribution of both genera (P < 0.001). Relations among liver metabolites and cecum bacterial composition were predominant in CD cohort, but these correlations do not persist following the shift to HFD. Overall, these findings demonstrate the important impact of environmental/dietary manipulation on the relationships between host genetics, gastrointestinal bacterial composition, immunological parameters, and metabolites-knowledge that will help in the understanding of the causal sources of metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646072>Autoinducer- of gut , a potential novel marker for human colorectal cancer, is associated with the activation of TNFSF9 signaling in macrophages.</a></h1><p>: The interaction between the quorum sensing (QS) molecules of gut  and the immunity of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been investigated before. : We measured the concentration of autoinducer- (AI-) in samples of stool, colorectal tissue, saliva and serum of CRC patients, and compared this to AI- levels in colorectal adenoma (AD) and normal colon mucosa (NC).

We attempted to validate the hypothesis that low bacterial diversity increases the risk of mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients with septic shock seen at  medical center from 2016 through 2019 were included in this cohort study. Total DNA was isolated from stool, and high-throughput sequencing was performed. Clinical data were extracted from patient medical records and hospital databases. Patients were grouped by gut  bacterial diversity (measured by Shannon diversity index) on presentation. We used logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients with low Shannon diversity index. RESULTS Of the 150 patients enrolled in this study, low bacterial diversity (Shannon index <3.0) was found in 80 patients and normal diversity (Shannon index ≥3.0) was found in 70 patients. Low diversity was associated with a higher unadjusted mortality risk, compared to those with normal diversity (odds ratio [OR] .04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-.83). However, this result became non-significant after adjusting the confounding factors such as age, sex, severity of disease, comorbid status, usage of probiotics, enteral nutrition, and antimicrobial drugs (OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.55-.69).

Community composition and activity of plant-roots  can be either beneficial or deleterious to plant health. Shifting this equilibrium could then strongly affect plant productivity in anthropized areas. In this study, we tested whether repeated bioaugmentation with Proteobacteria influenced plant productivity and the microbial communities associated with the rhizosphere of four plant species growing in sediments contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs). A mesocosm experiment was performed in randomized block design with two factors: (1) presence or absence of four plants species collected from a sedimentation basin of a former petrochemical plant, and () bioaugmentation or not with a bacterial consortium composed of ten isolates of . Plants were grown in a greenhouse over 4 months. MiSeq amplicon sequencing, targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS, was used to assess microbial community structures of sediments from planted or unplanted microcosms. Our results showed that while bioaugmentation caused a significant shift in microbial communities, presence of plant and their species identity had a stronger influence on the structure of the microbiome in PHCs contaminated sediments. The outcome of this study provides knowledge on the diversity and behavior of rhizosphere microbes associated with indigenous plants following repeated bioaugmentation, underlining the importance of plant selection in order to facilitate their efficient management, in order to accelerate processes of land reclamation.Copyright © 2019 Dagher, de la Providencia, Pitre, St-Arnaud and Hijri.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577818>Highly diverse anaerobe-predominant vaginal  among HIV-infected pregnant women in Zambia.</a></h1><p>Vaginal dysbiosis has been shown to increase the risk of some adverse birth outcomes. HIV infection may be associated with shifts in the vaginal microbiome. We characterized microbial communities in vaginal swabs collected between 16-20 gestational weeks in the Zambian Preterm Birth Prevention Study to investigate whether HIV and its treatment alter the microbiome in pregnancy. We quantified relative abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and identified community state types (CST) by hierarchical clustering. Associations between exposures-HIV serostatus (HIV+ vs HIV-) and preconceptional ART (ART+ vs ART-)-and microbiome characteristics were tested with rank-sum, and by linear and logistic regression, accounting for sampling by inverse-probability weighting. Of 261 vaginal swabs, 256 (98%) had evaluable sequences; 98 (38%) were from HIV+ participants, 55 (56%) of whom had preconceptional ART exposure.

The dynamics of intestinal microflora in response to particulate pollutants is unclear. The present study investigated changes in the gut  related to pollutant exposure using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). DNA was extracted from fecal samples. Amplicon Generation and the quality control of PCR products were performed. PCR products was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data analysis included: operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering and species annotation, alpha diversity, beta diversity, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and the use of PICRUSt bioinformatics software. The microbial diversity of the SHR rats was inversely associated with exposure to pollutants. In terms of relative abundance, 24 bacterial genera and  genera in particular ( and ) significantly declined, and one genus () increased. Moreover, pollutant exposure was associated with the accumulation of genes from the gut  that are implicated in cardiovascular diseases. From the long-term exposure experiment, rats appeared to respond to pollutant injury. In conclusion, these results suggest that the effects of atmospheric pollutants on organisms are not limited to the respiratory tract, but also include the gastrointestinal tract.

Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of acetate (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.5), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls. The subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity among obese individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m ( = 0.0%). At the phylum level, the abundance of fecal  was reduced in obese compared to nonobese individuals, but the difference was not statistically significant (Bacteroidetes phylum, SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.73-0.01; Firmicutes phylum, SMD = -0.10, 95% CI = -0.31-0.10). The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of SCFA but not gut  richness at the phylum level. Additional well-designed studies with a considerable sample size are needed to clarify whether this association is causal, but it is also necessary to identify additional contributors to SCFA production, absorption, and excretion in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616668>Cardiovascular Risk in Fatty Liver Disease: The Liver-Heart Axis-Literature Review.</a></h1><p>According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 18 million deaths per year. Nevertheless, the worldwide prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as type  diabetes mellitus, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), also known to be common risk factors for CVD, have dramatically increased over the last decades. Chronic alcohol consumption is a major cause of chronic liver diseases (CLD) as well as being a major health care cost expenditure accounting for the spending of tremendous amounts of money annually. NAFLD has become one of the major diseases plaguing the world while standing as the most common cause of liver disease in the Western countries by representing about 75% of all CLD. Currently, the most common cause of death in NAFLD remains to be CVD. Several mechanisms have been suggested to be responsible for associating FLD with CVD through several mechanisms including low-grade systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipotoxicity and  dysbiosis which may also be influenced by other factors such as genetic and epigenetic variations. Despite of all this evidence, the exact mechanisms of how FLD can causally contribute to CVD are not fully elucidated and much remains unknown. Moreover, the current literature supports the increasing evidence associating FLD with several cardiovascular (CV) adverse events including coronary artery disease, increased subclinical atherosclerosis risk, structural alterations mainly left ventricular hypertrophy, increased epicardial fat thickness, valvular calcifications including aortic valve sclerosis and mitral annular calcification and functional cardiac modifications mainly diastolic dysfunction in addition to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrythmias and conduction defects including atrioventricular blocks and bundle branch blocks. Patients with FLD should be evaluated and managed accordingly in order to prevent further complications. Possible management methods include non-pharmacological strategies including life style modifications, pharmacological therapies as well as surgical management. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking FLD with an increased CV risk, in addition to associated CV adverse events and current management modalities.Copyright © 2019 Ismaiel and Dumitraşcu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627338>Intestinal  of Grass Carp Fed Faba Beans: A Comparative Study.</a></h1><p>Many reports of the intestinal  of grass carp have addressed the microbial response to diet or starvation or the effect of microbes on metabolism; however, the intestinal  of crisp grass carp has yet to be elucidated. Moreover, the specific bacteria that play a role in the crispiness of grass carp fed faba beans have not been elucidated. In the present study, 16S sequencing was carried out to compare the intestinal  in the fore-, mid- and hind-intestine segments of grass carp following feeding with either faba beans or formula feed. Our results showed that (1) the hind-intestine presented significant differences in diversity relative to the fore- or midintestine and () faba beans significantly increased the diversity of intestinal , changed the intestinal  structure (Fusobacteria was reduced from 64.26% to 18.24%, while Proteobacteria was significantly increased from 17.75% to 51.99%), and decreased the metabolism of energy, cofactors and vitamins in grass carp. Furthermore, at the genus and species levels,  accounted for 15.09% of the , and  and  constituted 3.41% and .99%, respectively, which indicated that  of the family Moraxellaceae contributed to changes in the intestinal  structure and could be used as a potential biomarker.

Here, we focus on the environmental influence of cohabitation on the gut  as well as whether these environmentally influenced microorganisms are associated with cardiometabolic and inflammatory burden. We perform this by investigating the gut  composition of various groups of related individuals including cohabitating monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, non-cohabitating MZ twin pairs and spouse pairs.A stronger correlation between alpha diversity was found in cohabitating MZ twins (45 pairs, r = 0.64, p = .21 × 10) than in non-cohabitating MZ twin pairs (121 pairs, r = 0.42, p = 1.35 × 10). Although the correlation of alpha diversity did not attain significance between spouse pairs (42 pairs, r = 0.23, p = 0.15), the correlation was still higher than those in the 209 unrelated pairs (r = - 0.015, p = 0.832). Bray-Curtis (BC) dissimilarity metrics showed cohabitating MZ twin pairs had the most similar gut  communities which were more similar than the BC values of non-cohabitating MZ twins (empirical p-value = 0.0103), cohabitating spouses (empirical p-value = 0.0194), and pairs of unrelated non-cohabitating individuals (empirical p-value< 0.00001). There was also a significant difference between the BC measures from the spouse pairs and those from the unrelated non-cohabitating individuals (empirical p-value< 0.00001). Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated between the various groups of interest and the results indicate the presence of OTUs with an environmental influence and one OTU that appeared to demonstrate genetic influences. One of the OTUs (Otu0190) was observed to have a significant association with both the cardiometabolic and inflammatory burden scores (p's < 0.05).Through the comparison of the  contents of MZ twins with varying cohabitation status and spousal pairs, we showed evidence of environmentally influenced OTUs, one of which had a significant association with cardiometabolic and inflammatory burden scores.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573841>Amelioration of metabolic syndrome by metformin associates with reduced indices of low-grade inflammation independently of the gut .</a></h1><p>Metformin beneficially impacts several aspects of metabolic syndrome including dysglycemia, obesity and liver dysfunction, thus making it a widely used front line treatment for early-stage type  diabetes, which is associated with these disorders. Several mechanisms of action for metformin have been proposed, including that it acts as anti-inflammatory agent, possibly as a result of its impact on intestinal . In accord with this possibility, we observed herein that, in mice with diet-induced metabolic syndrome, metformin is impacting the gut  by preventing its encroachment upon the host, a feature of metabolic syndrome in mice and humans. However, the ability of metformin to beneficially impact metabolic syndrome in mice was not impacted by ablation of gut  achieved by use of antibiotics or germfree mice. Rather, while  ablation itself suppressed diet-induced dysglycemia, other features of metabolic syndrome including obesity, hepatic steatosis, and low-grade inflammation were similarly suppressed by metformin in the presence or absence of gut . These results support a role for metformin's anti-inflammatory activity, irrespective of gut , in driving some of this drug's beneficial impacts on metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663195>Natural compulsive-like behaviour in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) is associated with altered gut  composition.</a></h1><p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric illness that significantly impacts affected patients, and available treatments yield suboptimal therapeutic response. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in psychiatric illness has emerged as a potential target for therapeutic exploration. However, studies concerning the role of the GBA in OCD are limited. To investigate whether a naturally occurring obsessive-compulsive-like phenotype in a rodent model, i.e. large nest-building in deer mice, is associated with perturbations in the gut microbiome, we investigated and characterized the gut  in specific pathogen free bred and housed large (LNB) and normal (NNB) nest building deer mice of both sexes (n = 11 per group, including 3 males and 8 females). Following baseline characterisation of nest building behaviour, a single faecal sample was collected from each animal and the gut  analysed. Our results reveal the overall microbial composition of LNB animals to be distinctly different compared to controls (PERMANOVA p < 0.05). While no genera were found to be significantly differentially abundant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the normal phenotype showed a higher loading of Prevotella and Anaeroplasma, while the OC-phenotype demonstrated a higher loading of Desulfovermiculus, Aestuariispira, Peptococcus and Holdemanella (cut-off threshold for loading at 0. in either the first or second component of the PCA). These findings not only provide proof-of-concept for continued investigation of the GBA in OCD, but also highlight a potential underlying etiological association between alterations in the gut  and the natural development of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviours.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661027>Influence of pig gut  on Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae susceptibility.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the influence of gut microbiome composition in modulating susceptibility to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in pigs. Thirty-two conventional M. hyopneumoniae free piglets were randomly selected from six different litters at 3 weeks of age and were experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae at 8 weeks of age. Lung lesion scores (LS) were recorded 4 weeks post-inoculation (12 weeks of age) from piglet lungs at necropsy. Fecal bacterial community composition of piglets at 3, 8 and 12 weeks of age were targeted by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The LS ranged from 0.3 to 43% with an evident clustering of the scores observed in piglets within litters. There were significant differences in species richness and alpha diversity in fecal microbiomes among piglets within litters at different time points (p < 0.05). The dissimilarity matrices indicated that at 3 weeks of age, the fecal  of piglets was more dissimilar compared to those from 8 to 12 weeks of age. Specific groups of bacteria in the gut that might predict the decreased severity of M. hyopneumoniae associated lesions were identified. The microbial shift at 3 weeks of age was observed to be driven by the increase in abundance of the indicator family, Ruminococcaceae in piglets with low LS (p < 0.05). The taxa, Ruminococcus_ having the highest richness scores, correlated significantly between litters showing stronger associations with the lowest LS (r = -0.49, p = 0.005). These findings suggest that early life gut  can be a potential determinant for M. hyopneumoniae susceptibility in pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611298>Scientific frontiers in faecal  transplantation: joint document of Asia-Pacific Association of Gastroenterology (APAGE) and Asia-Pacific Society for Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE).</a></h1><p>The underlying microbial basis, predictors of therapeutic outcome and active constituent(s) of faecal  transplantation (FMT) mediating benefit remain unknown. An international panel of experts presented key elements that will shape forthcoming FMT research and practice.Systematic search was performed, FMT literature was critically appraised and a 1-day round-table discussion was conducted to derive expert consensus on key issues in FMT research.16 experts convened and discussed five questions regarding (1) the role of donor and recipient microbial (bacteria, viruses, fungi) parameters in FMT; () methods to assess  alterations; (3) concept of keystone species and microbial predictors of FMT, (4) influence of recipient profile and antibiotics pretreatment on FMT engraftment and maintenance and (5) new developments in FMT formulations and delivery. The panel considered that variable outcomes of FMT relate to compositional and functional differences in recipient's , and likely donor-associated and recipient-associated physiological and genetic factors. Taxonomic composition of donor intestinal  may influence the efficacy of FMT in recurrent  infections and UC. FMT not only alters bacteria composition but also establishes trans-kingdom equilibrium between gut fungi, viruses and bacteria to promote the recovery of microbial homeostasis. FMT is not a one size fits all and studies are required to identify microbial components that have specific effects in patients with different diseases.FMT requires optimisation before their therapeutic promise can be evaluated for different diseases.

The gut  (GM) acts by shaping immune tolerance and regulating the Treg number and suppressive function, besides circulating neuropeptides, and other immune cells that play in concert through the gut-brain axis. Previous mouse models have shown an altered enteric flora in early stage ALS, pointing to a possible GM role in ALS pathogenesis. Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) is a well-known therapeutic intervention used to re-establish the proper microenvironment and to modulate enteric and systemic immunity.  We are going to perform a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial employing FMT as a therapeutic intervention for ALS patients (). Forty-two ALS patients, at an early stage, will be enrolled with a :1 allocation ratio (28 FMT-treated patients vs. 14 controls). Study duration will be 12 months per patient. Three endoscopic procedures for intestinal biopsies in FMT and control groups are predicted at baseline, month 6 and month 12; at baseline and at month 6 fresh feces from healthy donors will be infused at patients in the intervention arm. The primary outcome is a significant change in Treg number between FMT-treated patients and control arm from baseline to month 6. Secondary outcomes include specific biological aims, involving in-depth analysis of immune cells and inflammatory status changes, central and peripheral biomarkers of ALS, besides comprehensive analysis of the gut, saliva and fecal . Other secondary aims include validated clinical outcomes of ALS (survival, forced vital capacity, and modifications in ALSFRS-R), besides safety and quality of life.  We await FMT to increase Treg number and suppressive functionality, switching the immune system surrounding motorneurons to an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective status. Extensive analysis on immune cell populations, cytokines levels, and  (gut, fecal and saliva) will shed light on early processes possibly leading the degenerative ALS course.  This is the first trial with FMT as a potential intervention to modify immunological response to ALS and disease progression at an early stage.Copyright © 2019 Mandrioli, Amedei, Cammarota, Niccolai, Zucchi, D'Amico, Ricci, Quaranta, Spanu and Masucci.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578269>RelB Deficiency in Dendritic Cells Protects from Autoimmune Inflammation Due to Spontaneous Accumulation of Tissue T Regulatory Cells.</a></h1><p>Foxp3 regulatory T cells are well-known immune suppressor cells in various settings. In this study, we provide evidence that knockout of the  gene in dendritic cells (DCs) of C57BL/6 mice results in a spontaneous and systemic accumulation of Foxp3 T regulatory T cells (Tregs) partially at the expense of -reactive Tregs. Deletion of  does not fully recapitulate this phenotype, indicating that alternative NF-κB activation via the RelB/p52 complex is not solely responsible for Treg accumulation. Deletion of RelB in DCs further results in an impaired oral tolerance induction and a marked type  immune bias among accumulated Foxp3 Tregs reminiscent of a tissue Treg signature. Tissue Tregs were fully functional, expanded independently of IL-33, and led to an almost complete Treg-dependent protection from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, we provide clear evidence that RelB-dependent pathways regulate the capacity of DCs to quantitatively and qualitatively impact on Treg biology and constitute an attractive target for treatment of autoimmune diseases but may come at risk for reduced immune tolerance in the intestinal tract.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658673>Comparison of Different Invasive and Non-Invasive Methods to Characterize Intestinal  throughout a Production Cycle of Broiler Chickens.</a></h1><p>In the short life of broiler chickens, their intestinal  undergoes many changes. To study underlying biological mechanisms and factors that influence the intestinal  development, longitudinal data from flocks and individual birds is needed. However, post-mortem collection of samples hampers longitudinal data collection. In this study, invasively collected cecal and ileal content, cloacal swabs collected from the same bird, and boot sock samples and cecal droppings from the litter of the broilers' poultry house, were collected on days 0, , 7, 14 and 35 post-hatch. The different sample types were evaluated on their applicability and reliability to characterize the broiler intestinal . The  of 247 samples was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analyses of α and β measures showed a similar development of  composition of cecal droppings compared to cecal content. Furthermore, the composition of cecal content samples was comparable to that of the boot socks until day 14 post-hatch. This study shows that the value of non-invasive sample types varies at different ages and depends on the goal of the  characterization. Specifically, cecal droppings and boot socks may be useful alternatives for cecal samples to determine intestinal  composition longitudinally.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636419>Elucidation of a sialic acid metabolism pathway in mucus-foraging Ruminococcus gnavus unravels mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to the gut.</a></h1><p>Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)) is commonly found in the terminal location of colonic mucin glycans where it is a much-coveted nutrient for gut bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus. R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut  in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases ,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of ,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for ,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts ,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620482>Dietary administration of probiotics modulates non-specific immunity and gut  of Nile tilapia () cultured in low input ponds.</a></h1><p>Poor culture conditions in low input ponds make fish highly susceptible to infectious pathogens which lead to diseases and mortalities yet the effects of probiotics on immunity, gut  and microbiological quality of fish in low input ponds are unknown.

The fish were fed on diets supplemented with either  (1 × 10 CFU g) or  (1 × 10 CFU g) at six levels: Diet 0 (No probiotic);  at  g kg (Diet 1); 4 g kg (Diet ) and 6 g kg (Diet 3) and  at 5 g kg (Diet 4); 10 g kg (Diet 5) and 15 g kg (Diet 6) for 180 days. Results indicate that hemato-immunological parameters (hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) serum protein, albumin, globulin and lysozyme activity) were significantly higher in fish fed on probiotic treated diets compared to the control ( < 0.05). On the contrary, fish fed on Diet 6 presented significantly similar Hb and globulin values compared to the control (P > 0.05). Additionally, fish fed on probiotic treated diets retained the probiotics in their guts and lower microbial load was realized in their muscle ( < 0.05). In conclusion,  and  supplementation in diets of Nile tilapia reared in low input ponds improves immunity, manipulates gut  and enhances fish flesh quality.© 2019 The Author(s).

Two of the four rhinoceros species in human care, Sumatran rhinoceros () and black rhinoceros (), are susceptible, whereas the other two, white rhinoceros () and greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros (), are relatively resistant to IOD. Complex interrelationships exist between mammalian hosts, their indigenous gut , metabolome, physical condition, and iron availability. The goal of this study was to gain insight into these relationships within the family Rhinocerotidae. Specific objectives were to (1) characterize the gut microbiome and metabolome of four rhinoceros species; () compare the microbiome and metabolome of IOD-susceptible and IOD-resistant rhinoceros species; and (3) identify variation in the microbiome and metabolome associated with compromised health or disease in IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses. Fecal samples were collected from 31 rhinoceroses (Sumatran rhinoceros,  = 3; black rhinoceros,  = 6; GOH rhinoceros,  = 9; white rhinoceros,  = 13) located at five facilities, and matched fecal aliquots were processed for microbiome and metabolome analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Despite the phylogenetic disparity and dissimilar zoo diets of the hosts, the structure of the fecal  of the two IOD-susceptible rhinoceros species were more closely related to each other than to those of the two IOD-resistant species (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; IOD-susceptible vs. IOD-resistant -value < 0.001). In addition, IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses exhibited less microbial diversity than their IOD-resistant relatives (Shannon diversity; -value < 0.001) which could have health implications. Of note, the black rhinoceros was distinct among the four rhinoceros species with the most divergent fecal metabolome; interestingly, it contained higher concentrations of short chain fatty acids. Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in microbial community composition ( = 0.253 and 0.488, respectively) or fecal metabolomic profile ( = 0.634 and 0.332, respectively). Differences in the distal gut microbiomes between IOD-resistant and IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses support hypotheses that gut microbes play a role in host iron acquisition, and further studies and experiments to test these hypotheses are warranted.Copyright © 2019 Roth, Switzer, Watanabe-Chailland, Bik, Relman, Romick-Rosendale and Ollberding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612141>Administration of  KBL375 Causes Taxonomic and Functional Changes in Gut  Leading to Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h1><p>Gut  play an important role in immune responses and energy metabolism. In this study, we evaluated whether administration of  () KBL375 isolated from healthy Korean feces improves the atopic dermatitis using the house dust mite ()-induced atopic dermatitis (AD) mouse model. Administration of  KBL375 significantly decreased dermatitis score, ear and dorsal thickness, and serum immunoglobulin E level in AD-induced mice. Significant reductions in mast cells and eosinophils were discovered in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. T helper  cell-related cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31 significantly decreased, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or transforming growth factor-β increased in skin tissues from  KBL375-treated mice. In addition to phenotypic changes in skin tissues,  KBL375 treatment induced an increase in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell population in mesenteric lymph nodes. Taxonomic and functional analyses of gut  showed significantly higher cecum bacterial diversities and abundances including genus , and  in  KBL375-treated mice. Metabolic analysis of the cecum also showed significant changes in the levels of various amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine, serine, and tyrosine, as well as short chain fatty acids such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate in AD-induced mice due to  KBL375 treatment. These altered metabolites in AD-induced mice returned to the levels similar to those in control mice when treated with  KBL375. Therefore,  KBL375 could be useful for AD treatment by modulating the immune system and inducing various metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Kim, Jang, Han, Seo, Park, Lee and Ko.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620118>Dietary Fiber-Induced Microbial Short Chain Fatty Acids Suppress ILC2-Dependent Airway Inflammation.</a></h1><p>Group  Innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) contribute significantly to allergic inflammation.

Here we show that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, derived from fermentation of dietary fibers by the gut  inhibit pulmonary ILC2 functions and subsequent development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR). We further show that SCFAs modulate GATA3, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolytic metabolic pathways in pulmonary ILC2s.

No statistical difference in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found (Kruskal-Wallis FDR-p > 0.05) among the different areas, fields or localities. Richness and diversity indexes (observed OTUs, Chao1, Simpson and Shannon indexes) showed significant differences in the cotton-growing fields and in the agroclimatic zones, mainly in the Sudano-Sahelian area. OTUs from seven bacterial species that mediate refractoriness to Plasmodium infection in An. gambiae s.l were detected. The beta diversity analysis did not show any significant difference.

Nevertheless, exposure to CuO NPs for 21 days markedly increased the alpha-diversity of the gut  of Enchytraeus crypticus (P < 0.05) and shifted the gut microbial communities, with a significant decline in the relative abundance of the phylum Planctomycetes (from 37.26% to 19.80%, P < 0.05) and a significant elevation in the relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria (P < 0.05). The number of detected ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut significantly decreased from 45 in the Control treatment to 16 in the Cu(NO) treatment and 20 in the CuO NPs treatment. The abundance of ARGs in the Enchytraeus crypticus gut were also significantly decreased to 38.48% when exposure to Cu(NO) and 44.90% when exposure to CuO NPs (P < 0.05) compared with the controls. These results extend our understanding of the effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles on the gut  and resistome of soil invertebrates.Copyright © 2019.

Scientific research has established that oats can improve diet quality, reduce cholesterol, regulate satiety, and protect against carcinogenesis in the colon; however, determining the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health and the gut microbiome is a newer, evolving area of research. To better understand the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health in humans, a literature review with predefined search criteria was conducted using the PubMed database and keywords for common gastrointestinal health outcomes. Moreover, to examine the gastrointestinal effects of oats across the scientific spectrum, a similar search strategy was executed to identify animal studies. In vitro studies were identified from the reference lists of human and animal studies. A total of 8 human studies, 19 animal studies, and 5 in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence in humans shows beneficial effects of oats on gastrointestinal health, with supportive evidence provided by in vitro and animal studies. The effective dose of oats varies by type, although an amount providing .5 to .9 g of β-glucan per day was shown to decrease fecal pH and alter fecal bacteria. For oat bran, 40 to 100 g/d was shown to increase fecal bacterial mass and short-chain fatty acids in humans. Differences in study design, methodology, and type of oats tested make valid comparisons difficult. The identification of best practices for the design of oat studies should be a priority in future research, as the findings will be useful for determining how oats influence specific indices of gastrointestinal health, including the composition of the human gut microbiome.© The Author(s) 2019.

For this study, raw yak milk, qula, and fermented yak milk samples were collected from the Aba Tibetan autonomous region of China. The genus and species microbial composition of these samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and groEL gene amplicons, and the volatile profile of the samples was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated variation in abundance of  at the genus level among the fermented yak milk samples, with Lactobacillus as the most abundant genus in the majority of samples, ranging from 41.6 to 98.26%. The volatile profile of the samples varied among those collected from different villages. Correlations between bacterial composition and volatile compounds of the samples were also observed. Lactobacillus displayed a significant correlation with volatile compounds such as benzaldehyde, ,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and ethyl acetate, whereas the samples with relatively high abundance of Streptococcus and Lactococcus displayed relatively low contents of volatile compounds.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

The cause and treatment has not been wholly elucidated. Some reports infer that CG is mainly associated with dental infection but no firm or reliable microbiological evidence has been provided for a causative organism. This study aimed to evaluate whether microorganisms contribute to the etiology of CG in order to inform appropriate treatment op tions in clinic.Unstimulated saliva was collected from 15 CG patients who were diagnosed clinically and pathologically and 15 healthy controls (HC). DNA was extracted from the precipitate of the centrifuged saliva for 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing using the Miseq PE300 platform. The distribution of the microbiome between the two groups was compared.CG patients had a greater microbial flora that was more diverse than the HC. Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Actinomyces, Rothia, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, and Aggregatibacter had a significantly higher abundance in CG patients. In contrast, Streptococcus and Campylobacter were the most abundant genera in HC with a mean relative abundance of 63% and %, respectively. The microbiological network indicated that most of the bacteria that were enriched at greater levels in CG patients were likely to be Prevotella, Actinomyces, and Rothia. These have been shown to co-exist with other bacteria.The composition and structure of bacterial communities in CG patients were different from HC. Most of the genera observed in CG patients were associated with periodontitis and pulp infection. These findings might be helpful in understanding the etiology of CG.

Trophic interactions may be altered through climate-dependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of °C warmer climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits (body condition, gut ) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605197>The effect of inulin and resistant maltodextrin on weight loss during energy restriction: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded intervention.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the additive effects of combining energy restriction with dietary fibres on change in body weight and gut  composition.The study was a 12-week randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel intervention trial. A total of 116 overweight or obese participants were assigned randomly either to 10 g inulin plus 10 g resistant maltodextrin or to 20 g of placebo supplementation through 400 mL of milk a day, while on a - 500 kcal/day energy restricted diet.Altogether, 86 participants completed the intervention. There were no significant differences in weight loss or body composition between the groups. The fibre supplement reduced systolic (5.35 ± .4 mmHg, p = 0.043) and diastolic (.82 ± 1.3 mmHg, p = 0.047) blood pressure to a larger extent than placebo. Furthermore, a larger decrease in serum insulin was observed in the placebo group compared to the fibre group (- 26.0 ± 9. pmol/L, p = 0.006). The intake of fibre induced changes in the composition of gut  resulting in higher abundances of Parabacteroides and Bifidobacteria, compared to placebo. The effects on blood pressure and glucose metabolism were mainly observed in women, and could be attributed to a higher gut  diversity after intervention. Finally, the fibre group experienced a higher degree of gastrointestinal symptoms, which attenuated over time.Supplementation of inulin and resistant maltodextrin did not provide an additional weight loss during an energy-restricted diet, but reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Chitooligosaccharides (COS), are oligomer that are depolymerized from chitosan and possess a wide range of biological activities. In this study, the effects of COS on colorectal cancer (CRC) development were evaluated using azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) induced mouse model of CRC (CACM).

In this study, we aim to investigate whether L-Arabinose could inhibit colitis by modulating gut . L-Arabinose was administrated in mice daily in a DSS-induced colitis model. The histological analysis, disease index and the expression of inflammatory genes were measured. 16S-rRNA sequence analysis was performed to investigate gut . Intriguingly, we found that L-Arabinose could repress DSS-induced colitis and inhibit p38-/p65-dependent inflammation activation. Besides that, our data revealed that L-Arabinose modulated gut  disturbed by DSS treatment. Additionally, by antibiotic treatment, the perturbed gut  was responsible for the suppressive effects of L-Arabinose on DSS-induced colitis. Lastly, Caco- cells was used to confirm the protective effects of L-Arabinose. As expected, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory proteins in Caco- cells treated with L-Arabinose in absence or presence of TNFα. Our work suggested that L-Arabinose exert anti-inflammation effect in DSS-induced colitis. These beneficial effects may be related to the diversity and composition of the gut  regulated by L-Arabinose.

In the present study, we modulated fermentation rate in an in vitro human fecal fermentation model through applying chemical crosslinking modification to a type  resistant starch (i.e., high-amylose maize starch). Crosslinking modification decreased the gas production (an indicator of fermentation rate) of high-amylose maize starch throughout the whole fermentation progress. Butyrate production rate of crosslinked starches decreased gradually with the increase of crosslinking degree. Certain beneficial gut  such as genera of Blautia and Clostridiales members were remarkably promoted by starches with low and medium crosslinking degrees, whereas HAMS with high crosslinking degree obviously promoted the abundance of Bacteroides uniformis and Ruminococcus bromii. This finding reveals that crosslinking modification effectively controls the fermentation rate and highlights the modulation metabolite profiles and gut  composition through chemical modification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599067>Mastiha (Pistacia lentiscus) Improves Gut  Diversity, Hepatic Steatosis, and Disease Activity in a Biopsy-Confirmed Mouse Model of Advanced Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Fibrosis.</a></h1><p>As a result of the obesity epidemic, the prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing. No drug is approved for the treatment of NASH. In this study, the effect of a nutritional supplement, Mastiha or Chios mastic gum, on metabolic and histological parameters and on the gut microbiome in mice with NASH and fibrosis was investigated.Advanced NASH was induced by feeding C57BL/6J mice a diet rich in fat, sucrose, and cholesterol for 41 weeks. After randomization, animals received the NASH-inducing diet with or without 0.% (w/w) Mastiha for a further 8 weeks. Disease activity was assessed by liver histology and determination of plasma transaminase activities. Fecal  DNA extraction and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were used to determine the composition of the gut microbiome. Mastiha supplementation led to a significant reduction in circulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, improvement in hepatic steatosis and collagen content, and a reduction in NAFLD activity score. Furthermore, it resulted in a partial but significant recovery of gut  diversity and changes in identity and abundance of specific taxa.This is the first study demonstrating an improvement in disease activity in mice with advanced NASH with fibrosis by a diet containing Mastiha.© 2019 The Authors.

Since prevention of osteoporosis is important, it might act as a potential cofactor in osteoporosis prevention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of VSEE on osteoporosis and abnormal lipid metabolisms.MC3T3-E1 cell and OVX rat model were used to evaluate VSEE on regulation of bone and lipid metabolisms. Differentiation and matrix mineralization of preosteoblast were significantly increased by VSEE (P <0.05), which attributed to stimulating calcium influx, then to activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and regulating runt-related transcription factor  (Runx2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). VSEE could cross Caco-/HT-29 co-cultured monolayer via paracellular pathway and peptide transporter (PepT1), and could be detected in blood and maximum concentration was 122.84± 3.68 mg/L at 60 min. Additionally, VSEE was found to reverse bone loss and regulate dyslipidemia through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in OVX rats. Firmicutes phylum, Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae and six genera in VSEE group were significantly different compared with Model group (P <0.05).VSEE promotes bone growth and inhibit abnormal lipid metabolism in OVX model through the regulation of intestinal  compositions and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.

Old age alters our metabolic and regenerative capacity. Following recruitment of 65 human subjects in the age range of 70 to 82, we discerned healthy aging (HA) and non-healthy aging (NHA) cohorts discordant in the occurrence of one or more major diseases: (1) cancer, () acute or chronic cardiovascular diseases, (3) acute or chronic pulmonary diseases, (4) diabetes, and (5) stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed these cohorts' oral microbiomes (saliva) and gut microbiomes (stool) to assess diversity and identify microbial biomarkers for HA. In contrast to the gut microbiome where no change was observed, we found that the saliva microbiome had higher α-diversity in the HA compared with the NHA group. We observed the genus Akkermansia to be significantly more abundant in the gut  of the HA group. Akkermansia muciniphila is a colonic mucin-degrading bacterium believed to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health, particularly in the context of diabetes and obesity. Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 was a taxon increased in abundance in the HA cohort. Streptococcus was the only genus observed to be significantly decreased in abundance in both the gut and oral microbiomes of the HA cohort compared with the NHA cohort.

However, our understanding of the changes induced by TP on MO challenged layers performances and oxidative status, and on the , remains limited. The aim of the present study was to better understand host (performances and redox balance) and  responses in MO-challenged layers with dietary TP. In this study, 200 Lohmann laying hens (65-week-old) were randomly allocated in a  ×  factorial design to receive a diet with or without MO (0 or 100 mg/kg), and supplemented with either 0 or 600 mg/kg TP. The results indicate that 100 mg/kg MO decreased egg production ( = 0.03), while dietary TP increased egg production in MO challenged layers ( < 0.01). Egg yolk color was decreased by high MO ( < 0.01), while dietary TP had no effect on yolk color ( > 0.05). Serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration were increased by high MO, while total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity, glutathione s-transferase (GSH-ST), and glutathione concentration in serum were decreased ( < 0.05). Dietary TP was able to reverse the increasing effect of MO on ALT and AST ( < 0.05). High MO resulted in higher MO levels in serum, liver, kidney, and egg, but it decreased Cu and Se content in serum, liver, and egg ( < 0.05). The Fe concentration in liver, kidney, and eggs was significantly lower in MO supplementation groups ( < 0.05). High MO levels in the diet led to lower  and higher  abundance, whereas dietary TP alone and/or in high MO treatment increased the  abundance and the  ratio at phylum level. High MO increased the abundance of  (phylum),  (class),  (order), and  (family), whereas dietary TP promoted the enrichment of  (species). Dietary TP also enhanced the enrichment of  (class),  (order),  (family), and  (species).  analysis revealed differentially enriched microbial compositions in the cecum caused by MO and TP, which might be responsible for the protective effect of dietary TP during a MO challenge.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578306>Transmission and clearance of potential procarcinogenic bacteria during fecal  transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUNDFecal  transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) in adults and children, but donor stool samples are currently screened for only a limited number of potential pathogens. We sought to determine whether putative procarcinogenic bacteria (enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli harboring the colibactin toxin) could be durably transmitted from donors to patients during FMT.METHODSStool samples were collected from 11 pediatric rCDI patients and their respective FMT donors prior to FMT as well as from the patients at -10 weeks, 10-20 weeks, and 6 months after FMT. Bacterial virulence factors in stool DNA extracts and stool cultures were measured by quantitative PCR: Bacteroides fragilis toxin (bft), Fusobacterium adhesin A (fadA), and Escherichia coli colibactin (clbB).RESULTSFour of 11 patients demonstrated sustained acquisition of a procarcinogenic bacteria. Whole genome sequencing was performed on colony isolates from one of these donor/recipient pairs and demonstrated that clbB+ E. coli strains present in the recipient after FMT were identical to a strain present in the donor, confirming strain transmission. Conversely,  patients exhibited clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria following FMT from a negative donor.CONCLUSIONBoth durable transmission and clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria occurred following FMT, suggesting that additional studies on appropriate screening measures for FMT donors and the long-term consequences and/or benefits of FMT are warranted.FUNDINGCrohn's & Colitis Foundation, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678397>The gut  and diabetic cardiomyopathy in humans.</a></h1><p>Type  diabetes (DT2) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiac insufficiency. This insufficiency is mostly post-ischaemic in nature, but other aetiologies are possible in this high-risk population. In patients with DT2, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of cardiac insufficiency secondary to chronic hyperglycaemia and myocardial lipotoxicity, which promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (and, frequently, apoptosis of these cells), interstitial fibrosis and a decrease in myocardial contractile performance. Several studies have shown that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with modifications to the intestinal , and changes in the synthesis of bacterial metabolites and their diffusion into the host, some of which appear to have direct deleterious effects on cardiac contractility. These findings open up new perspectives for pathophysiological studies by establishing the presence of a '-myocardium' axis and raising the possibility of innovative new treatments. Correction of intestinal dysbiosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency could, therefore, constitute an innovative therapeutic approach to cases of this disease with a poor prognosis.Copyright © 2019.

Our objective was to determine the concentration of ceftiofur and its metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract of steers treated with ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) or ceftiofur hydrochloride (CHCL), determine the effect of these drugs on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fecal Escherichia coli, and evaluate shifts in the microbiome. Steers were administered either a single dose (6.6 mg/kg) of CCFA or . mg/kg of CHCL every 24 hours for 3 days. Ceftiofur and its metabolites were measured in the plasma, interstitium, ileum and colon. The concentration and MIC of fecal E. coli and the fecal  composition were assessed after treatment. The maximum concentration of ceftiofur was higher in all sampled locations of steers treated with CHCL. Measurable drug persisted longer in the intestine of CCFA-treated steers. There was a significant decrease in E. coli concentration (P = 0.002) within 24 hours that persisted for  weeks after CCFA treatment. In CHCL-treated steers, the mean MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli peaked at 48 hours (mean MIC = 20.45 ug/ml, 95% CI = 10.29-40.63 ug/ml), and in CCFA-treated steers, mean MIC peaked at 96 hours (mean MIC = 10.68 ug/ml, 95% CI = 5.47-20.85 ug/ml). Shifts in the microbiome of steers in both groups were due to reductions in Firmicutes and increases in Bacteroidetes. CCFA leads to prolonged, low intestinal drug concentrations, and is associated with decreased E. coli concentration, an increased MIC of ceftiofur in E. coli at specific time points, and shifts in the fecal . CHCL led to higher intestinal drug concentrations over a shorter duration. Effects on E. coli concentration and the microbiome were smaller in this group, but the increase in the MIC of ceftiofur in fecal E. coli was similar.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635446> P2P3, a human gut bacterium having a strong non-gelatinized resistant starch-degrading activity.</a></h1><p>Resistant starch (RS) is metabolized by gut  and involved in the production of short chain fatty acids, which are related to a variety of physiological and health effects.

Here we show that encephalitogenic Th17 cells infiltrate the colonic lamina propria before neurological symptom development in two murine MS models, active and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Specifically targeting Th17 cell intestinal homing by blocking the α4β7-integrin and its ligand MAdCAM-1 pathway impairs T cell migration to the large intestine and dampens EAE severity in the Th17 cell adoptive transfer model. Mechanistically, myelin-specific Th17 cells proliferate in the colon and affect gut  composition. The beneficial effect of blocking the α4β7-integrin and its ligand MAdCAM-1 pathway on EAE is interdependent with gut .

In the present study the prebiotic potentials of different pectic derived substrates were performed by using intestinal cultures and measuring the growth, change in pH and short chain fatty acid, (SCFA) production. Arabinan, arabinogalactan, and rhamnogalacturonan were fermented by probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium breve, Bi. longum, Bi. bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (commensal bacteria). While, polygalacturonic acid was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to 5 (pH difference of ≈ ), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The SCFA profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate, acetate and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases. Thus, pectic polysaccharides hold potential application in food industry as prebiotic ingredients or dietary fibers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619962> Characterization of Gut -Derived Bacterial Strains With Neuroprotective Properties.</a></h1><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are disabling, incurable, and progressive conditions characterized by neuronal loss and decreased cognitive function. Changes in gut microbiome composition have been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a role for the gut-brain axis. Here, we show how specific gut-derived bacterial strains can modulate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes  through the production of specific metabolites and discuss the potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders. A panel of fifty gut bacterial strains was screened for their ability to reduce pro-inflammatory IL-6 secretion in U373 glioblastoma astrocytoma cells.  MRx0005 and  MRx0029 had the strongest capacity to reduce IL-6 secretion . Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and both bacterial strains displayed intrinsic antioxidant capacity. While MRx0005 showed a general antioxidant activity on different brain cell lines, MRx0029 only protected differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. MRx0029 also induced a mature phenotype in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells through upregulation of microtubule-associated protein . Interestingly, short-chain fatty acid analysis revealed that MRx0005 mainly produced C1-C3 fatty acids, while MRx0029 produced C4-C6 fatty acids, specifically butyric, valeric and hexanoic acid. None of the short-chain fatty acids tested protected neuroblastoma cells from chemically induced oxidative stress. However, butyrate was able to reduce neuroinflammation , and the combination of butyrate and valerate induced neuronal maturation, albeit not to the same degree as the complex cell-free supernatant of MRx0029. This observation was confirmed by solvent extraction of cell-free supernatants, where only MRx0029 methanolic fractions containing butyrate and valerate showed an anti-inflammatory activity in U373 cells and retained the ability to differentiate neuroblastoma cells. In summary, our results suggest that the pleiotropic nature of live biotherapeutics, as opposed to isolated metabolites, could be a promising novel drug class in drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2019 Ahmed, Busetti, Fotiadou, Vincy Jose, Reid, Georgieva, Brown, Dunbar, Beurket-Ascencio, Delday, Ettorre and Mulder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668625>Rhizosphere-Associated Pseudomonas Suppress Local Root Immune Responses by Gluconic Acid-Mediated Lowering of Environmental pH.</a></h1><p>The root microbiome consists of commensal, pathogenic, and plant-beneficial microbes [1]. Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens []. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative -keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, -methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal , the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut colonization, facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic. A publicly accessible APD3 database http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/ shows particular genes encoding microcins in 34.1% of .  strains (mostly MccV, MccM, MccH47, and MccI47), and much less in  and  (<%). Some 4.65% of  are microcinogenic (mostly with MccE492), and even less in  or  (mostly MccS). The high frequency and variety of microcins in some  indicate key ecological functions, a notion supported by their dominance in the intestinal  of biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the synthesis of post-translationally modified peptide microcins.Copyright © 2019 Baquero, Lanza, Baquero, del Campo and Bravo-Vázquez.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618664>Long-term effects of low doses of Chlorpyrifos exposure at the preweaning developmental stage: A locomotor, pharmacological, brain gene expression and gut microbiome analysis.</a></h1><p>Development is especially sensitive to Chlorpyrifos (CPF) toxicity, associated with several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders where motor function dysfunction is a core symptom. Amongst the alternative molecular targets to cholinesterases inhibition, developmental CPF alters different components in the most important neurotransmitter systems, although this depends on the exposure period. Exposure during the late postnatal preweaning stage is the least studied by far. This period includes essential neurodevelopmental processes and has an important translational meaning. The present study analyzed the influence of low doses of CPF on this developmental window on locomotor activity and the state of the different neurotransmitter systems by pharmacological challenges. Brain gene expression and microbiome modulation following CPF were also analyzed. CPF exposure long-term increased spontaneous vertical activity, female's activity following acute stress, hyposensitized the cholinergic system and hypersensitized the GABAergic system, up-regulated both muscarinic  receptor and GABA-A-α receptor subunit in the dorsal striatum and the frontal cortex, respectively and induced gut  dysbiosis at both genus and species levels. The present study supports alternative molecular targets than the ChEs following late postnatal, preweaning exposure to low doses of CPF, focusing on both cholinergic and GABAergic systems and the gut microbiome as an important factor.Copyright © 2019.

This model reproduces a similar situation to MS, as well as its relationship with intestinal  starting from the changes in bacterial lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) in the outer wall of the gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the administration of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), hydroxytirosol (HT), and oleic acid (OA) exert beneficial effects. Twenty-five Dark Agouti two-month-old male rats, weighing around 190 g, were distributed into the following groups: Control, EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis group), EAE + EVOO, EAE + HT, and EAE + OA. The glutathione redox system with the EAE was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and small and large intestines. The LPS and the correlation with oxidative stress in the small and large intestines were also investigated. The results showed that (1) the oxidative damage in the EAE model affects non-nervous organs and tissues; () The LPS is related to inflammatory phenomena and oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue and in other organs; (3) The administration of EVOO, HT, and OA reduces the LPS levels at the same time as minimizing the oxidative damage; (4) EVOO, HT, and OA improve the disease's clinical score; and (5) on balance, EVOO offers a better neuroprotective effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597099>CD109 Restrains Activation of Cutaneous IL-17-Producing γδ T Cells by Commensal .</a></h1><p>Interleukin-17-producing γδ T (γδ17) cells play a central role in protective and pathogenic immune responses. However, the tissue-specific mechanisms that control the activation of these innate lymphocytes are not known. Here, we demonstrate that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein highly expressed by keratinocytes, is an important regulator of skin homeostasis and γδ17 cell activation. Genetic deletion of CD109 results in spontaneous epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant accumulation of dermal-derived γδ17 cells, and enhanced susceptibility to psoriasiform inflammation. In this context, γδ17 activation requires interleukin (IL)-23 signals and is reversed by transient depletion of the skin . Mechanistically, CD109 restrains γδ17 cell activation in a cell-extrinsic manner by fortifying skin barrier integrity. Collectively, our data provide insight into the regulation of the skin IL-23/IL-17 immune axis and how homeostasis is maintained at this important barrier site.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate farm management practices such as the bedding materials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of recycled manure solids (RMS) as bedding material on bulk tank milk and microbiological implications for cheese quality. Bulk tank samples were collected from 84 dairy farms using RMS or straw bedding. The use of RMS did not influence thermophilic and mesophilic aerobic viable counts from spores. However, straw-milk samples gave higher values for mesophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacteria (0.44 log cfu/mL) than RMS-milk samples (0.17 log cfu/mL). The presence of thermoresistant lactic acid bacteria was not increased in milk from farms using RMS. Nevertheless, taxonomic profiles of thermoresistant bacteria isolated were different between the  types of milk. More Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus spp. were identified in RMS-milk samples. Thermoresistant enterococci and streptococci could easily end up in cheese. Therefore, milk proteolytic activities of these isolates were tested. Neither Streptococcus spp. nor Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibited proteolytic activities, whereas 53% of E. faecalis showed some. Also, only 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was detected. Survival of selected RMS-milk samples isolates (3 E. faecalis and 1 Streptococcus thermophilus) was evaluated during a model Cheddar cheese manufacture. Although those strains survived well, they did not modify the acidification curve of milk. However, they might cause organoleptic defects during cheese maturing.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO- are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered  composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly,  "normalization" involving the transfer of WT  into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed  composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664418>Changes in the intestinal  of superobese patients after bariatric surgery.</a></h1><p>The gut  is associated with obesity and weight loss after bariatric surgery and has been related to its changing pattern.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various colonization conditions such as bacterial concentrations, colonization time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial colonization reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting colonization of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

Four diets containing either 5% cellulose (control; CT), 5% dietary fiber and prebiotic blend (FP), 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (SE), or 5% fiber blend plus 0.02% saccharin and eugenol (FSE) were formulated to meet or exceed the AAFCO (2017) nutritional requirements for adult dogs. Eight adult female beagles (mean age 4. ± 1.1 yr; mean BW = 10.8 ± 1.4 kg; mean BCS = 5.8 ± 0.6) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 dietary treatments using a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period consisted of 14 d (10 d of diet adaptation and 4 d of total and fresh fecal and total urine collection). All animals remained healthy throughout the study, with serum metabolites being within reference ranges for adult dogs. All diets were well accepted by the dogs, resulting in similar (P > 0.05) daily food intakes among treatments. Likewise, fecal output and scores did not differ (P > 0.05) among dietary treatments, with the latter being within the ideal range (.5-.9) in a 5-point scale. All diets were highly digestible and had similar (P > 0.05) ATTD of dry matter (81.6%-84.4%), organic matter (86.4%-87.3%), and crude protein (86.6%-87.3%). However, total dietary fiber (TDF) digestibility was greater for dogs fed the FSE diet (P < 0.05) in contrast with dogs fed the CT and SE diets, whereas dogs fed FP diets had intermediate TDF digestibility, but not different from all other treatments. Fecal acetate and propionate concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) for dogs fed FP and FSE diets. Fecal concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate were greater for dogs fed CT (P < 0.05) compared with dogs fed the other three treatments. No shifts in fecal microbial richness and diversity were observed among dietary treatments. Overall, the data suggest that dietary supplementation of fiber and prebiotic blend was well tolerated by dogs, did not cause detrimental effects on fecal quality or nutrient digestibility, and resulted in beneficial shifts in fecal metabolites that may support gut health.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying  engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and () patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut . Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in  induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut  composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Modification of gut  and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile acid synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut , which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco- cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Insights into the intricate relationships between gut  and the host require not only the understanding of its structure and function but also the measurement of effector molecules acting along the gut  axis. This article reviews the literature on targeted chromatographic approaches in analysis of gut  specific metabolites in feces as the most accessible biological matrix which can directly probe the connection between intestinal bacteria and the (patho)physiology of the holobiont. Together with a discussion on sample collection and preparation, the chromatographic methods targeted to determination of some classes of -derived metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, low molecular masses amines and polyamines, vitamins, neurotransmitters and related compounds) are discussed and their main characteristics, summarized in Tables.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile acids (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; () reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut . Here we summarise the BA metabolic pathways focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? () Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut ? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut  is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633730>ANALYSIS OF LACTOSE INTOLERANCE IN STUDENTS WITH SUGGESTIVE SYMPTOMS OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME.</a></h1><p>Irritable bowel syndrome is a clinical condition presenting pain, distension and abdominal fullness, diarrhea, constipation, and other symptoms. It generates significant impacts on the quality of life of those affected. The pathophysiology is uncertain, but the role of various food types has been established in bowel sensitivity and its clinical manifestations. Carbohydrate intolerance, particularly to lactose, generates similar and sometimes indistinguishable symptoms from irritable bowel syndrome, and in clinical practice is both a frequent and underdiagnosed condition. Carbohydrate intolerance is related to enzymatic deficiencies, alterations of intestinal  and even genetic change. The principal test for a diagnosis of lactose intolerance is the breath test, which measures hydrogen emission (produced only by bacteria), after ingestion of the corresponding substrate.The present work aims to verify the prevalence of lactose intolerance in university students, presenting gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome.In a transversal study, to screen for those with suggestive symptoms, 124 medicine students participated by responding to a form. Those with abdominal pain were referred for anti-parasite treatment in order to exclude intestinal parasites as a secondary cause. Subsequently, using the hydrogen breath test, bacterial overgrowth was investigated, and if negative, lactose intolerance testing would be performed. Patients presenting high hydrogen concentrations of ≥20 ppm above the basal level were considered lactose intolerant.Of the total of students researched (n=124), 7 were excluded because they did not completing all study phases. From those 117 individuals effectively included in the survey; 8 (6.8%) were diagnosed with lactose intolerance and  (1.7%) with bacterial overgrowth. Intolerance was more frequent in; female individuals (75%), age range 18 to 25 years (62.5%), being colored (50%), and in their 5th semester of studies (37.5%). The presence of at least one gastrointestinal symptom among those presenting intolerance (100%), and those not presenting intolerance (42.%) was found (P=0.002). In addition to abdominal pain (100%) (P<0.001), the most recurrent gastrointestinal symptom in the lactose intolerant students was the distension/flatulence (62.5%) (P=0.026). In relation to life habits and food patterns, there was no statistical difference between lactose tolerant and intolerant individuals, or for symptom frequencies. The more advanced students, completing more periods towards graduation, demonstrated more occurrences of gastrointestinal symptoms, yet without presenting significant statistical discrepancies.In view of the test sample quantity (n=21), a high prevalence of lactose intolerance (6.8%) in the academic environment, with epidemiological characteristics compatible to those found the literature is demonstrated, generating knowledge with understanding to prevent, diagnose, alleviate and treat lactose intolerant university students, and generate positive impacts towards well-being, improving the quality of life of these individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645659>WZ66, a novel acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor, alleviates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice.</a></h1><p>The global prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) increases incredibly. NASH ends up to advanced liver disease, which is highly threatening to human health. Currently, treatment of NASH is very limited. Acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC1/ACC2) are proved as effective drug targets for NASH. We aimed to develop novel ACC inhibitors and evaluate their therapeutic value for NASH prevention. ACC inhibitors were obtained through structure-based drug design, synthesized, screened from ACC enzymatic measurement platform and elucidated in cell culture-based assays and animal models. The lipidome and microbiome analysis were integrated to assess the effects of WZ66 on lipids profiles in liver and plasma as well as gut  in the intestine. WZ66 was identified as a novel ACC1/ inhibitor. It entered systemic circulation rapidly and could accumulate in liver. WZ66 alleviated NASH-related liver features including steatosis, Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells activation in diet-induced obese mice. The triglycerides (TGs) and other lipids including diglycerides (DGs), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) were decreased in WZ66-treated mice as evidenced by lipidome analysis in livers. The lipids profiles in plasma were also altered with WZ66 treatment. Plasma TG were moderately increased, while the activation of SREBP1c was not detected. WZ66 also downregulated the abundance of Allobaculum, Mucispirillum and Prevotella genera as well as Mucispirillum schaedleri species in gut . WZ66 is an ideal lead compound and a potential drug candidate deserving further investigation in the therapeutics of NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590369>Exacerbations of Chronic Rhinosinusitis-Microbiology and Perspectives of Phage Therapy.</a></h1><p>The chronically inflamed mucosa in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) can additionally be infected by bacteria, which results in an acute exacerbation of the disease (AECRS). Currently, AECRS is universally treated with antibiotics following the guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), as our understanding of its microbiology is insufficient to establish specific treatment recommendations. Unfortunately, antibiotics frequently fail to control the symptoms of AECRS due to biofilm formation, disruption of the natural , and arising antibiotic resistance. These issues can potentially be addressed by phage therapy. In this study, the endoscopically-guided cultures were postoperatively obtained from 50 patients in order to explore the microbiology of AECRS, evaluate options for antibiotic treatment, and, most importantly, assess a possibility of efficient phage therapy.  and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria, followed by  and . Alarmingly, mechanisms of antibiotic resistance were detected in the isolates from 46% of the patients. Bacteria not sensitive to amoxicillin were carried by 28% of the patients. The lowest rates of resistance were noted for fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Fortunately, 60% of the patients carried bacterial strains that were sensitive to bacteriophages from the Biophage Pharma collection and 81% of the antibiotic-resistant strains turned out to be sensitive to bacteriophages. The results showed that microbiology of AECRS is distinct from ABRS and amoxicillin should not be the antibiotic of first choice. Currently available bacteriophages could be used instead of antibiotics or as an adjunct to antibiotics in the majority of patients with AECRS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604771>AidB, a novel thermostable -acylhomoserine lactonase from the bacterium  sp.</a></h1><p>Many Gram-negative bacteria employ -acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) as quorum sensing (QS) signal molecules to regulate virulence expression in a density-dependent manner. Quorum quenching (QQ) via enzymatic inactivation of AHLs is a promising strategy to reduce bacterial infections and drug resistance. Herein, a thermostable AHL lactonase (AidB), which could degrade different AHLs, with or without a substitution of carbonyl or hydroxyl at the C-3 position, was identified from the soil bacterium  sp. F3-. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that AidB is an AHL lactonase that hydrolyzes the ester bond of the homoserine lactone ring. AidB was thermostable in the range 30 to 80 °C and showed maximum activity after pre-incubating at 60 °C for 30 min. The optimum temperature of AidB was 60 °C, and the enzyme could be stably stored in ddHO at 4 °C or room temperature. AidB homologs were only found in  and  of the  AidB from  and AidB from  (amino acid identities of 50.6% and 52.8% to AidB, respectively) also showed thermostable AHL degradation activity.

Swabs containing the samples were collected both at baseline and after 45 days of treatment. 16S rRNA sequencing techniques were used to investigate the effect of HA gel on the subgingival microbiome.One hundred and eight samples of 54 patients were analyzed at baseline and after follow-up at 45 days. Three strata with different microbial composition were obtained in the samples at baseline, representing three main microbial consortia associated with peri-implantitis. Stratum 1 did not show any difference for any variable after treatment with HA, whereas in stratum , Streptococcus, Veillonella, Rothia, and Granulicatella did decrease (P < 0.05). Similarly, Prevotella and Campylobacter (P < 0.05) decreased in stratum 3 after treatment with HA. Microbial diversity was found to be decreased in stratum 3 (P < 0.05) after treatment with HA compared with the control group, in which an increase was found (P < 0.05).HA reduced the relative abundance of peri-implantitis-related microorganisms, especially the early colonizing bacteria, suggesting a specific action during the first stages in the development of the disease. HA did not alter relative abundances of non-oral genera. The use of HA in advanced stages of peri-implantitis resulted in a decrease in microbial alpha diversity, suggesting a protective action of the peri-implant site against bacteria colonization.© 2019 American Academy of Periodontology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569518>Loss of Diurnal Oscillatory Rhythms in Gut  Correlates with Changes in Circulating Metabolites in Type  Diabetic db/db Mice.</a></h1><p>Our hypothesis is that diabetes leads to loss of diurnal oscillatory rhythms in gut  altering circulating metabolites. We performed an observational study where we compared diurnal changes of the gut  with temporal changes of plasma metabolites. Metadata analysis from bacterial DNA from fecal pellets collected from 10-month old control (db/m) and type  diabetic (db/db) mice every 4 h for a 24-h period was used for prediction analysis. Blood plasma was collected at a day and night time points and was used for untargeted global metabolomic analysis. Feeding and activity behaviors were recorded. Our results show that while diabetic mice exhibited feeding and activity behavior similar to control mice, they exhibited a loss of diurnal oscillations in bacteria of the genus , , ,  and a phase shift in the oscillations of , proteobacteria, and actinobacteria. Analysis of the circulating metabolites showed alterations in the diurnal pattern of metabolic pathways where bacteria have been implicated, such as the histidine, betaine, and methionine/cysteine pathway, mitochondrial function and the urea cycle. Functional analysis of the differential microbes revealed that during the day, when mice are asleep, the microbes of diabetic mice were enriched in processing carbon and pyruvate metabolic pathways instead of xenobiotic degradation as was observed for control mice. Altogether, our study suggests that diabetes led to loss of rhythmic oscillations of many gut  with possible implications for temporal regulation of host metabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662387>Effects of a probiotic treatment () and open-label placebo on symptoms of allergic rhinitis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.</a></h1><p>Several studies suggest that gut  may play an important role in allergic diseases. The present trial aims to examine effects of the probiotic  on symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients. Effects of this probiotic on the immune system have been reported by several studies, but the majority of the previous trials were animal studies. In addition, it is well known that symptoms in allergic rhinitis are prone to exhibit high placebo responses. Moreover, recent studies report that even placebos without deception (open-label placebos) are highly effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Our study design combines both new approaches to assess effects on allergic symptoms in patients. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a probiotic treatment () with effects seen by open-label placebo, concealed placebo treatment and no treatment control.A total of 120 patients with allergic rhinitis will be randomly assigned to one of four different groups: a double-blind probiotic/placebo group (groups 1 and ), an open-label placebo group (group 3) and a no-treatment group (group 4) to control for spontaneous variation of symptoms. The primary outcome is the evaluation of allergic symptoms using the Combined Symptoms Medication Score. Furthermore, health-related quality of life is examined (Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes include a visual analogue scale on allergic burden and a second quality of life questionnaire.

Macroalga-derived oligosaccharides are candidate prebiotics, and herein, we determined the effects of  sp.-derived alginate oligosaccharide (AlgOS) on the distal intestinal  of Atlantic salmon (). Using a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique, we investigated the  harbored in the intestinal content and mucus of the fish offered feeds supplemented with 0.5 and .5% AlgOS. We found that the prebiotic shifts the intestinal  profile; alpha diversity was significantly reduced with .5% AlgOS while with 0.5% AlgOS the alteration occurred without impacting the bacterial diversity. Beta diversity analysis indicated the significant differences between control and prebiotic-fed groups. The low supplementation level of AlgOS facilitated the dominance of Proteobacteria (including , , ), and Spirochaetes () in the content or mucus of the fish, and few of these bacteria (, ) have genes associated with butyrate production. The results indicate that the low inclusion of AlgOS can plausibly induce a prebiotic effect on the distal intestinal  of Atlantic salmon. These findings can generate further interest in the potential of macroalgae-derived oligosaccharides for food and feed applications.Copyright © 2019 Gupta, Lokesh, Abdelhafiz, Siriyappagouder, Pierre, Sørensen, Fernandes and Kiron.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641199>Calibrated interdental brushing for the prevention of periodontal pathogens infection in young adults - a randomized controlled clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Periodontal disease is clearly correlated with systemic disease. The presence of periodontal pathogens in interdental spaces in young, healthy adults is a strong indicator of the need to introduce daily interdental prophylaxis. Twenty-five subjects (aged 18-35 years), diagnosticated clinically as periodontally healthy, were enrolled in this study. One hundred interdental sites were included. Among these sites, 50 "test" sites were cleaned daily with calibrated interdental brushes (IDBs), whereas the other 50 sites were not cleaned and considered "controls". The interdental biofilm at these interdental sites was collected at the beginning of the study (basal) and at 1 week,  weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology was used to quantify (i) 19 periodontal bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia, and (ii) total bacteria. In the test sites, the quantity of total bacteria decreased over time with the use of IDBs. The bacteria from the red and orange Socransky complexes, which are associated with periodontal disease, significantly decreased in the test sites but not in the control sites. Bacteria from the yellow, and purple Socransky complexes, which are associated with periodontal health, increased significantly in both groups whereas bacteria from the blue Socransky complex increased significantly only in the test sites. Furthermore, at basal, 66% of test sites and 68% of control sites bled during interdental brushing. These percentages decreased by 85% in 3 months for the test sites and by 27% in the control sites. In conclusion, the daily use of calibrated IDBs can reduce periodontal pathogens, reestablish symbiotic  and, decrease interdental inflammation in interdental sites of healthy young adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654796>BuZangTongLuo decoction improved hindlimb ischemia by activating angiogenesis and regulating gut  in diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Seven traditional medicinal plants (including Astragalus membranaceus, Dioscorea hemsleyi, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Scrophularia ningpoensis, Ophiopogon japonicus, Panax ginseng and Fritillariae cirrhosae) and one insect leech (Whitmania pigra Whitman) were combined into BuZangTongLuo formula (BZTLF) under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine. BZTLF is potentially effective against diabetic vascular complications.Previous studies failed to clarify the molecular mechanism through which BZTLF suppressed diabetic ischemia. In this study, we aimed to explore whether BZTLF treatment could prevent the occurrence of type  diabetic (T2D) hindlimb ischemia in mice. Further, we investigated the regulatory effect of BZTLF on angiogenesis-related VEGF signaling pathway and gut  dysfunction in diabetic ischemia mice.C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) received STZ injection and femoral artery ligation to build T2D diabetic hindlimb ischemia model. Mice were gavaged with BZTLF (5 g [raw materials]/kg/d) or with metformin plus atorvastatin for three weeks. Laser doppler imaging system was utilized for the visualization of blood flow. Histochemistry analysis was performed for microvascular vessel staining. Western blot was applied to detect the protein changes of signaling molecules responsible for VEGF pathway. Finally, 16S rDNA gene sequencing was conducted for analysis of gut  structure.BZTLF treatment remarkably restored blood flow and capillary density of diabetic hindlimb ischemia. And the protein changes of VEGF signaling molecules were reversed in BZTLF-treated diabetic ischemia mice, including the decreased VEGF and HIF-1α, and the increased NO, eNOS and p-ERK1/. The gut  analysis suggests that BZTLF treatment increased the abundances of several beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides), while decreased the populations of some harmful bacterial (Blautia, Weissella, Escherichia Shigella and Kurthia). By using Spearman correlation analysis, these changed gut flora were positively/negatively correlated with VEGF signaling pathway or glycometabolic parameters.BZTLF displayed beneficial effects on diabetic hindlimb ischemia by reshaping the gut  structure and stunning the VEGF/HIF-1α pathway.Copyright © 2019.

Gut  plays an important role in health and disease, including obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Probiotics refer to live microorganisms that confer health benefits on the host after administration in adequate amounts. Research on novel probiotics related therapies has evoked much attention. In our previous study, both Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and LGG cell-free supernatant (LGGs) were found to protect against alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis; however, the effects of LGG and LGGs on cardiac tissues of obese mice exposed to IH have not been determined. Here we exposed high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHFD)-induced obese mice to IH, to establish a model of obesity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Mice were divided into four groups: (1) HFHFD for 15 weeks; () HFHFD for 15 weeks with IH in the last 12 weeks (HFHFD/IH); (3) and (4) HFHFD/IH plus oral administration of either LGG (10 CFU bacteria/day) or LGGs (dose equivalent to 10 CFU bacteria/day) over the 15 weeks, respectively. Compared to HFHFD mice, HFHFD/IH-mice showed heart dysfunction with significant cardiac remodeling and inflammation; all these pathological and functional alterations were prevented by treatment with both LGG and LGGs (no significant difference between LGG and LGGs in this respect). The cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs against IH/HFHFD was associated with up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid -related factor (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant pathways. Our findings suggest a cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs in obese mice with OSA.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660343>Fecal Transplant in Children With  Gives Sustained Reduction in Antimicrobial Resistance and Potential Pathogen Burden.</a></h1><p>Fecal  transplantation (FMT) treats  infection (CDI). Little is known regarding the changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and potential pathogen burden that occur in pediatric recipients of FMT. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in AMR genes, potential pathogens, species, and functional pathways with FMT in children.Nine children with recurrent CDI underwent FMT. Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope .0.All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT ( < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes ( < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT ( < .001), with an increase post-FMT ( ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples ( < .001). Bacterial species  and  showed higher abundance in donors than recipients ( = .008 and  = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT.

These SCFAs are potent preventive agents against colorectal cancer due to their histone deacetylases inhibitory properties, which induce apoptosis in tumor colonocytes. As colorectal cancer is the fourth most common neoplasia in Europe with 28. new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a cost-effective preventive strategy has been tested in this work by redesigning common porcine meat products (chorizo sausages and cooked ham) consumed by a substantial proportion of the population towards potential colorectal cancer preventive functional foods. In order to test the preventive effect of these inulin-rich meat products against colorectal cancer, an animal model (Rattus norvegicus F344) was used, involving two doses of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) and two treatments with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) during a 20-week assay period. Control feed, control sausages, functional sausages (15.7% inulin), control cooked ham and functional cooked ham (10% inulin) were used to feed the corresponding animal cohorts. Then, the animals were sacrificed and their digestive tract tissues were analyzed. The results showed a statistically significant 49% reduction in the number of colon polyps in the functional meat products cohorts with respect to the control meat products animals, as well as an increase in the cecum weight (an indicator of a diet rich in prebiotic fiber), a 51.8% increase in colon propionate production, a 39.1% increase in colon butyrate concentrations, and a reduction in the number of hyperplastic Peyer's patches. Metagenomics studies also demonstrated colon  differences, revealing a significant increase in Bacteroidetes populations in the functional meat products (mainly due to an increase in Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae families, which include prominent propionate producers), together with a reduction in Firmicutes (especially due to lower Lachnospiraceae populations). However, functional meat products showed a remarkable increase in the anti-inflammatory and fiber-fermentative Blautia genus, which belongs to this Lachnospiraceae family. The functional meat products cohorts also presented a reduction in important pro-inflammatory bacterial populations, such as those of the genus Desulfovibrio and Bilophila. These results were corroborated in a genetic animal model of CRC (F344/NSlc-Apc) that produced similar results. Therefore, processed meat products can be redesigned towards functional prebiotic foods of interest as a cost-effective dietary strategy for preventing colorectal cancer in human populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593850>Diet as Regulator of Gut  and its Role in Health and Disease.</a></h1><p>In recent years, the gut  has been of great interest due to its role in maintaining health and its association with the development of different diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The objective of the present review is to show the main functions of the gut , the role in the degradation of complex carbohydrates particularly soluble fiber, resistant starches and bioactive compounds particularly polyphenols. In addition, the review will focus on the nutrient-gut  interaction and its role on the development of dysbiosis (imbalance) and low-grade inflammation during the obesity and type  diabetes. Finally, several strategies using prebiotics will be discussed to reduce the gut  dysbiosis, and to improve some biochemical abnormalities during obesity and type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019 IMSS.

We investigated if the dietary minerals interact with the gut  to alter circulating lipid profiles, implicated in CVD and metabolic syndrome.Plasma samples from Wistar rats fed a control or HNaLK diet with or without antibiotic treatment (n = 7 each, a total of 28) were subjected to lipidomics analysis. Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut  and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster ) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster  TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster  TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

Pathogenic filamentous oomycetes of the genus  comprises more than 150 recognized species and cause highly destructive soil-borne diseases in deciduous trees crops worldwide. Moreover, the treatment of soil  with amino acids is an alternative strategy to achieve desirable effects even against phytopathogenic oomycetes. In our study, samples from rhizosphere soil were collected either from naturally -infected trees, from completely asymptomatic ones, or from trees as above subjected also to treatments with amino acids (Amino16®) under different fertilization regimes. The interactions of bacterial communities with plant pathogenic oomycetes are crucial to determine the course of infection and the pathogenicity encompassing various functional contexts like biofilm formation. Thus, for deciphering the structure and diversity of these soil bacterial communities, we applied a 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing approach targeting the V3-V4 gene region. After quality check 478,479 sequences were obtained in the dataset comprising a total read length of 192,291,625 base pairs.  were the dominant phylum (46.1%) followed by  (13.%) and  (12.4%).

However, data are scarce regarding the antibiotic resistance in fish themselves. Herein, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were assessed in the gut of four major Chinese freshwater carp (i.e., silver carp, grass carp, bighead carp, and crucian carp) from food retail markets. Results show that the abundances of target ARGs (e.g., tetA, tetO, tetQ, tetW, sulI, sulII, and bla) and class 1 integrase (intI1) were in the range 9.4 × 10 - 1.6 × 10 and 6.7 × 10 - 5. × 10 gene copies per 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The sulI, sulII, and tetQ strongly correlated with silver and mercury resistance genes (e.g., silE and merR). The microbial taxa of fish gut could be partly separated among retail markets based on the PCA analysis. About 15.0% of the OTUs in fish gut were shared and 74.5% of the shared OTUs were identified as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. These phyla may constitute the core  in the guts of the four Chinese freshwater carp. The possible ARG hosts were revealed based on the network analysis, and the presence of pathogen-associated resistant genera in fish gut highlights the need to fully understand their potential human health risks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about the effect of exogenous factors (including enteric pathogens) on the colonic TPP uptake process. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effect of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection on colonic uptake of TPP. We used human-derived colonic epithelial NCM460 cells and mice in our investigation. The results showed that infecting NCM460 cells with live EHEC (but not with heat-killed EHEC, EHEC culture supernatant, or with non-pathogenic E. Coli) to lead to a significant inhibition in carrier-mediated TPP uptake, as well as in level of expression of the TPPT protein and mRNA. Similarly, infecting mice with EHEC led to a significant inhibition in colonic TPP uptake and in level of expression of TPPT protein and mRNA. The inhibitory effect of EHEC on TPP uptake by NCM460 was found to be associated with reduction in the rate of transcription of the SLC44A4 gene as indicated by the significant reduction in the activity of the SLC44A4 promoter transfected into EHEC infected cells. The latter was also associated with a marked reduction in the level of expression of the transcription factors CREB-1 and ELF3, which are known to drive the activity of the SLC44A4 promoter. Finally, blocking the ERK1/ and NF-kB signaling pathways in NCM460 cells significantly reversed the level of EHEC inhibition in TPP uptake and TPPT expression. Collectively, these findings show, for the first time, that EHEC infection significantly inhibit colonic uptake of TPP, and that this effect appears to be exerted at the level of SLC44A4 transcription and involves the ERK1/ and NF-kB signaling pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664483>Relationship between gut , probiotics, and type  diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>The worldwide prevalence of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is constantly increasing, and it has become a major concern, with several implications for public health, economy, and social well-being.

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged  to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a -week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for  weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647500>Association of Dietary Fiber and Yogurt Consumption With Lung Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis.</a></h1><p>Dietary fiber (the main source of prebiotics) and yogurt (a probiotic food) confer various health benefits via modulating the gut  and metabolic pathways. However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated.To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors.This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1 445 850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within  years after enrollment were excluded.Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments.Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma).The analytic sample included 627 988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817 862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18 822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism.Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers.

Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic  is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~ log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

During pregnancy, the female body undergoes unique hormonal changes that contribute to weight gain as well as modulations in immune function that can affect  composition. Several studies have described the vaginal  of pregnant women from the USA, Europe and Mexico. Here we expand our knowledge about the vaginal microbial communities during the third trimester to healthy expectant Brazilian mothers. Vaginal samples were collected from patients delivering at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Microbial DNA was isolated from samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the PGM Ion Torrent. Brazilian pregnant women presented three distinct types of microbial community at the time of labor. Two microbial communities, Cluster 1 and Cluster 3, presented an overall dominance of Lactobacillus while Cluster  tended to present higher diversity and richness, with the presence of Pseudomonas, Prevotella and other vaginosis related bacteria. About half of the Brazilian mothers sampled here had dominance of L. iners. The proportion of mothers without dominance of any Lactobacillus was higher in Brazil (22%) compared to UK (.4%) and USA, where this community type was not detected. The vaginal  showed significant correlation with the composition of the babies' gut  (p-value = 0.002 with a R of 15.8%).

We investigated whether baseline measures of subgingival  predicted fasting plasma glucose (FPG) longitudinally. The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS) enrolled 230 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20 to 55 y (mean ± SD, 34 ± 10 y) from whom baseline subgingival plaque and longitudinal FPG were measured. DNA was extracted from subgingival plaque, and V3 to V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. FPG was measured at baseline and again at  y; glucose change was defined as follow-up minus baseline. Multivariable linear models regressed -y glucose change onto baseline measures of community diversity and abundances of 369 individual taxa. A microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) summarizing top individual taxa associated with glucose change was calculated and used in regression models. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and baseline glucose levels. Statistical significance was based on the false discovery rate (FDR; <0.05) or a Bonferroni-corrected  value of 1 × 10, derived from the initial 369 hypothesis tests for specific taxa. Mean -y FPG change was 1.5 ± 8 mg/dL. Baseline levels of 9 taxa predicted FPG change (all FDR <0.05), among which  sp oral taxon 097 and  spp predicted greater FPG change, while  sp oral taxon 498 predicted lesser FPG change (all 3  values, Bonferroni significant). The MDI explained 6% of variation in longitudinal glucose change ( < 0.001), and baseline glucose levels explained 10% of variation ( < 0.0001).

Baicalin (BI), a major constituent in an anti-inflammatory herb Scutellaria baicalensis, can be biotransformed into baicalein (BE) by the intestinal . We evaluated the anti-inflammation and anti-CRC effects of the metabolite BE.The in vitro biotransformation by human intestinal  from BI into BE has been determined with HPLC. Using a gut-specific Apc mouse model, the effects of oral BE on the life span, organ index, and tumor multiplicity were evaluated. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA. To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal . Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125. to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index. Compared with the model group, following BE treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and colon (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In the gut tissues, BE treatment significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In vitro data supported our in vivo results that the anti-CRC effects of BE were via the inhibition of gut inflammation and induction of cancer cell death.Our results suggest that the parent compound BI can be quickly converted into its microbial metabolite BE, which has stronger bioactive effects than BI.

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut  in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD pathogenesis, influence of microbiome on mitochondrial regulation and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of the disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

Colitis was induced by drinking % DSS from days 0 to 6, followed by  days of drinking normal water. Mice were weighed daily and then sacrificed on day 8. We found that  improved DSS-induced colitis, which was evidenced by reduced weight loss, colon length shortening and histopathology scores and enhanced barrier function. Serum and tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL1α, IL6, IL12A, MIP-1A, G-CSF, and KC) decreased as a result of  administration. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences showed that  induced significant gut  alterations. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokines and other injury factors were negatively associated with , , and , which were prominently abundant in -treated mice. We confirmed that  treatment could ameliorate mucosal inflammation either via microbe-host interactions, which protect the gut barrier function and reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, or by improving the microbial community.

However, the effects of Western and Korean diets on the gut microbiome and host metabolome are unclear. To examine the diet-specific effects on microbiome and metabolome, we conducted a randomized crossover clinical trial of typical Korean diet (TKD), typical American diet (TAD), and recommended American diet (RAD). The trial involved a 4-week consumption of an experimental diet followed by a -week interval before diet crossover. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis identified 16, 10, and 14 differential bacteria genera specific to TKD, RAD, and TAD, respectively. The Firmucutes-Bacteroidetes ratio was increased by TKD. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolome profiling revealed that TKD enriched branched chain amino acid metabolism, whereas ketone body metabolism was evident in RAD and TAD. Microbiome and metabolome responses to the experimental diets varied with individual enterotypes. These findings provide evidence that the gut microbiome and host metabolome rapidly respond to different cultural diets. The findings will inform clarification of the diet-related communication networks of the gut microbiome and host metabolome in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675589>Effects of cadmium on intestinal histology and  in freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).</a></h1><p>In this study, Procambarus clarkii (P. clarkii) were exposed to different concentrations (0, , 5 and 10 mg/L) of cadmium (Cd). We studied the effects of Cd exposure on intestinal histology and  in P. clarkii. The results demonstrated that exposure to Cd caused histological alterations in the intestines of P. clarkii. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Cd exposure could alter the richness, diversity, and composition of intestinal  in P. clarkii. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of the prevalent phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria changed significantly after exposure to Cd. At the genus level, the most prevalent genera with significant difference in relative abundance were Bacteroides, Clostridium XlVb, Hafnia, Buttiauxella, Shewanella, Anaerorhabdus, Alistipes, Arcobacter, Azoarcus, Chryseobacterium, and so on. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of intestinal microbial communities showed that Cd exposure could significantly alter the pathways related to metabolism, diseases, cellular processes, and so on. Taken together, exposure to Cd could induce intestinal histological damage and affect intestinal  composition and functions of P. clarkii. Our study can be an important step toward a better understanding of the toxic effects of Cd on aquatic crustaceans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the , after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and ) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco- cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco- monolayers to palmitic or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic acid had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Five samples of commercial spelt flour were subjected to spontaneous fermentation to obtain a type I sourdough. A total of 186 LAB and 174 yeast isolates were selected at different refreshment steps and subjected to further analyses. Within LAB, coccal isolates constituted 78.5% of the total LAB, with the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus. Although documented before as a component, this is the first report of a spelt sourdough fermentation dominated by this homofermentative LAB, characterized by a high acidification rate, ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to grow in high osmolarity conditions. Yeast communities resulted in four dominant species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Pichia fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae. This study highlights for the first time the biodiversity and dynamics of yeast communities involved in sourdough fermentation of spelt. Compared to commercial baker's yeast, autochthonous W. anomalus, P. fermentans and S. cerevisiae isolates show a good performance, and their use could be an advantage for their acquired adaptation to the environment, providing stability to the fermentation process.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672153>Effect of Enterococcus faecalis 2001 on colitis and depressive-like behavior in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice: involvement of the brain-gut axis.</a></h1><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety; however, the mechanism of psychiatric disorder development remains unclear. Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573550>The gut microbiome and metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors that, if left untreated, will often progress to greater metabolic defects such as type  diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. While these risk factors have been established for over 40 years, the definition of MetS warrants reconsideration in light of the substantial data that have emerged from studies of the gut microbiome. In this Review we present the existing recent literature that supports the gut microbiome's potential influence on the various risk factors of MetS. The interplay of the intestinal  with host metabolism has been shown to be mediated by a myriad of factors, including a defective gut barrier, bile acid metabolism, antibiotic use, and the pleiotropic effects of microbially produced metabolites. These data show that events that start in the gut, often in response to external cues such as diet and circadian disruption, have far-reaching effects beyond the gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619731>Alterations to the Gastrointestinal Microbiome Associated with Methamphetamine Use among Young Men who have Sex with Men.</a></h1><p>Methamphetamine (MA) use is a major public health problem in the United States, especially among people living with HIV (PLWH). Many MA-induced neurotoxic effects are mediated by inflammation and gut  may play a role in this process, yet the effects of MA on the microbiome have not been adequately explored. Therefore, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on rectal swab samples from 381 men who have sex with men, 48% of whom were PLWH and 41% of whom used MA. We compared microbiome composition between MA users and non-users while testing for potential interactions with HIV and controlling for numerous confounders using inverse probability of treatment weighting. We found that MA use explained significant variation in overall composition (R = 0.005, p = 0.008) and was associated with elevated Finegoldia, Parvimonas, Peptoniphilus, and Porphyromonas and reduced Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium, among others. Genera including Actinomyces and Streptobacillus interacted with HIV status, such that they were increased in HIV+ MA users. Finegoldia and Peptoniphilus increased with increasing frequency of MA use, among others. In summary, MA use was associated with a microbial imbalance favoring pro-inflammatory bacteria, including some with neuroactive potential and others that have previously been associated with poor HIV outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596293>Potassium sorbate suppresses intestinal microbial activity and triggers immune regulation in zebrafish (Danio rerio).</a></h1><p>Potassium sorbate (PS) is a class of bacteriostatic antiseptic agent widely used in the food industry; the effects of its intake on host health are currently unclear. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0.1 g L-1 and 1 g L-1 aqueous solutions of PS for  weeks to investigate the impact of PS on the microecological balance of the intestinal  and immune system. PS exposure triggered immune regulation of zebrafish, significantly reducing the content of diverse biomarkers in the gut, including Immunoglobulin G (IgG), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Based on high-throughput sequencing data, it was observed that PS exposure resulted in some destabilization of the microbiome composition of the zebrafish, which mainly manifested as a reduction in the abundance of specific genera and the relative levels of transcription and carbohydrate metabolism related to microbial reproductive ability and activity. These changes were consistent with the activity index of  (AIM), a novel measure that we constructed. Collectively, these results illustrate that PS can affect the immune system of zebrafish by changing the composition and function of the gut , and inhibiting the metabolism of the intestinal . Our study offers a new understanding of the toxicity of PS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573753>The association between vaginal bacterial composition and miscarriage: a nested case-control study.</a></h1><p>To characterise vaginal bacterial composition in early pregnancy and investigate its relationship with first and second trimester miscarriages.Nested case-control study.Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London.161 pregnancies: 64 resulting in first trimester miscarriage, 14 in second trimester miscarriage and 83 term pregnancies.Prospective profiling and comparison of vaginal bacteria composition using 16S rRNA gene-based metataxonomics from 5 weeks' gestation in pregnancies ending in miscarriage or uncomplicated term deliveries matched for age, gestation and body mass index.Relative vaginal bacteria abundance, diversity and richness. Pregnancy outcomes defined as first or second trimester miscarriage, or uncomplicated term delivery.First trimester miscarriage associated with reduced prevalence of Lactobacillus spp.-dominated vaginal  classified using hierarchical clustering analysis (65.6 versus 87.7%; P = 0.005), higher alpha diversity (mean Inverse Simpson Index .5 [95% confidence interval 1.8-3.0] versus 1.5 [1.3-1.7], P = 0.003) and higher richness 25.1 (18.5-31.7) versus 16.7 (13.4-20), P = 0.017), compared with viable pregnancies. This was independent of vaginal bleeding and observable before first trimester miscarriage diagnosis (P = 0.015). Incomplete/complete miscarriage associated with higher proportions of Lactobacillus spp.-depleted communities compared with missed miscarriage. Early pregnancy vaginal bacterial stability was similar between miscarriage and term pregnancies.These findings associate the bacterial component of vaginal  with first trimester miscarriage and indicate suboptimal community composition is established in early pregnancy. While further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism, vaginal bacterial composition may represent a modifiable risk factor for first trimester miscarriage.Vaginal bacterial composition in first trimester miscarriage is associated with reduced Lactobacillus spp. abundance and is independent of vaginal bleeding.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to gain a better insight into the development dynamics of certain bacterial groups during the first week of life.Fecal samples of healthy Simmental calves (dual-purpose breed; n = 80), bottle fed and raised in a dairy farm were taken immediately after birth and at 6/12/24/48/72/168 hours (h) after birth. Samples were analyzed using cultural, biochemical and molecular-biological methods. The aerobe, anaerobe, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus counts of healthy calves increased significantly between 6 and 24 hours postpartum (p <0.05). Apart from the anaerobes, bacterial counts decreased after reaching a plateau at 24 - 48 h. Enterococcus faecalis was detected in significantly higher counts compared to Ent. faecium (p <0.05). Lactobacilli developed more slowly and increased until day 7 after birth to a mean value of 6.8 x 10 CFU  . MALDI-TOF analysis of ,338 lactobacilli isolates resulted in 36 different species.L. reuteri became the most common Lactobacillus sp. during the first week of life.L. reuteri became the most common L. sp. during the first week of life. This fact seems to be very important for the calf's intestinal health because L. reuteri is known to show in-vitro bactericidal effects against bacterial pathogens and anti-infective activities against rotaviruses and Cryptosporidium parvum.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646963>The  structure in the cecum of laying hens contributes to dissimilar HS production.</a></h1><p>Host genotype plays a crucial role in microbial composition of laying hens, which may lead to dissimilar odor gas production. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino acid metabolism-associated pathways (amino acid related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal , which in turn modulates their odor production.

Six multiparous lactating Holstein cows were used in a crossover design (two treatments × two periods). The control treatment (CON) was based on a diet including 50% of grass silage, whereas the experimental treatment (TAN) included grass silage sprayed with OTE (26 g/kg DM) just before baling. Milk yield (on average 24 kg fat protein corrected milk per day) was not affected, but both milk and rumen fatty acids profiles were impacted by OTE. Nitrogen intake (415 g N per cow per day) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE; 0.25 on average) were not affected, but a shift from urine (-8% of N intake relatively to control, P = 0.06) to faecal N (+5%; P = 0.004) was observed with the TAN diet (P ≤ 0.05). Nitrogen apparent digestibility was thus reduced for TAN (-3%; P ≤ 0.05). The effect of OTE on ruminal and milk FA profiles suggests an impact on rumen . Nitrogen isotopic discrimination between animal proteins and diet (Δ15N) was evaluated as a proxy for NUE. While no differences in NUE were observed across diets, a lower Δ15N of plasma proteins was found when comparing TAN v. CON diets. This finding supports the concept that Δ15N would mainly sign the N partitioning at the metabolic level rather than the overall NUE, with the latter also being impacted by digestive processes. Our results agree with a N shift from urine to faeces, and this strategy can thus be adopted to decrease the environmental impact of ruminant protein feeding.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639033>Rescue fecal  transplantation for antibiotic-associated diarrhea in critically ill patients.</a></h1><p>Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a risk factor for exacerbating the outcome of critically ill patients. Dysbiosis induced by the exposure to antibiotics reveals the potential therapeutic role of fecal  transplantation (FMT) in these patients. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the safety and potential benefit of rescue FMT for AAD in critically ill patients.A series of critically ill patients with AAD received rescue FMT from Chinese fmtBank, from September 2015 to February 2019. Adverse events (AEs) and rescue FMT success which focused on the improvement of abdominal symptoms and post-ICU survival rate during a minimum of 12 weeks follow-up were assessed.Twenty critically ill patients with AAD underwent rescue FMT, and 18 of them were included for analysis. The mean of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 21.7 ± 8.3 (range 11-37). Thirteen patients received FMT through nasojejunal tube, four through gastroscopy, and one through enema. Patients were treated with four (4. ± .1, range -9) types of antibiotics before and during the onset of AAD. 38.9% (7/18) of patients had FMT-related AEs during follow-up, including increased diarrhea frequency, abdominal pain, increased serum amylase, and fever. Eight deaths unrelated to FMT occurred during follow-up. One hundred percent (/) of abdominal pain, 86.7% (13/15) of diarrhea, 69.% (9/13) of abdominal distention, and 50% (1/) of hematochezia were improved after FMT. 44.4% (8/18) of patients recovered from abdominal symptoms without recurrence and survived for a minimum of 12 weeks after being discharged from ICU.In this case series studying the use of FMT in critically ill patients with AAD, good clinical outcomes without infectious complications were observed. These findings could potentially encourage researchers to set up new clinical trials that will provide more insight into the potential benefit and safety of the procedure in the ICU.ClinicalTrials.gov, Number  .

We examined associations between micronutrient intake and a low-Lactobacillus vaginal  as assessed by molecular methods (termed "molecular-BV").This cross-sectional analysis utilized data collected at the baseline visit of the Hormonal Contraception Longitudinal Study, a cohort of reproductive-aged women followed over  years while initiating or ceasing hormonal contraception (HC). The Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaire was administered and micronutrient intakes were ranked. Vaginal  composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and clustered into community state types (CSTs) based on the types and relative abundance of bacteria detected. Associations between the lowest estimated quartile intake of nutrients and having a low-Lactobacillus CST (molecular-BV) were evaluated by logistic regression. Separate models were built for each nutrient controlling for age, body mass index, behavioral factors, HC use and total energy intake. We also conducted a literature review of existing data on associations between micronutrient intakes and BV.Samples from 104 women were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 25.8 years (SD 4.3), 29.8% were African American, 48.1% were using HC, and 25% had molecular-BV. In adjusted multivariable analyses, the lowest quartile of betaine intake was associated with an increased odds of molecular-BV (aOR 9., p value < 0.01, [CI .4-35.0]).This is the first study to assess the association between estimated micronutrient intake and molecular-BV. Lower energy-adjusted intake of betaine was associated with an increased risk of molecular-BV. Betaine might have direct effects on the vaginal microenvironment or may be mediated through the gut . Additional research is needed to determine reproducibility of this finding and whether improved intake of select micronutrients such as betaine decreases the risk of BV and its sequelae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650293>Oral microbial influences on oral mucositis during radiotherapy treatment of head and neck cancer.</a></h1><p>Oral mucositis (OM) remains a significant complication developed by many patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) to the head and neck region. Emerging data suggest oral microbes may contribute to the onset and severity of this acute side effect.In this study, saliva and oral swabs from head and neck cancer patients undergoing RT were collected. We employed molecular microbiological techniques to study the bacterial communities present in saliva, and both the bacterial and fungal communities present on the buccal mucosa and lateral tongue. Changes in  composition with increasing radiation dose and the presence of mucositis were examined.The data suggest that the salivary  remain stable during RT and are consistently dominated by Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium and Granulicatella. Obligate and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) Bacteroidales G2, Capnocytophaga, Eikenella, Mycoplasma and Sneathia, as well as anaerobic GNB in the periopathogenic genera Porphyromonas and Tannerella, were all positively correlated with ≥ grade  OM. Significant increases in the relative abundances of Bacteroidales G2, Fusobacterium and Sneathia were identified in buccal mucosa swabs at sites of ≥ grade  OM (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the abundance of several GNB (Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Tannerella, Porphyromonas and Eikenella) on the buccal mucosa may influence patient susceptibility to developing OM. Candida was widely detected in buccal mucosa swabs, regardless of mucositis status.Our findings support previously hypothesized associations between oral health and the pathogenesis of OM, highlighting the importance of oral health interventions for head and neck cancer patients.</p></html>
