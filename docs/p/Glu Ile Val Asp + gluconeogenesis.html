The experimental design was a split plot, with cow as the whole plot, treatment as the whole-plot factor and days in milk (DIM) as the subplot factor. Cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control or infusion of 1,500 g/d of glucose into the abomasum from the day of calving to 29 DIM. Cows were sampled prepartum and at 4, 15, and 29 DIM. Postpartum dry matter intake increased at a lower rate with infusion compared with the control. Arterial concentrations of all essential AA (EAA) were lower with infusion compared with the control. Net portal fluxes of His, , Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, , Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr were lower with infusion compared with the control and the net portal fluxes of these AA showed positive correlations with dry matter intake, whereas the net portal fluxes of , , and Gln were unaffected by treatment. Net hepatic fluxes of EAA were not affected by treatment but increased as lactation progressed with both treatments. On a net basis, all EAA were removed by the liver prepartum and at 4 DIM, whereas Met, Phe, and Thr were the only EAA being removed at 29 DIM. Except for Ala, AA removed by the liver might be used primarily for noncatabolic processes, as exemplified by the 16% of hepatic Gly uptake accounted for as urinary hippurate. The measured hepatic uptake of glucogenic precursors (glucogenic AA, volatile fatty acids, lactate, and glycerol) accounted for 50 to 90% of the hepatic release of glucose. The hepatic urea output accounted for more than 100% of the hepatic ureagenic precursor uptake, indicating that the glucogenic precursors unaccounted for are nonnitrogen-containing compounds. In conclusion, an increased exogenous glucose supply to the small intestine did not seem to affect the amount of EAA and non-EAA available for peripheral tissues in early lactation, and the study did not indicate an AA-sparing effect of small intestinal glucose absorption. In periparturient dairy cows, hepatic catabolism of AA was not driven by the increased whole-body demand for glucose, and Ala was the only AA that contributed substantially to hepatic . In very early lactation, the supply of EAA might be of greater concern than the supply of glucogenic substrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15356277>Integrating the universal metabolism into a phylogenetic analysis.</a></h2><p>The darwinian concept of "descent with modification" applies to metabolic pathways: pathways sharing similarities must have inherited them from an exclusive, hypothetical ancestral pathway. Comparative anatomy of biochemical pathways is performed using five criteria of homology. Primary homologies of "type I" were defined as several pathways sharing the same enzyme with high specificity for its substrate. Primary homologies of "type II" were defined as the sharing of similar enzymatic functions, cofactors, functional family, or recurrence of a set of reactions. Standard cladistic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary history of metabolic development and the relative ordering of biochemical reactions through time, from a single matrix integrating the whole basic universal metabolism. The cladogram shows that the earliest pathways to emerge are metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II (, Asn, , and Gln). The earliest enzymatic functions are mostly linked to amino acid catabolism: deamination, transamination, and decarboxylation. For some amino acids, catabolism and biosynthesis occur at the same time (, , Lys, and Met). Catabolism precedes anabolism for Asn, Gln, Arg, Trp, His, Tyr, and Phe, and anabolism precedes catabolism for Pro, Ala, Leu, , , Cys, Gly, Ser, and Thr. The urea cycle evolves from arginine synthesis. Metabolism of fatty acids and sugars develops after the full development of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II, and they are associated with the anabolism of amino acids of groups III and IV. Syntheses of aromatic amino acids are branched within sugar metabolism. The Krebs cycle occurs relatively late after the setting of metabolism of amino acids of groups I and II. One portion of the Krebs cycle has a catabolic origin, whereas the other portion has an anabolic origin in pathways of amino acids of groups III and IV. It is not possible to order glycolysis and  with regard to the Krebs cycle, as they all belong to "period 6." Pentose-phosphate and Calvin cycles are later (periods 7 and 8, respectively). Cladistic analysis of the structure of biochemical pathways makes hypotheses in biochemical evolution explicit and parsimonious.</p></html>
