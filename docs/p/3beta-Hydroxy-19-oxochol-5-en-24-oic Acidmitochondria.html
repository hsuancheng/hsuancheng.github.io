<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583724>iTRAQ-based mitochondrial proteome analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying postharvest senescence of Zizania latifolia.</a></h1><p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying postharvest senescence of Zizania latifolia, the changes in the mitochondrial proteome of plants treated with or without (control) 1-methyleyelopropene and ethylene during storage at room temperature for 0, 3 and 6 days were investigated using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling combined with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1,390 proteins with two or more peptides were identified, of which 211 showed a significant (p < .05) change (at least twofold) in relative abundance. Monitoring the parallel reaction validated the reliability and accuracy of the iTRAQ results. Bioinformatics and functional analysis of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) revealed that postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia could be attributed to (a) strengthened pentose phosphate pathway, (b) imbalanced protein, amino , organic , and fatty  metabolism, (c) disordered energy homeostasis, (d) exacerbated oxidative damage, (e) RNA degradation, (f) activation of the Ca , mitogen-activated protein kinase, and jasmonic  signaling pathways, (g) programed cell death, (h) excessive biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, or (i) degradation of cell structure. Our findings provide integrated insight into the molecular mechanisms of postharvest senescence during storage as well as the DEPs that show promise as targets for controlling senescence-induced quality deterioration of Z. latifolia. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Postharvest senescence is the most important factor that causes fast quality deterioration of Zizania latifolia. The understanding of the processes leading to postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia is essential in enhancing the commercial value and extending the shelf life of the product. It is currently believed that the mitochondrial metabolism is closely related to postharvest senescence. For this, the changes of proteome in Z. latifolia  treated with or without (control) 1-MCP and ETH during storage at room temperature were investigated. Results showed that a variety of physiobiochemical responses occur during postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia. 1-MCP treatment significantly inhibited the changes of these physiobiochemical processes, finally, retarding the postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia. ETH treatment had opposite effects on proteome changes compared with 1-MCP treatment. Taken together, these results enrich the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of postharvest senescence of Z. latifolia.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541868>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of cinnamic  derivatives with synergetic neuroprotection and angiogenesis effect.</a></h1><p>As for complex brain diseases involved with multiple pathogenic factors, it is extremely difficult to achieve curative effect by acting on a single target. Multi-approach drugs provide a promising prospect in the treatment of complex brain diseases and have been attracting more and more interest. Enlightened by synergetic effect of combination in traditional herb medicines, forty-two novel cinnamic  derivatives were designed and synthesized by introducing capsaicin and/or ligustrazine moieties to enhance biological activities in both neurological function and neurovascular protection. Elevated levels of cell viability on human brain microvascular endothelium cell line (HBMEC-2) and human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) against free radical injury were observed in most of compounds. Among them, compound 14a exhibited the most potent activities with a significant EC value of 3.26 ± 0.16 μM (HBMEC-2) and 2.41 ± 0.10 μM (SH-SY5Y). Subsequently, the results of morphological staining and flow cytometry analysis experiments on both cell lines showed that 14a had the potential to block apoptosis, maintain cell morphological integrity and protect physiological function of . Moreover, 14a displayed specific angiogenesis effect in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay; and the results of RT-PCR suggested that the mechanism for angiogenesis effect was associated with the enhancement of the expressions of VEGFR2 mRNA in chick embryo. Preliminary structure-activity relationship was analyzed. The above evidences suggested that conjunctures gained by combining active ingredients in traditional herb medicines deserved further study and might provide references in discovering dual-effective lead compounds for brain diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

MMUT catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an anaplerotic reaction which feeds into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle. As part of the pathological mechanisms of MMA, previous studies have suggested there is decreased TCA activity due to a "toxic inhibition" of TCA cycle enzymes by MMA related metabolites, in addition to reduced anaplerosis. Here, we have utilized  isolated from livers of a mouse model of MMA (Mut-ko/ki) and their littermate controls (Ki/wt) to examine the amounts and enzyme functions of most of the TCA cycle enzymes. We have performed mRNA quantification, protein semi-quantitation, and enzyme activity quantification for TCA cycle enzymes in these samples. Expression profiling showed increased mRNA levels of fumarate hydratase in the Mut-ko/ki samples, which by contrast had reduced protein levels as detected by immunoblot, while all other mRNA levels were unaltered. Immunoblotting also revealed decreased protein levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Interesting, the decreased protein amount of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was reflected in decreased activity for this enzyme while there is a trend towards decreased activity of fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3, succinyl-CoA synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase are not statistically different in terms of quantity of enzyme or activity. Finally, we found decreased activity when examining the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in series with succinate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase in the Mut-ko/ki mice compared to their littermate controls, as expected. This study demonstrates decreased activity of certain TCA cycle enzymes and by corollary decreased TCA cycle function, but it supports decreased protein quantity rather than "toxic inhibition" as the underlying mechanism of action. SUMMARY: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn metabolic disorder of propionate catabolism. In this disorder, toxic metabolites are considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism for acute and long-term complications. However, despite optimized therapies aimed at reducing metabolite levels, patients continue to suffer from late complications, including metabolic stroke and renal insufficiency. Since the propionate pathway feeds into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, we investigated TCA cycle function in a constitutive MMA mouse model. We demonstrated decreased amounts of the TCA enzymes, Mdh2 and Ogdh as semi-quantified by immunoblot. Enzymatic activity of Ogdh is also decreased in the MMA mouse model compared to controls. Thus, when the enzyme amounts are decreased, we see the enzymatic activity also decreased to a similar extent for Ogdh. Further studies to elucidate the structural and/or functional links between the TCA cycle and propionate pathways might lead to new treatment approaches for MMA patients.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, ten AOX genes () were identified, and CysI and CysII of AOX isoforms were highly conserved in rapeseed. Among them,  was mainly expressed in the ovule and displayed varying expression between rapeseed cultivars which showed different salt resistance in seed germination. We identified its mitochondrial localization of this gene. To investigate the function of  in rapeseed, transgenic rapeseed lines with overexpressed  were created and seed germination and seedling establishment assays were performed under osmotic, salt, and ABA treatment. The results indicated that overexpression of  significantly improved seed germination under osmotic and salt stress and weakened ABA sensitivity. In addition, post-germination seedling growth was improved under high salt condition, but showed hypersensitivity to ABA. RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that the genes involved in electron transport or energy pathway were induced and a number of gene responses to salt stress and ABA were regulated in  overexpressing seeds. Taken together, our results imply that  confers tolerance to osmotic and salt stress in terms of seed germination and seedling establishment by regulating stress responsive genes and the response to ABA, and could be utilized as a candidate gene in transgenic breeding.Copyright © 2019 Yang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606807>Tissue-Specific Peculiarities of Vibration-Induced Hypoxia in Rabbit Liver and Kidney.</a></h1><p>Activity of the energy production systems in rabbit liver and kidney under conditions of unfavorable vibration exposure was studied by the polarography method using a galvanic-type closed oxygen sensor.

Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty  oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty  oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty  oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tumourigenic cells oxidise glucose by fermentation and generate lactate and adenosine triphosphate even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect). The Na/H-antiporter is upregulated in tumourigenic cells resulting in release of lactate- and H ions into the extracellular space. Accumulation of lactate- and proton ions in the extracellular space results in an acidic environment that promotes invasion and metastasis. Otto Warburg reported that tumourigenic cells have defective  that produce less energy. However, decades later it became evident that these  have adapted with alterations in mitochondrial content, structure, function and activity. Mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy regulate the formation of new  and degradation of defective  in order to combat accumulation of mutagenic mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic . Tumourigenic cells also produce increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from upregulated glycolysis leading to pathogenesis including cancer. Moderate ROS levels exert proliferative- and prosurvival signaling, while high ROS quantities induce cell death. Understanding the crosstalk between aberrant metabolism, redox regulation, mitochondrial adaptions and pH regulation provides scientific- and medical communities with new opportunities to explore cancer therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003).  postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty  concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty  and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526819>Propionic  induces mitochondrial dysfunction and affects gene expression for  biogenesis and neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y cell line.</a></h1><p>Studies in animal models have shown that the short-chain fatty , propionic  (PPA), interferes with mitochondrial metabolism leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PPA on mitochondrial function and gene expression in neuronal cells. SH-SY5Y cells and normal human neural progenitor (NHNP) cells were exposed to 1, 5 mM PPA for 4 or 24 h and we found that the mitochondrial potential measured in SH-SY5Y cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner after PPA treatment. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that the size of the  was significantly reduced following PPA treatment. A dose-dependent increase in the mitochondrial DNA copy number was observed in the PPA-treated cells. The expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins PGC-1α, TFAM, SIRT3, and COX4 was significantly increased after PPA treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that mRNA expression in the notch signaling-related genes ASCL1 and LFNG changed after PPA treatment and the positive correlated protein expression changes were also observed. These results revealed that PPA treatment may affect neurodevelopment by altering mitochondrial function and notch signaling-related gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520071>pLG72 levels increase in early phase of Alzheimer's disease but decrease in late phase.</a></h1><p>pLG72, named as D-amino  oxidase activator (although it is not an activator of D-amino  oxidase demonstrated by later studies), in  has been regarded as an important modulator of D-amino  oxidase that can regulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Both oxidative stress in  and NMDAR neurotransmission play essential roles in the process of neurodegenerative dementia. The aim of the study was to investigate whether pLG72 levels changed with the severity of neurodegenerative dementia. We enrolled 376 individuals as the overall cohort, consisting of five groups: healthy elderly, amnestic mild cognitive impairment [MCI], mild Alzheimer's disease [AD], moderate AD, and severe AD. pLG72 levels in plasma were measured using Western blotting. The severity of cognitive deficit was principally evaluated by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. A gender- and age- matched cohort was selected to elucidate the effects of gender and age. pLG72 levels increased in the MCI and mild AD groups when compared to the healthy group. However, pLG72 levels in the moderate and severe AD groups were lower than those in the mild AD group. D-serine level and D- to total serine ratio were significantly different among the five groups. L-serine levels were correlated with the pLG72 levels. The results in the gender- and age- matched cohort were similar to those of the overall cohort. The finding supports the hypothesis of NMDAR hypofunction in early-phase dementia and NMDAR hyperfunction in late-phase dementia. Further studies are warranted to test whether pLG72 could reflect the function of NMDAR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575700>Sirtuin 5 Regulates Proximal Tubule Fatty  Oxidation to Protect against AKI.</a></h1><p>The primary site of damage during AKI, proximal tubular epithelial cells, are highly metabolically active, relying on fatty  to meet their energy demands. These cells are rich in  and peroxisomes, the two organelles that mediate fatty  oxidation. Emerging evidence shows that both fatty  pathways are regulated by reversible posttranslational modifications, particularly by lysine acylation. Sirtuin 5 (Sirt5), which localizes to both  and peroxisomes, reverses post-translational lysine acylation on several enzymes involved in fatty  oxidation. However, the role of the Sirt5 in regulating kidney energy metabolism has yet to be determined.We subjected male Sirt5-deficient mice (either +/- or -/-) and wild-type controls, as well as isolated proximal tubule cells, to two different AKI models (ischemia-induced or cisplatin-induced AKI). We assessed kidney function and injury with standard techniques and measured fatty  oxidation by the catabolism of C-labeled palmitate to CO.Sirt5 was highly expressed in proximal tubular epithelial cells. At baseline,  knockout ( ) mice had modestly decreased mitochondrial function but significantly increased fatty  oxidation, which was localized to the peroxisome. Although no overt kidney phenotype was observed in  mice,  mice had significantly improved kidney function and less tissue damage compared with controls after either ischemia-induced or cisplatin-induced AKI. This coincided with higher peroxisomal fatty  oxidation compared with  fatty  oxidation in the  proximal tubular epithelial cells.Our findings indicate that Sirt5 regulates the balance of mitochondrial versus peroxisomal fatty  oxidation in proximal tubular epithelial cells to protect against injury in AKI. This novel mechanism might be leveraged for developing AKI therapies.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655859>Deletion of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 knocks  down triggering metabolic rewiring in yeast.</a></h1><p>The Voltage-Dependent Anion-selective Channel (VDAC) is the pore-forming protein of mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing metabolites and ions exchanges. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole metabolism suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483243>Identification of peptide domains involved in the subcellular localization of the feline coronavirus 3b protein.</a></h1><p>Feline coronavirus (FCoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly fatal systemic disease in cats.

Using serial truncated mutants, we showed that nucleolar accumulation is controlled by a joint nucleolar and nuclear localization signal (NoLS/NLS) in which the identified overlapping pat4 motifs (residues 53-57) play a critical role. Mutational analysis also revealed that mitochondrial translocation is mediated by N-terminal residues 10-35, in which a Tom20 recognition motif (residues 13-17) and two other overlapping hexamers (residues 24-30) associated with mitochondrial targeting were identified. In addition, a second Tom20 recognition motif was identified further downstream (residues 61-65), although the mitochondrial translocation evoked by these residues seemed less efficient as a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution was also observed.

Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of palmitic  (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty -free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

However, the relationship between SIRT3 and aberrant lipid synthesis in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance of SIRT3 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and normal tissues. To analyze the role of SIRT3 in CCSC in vitro, endogenous SIRT3 levels were up- and down-regulated in SiHa and C33a cells, respectively, via lentiviral-based transfection. Levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Acetylation levels for acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC1) were measured with the anti-acetyllysine antibody. Knockdown of SIRT3 reduced levels of cellular lipid content in cells. To investigate the role of SIRT3 in cell proliferation, nude mice were xenografted with SIRT3-overexpressing or SIRT3-knockdown CCSC cells. Overall, the results demonstrate that SIRT3 significantly contributed to the reprogramming of FA synthesis in CCSC by up-regulating ACC1 to promote de novo lipogenesis by SIRT3 deacetylation. Moreover, the findings show that the SIRT3-mediated regulation of FA synthesis played a critical role in the proliferation and metastasis of CCSC cells, suggesting that SIRT3 has therapeutic potential in CCSC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645900>Mechanisms by which PE21, an extract from the white willow , delays chronological aging in budding yeast.</a></h1><p>We have recently found that PE21, an extract from the white willow , slows chronological aging and prolongs longevity of the yeast  more efficiently than any of the previously known pharmacological interventions. Here, we investigated mechanisms through which PE21 delays yeast chronological aging and extends yeast longevity. We show that PE21 causes a remodeling of lipid metabolism in chronologically aging yeast, thereby instigating changes in the concentrations of several lipid classes. We demonstrate that such changes in the cellular lipidome initiate three mechanisms of aging delay and longevity extension. The first mechanism through which PE21 slows aging and prolongs longevity consists in its ability to decrease the intracellular concentration of free fatty . This postpones an age-related onset of liponecrotic cell death promoted by excessive concentrations of free fatty . The second mechanism of aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to decrease the concentrations of triacylglycerols and to increase the concentrations of glycerophospholipids within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This activates the unfolded protein response system in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then decelerates an age-related decline in protein and lipid homeostasis and slows down an aging-associated deterioration of cell resistance to stress. The third mechanisms underlying aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to change lipid concentrations in the mitochondrial membranes. This alters certain catabolic and anabolic processes in , thus amending the pattern of aging-associated changes in several key aspects of mitochondrial functionality.Copyright: © 2019 Medkour et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495025>Sperm competitive advantage of a rare mitochondrial haplogroup linked to differential expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes.</a></h1><p>Maternal inheritance of  creates a sex-specific selective sieve through which mitochondrial mutations harmful to males but not females accumulate and contribute to sexual differences in longevity and disease susceptibility. Because eggs and sperm are under disruptive selection, sperm are predicted to be particularly vulnerable to the genetic load generated by maternal inheritance, yet evidence for mitochondrial involvement in male fertility is limited and controversial. Here, we exploit the coexistence of two divergent mitochondrial haplogroups (A and B2) in a Neotropical arachnid to investigate the role of  in sperm competition. DNA profiling demonstrated that B2-carrying males sired more than three times as many offspring in sperm competition experiments than A males, and this B2 competitive advantage cannot be explained by female mitochondrial haplogroup or male nuclear genetic background. RNA-Seq of testicular tissues implicates differential expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes in the B2 competitive advantage, including a 22-fold upregulation of atp8 in B2 males. Previous comparative genomic analyses have revealed functionally significant amino  substitutions in differentially expressed genes, indicating that the mitochondrial haplogroups differ not only in expression but also in DNA sequence and protein functioning. However, mitochondrial haplogroup had no effect on sperm number or sperm viability, and, when females were mated to a single male, neither male haplogroup, female haplogroup nor the interaction between male/female haplogroup significantly affected female reproductive success. Our findings therefore suggest that mitochondrial effects on male reproduction may often go undetected in noncompetitive contexts and may prove more important in nature than is currently appreciated.© 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Mitochondrial fusion is primarily controlled by three GTPases, mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), Mfn2, and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1), while mitochondrial fission is primarily regulated by GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Dysregulated activity of these GTPases results in disrupted mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism. This review will update the metabolic roles of these GTPases in obesity, diabetes, and cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480399>Transport of Ca and Ca-Dependent Permeability Transition in Rat Liver  under the Streptozotocin-Induced Type I Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Although diabetes mellitus is known to be a disease associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, not everything is clear about mitochondrial Ca transport and Ca-induced permeability transition in diabetic cells. The objective of this work was to study the operation of MCU and Ca-dependent mitochondrial permeabilization in the liver cells of Sprague-Dawley rats under the streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes. It was shown that two weeks after the induction of diabetes, the rate of Ca uptake by the  of diabetic animals increased ~1.4-fold. The expression of MCU and MICU1 subunits did not change, yet the quantity of dominant-negative MCUb channel subunits was almost twice as lower. The organelles also became more resistant to the induction of CsA-sensitive MPT pore and less resistant to the induction of CsA-insensitive palmitate/Ca-induced pore. The  of diabetic liver cells also showed changes in the lipid matrix of their membranes. The content of fatty  in the membranes grew, and microviscosity of the lipid bilayer (assessed with laurdan) increased. At the same time, lipid peroxidation (assessed by the production of malonic dialdehyde) was stimulated. The paper discusses the consequences of the diabetes-related changes in  in the context of cell physiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541249>Long-living budding yeast cell subpopulation induced by ethanol/acetate and respiration.</a></h1><p>Budding yeast generate heterogeneous cells that can be separated into 2 distinctive cell types: short-living low density (LD) and long-living high density (HD) cells by density gradient centrifugation. We found that ethanol and acetate induce formation of HD cells, and mitochondrial respiration is required. From their transcriptomes and metabolomes, we found up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HD cells involved in the RGT2/RGT1 glucose sensing pathway and its down-stream genes encoding hexose transporters. For HD cells, we determined an abundance of various carbon sources including glucose, lactate, pyruvate, trehalose, mannitol, mannose, and galactose. Other up-regulated DEGs in HD cells were involved in the TORC1-SCH9 signaling pathway and its down-stream genes involved in cytoplasmic translation. We also measured an abundance of free amino  in HD cells including valine, proline, isoleucine, and glutamine. These characteristics of the HD cell transcriptome and metabolome may be important conditions for maintaining a long-living phenotype.© The Author(s) 2019.

Restorer of fertility 4 (Rf4), the major fertility restorer gene of CMS-C, is located on chromosome 8S. To positionally clone Rf4, a large F3 population derived from a cross between a non-restorer and restorer (n = 5104) was screened for recombinants and then phenotyped for tassel fertility, resulting in a final map-based cloning interval of 12 kb. Within this 12-kb interval, the only likely candidate for Rf4 was GRMZM2G021276, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor with tassel-specific expression. The Rf4 gene product contains a nuclear localization signal and is likely to not interact directly with the . Sequence analysis of Rf4 revealed four encoded amino  substitutions between restoring and non-restoring inbreds, however only one substitution, F187Y, was within the highly conserved bHLH domain. The hypothesis that Rf4 restoration is altered by a single amino  was tested by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) homology directed repair (HDR) to create isogenic lines that varied for the F187Y substitution. In a population of these CRISPR-Cas9 edited plants (n = 780) that was phenotyped for tassel fertility, plants containing F187 were completely fertile, indicating fertility restoration, and plants containing Y187 were sterile, indicating lack of fertility restoration. Structural modeling shows that this amino  residue 187 is located within the four helix bundle core, a critical region for stabilizing dimer conformation and affecting interaction partner selection.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630795>Von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 8 (VWA8) localizes to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane.</a></h1><p>VWA8 is a poorly characterized mitochondrial AAA + ATPase protein. The specific submitochondrial localization of VWA8 remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the specific submitochondrial compartment within which VWA8 resides in order to provide more insight into the function of this protein. Bioinformatics analysis showed that VWA8 has a 34 amino  N-terminal Matrix-Targeting Signal (MTS) that is similar to those in proteins known to localize to the mitochondrial matrix. Experiments in C2C12 mouse myoblasts using confocal microscopy showed that deletion of the VWA8 MTS (vMTS) resulted in cytosolic, rather than mitochondrial, localization of VWA8. Biochemical analysis using differential sub-fractionation of  isolated from rat liver showed that VWA8 localizes to the matrix side of inner mitochondrial membrane, similar to the inner mitochondrial membrane protein Electron Transfer Flavoprotein-ubiquinone Oxidoreductase (ETFDH). The results of these experiments show that the vMTS is essential for localization to the mitochondrial matrix and that once there, VWA8 localizes to the matrix side of inner mitochondrial membrane.Copyright © 2019.

Modifications of rRNA are key for ribosome production and function. Identification and characterization of enzymes involved in epitranscriptome shaping is instrumental for the elucidation of the functional roles of specific RNA modifications. Ten modified sites have been thus far identified in the mammalian mitochondrial rRNA. Enzymes responsible for two of these modifications have not been characterized. Here, we identify METTL15, show that it is the main N4-methylcytidine (m4C) methyltransferase in human cells and demonstrate that it is responsible for the methylation of position C839 in mitochondrial 12S rRNA. We show that the lack of METTL15 results in a reduction of the mitochondrial de novo protein synthesis and decreased steady-state levels of protein components of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Without functional METTL15, the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome is decreased, with the late assembly components being unable to be incorporated efficiently into the small subunit. We speculate that m4C839 is involved in the stabilization of 12S rRNA folding, therefore facilitating the assembly of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunits. Taken together our data show that METTL15 is a novel protein necessary for efficient translation in human .© The Author(s) 2019.

We tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributes to impaired protein synthesis and increased proteolysis resulting in tissue atrophy in a comprehensive array of models. In myotubes treated with ethanol, using unbiased approaches, we identified defects in mitochondrial electron transport chain components, endogenous antioxidants, and enzymes regulating the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle. Using high sensitivity respirometry, we observed impaired cellular respiration, decreased function of complexes I, II, and IV, and a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation in ethanol-treated myotubes and muscle from ethanol-fed mice. These perturbations resulted in lower skeletal muscle ATP content and redox ratio (NAD/NADH). Ethanol also caused a leak of electrons, primarily from complex III, with generation of mitochondrial ROS and reverse electron transport. Oxidant stress with lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric  reactive substances) and protein oxidation (carbonylated proteins) were increased in myotubes and skeletal muscle from mice and humans with alcoholic liver disease. Ethanol also impaired succinate oxidation in the TCA cycle with decreased metabolic intermediates. MitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial specific antioxidant, reversed ethanol-induced mitochondrial perturbations (including reduced oxygen consumption, generation of ROS and oxidative stress), increased TCA cycle intermediates, and reversed impaired protein synthesis and the sarcopenic phenotype. We show that ethanol causes skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased protein synthesis, and increased autophagy, and that these perturbations are reversed by targeting mitochondrial ROS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL-2 and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and increased the expression of tight junction proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of -associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive oxygen species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of tight junction proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty  uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto  decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic  cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in , and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino  catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino  transaminase, branched-chain α-keto  dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino , thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino  in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino , as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino , alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino  catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino  catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric , increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric  concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561610>Subcellular Energetics and Carbon Storage in .</a></h1><p>Microalgae have emerged as a promising platform for production of carbon- and energy- rich molecules, notably starch and oil. Establishing an economically viable algal biotechnology sector requires a holistic understanding of algal photosynthesis, physiology, cell cycle and metabolism. Starch/oil productivity is a combined effect of their cellular content and cell division activities. Cell growth, starch and fatty  synthesis all require carbon building blocks and a source of energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, but with a different requirement in ATP/NADPH ratio. Thus, several cellular mechanisms have been developed by microalgae to balance ATP and NADPH supply which are essentially produced by photosynthesis. Major energy management mechanisms include ATP production by the chloroplast-based cyclic electron flow and NADPH removal by water-water cycles. Furthermore, energetic coupling between chloroplast and other cellular compartments,  and peroxisome, is increasingly recognized as an important process involved in the chloroplast redox poise. Emerging literature suggests that alterations of energy management pathways affect not only cell fitness and survival, but also influence biomass content and composition. These emerging discoveries are important steps towards diverting algal photosynthetic energy to useful products for biotechnological applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541853>Folate-decorated, endostatin-loaded, nanoparticles for anti-proliferative chemotherapy in esophaegeal squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>This study aims to design and synthesize Endostatin (ENT)-loaded nanoparticles using Folic  (FA) as a driver for targeted anti-proliferative chemotherapy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC).

FA-ENT nanoparticles were internalized into ESCC cells with preferential binging to the nucleus and  for necrotic and apoptotic effects. Nanoparticles showed increased proliferation inhibition of 64.71% and reduced KYSE-30 cell migration of up to 74.12% when compared to the control. Positively charged spherical nanoparticles, with selective pH responsive ENT release, were further tested in vivo employing a tumor xenograft model. Tumor mass increased up to 5505.54 mm in the control group while a substantial reduction occurred in the treatment group (native ENT, ENT-nano and FA-ENT-nano) down to 128.23 mm (97.67%). Tumor volume was reduced from 1000.2 mm to 567.64 mm (43.25%) in the native ENT group, from 324.43 mm to 190.25 mm (41.36%) in ENT-nano group (non-targeted system), and from 1374.21 mm to 998.67 mm (27.33%) in FA-ENT-nano group (targeted system) following treatment.

It is now evident that  are involved in the malignant transformation, cell proliferation, aggression and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer (PC). Recent comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial oncobioenergetic (MOB) profile of PC cells using microplate-based high resolution respirometry has clearly demonstrated that characteristic MOB alterations occur at different stages of PC development. Additionally, studies have reported that modification of the MOB profile significantly inhibits the growth of malignant cells. This observation suggests that dynamic alterations in the MOB function are a critical component in the development of malignant disease of the prostate. Therefore, quantification of MOB function may be a good marker for the prediction of tumor stage. Future studies may develop novel approaches to measure oncobioenergetics of tumors with minimal invasive procedures effectively in men to determine the general prostate health and tumor staging, and to predict whether a tumor will proceed to malignancy in patients. Additionally, since PC is a slow growing tumor, modulating the MOB profile at specific stages of tumor development may be a novel approach to treat or prevent PC.Copyright: © Vayalil et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562244>Enhancing cardiac glycolysis causes an increase in PDK4 content in response to short term high fat diet.</a></h1><p>The healthy heart has a dynamic capacity to respond and adapt to changes in nutrient availability. Metabolic inflexibility, such as occurs with diabetes, increases cardiac reliance on fatty  to meet energetic demands and this results in deleterious effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction, that contribute to pathophysiology. Enhancing glucose usage may mitigate metabolic inflexibility and be advantageous under such conditions. Here, we sought to identify how mitochondrial function and cardiac metabolism are affected in a transgenic mouse model of enhanced cardiac glycolysis (GlycoHi) basally and following a short-term (7d) high fat diet (HFD). GlycoHimice constitutively express an active form of phosphofructokinase-2, resulting in elevated levels of the PFK-1 allosteric activator fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. We report that basally GlycoHi  exhibit augmented pyruvate supported respiration relative to fatty . Nevertheless, both wild type and GlycoHi  had a similar shift towards increased rates of fatty  supported respiration following HFD. Metabolic profiling by GC-MS revealed distinct features based on both genotype and diet, with a unique increase in branched chain amino  in the GlycoHi HFD group. Targeted quantitative proteomics analysis also supported both genotype and diet-dependent changes in protein expression and uncovered an enhanced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in the GlycoHiHFD group.  These results support a newly identified mechanism whereby the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate promote mitochondrial PDK4 levels and identifies a secondary adaptive response that prevents excessive mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation when glycolysis is sustained after a high fat dietary challenge.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518503>Human concentrations of uric  scavenges adaptive and maladaptive ROS in isolated rat hearts subjected to ischemic stress.</a></h1><p>Uric  is a purine degradation product but also an important antioxidant and ROS scavenger. Experimental settings that mimic myocardial ischemia-reperfusion have not included uric  despite that it is always present in human extracellular fluid and plasma. We hypothesized that uric  has an important role in myocardial ROS scavenging. Here, we tested the cardiac response to uric  on infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion with and without exacerbated oxidative stress due to acute pressure overload and during preconditioning. We also examined mitochondrial respiration and ROS-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Under exacerbated ROS stress induced by high pressure perfusion, uric  lowered oxidative stress and reduced infarct size. In contrast, uric  blocked cardioprotection induced by ischemic preconditioning. However, this effect was reversed by probenecid, an inhibitor of cellular uptake of uric . In accordance, in intact cardiomyocytes, extracellular uric  reduced the susceptibility of  towards opening of the permeability transition pore, suggesting that uric  may prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury due to scavenging of maladaptive ROS. Moreover, as uric  also scavenges also adaptive ROS, this may interfere with preconditioning. Altogether, uric  might be a confounder when translating preclinical experimental results into clinical treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550237>Dominant mutations in mtDNA maintenance gene SSBP1 cause optic atrophy and foveopathy.</a></h1><p>Mutations in genes encoding components of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication machinery cause mtDNA depletion syndromes (MDS), which associate ocular features with severe neurological syndromes. Here, we identified heterozygous missense mutations in SSBP1 in five unrelated families, leading to the R38Q and R107Q amino- changes in the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein, a crucial protein involved in mtDNA replication. All affected individuals presented optic atrophy, associated with foveopathy in half of the cases. To uncover the structural features underlying SSBP1 mutations, we determined a new revised SSBP1 crystal structure. Structural analysis suggests that both mutations affect dimer interactions and presumably distort the DNA binding region. Using patient fibroblasts, we validated that the R38Q variant destabilizes SSBP1 dimer/tetramer formation, affects mtDNA replication and induces mtDNA depletion. Our study, showing that mutations in SSBP1 cause a novel form of dominant optic atrophy frequently accompanied with foveopathy, brings new insights into mtDNA maintenance disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543707>Lipid Droplets and the Management of Cellular Stress.</a></h1><p>Lipid droplets are cytosolic fat storage organelles present in most eukaryotic cells. Long regarded merely as inert fat reservoirs, they are now emerging as major regulators of cellular metabolism. They act as hubs that coordinate the pathways of lipid uptake, distribution, storage, and use in the cell. Recent studies have revealed that they are also essential components of the cellular stress response. One of the hallmark characteristics of lipid droplets is their capacity to buffer excess lipids and to finely tune their subsequent release based on specific cellular requirements. This simple feature of lipid droplet biology, buffering and delayed release of lipids, forms the basis for their pleiotropic roles in the cellular stress response. In stressed cells, lipid droplets maintain energy and redox homeostasis and protect against lipotoxicity by sequestering toxic lipids into their neutral lipid core. Their mobility and dynamic interactions with  enable an efficient delivery of fatty  for optimal energy production. Lipid droplets are also involved in the maintenance of membrane and organelle homeostasis by regulating membrane composition, preventing lipid peroxidation and removing damaged proteins and lipids. Finally, they also engage in a symbiotic relationship with autophagy and act as reservoirs of bioactive lipids that regulate inflammation and immunity. Thus, lipid droplets are central managers of lipid metabolism that function as safeguards against various types of cellular stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612296>Gold Nanoparticles Treatment Reverses Brain Damage in Alzheimer's Disease Model.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid (A)β peptide accumulation and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. New hypotheses have suggested that AD involves neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) presents anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. The present study evaluated the AuNP treatment on an AD model (okadaic , OA). Male Wistar rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with OA (100 μg); 24 h later they were treated with 20-nm AuNP (at a dose 2.5 mg/kg) every 48 h for 21 days. The following groups were separated (n = 12/group): Sham, AuNP, OA, and OA + AuNP. OA increases Tau phosphorylation in the cortex and hippocampus, while AuNP treatment maintained it as normal. Spatial memory was impaired by OA, and AuNP treatment prevented this deficit. Neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NGF- β) in the cortex and hippocampus were decreased by OA. The OA and OA + AuNP groups showed increased interleukin (IL)-1 β in the hippocampus and cortex, and the AuNP group showed increased IL-1 β in the hippocampus. In both groups, S100 levels in the cortex and hippocampus were increased by OA. IL-4 was increased in OA + AuNP animals. AuNPs prevented oxidative stress (sulfhydryl and nitrite levels) in brain structures induced by OA. Moreover, OA modulated ATP synthase activity, and AuNP maintained normal brain mitochondrial function. The antioxidant capacities were reduced by OA, and AuNP restored antioxidant status (SOD, catalase activities and GSH levels) on brain. OA-induced damage on brain tissues, and long-term AuNP treatment prevented the neuroinflammation, modulation of mitochondrial function, and impaired cognition induced by AD model, showing that AuNPs may be a promising treatment for neurodisease caused by these elements.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673867>Metagenomic study of endophytic bacterial community of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) cultivated in different soil and climatic conditions.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to clarify effects of soil and climatic conditions on community structure of sweet potato bacterial endophytes by applying locked nucleic  oligonucleotide-PCR clamping technique and metagenomic analysis.

Methionine restricted rodents experience a decrease in glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant, in several tissues, which is paradoxical to longevity interventions because tissues with low GSH might experience more oxidative damage. Liver plays a key role in GSH synthesis and here we examined how MR influences GSH metabolism in the liver. We also hypothesised that low GSH might be subsidized by compensatory pathway(s) in the liver. To investigate GSH synthesis and antioxidant responses, Fischer-344 rats were given either a MR diet or a control diet for 8 weeks. Based on γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity, GSH synthetic capacity did not respond to low dietary methionine availability. Tissue level protein and lipid oxidation markers do not support elevated oxidative damage, despite low GSH availability. Whole tissue and mitochondrial level responses to MR differed. Specifically, the activity of glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase increase in whole liver tissue which might offset the effects of declined GSH availability whereas mitochondrial GSH levels were unperturbed by MR. Moreover, enhanced proton leak in liver  by MR (4 week) presumably diminishes ROS production. Taken together, we suggest that the effect of low GSH in liver tissue is subsidized, at least in part, by increased antioxidant activity and possibly by enhanced mitochondrial proton leak.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we found that hypertrophic hearts exhibit normal cardiac glucose oxidation rates, but reduced fatty  oxidation rates, compared to Sham controls under basal (no insulin) conditions. Furthermore, insulin stimulation attenuated insulin's effects on cardiac substrate utilization, suggesting the development of cardiac insulin resistance. Consistent with insulin resistance, p38-MAPK protein levels were reduced in hypertrophic hearts. By contrast, systemic hyperinsulin-euglycemic clamp indicated normal insulin sensitivity.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free fatty  (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise.

Alcohol use disorder, one of these conditions, is known to predispose to bacterial pneumonia by suppressing the lung's innate immune system, and more specifically by disrupting critical alveolar macrophage (AM) functions. Recently, we established that chronic ethanol consumption also perturbs surfactant lipid homeostasis in the lung and that elevated concentrations of free fatty  contribute to blocking essential AM functions, such as agonist-induced cytokine expression. In this study, we extend these observations by showing that elevated free fatty  levels impair metabolic responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in AMs. In particular, we show that the glycolytic reprogramming characteristic of LPS-stimulated AMs is blunted by the saturated fatty  palmitate, whereas oleate, an unsaturated fatty , or ethanol alone, had no effect on this adaptive metabolic response. Additionally, we found that elevated concentrations of palmitate induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and that glycolytic reprogramming and cytokine production to LPS could be partially restored in AMs by either pharmacologically blocking palmitate entry into  or administering a mitochondrial specific antioxidant. Taken together, these findings suggest that alcohol and elevated levels of saturated fatty  conspire to impair pulmonary innate immunity by altering metabolic responses in AMs. Additionally, our findings suggest that targeting the mechanisms involved in fatty  metabolism can restore pulmonary immunity and limit bacterial pneumonia in individuals with alcohol use disorder.Copyright © 2019.

Antioxidants including acetyl cysteine, apocynin, and mitotempo ameliorated EndoMT; however, they did not change glycocalyx shedding in HUVECs.

The liver is the primary organ affected by cholestasis. Chronic cholestasis could entail to tissue fibrotic changes and liver cirrhosis. Other organs, including heart, kidneys, nervous system, skeletal muscles, as well as the reproductive system, might also be affected during cholestasis. Although the cholestasis-associated pathological and biochemical alterations in organs such as liver have been widely investigated, there is little information about complications such as cholestasis-induced reproductive toxicity. The current study aimed to evaluate the pathologic effects of cholestasis on reproductive organs in both male and female animals. Rats underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) surgery. Markers of reproductive toxicity, including serum hormonal changes, tissue histopathological alterations, biomarkers of oxidative stress, and markers of mitochondrial impairment, were evaluated. Increased serum markers of liver injury and elevated level of cytotoxic molecules such as bile  and bilirubin were evident in BDL animals. On the other hand, the serum level of hormones such as testosterone was suppressed in BDL rats. Significant histopathological alterations were also evident in the testis and ovary of BDL animals. A significant increase in oxidative stress markers, including ROS formation, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and depleted glutathione and antioxidant reservoirs were also detected in BDL rats. Moreover, mitochondrial depolarization decreased dehydrogenases activity, and depleted ATP content was detected in sperm isolated from the BDL group. These data indicate that cholestasis-associated reproductive toxicity in male and female rats is restrictedly coupled with severe oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although linoleic  is an essential nutrient, its excess intake is harmful to health. On the other hand, linoleic  has been shown to prevent the reduction in cardiolipin content and to improve mitochondrial function in aged rats with spontaneous hypertensive heart failure (HF). In this study, we found that lower dietary intake of linoleic  in HF patients statistically correlates with greater severity of HF, and we investigated the mechanisms therein involved.HF patients, who were classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I (n = 45), II (n = 93), and III (n = 15), were analyzed regarding their dietary intakes of different fatty  during the one month prior to the study. Then, using a mouse model of HF, we confirmed reduced cardiolipin levels in their cardiac myocytes, and then analyzed the mechanisms by which dietary supplementation of linoleic  improves cardiac malfunction of .The dietary intake of linoleic  was significantly lower in NYHA III patients, as compared to NYHA II patients. In HF model mice, both CI-based and CII-based OXPHOS activities were affected together with reduced cardiolipin levels. Silencing of CRLS1, which encodes cardiolipin synthetase, in cultured cardiomyocytes phenocopied these events. Feeding HF mice with linoleic  improved both CI-based and CII-based respiration as well as left ventricular function, together with an increase in cardiolipin levels. However, although assembly of the respirasome (i.e., CI/CIII/CIV complex), as well as assembly of CII subunits and the CIII/CIV complex statistically correlated with cardiolipin levels in cultured cardiomyocytes, respirasome assembly was not notably restored by dietary linoleic  in HF mice. Therefore, although linoleic  may significantly improve both CI-based and CII-based respiration of cardiomyocytes, respirasomes impaired by HF were not easily repaired by the dietary intake of linoleic .Dietary supplement of linoleic  is beneficial for improving cardiac malfunction in HF, but is unable to completely cure HF.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654229>Evaluation of circulating leukocyte transcriptome and its relationship with immune function and blood markers in dairy cows during the transition period.</a></h1><p>Dairy cows during the transition period are faced with important physiological changes which include a dysfunctional immune system and an increased inflammatory state. New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino  metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty  elongation in  and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving.

Considering the limited efficacy and toxicity of currently available -targeting agents, it is necessary to develop effective -targeting anticancer drugs. By screening a large chemical library consisting of natural products with diverse chemical entities, we identified gracillin, a steroidal saponin, as a -targeting antitumor drug. Gracillin displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on the viability of a large panel of human cancer cell lines, including those carrying acquired resistance to chemotherapy or EGFR-targeting drugs, by inducing apoptosis. We show that gracillin attenuates -mediated cellular bioenergetics by suppressing ATP synthesis and by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistically, gracillin disrupts complex II (CII) function by abrogating succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity without affecting the succinate:ubiquinone reductase. The gracillin-induced cell death was potentiated by 3-nitropropionic  (3-NPA) or thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which inhibit CII by binding to the active site of SDHA or to the ubiquinone-binding site, respectively. Finally, we show that gracillin effectively suppressed the mutant-Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis and the growth of xenograft tumors derived from cell lines or patient tissues. Gracillin displayed no obvious pathophysiological features in mice. Collectively, gracillin has potential as a CII-targeting antitumor drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489782>Voluntary exercise normalizes the proteomic landscape in muscle and brain and improves the phenotype of progeroid mice.</a></h1><p>The accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations is a suspected driver of aging and age-related diseases, but forestalling these changes has been a major challenge. One of the best-studied models is the prematurely aging mtDNA mutator mouse, which carries a homozygous knock-in of a proofreading deficient version of the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase-γ (PolgA). We investigated how voluntary exercise affects the progression of aging phenotypes in this mouse, focusing on mitochondrial and protein homeostasis in both brain and peripheral tissues. Voluntary exercise significantly ameliorated several aspects of the premature aging phenotype, including decreased locomotor activity, alopecia, and kyphosis, but did not have major effects on the decreased lifespan of mtDNA mutator mice. Exercise also decreased the mtDNA mutation load. In-depth tissue proteomics revealed that exercise normalized the levels of about half the proteins, with the majority involved in mitochondrial function and nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk. There was also a specific increase in the nuclear-encoded proteins needed for the tricarboxylic  cycle and complex II, but not in mitochondrial-encoded oxidative phosphorylation proteins, as well as normalization of enzymes involved in coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Furthermore, we found tissue-specific alterations, with brain coping better as compared to muscle and with motor cortex being better protected than striatum, in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that voluntary exercise counteracts aging in mtDNA mutator mice by counteracting protein dysregulation in muscle and brain, decreasing the mtDNA mutation burden in muscle, and delaying overt aging phenotypes.© 2019 The Authors.

Monogenic developmental disorders of the heart and vessels are highly valuable to study the physiological and pathological processes in cardiovascular system homeostasis. The arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare, autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder showing lengthening, tortuosity, and stenosis of the large arteries, with a propensity for aneurysm formation. In histopathology it associates with fragmentation and disorganization of the elastic fibers in several tissues, including the arterial wall. ATS is caused by pathogenic variants in SLC2A10, encoding the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10.Although several hypotheses have been forwarded, the molecular mechanisms linking disrupted GLUT10 activity with arterial malformations are largely unknown. Recent Advances: The vascular and systemic manifestations, and natural history of ATS patients have been largely delineated. GLUT10 was identified as an intracellular transporter of dehydroascorbic , which contributes to collagen and elastin crosslinking in the ER, redox homeostasis in the  and global and gene-specific methylation/hydroxymethylation affecting epigenetic regulation in the nucleus. We revise here the current knowledge on ATS and the role of GLUT10 within the compartmentalization of ascorbate in physiological and diseased states.Centralization of clinical, treatment and outcome data will enable better management for ATS patients. Establishment of representative animal disease models could facilitate the study of the pathomechanisms underlying ATS. This might be relevant for other forms of vascular dysplasia, such as isolated aneurysm formation, hypertensive vasculopathy and neovascularization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676548>Rhes, a striatal-enriched protein, promotes mitophagy via Nix.</a></h1><p>Elimination of dysfunctional  via mitophagy is essential for cell survival and neuronal functions. But, how impaired mitophagy participates in tissue-specific vulnerability in the brain remains unclear. Here, we find that striatal-enriched protein, Rhes, is a critical regulator of mitophagy and striatal vulnerability in brain. In vivo interactome and density fractionation reveal that Rhes coimmunoprecipitates and cosediments with mitochondrial and lysosomal proteins. Live-cell imaging of cultured striatal neuronal cell line shows Rhes surrounds globular , recruits lysosomes, and ultimately degrades . In the presence of 3-nitropropionic  (3-NP), an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, Rhes disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ  ) and promotes excessive mitophagy and cell death. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that systemic injection of 3-NP in mice promotes globular , accumulation of mitophagosomes, and striatal lesion only in the wild-type (WT), but not in the Rhes knockout (KO), striatum, suggesting that Rhes is critical for mitophagy and neuronal death in vivo. Mechanistically, Rhes requires Nix (BNIP3L), a known receptor of mitophagy, to disrupt ΔΨ  and promote mitophagy and cell death. Rhes interacts with Nix via SUMO E3-ligase domain, and Nix depletion totally abrogates Rhes-mediated mitophagy and cell death in the cultured striatal neuronal cell line. Finally, we find that Rhes, which travels from cell to cell via tunneling nanotube (TNT)-like cellular protrusions, interacts with dysfunctional  in the neighboring cell in a Nix-dependent manner. Collectively, Rhes is a major regulator of mitophagy via Nix, which may determine striatal vulnerability in the brain.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Analyses of the available 2,161 complete mitochondrial genomes of 1,042 fishes, including 115 deep-sea species, detect signals of positive selection in mitochondrial genes in nine branches of deep-sea fishes. Aerobic metabolism yields much more energy  unit of source material than anaerobic metabolism. The adaptive evolution of the mtDNA may reflect that aerobic metabolism plays a more important role than anaerobic metabolism in deep-sea fishes, whose energy sources (food) are extremely limited. This strategy maximizes the usage of energy sources. Eleven mitochondrial genes have convergent/parallel amino  changes between branches of deep-sea fishes. Thus, these amino  sites may be functionally important in the acquisition of energy, and reflect convergent evolution during their independent invasion of the harsh deep-sea ecological niche.Copyright © 2019 Shen, Pu, Chen, Murphy and Shen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564645>Fatty  Enhance the Maturation of Cardiomyocytes Derived from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.</a></h1><p>Although human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have emerged as a novel platform for heart regeneration, disease modeling, and drug screening, their immaturity significantly hinders their application. A hallmark of postnatal cardiomyocyte maturation is the metabolic substrate switch from glucose to fatty . We hypothesized that fatty  supplementation would enhance hPSC-CM maturation. Fatty  treatment induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and significantly increases cardiomyocyte force production. The improvement in force generation is accompanied by enhanced calcium transient peak height and kinetics, and by increased action potential upstroke velocity and membrane capacitance. Fatty  also enhance mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity. RNA sequencing showed that fatty  treatment upregulates genes involved in fatty  β-oxidation and downregulates genes in lipid synthesis. Signal pathway analyses reveal that fatty  treatment results in phosphorylation and activation of multiple intracellular kinases. Thus, fatty  increase human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, force generation, calcium dynamics, action potential upstroke velocity, and oxidative capacity. This enhanced maturation should facilitate hPSC-CM usage for cell therapy, disease modeling, and drug/toxicity screens.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of  were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of , which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of  causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer.

Depending on the microcellular environment (specifically, oxygen availability, energy demand, and the presence or absence of ), pyruvate has several separate fates: In -containing cells, pyruvate can enter the citric  cycle within the mitochondrial matrix and undergo . Aptly named due to its dependence on oxygen as the final electron acceptor, oxidative phosphorylation cannot take place in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, as the enzymes of both the citric  cycle and electron transport chain are within the , cells lacking  (e.g., erythrocytes) cannot rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. In erythrocytes and oxygen-deprived tissue, pyruvate remains within the cytoplasm and converts to lactate, a process referred to as . This final reaction allows for the regeneration of NAD+, a cofactor that must be available in high enough intracellular concentrations for the earlier reactions of glycolysis to remain favorable. Compared to oxidative phosphorylation, however, anaerobic glycolysis is significantly less efficient, providing a net production of only 2 ATP per glucose molecule (versus 32 ATP per glucose molecule produced during oxidative phosphorylation).[1]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636568>From Africa to Antarctica: Exploring the Metabolism of Fish Heart  Across a Wide Thermal Range.</a></h1><p>The thermal sensitivity of ectotherms is largely dictated by the impact of temperature on cellular bioenergetics, particularly on mitochondrial functions. As the thermal sensitivity of bioenergetic pathways depends on the structural and kinetic properties of its component enzymes, optimization of their  function to different thermal niches is expected to have occurred through selection. In the present study, we sought to characterize mitochondrial phenotypic adjustments to thermal niches in eight ray-finned fish species occupying a wide range of thermal habitats by comparing the activities of key mitochondrial enzymes in their hearts. We measured the activity of four enzymes that control substrate entrance into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle: pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD). We also assayed enzymes of the electron transport system (ETS): complexes I, II, I + III, and IV. Enzymes were assayed at five temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C). Our results showed that the activity of CPT, a gatekeeper of the fatty  pathway, was higher in the cold-water fish than in the warmer-adapted fish relative to the ETS (complexes I and III) when measured close to the species optimal temperatures. The activity of HOAD showed a similar pattern relative to CI + III and thermal environment. By contrast, PDHc and PK did not show the similar patterns with respect to CI + III and temperature. Cold-adapted species had high CIV activities compared to those of upstream complexes (I, II, I + III) whereas the converse was true for warm-adapted species. Our findings reveal a significant variability of heart mitochondrial organization among species that can be linked to temperature adaptation. Cold-adapted fish do not appear to compensate for PDHc activity but likely adjust fatty  oxidation through higher activities of CPT and HOAD relative to complexes I + III.Copyright © 2019 Hunter-Manseau, Desrosiers, Le François, Dufresne, Detrich, Nozais and Blier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617565>Evolution and Unprecedented Variants of the Mitochondrial Genetic Code in a Lineage of Green Algae.</a></h1><p> of diverse eukaryotes have evolved various departures from the standard genetic code, but the breadth of possible modifications and their phylogenetic distribution are known only incompletely. Furthermore, it is possible that some codon reassignments in previously sequenced mitogenomes have been missed, resulting in inaccurate protein sequences in databases. Here we show, considering the distribution of codons at conserved amino  positions in mitogenome-encoded proteins, that  of the green algal order Sphaeropleales exhibit a diversity of codon reassignments, including previously missed ones and some that are unprecedented in any translation system examined so far, necessitating redefinition of existing translation tables and creating at least seven new ones. We resolve a previous controversy concerning the meaning the UAG codon in Hydrodictyaceae, which beyond any doubt encodes alanine. We further demonstrate that AGG, sometimes together with AGA, encodes alanine instead of arginine in diverse sphaeroplealeans. Further newly detected changes include Arg-to-Met reassignment of the AGG codon and Arg-to-Leu reassignment of the CGG codon in particular species. Analysis of tRNAs specified by sphaeroplealean mitogenomes provides direct support for and molecular underpinning of the proposed reassignments. Furthermore, we point to unique mutations in the mitochondrial release factor mtRF1a that correlate with changes in the use of termination codons in Sphaeropleales, including the two independent stop-to-sense UAG reassignments, the reintroduction of UGA in some Scenedesmaceae, and the sense-to-stop reassignment of UCA widespread in the group.

Apoptosis induces cell death through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is considered an irreversible step in apoptosis. Activation of MOMP to levels that fail to reach the apoptotic threshold may paradoxically promote cancer-a phenomenon called "Minority MOMP." We asked whether reflux-induced esophageal carcinogenesis occurred via minority MOMP and whether compensatory resistance mechanisms prevented cell death during this process. We exposed preneoplastic, hTERT-immortalized Barrett's cell, CP-C and CP-A, to the oncogenic bile , deoxycholic  (DCA), for 1 year. Induction of minority MOMP was tested via comet assay, CyQuant, annexin V, JC-1, cytochrome C subcellular localization, caspase 3 activation, and immunoblots. We used bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3) profiling to test the mitochondrial apoptotic threshold. One-year exposure of Barrett's cells to DCA induced a malignant phenotype noted by clone and tumor formation. DCA promoted minority MOMP noted by minimal release of cytochrome C and limited caspase 3 activation, which resulted in DNA damage without apoptosis. Upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein, Mcl-1, ROS generation, and NF-κB activation occurred in conjunction with minority MOMP. Inhibition of ROS blocked minority MOMP and Mcl-1 upregulation. Knockdown of Mcl-1 shifted minority MOMP to complete MOMP as noted by dynamic BH3 profiling and increased apoptosis. Minority MOMP contributes to DCA induced carcinogenesis in preneoplastic BE.

Although mostly noncancerous, pituitary adenomas (PAs) can cause serious health problems such as headaches, visual field defects, double vision, and hypopituitarism by invasion of regional structures. Nonfunctioning PAs (NFPAs) approximately account for one-third of PAs manifested by no circulating hormone hypersecretion. Lipid reprogramming has been recognized as a hallmark of tumor cells and proven to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. However, the lipid molecular pathogenesis of NFPAs has remained obscure to date. To uncover lipid alterations that may contribute to the development of NFPAs and define their molecular characteristics, we investigated tissue lipids of patients with NFPAs including eight null cell adenomas (NCAs) and eight oncocytomas (OCMs) and of five normal pituitary glands as the control (Ctrl) using nontargeted lipidomics based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometry. The lipidomic results were further validated in another set of subjects consisting of 8 NCAs, 10 OCMs, and 6 Ctrls to define crucial lipids discriminating NFPAs from the normal pituitary tumors. Lipidomic analyses revealed that OCM showed more pronounced changes in lipid compositions than NCA and Ctrl. As expected,  abundant cardiolipins were remarkably increased in OCM, which was accordant with the biochemical evidence of  hyperplasia in OCM. Significantly increased levels of phospholipids (PLs), especially arachidonic  (AA)-enriched PLs, were unique characteristics of lipid profiling in OCM vs Ctrl.

This study evaluated the potential anti-obesogenic hepatoprotective effects of combined treatment with L-carnitine and nicotinamide riboside, i.e., components that can enhance fatty  transfer across the inner mitochondrial membrane and increase nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD+) levels, which are necessary for β-oxidation and the TCA cycle, respectively. Ldlr -/-.Leiden mice were treated with high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with L-carnitine (LC; 0.4% /), nicotinamide riboside (NR; 0.3% /) or both (COMBI) for 21 weeks. L-carnitine plasma levels were reduced by HFD and normalized by LC. NR supplementation raised its plasma metabolite levels demonstrating effective delivery. Although food intake and ambulatory activity were comparable in all groups, COMBI treatment significantly attenuated HFD-induced body weight gain, fat mass gain (-17%) and hepatic steatosis (-22%). Also, NR and COMBI reduced hepatic 4-hydroxynonenal adducts. Upstream-regulator gene analysis demonstrated that COMBI reversed detrimental effects of HFD on liver metabolism pathways and associated regulators, e.g., ACOX, SCAP, SREBF, PPARGC1B, and INSR.

Patients with autosome recessive inheritance of NFU1 mutation G208C have reduced activity of the respiratory chain complex II, lipoic- dependent enzymes, and develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in ~ 70% of cases. We investigated whether rats with a human mutation in NFU1 are also predisposed to PAH development. A point mutation in rat NFU1G206C (human G208C) was introduced through CRISP/Cas9 genome editing. Hemodynamic data, tissue samples, and fresh  were collected and analyzed. NFU1G206C rats showed an increased right ventricular (RV) pressure, RV hypertrophy and high levels of pulmonary artery remodeling. Computed tomography and angiography of the pulmonary vasculature indicated severe angioobliterative changes in NFU1G206C rats. Importantly, the penetrance of PAH phenotype was found to be more prevalent in females than in males, replicating the established gender difference within PAH patients. Male and female homozygote rats exhibited a decreased expression and activity of mitochondrial complex II, and markedly decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and lipoate binding. The limited development of PAH in males correlated with the preserved levels of oligomeric NFU1, increased expression of ISCU, an alternative branch of iron-sulfur assembly system, and increased complex IV activity. Thus, the male sex has additional plasticity to overcome the iron-sulfur cluster deficiency.

Previous preclinical models of chemoresistance in TNBC have suffered from a lack of clinical relevance. Using a single high dose chemotherapy treatment, we developed a novel MDA-MB-436 cell-based model of chemoresistance characterized by a unique and complex morphologic phenotype, which consists of polyploid giant cancer cells giving rise to neuron-like mononuclear daughter cells filled with smaller but functional  and numerous lipid droplets. This resistant phenotype is associated with metabolic reprogramming with a shift to a greater dependence on fatty  and oxidative phosphorylation. We validated both the molecular and histologic features of this model in a clinical cohort of primary chemoresistant TNBCs and identified several metabolic vulnerabilities including a dependence on PLIN4, a perilipin coating the observed lipid droplets, expressed both in the TNBC-resistant cells and clinical chemoresistant tumors treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. These findings thus reveal a novel mechanism of chemotherapy resistance that has therapeutic implications in the treatment of drug-resistant cancer. IMPLICATIONS: These findings underlie the importance of a novel morphologic-metabolic phenotype associated with chemotherapy resistance in TNBC, and bring to light novel therapeutic targets resulting from vulnerabilities in this phenotype, including the expression of PLIN4 essential for stabilizing lipid droplets in resistant cells.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648074>A second intracellular copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and a manganese superoxide dismutase in Oxya chinensis: Molecular and biochemical characteristics and roles in chlorpyrifos stress.</a></h1><p>A second intracellular copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (icCuZnSOD2) and manganese SOD (MnSOD) were cloned and characterized in Oxya chinensis.

The optimum temperatures and pH values of the recombinant OcicCuZnSOD2 and OcMnSOD were 40 °C and 8.0. They were stable at 25-55 °C and at pH 5.0-12.0 and pH 6.0-12.0, respectively. The activity and mRNA expression of each OcSOD were assayed after chlorpyrifos treatments. Total SOD and CuZnSOD activities first increased then declined under chlorpyrifos stress. Chlorpyrifos induced the mRNA expression and activity of OcMnSOD as a dose-dependent manner and inhibited OcicCuZnSOD2 transcription. The role of each OcSOD gene in chlorpyrifos stress was investigated using RNAi and disc diffusion assay with Escherichia coli overexpressing OcSOD proteins. Silencing of OcMnSOD significantly increased ROS content in chlorpyrifos-exposed grasshoppers. Disc diffusion assay showed that the plates with E. coli overexpressing OcMnSOD had the smaller inhibition zones around the chlorpyrifos-soaked filter discs. These results implied that OcMnSOD played a significant role in defense chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The gene is present only in mouse and rat genomes; hence it is restricted to two species. To understand why, it is essential to uncover details about its functions in cellular processes. Here we show that ApoL9 interacts with the proteins of the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies, which are key players in macroautophagy.  binding studies show a strong association with GABARAP, and in amino -starved cells it preferentially interacts with lipidated LC3B, likely by binding to its PE moiety through its lipid-binding domain. On treatment with autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, ApoL9 is found near swollen  and on lysosomes/LAMP1-positive compartments. However, ApoL9 itself does not seem to be degraded as a result of autophagy, suggesting that it is not an autophagy cargo receptor. Deletions in a putative transmembrane region between amino  110 and 145 abolish binding to PE. In addition, ApoL9 can redistribute to stress granules, can homo-oligomerize, and is a microtubule-associated protein. In short, its distribution in the cell is quite widespread, suggesting that it could have functions at the intersection of membrane binding and reorganization, autophagy, cellular stress and intracellular lipid transport.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.© 2019.

Here we show that inducing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stress in Drosophila using a mitochondrially-targeted Type I restriction endonuclease (mtEcoBI) results in unexpected metabolic reprogramming in adult flies, distinct from effects on OXPHOS. Carbohydrate utilization was repressed, with catabolism shifted towards lipid oxidation, accompanied by elevated serine synthesis. Cleavage and translocation, the two modes of mtEcoBI action, repressed carbohydrate rmetabolism via two different mechanisms. DNA cleavage activity induced a type II diabetes-like phenotype involving deactivation of Akt kinase and inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, whilst translocation decreased post-translational protein acetylation by cytonuclear depletion of acetyl-CoA (AcCoA). The associated decrease in the concentrations of ketogenic amino  also produced downstream effects on physiology and behavior, attributable to decreased neurotransmitter levels. We thus provide evidence for novel signaling pathways connecting mtDNA to metabolism, distinct from its role in supporting OXPHOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530015>NDUFAB1 protects against obesity and insulin resistance by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism.</a></h1><p> are fundamental organelles for cellular and systemic metabolism, and their dysfunction has been implicated in the development of diverse metabolic diseases. Boosted mitochondrial metabolism might be able to protect against metabolic stress and prevent metabolic disorders. Here we show that NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDU)-FAB1, also known as mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, acts as a novel enhancer of mitochondrial metabolism and protects against obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, NDUFAB1 coordinately enhances lipoylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase mediated by the mitochondrial fatty  synthesis pathway and increases the assembly of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. Skeletal muscle-specific ablation of NDUFAB1 causes systemic disruption of glucose homeostasis and defective insulin signaling, leading to growth arrest and early death within 5 postnatal days. In contrast, NDUFAB1 overexpression effectively protects mice against obesity and insulin resistance when the animals are challenged with a high-fat diet. Our findings indicate that NDUFAB1 could be a novel mitochondrial target to prevent obesity and insulin resistance by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism.-Zhang, R., Hou, T., Cheng, H., Wang, X.

Their development proposes structure optimization in respect of availability and activity towards target cells and organelles. Selection of 1 or its precursor betulonic  2 and the optimal linker is of particular importance for drug candidate identification among the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates.In this study new C-28-TPP conjugated derivatives of 1 and 2 with the alkyl/alkoxyalkyl linkers of variable length were synthesized and compared regarding their anticancer, antibacterial, and -targeted effects.The TPP conjugates of 1 and 2 [6a-f, 7a-f] were synthesized by the reaction of halogenalkyl esters [3a-f, 4a-f, 5] with triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile upon heating. Cytotoxicity (MTT assay), antibacterial activity (microdilution assay) and mitochondrial effects (flow cytofluorometry) were studied.Conjugation with the TPP group greatly increased cytotoxicity of the triterpenoids up to 30 times. The conjugates were up to 10-17 times more active against MCF-7 (IC50 = 0.17µM, 72h, 6c) and PC-3 (IC50 = 0.14µM, 72h, 6a) cancer cells than for human skin fibroblasts. Enhanced antibacterial (bactericidal) activity of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates with MIC for Gram-positive bacteria as low as 2µM (6a, 7a) was for the first time revealed. The conjugates were found to effectively inhibit oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin probe in cytosol, decrease transmembrane potential and increase superoxide radical level in .Relationships between the effects and structure of the TPP-triterpenoid conjugates were evaluated and are discussed. Based on the results, 6a can be selected for further preclinical investigation as a potential anticancer compound.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid Metabolism Directs Fetal Liver Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h1><p>The extreme metabolic demands of pregnancy require coordinated metabolic adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid metabolism were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid metabolism alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient metabolism in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In particular, protein malnutrition is one of the determinants of frailty and sarcopenia in elderly people.To investigate the role of amino  supplementation in senior patients we performed an open-label randomized trial and administered a particular branched-chain amino  enriched mixture (BCAAem) or provided diet advice in 155 elderly malnourished patients. They were followed for 2 months, assessing cognitive performance by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), muscle mass measured by anthropometry, strength measure by hand grip and performance measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the 30 s Chair Sit to Stand (30-s CST) test and the 4 m gait speed test. Moreover we measured oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial production of ATP and electron flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Both groups improved in nutritional status, general health and muscle mass, strength and performance; treatment with BCAAem supplementation was more effective than simple diet advice in increasing MMSE (1.2 increase versus 0.2, p = 0.0171), ATP production (0.43 increase versus -0.1, p = 0.0001), electron flux (0.50 increase versus 0.01, p < 0.0001) and in maintaining low oxidative stress. The amelioration of clinical parameters as MMSE, balance, four meter walking test were associated to increased mitochondrial function.Overall, our findings show that sustaining nutritional support might be clinically relevant in increasing physical performance in elderly malnourished patients and that the use of specific BCAAem might ameliorate also cognitive performance thanks to an amelioration of  bioenergetics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

To understand comprehensive metabolic disturbances in this model, both cell lysates and culture supernatants were subjected to metabolomic analysis. As expected from the fact that MPP inhibits mitochondrial complex I, a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis was indicated by an increase in extracellular lactic  and a parallel depletion of pyruvic . In cell lysates, the metabolic shift was supported by consistent decreases in TCA cycle intermediates. Metabolomic analysis also revealed aberrant choline metabolism. Choline in the culture supernatant was elevated 8.5- and 17-fold by 30 and 300 μM MPP exposure, respectively; therefore, extracellular choline might be a metabolic biomarker for Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Fourteen articles were finally included.Exercise-induced free radical and inflammatory marker blood levels, but not changed the plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC), after administration of antioxidant supplement. The oral administration of antioxidants produced null or negative effect on endothelial function, but the infusion into the brachial artery during rhythmic handgrip exercise produced a significant improvement in muscle blood flow, due to an on increase in the availability of nitric  derived from the nitric oxide synthase. Aerobic exercise and antioxidant supplementation improved submaximal and maximal aerobic parameters, as well as mitochondrial density and -regulated apoptotic signaling. Antioxidant supplementation, but not omega-3 PUFA, decreased pro-inflammatory marker levels and fat oxidation induced by exercise. Strength training decreased serum B concentration but combined with omega-3 PUFA or antioxidant supplementation, B levels were maintained. Antioxidant supplementation has protective effect after fatigue in isometric exercise but improved appendicular fat-free mass just combined with resistance exercise. Omega-3 fatty  supplement combined with exercise increased lean mass in women, but not in men.

Current research has shown that hepatic fatty  accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway.  are the major sites of fatty  β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty . Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged  to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty  oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty  accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583037>Crosstalk between Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Autophagy in Skeletal Muscle.</a></h1><p>Autophagy is responsible for the maintenance of skeletal muscle homeostasis, thanks to the removal of aberrant and dysfunctional macromolecules and organelles. During fasting, increased autophagy ensures the maintenance of the amino  pool required for energy production. The activity of the mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU), the highly selective channel responsible for mitochondrial Ca uptake, controls skeletal muscle size, force, and nutrient utilization. Thus, both autophagy and mitochondrial Ca accumulation play a pivotal role to maintain muscle homeostasis and to sustain muscle function. Here, we address whether, in skeletal muscle, mitochondrial Ca uptake and autophagy are mutually related. Muscle-restricted MCU silencing partially inhibits the autophagy flux. Moreover, skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg7, known to cause the accumulation of dysfunctional , drastically reduces mitochondrial Ca accumulation. Thus, a vicious cycle takes place, in which reduced MCU activity hampers the autophagic flux, and loss of autophagy further impairs mitochondrial Ca signaling.Copyright © 2019 Gaia Gherardi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550253>A -targeted fatty  analogue influences hepatic glucose metabolism and reduces the plasma insulin/glucose ratio in male Wistar rats.</a></h1><p>A fatty  analogue, 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic  (1-triple TTA), was previously shown to have hypolipidemic effects in rats by targeting mitochondrial activity predominantly in liver. This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and liver carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7 liver cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and fatty  oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and Hnf4A, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty  oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty  analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty  oxidation.

Previously, we demonstrated that BKA exhibited cytotoxic effects on 4T1 tumor cells, depending on the cell number in the culture, but not on NIH3T3 cells. However, the cause of this differential sensitivity was unelucidated. Here we demonstrate that BKA reduced the O consumption in both cell lines and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby facilitating glucose consumption. BKA reduced cellular ATP in 4T1 cells in a dose-dependent manner but not in NIH3T3 cells. The cellular ATP of 4T1 cells was decreased with a reduced glucose concentration in the media, but that of NIH3T3 cells remained constant. We also demonstrated that BKA-induced cell death in both cell lines in low glucose media; however, the susceptibility to the reduced glucose concentration was slightly higher in 4T1 cells, which may be attributed to the difference in the dependency on glycolysis as their energy source. These results indicate that 4T1 tumor cells rely heavily on glucose for energy production.

Oil red staining and Elisa Kit were used to detect the intracellular FFA and TG contents in ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and the MDA/SOD measurement were used to detect the ROS production. In order to demonstrate the role of ACSL1 and the interaction between ACSL1 and Nrf2 in ORN, related siRNA and plasmid were transfected into HK-2 cells.

To understand this dichotomy, we explored the function of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)2, a tricarboxylic  cycle enzyme mutated in subsets of acute leukemias and gliomas, in cancer. Silencing of IDH2 in prostate cancer cells impaired oxidative bioenergetics, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and promoted exaggerated mitochondrial dynamics. This was associated with increased subcellular mitochondrial trafficking, turnover of membrane focal adhesion complexes, and enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion, without changes in cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, loss of IDH2 caused ROS-dependent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in normoxia, which was required for increased mitochondrial trafficking and tumor cell movements. Therefore, IDH2 is a dual regulator of cancer bioenergetics and tumor cell motility. This pathway may reprogram mitochondrial dynamics to differentially adjust energy production or promote tumor cell invasion in response to microenvironment conditions.-Wang, Y., Agarwal, E., Bertolini, I., Ghosh, J.

Alteration in energy metabolism has been suggested to contribute to radiation-induced heart pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction being a hallmark of this disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of acetylation in heart  in the long-term response to chronic radiation. ApoE-deficient C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate (20 mGy/day) gamma radiation for 300 days, resulting in a cumulative total body dose of 6.0 Gy. Heart  were isolated and analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Radiation-induced proteome and acetylome alterations were further validated using immunoblotting, enzyme activity assays, and ELISA. In total, 71 proteins showed peptides with a changed acetylation status following irradiation. The great majority (94%) of the hyperacetylated proteins were involved in the TCA cycle, fatty  oxidation, oxidative stress response and sirtuin pathway. The elevated acetylation patterns coincided with reduced activity of mitochondrial sirtuins, increased the level of Acetyl-CoA, and were accompanied by inactivation of major cardiac metabolic regulators PGC-1 alpha and PPAR alpha. These observations suggest that the changes in mitochondrial acetylation after irradiation is associated with impairment of heart metabolism.

Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher oxygen consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino  transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610192>Ellagic  improves muscle dysfunction in cuprizone-induced demyelinated mice via mitochondrial Sirt3 regulation.</a></h1><p>Sirt3 enzyme and mitochondrial abnormality can be related to excess fatigue or muscular dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS).Ellagic  (EA) has a mitochondrial protector, iron chelator, antioxidant, and axon regenerator in neurons.In this study the effect of EAon muscle dysfunction, its , and Sirt3 enzyme incuprizone-induced model of MSwas examined. Demyelination was induced by a diet containing 0.2% w/w cuprizone (Cup) for 42 days and EA administered daily (5, 50, and 100 mg/kg P.O) either with or without cuprizone in mice. Behavioral tests were assessed, and muscle tissue markers ofoxidative stress, mitochondrial parameters, mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, the Sirt3 protein level, and Sirt3 expression were also determined. Luxol fast blue staining and the behavioral tests were performed toassess the implemented model. In Cup group an increased oxidative stress in their muscle tissues was observed. Also, muscle  exhibited  dysfunction, lowered mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, Sirt3 protein level, and Sirt3 expression.EA prevented most of these anomalous alterations. Sub-chronicEA co-treatment dose-dependently ameliorated behavioral and muscular impairment in mice that received Cup.EA can effectively protect muscle tissue against cuprizone-induced demeylination via the mitochondrial protection, oxidative stress prevention and Sirt3 overexpression.Copyright © 2019.

During our study, concentrations of microbial phenolic  and mitochondrial metabolites (succinic, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric, itaconic ) as indicators of sepsis and mitochondrial dysfunction, respectively, are measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the blood of critically ill patients at the early and late stages of documented sepsis. The increase in levels of some phenylcarboxylic (phenyllactic (PhLA), -hydroxyphenylacetic (-HPhAA), -hydroxyphenyllactic (-HPhAA))  (PhCAs), simultaneously with a rise in levels of mitochondrial dicarboxylic , are mainly detected during the late stage of sepsis, especially succinic  (up to 100-1000 µM). Itaconic  is found in low concentrations (0.5-2.3 µM) only at early-stage sepsis. PhCAs in vitro inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in isolated  but, unlike itaconic  which acts as a competitive inhibitor of SDH, microbial metabolites most likely act on the ubiquinone binding site of the respiratory chain. A close correlation of the level of succinic  in serum and sepsis-induced organ dysfunction is revealed, moreover the most significant correlation is observed at high concentrations of phenolic microbial metabolites (PhCAs) in late-stage sepsis. These data indicate the promise of such an approach for early detection, monitoring the progression of organ dysfunction and predicting the risk of non-survival in sepsis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527235>Redox-dependent gating of VDAC by mitoNEET.</a></h1><p>MitoNEET is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein essential for sensing and regulation of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. It is a key player in multiple human maladies including diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration, and Parkinson's diseases. In healthy cells, mitoNEET receives its clusters from the mitochondrion and transfers them to acceptor proteins in a process that could be altered by drugs or during illness. Here, we report that mitoNEET regulates the outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). VDAC1 is a crucial player in the cross talk between the  and the cytosol. VDAC proteins function to regulate metabolites, ions, ROS, and fatty  transport, as well as function as a "governator" sentry for the transport of metabolites and ions between the cytosol and the . We find that the redox-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster protein mitoNEET gates VDAC1 when mitoNEET is oxidized. Addition of the VDAC inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS) prevents both mitoNEET binding in vitro and mitoNEET-dependent mitochondrial iron accumulation in situ. We find that the DIDS inhibitor does not alter the redox state of MitoNEET. Taken together, our data indicate that mitoNEET regulates VDAC in a redox-dependent manner in cells, closing the pore and likely disrupting VDAC's flow of metabolites.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The FDA has strongly encouraged the application of modeling in drug development to improve product safety. This study illustrates how DILIsym, a computational representation of liver injury, was able to reproduce species differences in liver toxicity due to PF-04895162 (ICA-105665). PF-04895162, a drug in development for the treatment of epilepsy, was terminated after transaminase elevations were observed in healthy volunteers (). Liver safety concerns had not been raised in preclinical safety studies. DILIsym, which integrates in vitro data on mechanisms of hepatotoxicity with predicted in vivo liver exposure, reproduced clinical hepatotoxicity and the absence of hepatotoxicity observed in the rat. Simulated differences were multifactorial. Simulated liver exposure was greater in humans than rats. The simulated human hepatotoxicity was demonstrated to be due to the interaction between mitochondrial toxicity and bile  transporter inhibition; elimination of either mechanism from the simulations abrogated injury. The bile  contribution occurred despite the fact that the IC for bile salt export pump (BSEP) inhibition by PF-04895162 was higher (311 µmol/L) than that has been generally thought to contribute to hepatotoxicity. Modeling even higher PF-04895162 liver exposures than were measured in the rat safety studies aggravated mitochondrial toxicity but did not result in rat hepatotoxicity due to insufficient accumulation of cytotoxic bile  species. This investigative study highlights the potential for combined in vitro and computational screening methods to identify latent hepatotoxic risks and paves the way for similar and prospective studies.© 2019 The Authors.

Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel is a Ca permeable cation channel that can be activated by HO and plays an important role in cellular functions. It is also able to promote susceptibility to cell death. We studied expression and functionality of TRPM2 in KGN cells and examined GCT tissue microarrays (TMAs) to explore in vivo relevance. We employed live cell, calcium and mitochondrial imaging, viability assays, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We confirmed that KGN cells produce HO and found that they express functional TRPM2. HO increased intracellular Ca levels and N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic  (ACA), a TRPM2 inhibitor, blocked this action. HO caused mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptotic cell death, which could be attenuated by a scavenger (Trolox). Immunohistochemistry showed parallel expression of NOX4 and TRPM2 in all 73 tumor samples examined. The results suggest that GCTs can be endowed with a system that may convey susceptibility to cell death. If so, induction of oxidative stress may be beneficial in GCT therapy. Our results also imply a therapeutic potential for TRPM2 as a drug target in GCTs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682209>Integrating Autism Spectrum Disorder Pathophysiology: , Vitamin A, CD38, Oxytocin, Serotonin and Melatonergic Alterations in the Placenta and Gut.</a></h1><p>A diverse array of data has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), reflecting the complexity of its pathophysiology as well as its heterogeneity. Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in  functioning crucial in both.Factors acting to regulate  functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article.Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic  metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal  functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in  functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal obesity and preeclampsia as well as more general prenatal stressors modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.Such an integrated model of the pathophysiology of ASD has important preventative and treatment implications.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470033>Gefitinib and curcumin-loaded nanoparticles enhance cell apoptosis in human oral cancer SAS cells in vitro and inhibit SAS cell xenografted tumor in vivo.</a></h1><p>Curcumin (Cur), a natural product, has been shown to have anti-tumor activities in many human cancer cells. Gefitinib (Gef) is a clinical drug for cancer patients. However, there is no available information to show whether Gef/Cur nanoparticles (NPs) increased cell apoptosis and anti-tumor effects on xenograft mice model in vivo. In this study, γ-polyglutamic -coated nanoparticles loaded with Gef and Cur (γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs) were developed and its physicochemical properties and antitumor effects were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs showed 548.5 ± 93.7 nm in diameter and -40.3 ± 3.87 mV on surface charge. The loading efficiencies of Gef and Cur were 89.5 and 100%, respectively. γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs could be internalized into SAS cells and significantly decreased total cell viability of SAS cells. Western blotting results indicated that both free Gef/Cur and γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs induced apoptotic cell death via caspase- and -dependent pathways. In vivo studies indicated that treatments of PLGA NPs, free Gef/Cur, and γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs did not significantly affect appearances and bodyweights of mice. But the γ-PGA-Gef/Cur NPs significantly suppressed tumor size when comparing to free Gef/Cur-treated group.

Fatty  partially regulate α-Synuclein accumulation, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons highly express fatty -binding protein 3 (FABP3). We previously demonstrated that FABP3 knockout mice show decreased α-Synuclein oligomerization and neuronal degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons . In this study, we newly investigated the importance of FABP3 in α-Synuclein uptake, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-induced axodendritic retraction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. To disclose the issues, we employed cultured mesencephalic neurons derived from wild type or FABP3 C57BL6 mice and performed immunocytochemical analysis. We demonstrated that TH neurons from FABP3 mice take up α-Synuclein monomers while FABP3 TH neurons do not. The formation of filamentous α-Synuclein inclusions following treatment with MPP was observed only in FABP3, and not in FABP3 neurons. Notably, detailed morphological analysis revealed that FABP neurons did not exhibit MPP-induced axodendritic retraction. Moreover, FABP3 was also critical for MPP-induced reduction of mitochondrial activity and the production of reactive oxygen species. These data indicate that FABP3 is critical for α-Synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons, thereby preventing synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h1><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and  through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the  to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic -Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). From the above, our research indicates that CA is a promising antifungal candidate when applied to C. albicans infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676404>Buddleja saligna Willd (Loganiaceae) inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in oxidative cardiopathy with concomitant modulation of nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymatic activities and dysregulated lipid metabolic pathways.</a></h1><p>Buddleja saligna Willd (Loganiaceae), mostly indigenous to South Africa is traditionally used in the treatment cardio-dysfunctional related ailments amongst other diseases.The cardio-protective effect of B. saligna was investigated in ferric-induced oxidative cardiopathy.Hearts harvested from healthy male SD rats were incubated with 0.1 mM FeSO to induce oxidative damage and co-incubated with B. saligna extract. Reaction mixtures without the extract served as negative control, while tissues without the extract or standard antioxidant (gallic ) and pro-oxidant served as the normal control. The tissues were analyzed for levels of glutathione, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide as well as cholinergic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lipase, and purinergic enzymes activities, lipid profiles, fatty  metabolic pathways and metabolites.Induction of oxidative damage significantly (p < 0.05) depleted the levels of GSH, SOD, catalase, and ENTPDase activities, while concomitantly elevating the levels of MDA, NO, ACE, acetylcholinesterase, lipase and ATPase activities. These levels and activities were significantly reversed on treatment with B. saligna. Treatment with B. saligna also led to depletion of cardiac cholesterol and LDL-c levels, while elevating triglyceride and HDL-c level. It also depleted oxidative-induced lipid metabolites with concomitant generation of thirteen other metabolites. B. saligna also inactivated oxidative-induced pathways for beta oxidation of very long chain fatty , glycerolipid metabolism, and fatty  elongation in .These results suggest that B. saligna protects against ferric-induced oxidative cardiopathy by mitigating oxidative stress, while concomitantly inhibiting ACE, acetylcholinesterase and lipase activities, and modulating lipid spectrum and dysregulated metabolic pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We have originally shown the role of α-syn as a modulator of the ER- interface and mitochondrial Ca transients, suggesting that, at mild levels of expression, α-syn sustains cell metabolism. Here, we investigated the possibility that α-syn action on ER- tethering could be compromised by the presence of PD-related mutations. The clarification of this aspect could contribute to elucidate key mechanisms underlying PD. The findings reported so far are not consistent, possibly because of the different methods used to evaluate ER- connectivity. Here, the effects of the PD-related α-syn mutations A53T and A30P on ER- relationship were investigated in respect to Ca handling and mitochondrial function using a newly generated SPLICS sensor and aequorin-based Cameasurements. We provided evidence that A53T and A30P amino  substitution does not affect the ability of α-syn to enhance ER/ tethering and mitochondrial Ca transients, but that this action was lost as soon as a high amount of TAT-delivered A53T and A30P α-syn mutants caused the redistribution of α-syn from cytoplasm to foci. Our results suggest a loss of function mechanism and highlight a possible connection between α-syn and ER- Ca cross-talk impairment to the pathogenesis of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677478>Visualizing Dynamic Performance of Lipid Droplets in a Parkinson's Disease Model via a Smart Photostable Aggregation-Induced Emission Probe.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease affected by diverse factors, and lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly recognized as major players in PD because of their relevance to neuron activity. However, long-term dynamic changes of LDs and their relative activity remain unclear. Here, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe named 2-DPAN was prepared and employed to visualize dynamic processes of LDs in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD for the first time, and LDs' accumulation-peak/plateau-decrease were confirmed. We further found a close relationship between LDs and variation in mitochondrial activity. Strikingly, the progression of cell death was accelerated by lipase, whereas pre-stimulation of LDs by unsaturated fatty -oleic  decreased the death process by inhibiting excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fatty  production, thereby protecting .

To counteract such damage and to favor neurogenesis, neurotrophic factors could be used as therapeutic agents. Octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), produced by astrocytes, is a potent neuroprotective agent. In N2a cells, we studied the ability of ODN to promote neuronal differentiation. This parameter was evaluated by phase contrast microscopy, staining with crystal violet, cresyl blue, and Sulforhodamine 101. The effect of ODN on cell viability and mitochondrial activity was determined with fluorescein diacetate and DiOC(3), respectively. The impact of ODN on the topography of  and peroxisomes, two tightly connected organelles involved in nerve cell functions and lipid metabolism, was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy: detection of  with MitoTracker Red, and peroxisome with an antibody directed against the ABCD3 peroxisomal transporter. The profiles in fatty , cholesterol, and cholesterol precursors were determined by gas chromatography, in some cases coupled with mass spectrometry. Treatment of N2a cells with ODN (10 M, 48 h) induces neurite outgrowth. ODN-induced neuronal differentiation was associated with modification of topographical distribution of  and peroxisomes throughout the neurites and did not affect cell viability and mitochondrial activity. The inhibition of ODN-induced N2a differentiation with H89, U73122, chelerythrine and U0126 supports the activation of a PKA/PLC/PKC/MEK/ERK-dependent signaling pathway. Although there is no difference in fatty  profile between control and ODN-treated cells, the level of cholesterol and some of its precursors (lanosterol, desmosterol, lathosterol) was increased in ODN-treated cells. The ability of ODN to induce neuronal differentiation without cytotoxicity reinforces the interest for this neuropeptide with neurotrophic properties to overcome nerve cell damage in major neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629737>Deficiency of nuclear receptor interaction protein leads to cardiomyopathy by disrupting sarcomere structure and mitochondrial respiration.</a></h1><p>Cardiomyopathy is a common and lethal complication in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy. The pathogenesis underlying LGMD-related cardiomyopathy remains unclear. NRIP (gene name DCAF6), a Ca-dependent calmodulin binding protein, was reduced in dystrophic muscles from LGMD patients. Mice lacking NRIP exhibit a myopathic phenotype resembling that in LGMD patients, making NRIP deficiency a potential culprit leading to cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to determine if NRIP deficiency leads to cardiomyopathy and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.NRIP expression was reduced in both human and mouse failing hearts. Muscle-specific NRIP knockout (MCK-Cre::Dcaf6) mouse heart and isolated cardiomyocytes exhibited markedly reduced contractility. Transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal sarcomere structures and mitochondrial morphology in MCK-Cre::Dcaf6 hearts. Protein co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging revealed that NRIP interacts with α-actinin 2 (ACTN2) at the Z-disc. We found that NRIP facilitated ACTN2-mediated F-actin bundling, and that NRIP deficiency resulted in reduced binding between Z-disc proteins ACTN2 and Cap-Z. In addition, NRIP-deficiency led to increased mitochondrial ROS and impaired mitochondrial respiration/ATP production owing to elevated cellular NADH/NAD ratios. Treatment with -directed antioxidant mitoTEMPO or NAD precursor nicotinic  restored mitochondrial function and cardiac contractility in MCK-Cre::Dcaf6 mice.NRIP is essential to maintain sarcomere structure and mitochondrial/contractile function in cardiomyocytes. Our results revealed a novel role for NRIP deficiency in the pathogenesis of LGMD and heart failure. Targeting NRIP, therefore, could be a powerful new approach to treat myocardial dysfunction in LGMD and heart failure patients.Copyright © 2019.

The excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) could not only inhibit the function of P-gp through insufficient adenosine triphosphate supply but also cause apoptosis in MDR cells. Here, we designed a  targeting nanoparticulate system (GNPs-P-Dox-GA) for overcoming MDR through enhanced ROS generation, where increased cellular uptake as well as  accumulation were both realized by glycyrrhetinic  (GA). First, doxorubicin was conjugated with GA (GA-Dox) and then grafted onto a -(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer backbone via hydrazone bond (P-Dox-GA). The obtained P-Dox-GA was subsequently attached to the surface of gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs). As gelatin is a substrate of tumor extracellular metal matrix protease-2 (MMP2), GNPs-P-Dox-GA nanoparticles could be degraded and release small size P-Dox-GA to facilitate tumor tissue penetration. After P-Dox-GA internalized by tumor cells under GA mediation, Dox-GA detached from HPMA copolymer through hydrolysis of hydrazone bond and then efficiently delivered to . Compared to non-GA modified carriers, GNPs-P-Dox-GA exhibited increased cellular uptake nearly 4-fold and  distribution 8.8-fold, and increased ROS production level nearly 3-fold, significantly decreased efflux rate (55% compared with Dox group) in drug resistant HepG2/ADR cells, and then led to improved  antitumor efficiency in HepG2/ADR cells (IC only 19.5% of unmodified ones) as well as exciting  antitumor efficiency on HepG2/ADR heterotopic tumor nude mice (1.75-fold higher tumor growth inhibition rate than free drug).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546610>Autophagy and Inflammasome Activation in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.</a></h1><p>The clinical outcome of patients affected by dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is heterogeneous, since its pathophysiology is only partially understood.

In line, DCM hearts are characterized by accumulation of lipoperoxidation products and activation of both redox responsive pathways and inflammasome. Consistently with the fact that mTOR signaling may impair ALP, we observed, an increase in DCM activation, together with a reduction in the nuclear localization of Transcription Factor EB -TFEB- (a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis). These alterations were coupled with metabolomic alterations, including accumulation of branched chain amino  (BCAAs), known mTOR activators. Consistently, reduced levels of PP2Cm, a phosphatase that regulates the key catabolic step of BCAAs, coupled with increased levels of miR-22, a regulator of PP2Cm levels that triggers senescence, characterize DCM hearts. The same molecular defects were present in clinically relevant cells isolated from DCM hearts, but they could be reverted by downregulating miR-22.We identified, in human DCM, a complex series of events whose key players are miR-22, PP2Cm, BCAA, mTOR, and ALP, linking loss of proteostasis with inflammasome activation.

Recently, we reported that isoflurane induced the attenuation of mitochondrial respiration caused by complex I substrates. This process was not associated with endogenous production of mitochondrial nitric oxide (NO). In the present study, we investigated the effects of isoflurane on mitochondrial respiration and ROS production using complex II substrates. The detailed mechanism of these effects was explored with regards to NO production and the expression of mitochondrial ATP‑dependent K+ (mKATP) channels.  were isolated from the heart of Sprague‑Dawley rats. The respiratory rates of  (0.5 mg/ml) were measured via polarography at 28˚C with computer‑controlled Clark‑type O2 electrodes. The complex II substrate succinate (5 mM) was used; 0.25 mM of isoflurane was administered prior to ADP‑initiated state 3 respiration. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured under treatment with the substrate succinate, or succinate in the presence of the complex I inhibitor rotenone. The detection was achieved in a cuvette‑based spectrophotometer operating at wavelengths of 503 nm (excitation) 527 nm (emission) in the presence of 50 nM of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123. The H2O2 release rates in the  were measured spectrophotometrically with succinate, or succinate and rotenone using the fluorescent dye Amplex red (12.5‑25 µM). The results indicated that isoflurane increased the state 3 and 4 respiration rates caused by succinate, which were higher than those noted in the control group in the presence of succinate alone. The NOS inhibitor L‑NIO or the NO‑sensitive guanylyl cyclase 1H‑[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3‑a]quinoxalin‑1‑one did not inhibit the increase in the respiration rate (state 3) induced by isoflurane. The ROS scavengers SPBN and manganese (III) tetrakis (4‑benzoic ) porphyrin chloride inhibited the increase in the respiration rate (state 3 and 4) induced by isoflurane. This effect was not noted for the putative KATP channel blockers 5‑hydroxydecanoic  and glibenclamide. Isoflurane caused a greater decrease in the concentration of H2O2 during ADP‑initiated state 3 respiration, and L‑N5‑(1‑Iminoethyl)‑ornithine did not inhibit this effect. In conclusion, isoflurane was determined to modulate mitochondrial respiration and ROS production caused by the complex II substrate succinate. These effects were independent of endogenous mitochondrial NO generation and mitochondrial KATP channel opening.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655165>Disturbance of mitochondrial functions associated with permeability transition pore opening induced by cis-5-tetradecenoic and myristic  in liver of adolescent rats.</a></h1><p>Patients affected by very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency commonly present liver dysfunction whose pathogenesis is poorly known.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and  DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty  translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Our data provide new insights that miR-29a can improve HDF-induced obesity, hepatocellular steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as highlight the role of miR-29a in regulation of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613291>BODIPY-based selenides as fluorescent probes for rapid, sensitive and -specific detection of hypochlorous .</a></h1><p>Hypochlorous  (HClO) is a powerful microbicidal agent in the innate immue system; however, abnormal HClO levels can cause tissue damage and many diseases. Thus, it is vitally important to develop facile, rapid and accurate analytical methods for the detection of HClO/ClOin vitro and in vivo. In this work, we have constructed three meso-substituted BODIPY selenides with different hydrocarbyl groups (ethyl for BSe-Et, benzyl for BSe-Bz and phenyl for BSe-Ph) as fluorescent probes for the detection of HClO/ClO. All three non-fluorescent probes can sense HClO/ClO to form fluorescent selenoxides by blocking the photo-induced electron transfer process. Their sensing properties display a clear relationship with the structure of the hydrocarbyl. The sensing reactivity is heavily dependent on the electron-donating ability of hydrocarbyls, with the order of the response time as BSe-Et (2 s) < BSe-Bz (5 s) ≪ BSe-Ph (>100 s). Both BSe-Et and BSe-Bz afford a large fluorescence response and very low detection limits (0.3 nM and 0.8 nM), and BSe-Bz displays a higher selectivity over BSe-Et. Finally, as a representative, BSe-Bz was successfully applied to the detection of exo- and endogenous HClO in living cells, and demonstrated to be a -localized fluorescent probe.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682211>Autism Spectrum Disorders: Role of Pre- and Post-natal GammaDelta (γδ) T Cells and Immune Regulation.</a></h1><p>It is widely accepted that alterations in immune functioning are an important aspect of the pathoetiology and pathophysiology of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A relatively under-explored aspect of this is the role of gammaDelta (γδ) T cells, including prenatally and in the postnatal gut, which seem important hubs in driving the course of ASD.The present article looks at the role of γδ T cells in ASD, including via their interactions with other immune cells shown to be altered in this spectrum of conditions, including natural killer cells and mast cells.Other risk factors in ASD, such as decreased vitamins A & D, as well as toxin-associated activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor may also be intimately linked to γδ T cells, and alterations in the regulation of these cells. A growing body of data has highlighted an important role for alterations in  functioning in the regulation of immune cells, including natural killer cells and mast cells. This is an area that requires investigation in γδ T cells and their putative subtypes.It is also proposed that maternal stress may be acting via alterations in the maternal microbiome, leading to changes in how the balance of short chain fatty , such as butyrate, may act to regulate the placenta and developing foetus. Following an overview of previous research on immune, especially γδ T cells, effects in ASD, the future research implications are then detailed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616303>Shengmai Injection Suppresses Angiotensin II-Induced Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy and Apoptosis  Activation of the AMPK Signaling Pathway Through Energy-Dependent Mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Shengmai injection (SMI), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine extracted from Panax ginseng C.A.

SMI could improve cell-survival rate and also reduce myocardial cell hypertrophy and apoptosis.  are important sites of cellular energy metabolism, and SMI protects mitochondrial function which was evaluated by mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR), and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in this study. The expression levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and phosphocreatine (PCr) increased. The expression levels of free fatty  oxidation [carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1)], glucose oxidation [glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4)], and mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α [PGC-1α]) were upregulated after SMI treatment. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important signaling pathway regulating energy metabolism and also can regulate the above-mentioned indicators. In the present study, SMI was found to promote phosphorylation of AMPK. However, the effects of SMI on fatty , glucose oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as inhibiting apoptosis of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes were partly blocked by AMPK inhibitor-compound C. Moreover, decreased myocardial hypertrophy and apoptosis treated by SMI were inhibited by AMPK knockdown with shAMPK to a certain degree and AMPK knockdown almost abolished the SMI-induced increase in the expression of GLUT-4, CPT-1, and PGC-1α. These data suggest that SMI suppressed Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis via activation of the AMPK signaling pathway through energy-dependent mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Li, Ruan, Xu, Li, Qiang, Zhou, Gao and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668391>miR-873-5p targets mitochondrial GNMT-Complex II interface contributing to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex pathology in which several dysfunctions, including alterations in metabolic pathways, mitochondrial functionality and unbalanced lipid import/export, lead to lipid accumulation and progression to inflammation and fibrosis. The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the . In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation in the . Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Increasing evidence, however, demonstrates that LDs fulfill a pleiotropy of additional functions. Among them is the modulation of protein as well as lipid homeostasis. Under unfavorable pro-oxidative conditions, proteins can form aggregates which may exceed the overall proteolytic capacity of the proteasome. After stress termination LDs can adjust and support the removal of these aggregates. Additionally, LDs interact with , specifically take over certain proteins and thus prevent apoptosis. LDs, which are loaded with these harmful proteins, are subsequently eliminated via lipophagy. Recently it was demonstrated that this autophagic process is a modulator of longevity. LDs do not only eliminate potentially dangerous proteins, but they are also able to prevent lipotoxicity by storing specific lipids. In the present study we used the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to compare the proteome as well as lipidome of  and LDs under different conditions: replicative aging, stress and apoptosis. In this context we found an accumulation of proteins at LDs, supporting the role of LDs in proteostasis.

We determined the mitochondrial proteome of the three major cerebellar cell types (Purkinje cells, granule cells and astrocytes) and identified hundreds of mitochondrial proteins that are differentially regulated.

We also characterize cell-type differences in mitochondrial calcium buffering via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (Mcu) and identify regulator of microtubule dynamics protein 3 (Rmdn3) as a determinant of endoplasmic reticulum- proximity in Purkinje cells.

The nucleoside analogues resemble naturally occurring nucleosides and act by causing termination of the nascent DNA chain. These agents are generally safe and well tolerated as they are used by the viral, but not human polymerases in DNA replication. Actually, nucleoside analogues are a large class of agents that include drugs for cancer (cytarabine, gemcitabine, mercaptopurine), rheumatologic diseases (azathioprine, allpurinol) and even bacterial infections (trimethoprim). The nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV infection are often referred to as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, they have activity against both DNA dependent and RNA dependent DNA polymerases. They are believed to inhibit viral replication by several mechanisms, either by competitive inhibition of the viral polymerase or by DNA chain termination. Many of the antiviral nucleoside analogues are blocked at the 3’ hydroxyl group of the deoxyribonucleic , which results in failure of elongation of the nascent DNA molecule. Other antiviral nucleoside analogues are negative enantiomers (L-forms: lamivudine, emtricitabine, telbivudine) of the natural (D-form) nucleosides and interfere with replication, partially because of steric hindrance when they are taken up by the viral polymerase or added to the DNA molecule. Nucleoside analogues that are phosphorylated at the 5’ site are often referred to as nucleotide analogues, but this distinction is artificial as these agents (tenofovir, adefovir) are also nucleoside analogues. These features of the structure of nucleoside analogues are important because of the danger that they might be used by human polymerases and incorporated into RNA or DNA, which is the basis of the serious toxicities of the nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues can cause liver injury by several mechanisms. Most characteristic is a mitochondrial type of hepatic injury that is probably caused by the nucleoside analogue becoming incorporated into or blocking mitochondrial DNA synthesis by the mitochondrial gamma polymerase, leading to a depletion of  or decrease in their function. Mitochondrial injury can affect multiple tissues thereby causing myopathy, neuropathy, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and/or hepatic injury. The hepatic injury is characterized by accumulation of lactic acidosis, microvesicular steatosis and hepatic synthetic failure (LASH). Serum aminotransferase levels may be minimally elevated and jaundice arises late. The most dramatic example of hepatic mitochondrial injury occurred with the drug fialuridine (FIAU), a nucleoside analogue that was withdrawn after several fatalities due to hepatic failure, lactic acidosis and pancreatitis arising 2 to 3 months after initiation of therapy during phase 2 trials in humans. A similar, but rare and less dramatic and partially reversible hepatic mitochondrial injury has been linked to use of didanosine (dideoxyinosine: ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytine: ddC), stavudine (d4T) and less commonly to zidovudine (AZT).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31485472>RNA sequencing data of human prostate cancer cells treated with androgens.</a></h1><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent cancer in North American men and PCa cells rely on the androgen receptor (AR) for growth and survival. To understand the effect of AR in cancer cells, we have treated LNCaP and LAPC4 cells, two immortalized human PCa cells , with the synthetic androgen R1881 and then performed RNA-seq analyses. High quality sequencing data have been analyzed using our bioinformatic pipeline which consists of FastQC for quality controls, Trimmomatic for trimming, and Kallisto for pseudoalignment to the transcriptome. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 after adjustment for false-discovery rate (FDR  values < 0.05) and Relative Log Expression (RLE) normalization. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was also performed to identify biological pathways significantly modulated by androgens. GSEA analyses identified the androgen signaling pathway, as well as several metabolic pathways, as significantly enriched following androgen stimulation. These analyses highlight the most significant metabolic pathways up-regulated following AR activation. Raw and processed RNA-seq data were deposited and made publicly available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; GSE128749). These data have been incorporated in a recent article describing the functions of AR as a master regulator of PCa cell metabolism.

However, it is unclear how  mutations lead to α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation and dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration. Here, we report that -deficient  exhibits defects in neurotransmission during early developmental stages and progressive cell loss throughout the brain, including degeneration of the DA neurons. Lipid analysis of brain tissues reveals that the acyl-chain length of phospholipids is shortened by  loss, which causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through membrane lipid disequilibrium. The introduction of wild-type human iPLA2-VIA or the -ER contact site-resident protein C19orf12 in -deficient flies rescues the phenotypes associated with altered lipid composition, ER stress, and DA neurodegeneration, whereas the introduction of a disease-associated missense mutant,  A80T, fails to suppress these phenotypes. The acceleration of α-Syn aggregation by  loss is suppressed by the administration of linoleic , correcting the brain lipid composition. Our findings suggest that membrane remodeling by iPLA2-VIA is required for the survival of DA neurons and α-Syn stability.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

As such, it represents a potential critical factor in nutritional programming. Here, we investigated whether early methionine restriction at first feeding could have long-term programmed metabolic consequences in rainbow trout. For this purpose, trout fry were fed with either a control diet (C) or a methionine-deficient diet (MD) for 2 weeks from the first exogenous feeding. Next, fish were subjected to a 5 month growth trial with a standard diet followed by a 2 week challenge (with the MD or C diet) to test the programming effect of the early methionine restriction. The results showed that, whatever the dietary treatment of fry, the 2 week challenge with the MD diet led to a general mitochondrial defect associated with an increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitophagy and apoptosis, highlighting the existence of complex cross-talk between these different functions. Moreover, for the first time, we also observed that fish fed the MD diet at the first meal later exhibited an increase in several critical factors of mitophagy, hinting that the early nutritional stimulus with methionine deficiency resulted in long-term programming of this cell function. Together, these data extend our understanding of the role of dietary methionine and emphasize the potential for this amino  in the application of new feeding strategies, such as nutritional programming, to optimize the nutrition and health of farmed fish.© 2019.

Moreover, the decrements of mitochondrial DNA copy number and the expressions of mitochondrial Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, and -specific superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in the kidneys of FA-treated mice were further reduced in rotenone-pretreated mice, indicating the aggravated mitochondrial damage. In parallel with the SOD2 reduction, the oxidative stress markers of malondialdehyde and HO-1 displayed greater increment in AKI mice with rotenone pretreatment in line with the deteriorated apoptotic response and inflammation.Our results suggested that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity aggravated renal tubular injury, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and inflammation in FA-induced AKI.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Here, biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a waste material,  (GM) fruit peel extract is demonstrated. The best condition for AgNPs synthesis was with 0.5 g of peel extract, 7.5 mM silver nitrate at 45 °C, ~pH 4 for 16 h. The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and 32.7 ± 5.7 nm in size. To test its efficiency to be used as drug carrier, plant-based drug, protocatechuic  (PCA) was used as a test drug. AgNPs loaded with PCA (AgPCA) resulted in 80% of inhibition at 15.6 µg/mL as compared to AgNPs which only killed 5% of HCT116 colorectal cells at same concentration. The IC of AgNPs and AgPCA for HCT116 were 40.2 and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. At 15.6 µg/mL, AgPCA was not toxic to the tested colon normal cells, CCD112. Ag-based drug carrier could also potentially reduce the toxicity of loaded drug as the IC of PCA alone (148.1 µg/mL) was higher than IC of AgPCA (10.7 µg/mL) against HCT116. Further, 24-h treatment of 15.6 µg/mL AgPCA resulted in loss of membrane potential in the  of HCT116 cells and increased level of reaction oxygen species (ROS). These could be the cellular killing mechanisms of AgPCA.

To solubilize HN, this report describes two genetically-encoded fusions between HN and elastin-like polypeptides (ELP). ELPs provide steric stabilization and/or thermo-responsive phase separation. Fusions were designed to either remain soluble or phase separate at the physiological temperature of the retina. Interestingly, the soluble fusion assembles stable colloids with a hydrodynamic radius of 39.1 nm at 37°C. As intended, the thermo-responsive fusion forms large coacervates (>1,000 nm) at 37°C. Both fusions bind human RPE cells and protect against oxidative stress-induction of apoptosis (TUNEL, caspase-3 activation). Their activity is mediated through STAT3; furthermore, STAT3 inhibition eliminates their protection.

In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of MHY4381, a newly synthesized HDAC inhibitor, against human prostate cancer cell lines and compared its efficacy with that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic  (SAHA), a well-known HDAC inhibitor. We assessed cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and other biological effects in the prostate cancer cells. We also evaluated a possible mechanism of MHY4381 on the apoptotic cell death pathway. The IC value of MHY4381 was lower in DU145 cells (IC=0.31 μM) than in LNCaP (IC=0.85 μM) and PC-3 cells (IC=5.23 μM). In addition, the IC values of MHY4381 measured in this assay were significantly lower than those of SAHA against prostate cancer cell lines. MHY4381 increased the levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 and reduced the expression of HDAC proteins in the prostate cancer cell lines. MHY4381 increased G2/M phase arrest in DU145 cells, and G1 arrest in LNCaP cells. It also activated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which induced apoptosis in the DU145 and LNCaP cells by increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and releasing cytochrome c into the cytoplasm.

HL-1 cells were incubated with TNF-α (25 ng/mL) with or without sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS, 0.1 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, pro-inflammatory cytokines, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and fatty  metabolism were evaluated through Western blotting.

Influx of Na and efflux of H and NH  were measured across the nuchal organ of both embryos and neonates. We propose that the efflux of K and Cl across the nuchal organ in embryos is related to the expansion of the haemocoel and release of intracellular solutes into the extracellular space during development.

Ca influx across the nuchal organ and body surface of neonates but not embryos is presumably related to calcification of the exoskeleton. Increases in the levels of Na and Ca in the water within the brood chamber suggests maternal provisioning of ions for uptake by the embryos. Our data thus support roles of the nuchal organ in ionoregulation, pH regulation, and nitrogenous waste excretion.© 2019.

We measured oxygen consumption during a 2-h, strenuous exercise test; assessed the respiration of skeletal muscle ; and performed untargeted metabolomics on treated fish, with and without exercise.Nitrate and nitrite treatment increased blood nitrate and nitrite levels. Nitrate treatment significantly lowered the oxygen cost of exercise, as compared with pretreatment values. In contrast, nitrite treatment significantly increased oxygen consumption with exercise. Nitrate and nitrite treatments did not change mitochondrial function measured ex vivo, but significantly increased the abundances of ATP, ADP, lactate, glycolytic intermediates (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle intermediates (e.g., succinate), and ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate) by 1.8- to 3.8-fold, relative to controls. Exercise significantly depleted glycolytic and TCA intermediates in nitrate- and nitrite-treated fish, as compared with their rested counterparts, while exercise did not change, or increased, these metabolites in control fish. There was a significant net depletion of fatty , acyl carnitines, and ketone bodies in exercised, nitrite-treated fish (2- to 4-fold), while exercise increased net fatty  and acyl carnitines in nitrate-treated fish (1.5- to 12-fold), relative to their treated and rested counterparts.Nitrate and nitrite treatment increased the availability of metabolic fuels (ATP, glycolytic and TCA intermediates, lactate, and ketone bodies) in rested zebrafish. Nitrate treatment may improve exercise performance, in part, by stimulating the preferential use of fuels that require less oxygen for energy production.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647942>The compartmentalised nature of the mechanisms governing superoxide formation and scavenging in cells exposed to arsenite.</a></h1><p>In this study, respiration-proficient (RP) and -deficient (RD) cells were exposed to 2.5 or 10 μM arsenite to generate superoxide (O) respectively in the mitochondrial respiratory chain or via NADPH oxidase activation. These treatments, while causing similar, although mitochondrial permeability transition-dependent (RP-cells) or independent (RD-cells), delayed apoptosis, surprisingly generated identical kinetics and levels of dihydrorhodamine oxidation, indicative of O formation. These similarities were attributable to the involvement of a common upstream event resulting in activation of the two O-generating systems, and to intrinsic features of the cells. Both mechanisms required an initial and sequential mobilization of Ca from the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), with however different implications. The close contacts existing between the RyR and the  created optimal conditions for the Ca clearance, and the ensuing formation of O in RP-cell . Exposure to low concentrations of l-ascorbic  (AA) transported by high affinity mechanisms in cells and , suppressed O formation. Much more Ca, and hence more arsenite, was necessary to promote NADPH oxidase activation in RD-cells, as a consequence of the cytosolic dilution and mitochondrial clearance of Ca. For the same reasons, an exposure to high concentrations of AA was required to suppress O formation under these conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To gain metabolic insight into this differential response, metabolome changes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves were determined following short-term (0.5 and 3.0 h) vs. prolonged freezing (5.5 and 10.5 h) at -4.5°C resulting in reversible or irreversible injury, respectively. LD , the freezing duration causing 50% injury, was estimated to be ∼3.1 h and defined as the threshold beyond which tissues were irreversibly injured. From 39 identified metabolites, 19 were selected and clustered into 3 groups: (1) signaling-related (salicylic , aliphatic and aromatic amino ), (2) injury-related (GABA, lactic , maltose, fatty , policosanols, TCA intermediates) and (3) recovery-related (ascorbic , α-tocopherol). Initial accumulation of salicylic  during short-term freezing followed by a decline may be involved in triggering tolerance mechanisms in moderately injured tissues, while its resurgence during prolonged freezing may signal programmed cell death. GABA accumulated with increasing freezing duration, possibly to serve as a 'pH-stat' against cytoplasmic acidification resulting from lactic  accumulation.  seem to be more sensitive to prolonged freezing than chloroplasts since TCA intermediates decreased after LD while salicylic  and maltose, produced in chloroplasts, accumulate even at 10.5-h freezing. Fatty  and policosanols accumulation with increasing freezing duration indicates greater injury to membrane lipids and epicuticular waxes. Ascorbic  and α-tocopherol accumulated after short-term freezing, supposedly facilitating recovery while their levels decreased in irreversibly injured tissues.© 2019 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515272>The specific molecular architecture of plant 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase.</a></h1><p>3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase (HMGL) is involved in branched-chain amino  catabolism leading to acetyl-CoA production. Here, using bioinformatics analyses and protein sequence alignments, we found that in  a single gene encodes two HMGL isoforms differing in size (51 kDa, HMGL51 and 46 kDa, HMGL46). Similar to animal HMGLs, both isoforms comprised a C-terminal type 1 peroxisomal retention motif, and HMGL51 contained a mitochondrial leader peptide. We observed that only a shortened HMGL (35 kDa, HMGL35) is conserved across all kingdoms of life. Most notably, all plant HMGLs also contained a specific N-terminal extension (P100) that is located between the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence TP35 and HMGL35 and is absent in bacteria and other eukaryotes. Interestingly, using HMGL enzyme assays, we found that rather than HMGL46, homodimeric recombinant HMGL35 is the active enzyme catalyzing acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate synthesis when incubated with ()-HMG-CoA. This suggested that the plant-specific P100 peptide may inactivate HMGL according to specific physiological requirements. Therefore, we investigated whether the P100 peptide in HMGL46 alters its activity, possibly by modifying the HMGL46 structure. We found that induced expression of a cytosolic HMGL35 version in  delays germination and leads to rapid wilting and chlorosis in mature plants. Our results suggest that in plants, P100-mediated HMGL inactivation outside of peroxisomes or  is crucial, protecting against potentially cytotoxic effects of HMGL activity while it transits to these organelles.© 2019 Hemmerlin et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642231>[Protective Effect of a Dihydroflavonol Glycoside from  Nutt. in Mouse Model of Alcoholic Acute Pancreatitis].</a></h1><p>To investigate the protective effect of (2R, 3R)-dihydroquercetin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranose (C1) extracted from  Nutt. in a mouse model of alcoholic acute pancreatitis (FAEE-AP) induced byfatty  ethyl ester (FAEE).The 30 healthy SPF mice were randomly divided into control group, model group, low dose group, middle dose group and high dose group, 6 in each group.

Traditional landraces or "criollo" tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) from Andean areas of Argentina, selected for their fruit quality, were analysed in this study. We explored the metabolome and transcriptome of the ripe fruit in nine landrace accessions representing the seven genetic groups and compared them to the mature fruit of the wild progenitor Solanum pimpinellifolium. The content of branched- (isoleucine and valine) and aromatic (phenylalanine and tryptophan) amino , citrate and sugars were significantly different in the fruit of several "criollo" tomatoes compared to S. pimpinellifolium. The transcriptomic profile of the ripe fruit showed several genes significantly and highly regulated in all varieties compared to S. pimpinellifolium, like genes encoding histones and mitochondrial proteins. Additionally, network analysis including transcripts and metabolites identified major hubs with the largest number of connections such as constitutive photomorphogenic protein 1 (a RING finger-type ubiquitin E3 ligase), five Zn finger transcription factors, ascorbate peroxidase, acetolactate synthase, and sucrose non-fermenting 1 kinase.

However, its therapeutic potential has been significantly impaired by its poor biostability, lack of tumor specificity, and particularly low cellular uptake. Herein, a linear peptide Arg-Trp-d-Arg-Asn-Arg (RWrNR) was identified as an integrin αβ specific ligand with a nanomolar dissociation constant ( = 0.95 nM), which can greatly improve kla antitumor activity (IC = 8.81 μM) by improving its cellular uptake, compared to the classic integrin-recognition motif c-RGDyK (IC = 37.96 μM). Particularly, the RWrNR-kla conjugate can be entrapped in acidic sensitive nanogels (RK/Parg/CMCS-NGs), composed of poly-l-arginine (Parg) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS, pI = 6.8), which can not only carry out controlled release of RWrNR-kla in response to the tumor acidic microenvironment, and consequently enhance its tumor specificity and cell internalization, but also trigger tumor-associated macrophages to generate nitric oxide, leading to enhanced synergistic anticancer efficacy. Importantly, RK/Parg/CMCS-NGs have been proven to effectively activate the apoptosis signaling pathway  and significantly inhibit tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. To summarize, RK/Parg/CMCS-NGs are a promising apoptotic peptide-based therapeutics with enhanced tumor accumulation, cytosolic delivery, and synergistic anticancer effects, thereby holding great potential for the treatment of malignant tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505459>Melatonin rescues impaired penetration ability of human spermatozoa induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.</a></h1><p>Fertilization failure often occurs during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles despite apparently normal sperm and oocytes. Accumulating evidence suggests that  play crucial roles in the regulation of sperm function and male fertility. 3-Nitrophthalic  (3-NPA) can induce oxidative stress in , and melatonin, as an antioxidant, can improve mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress. The role of sperm mitochondrial dysfunction in fertilization failure during in vitro fertilization (IVF) is unclear. The present study revealed that spermatozoa with low, or poor, fertilization rates had swollen , increased -derived ROS, and attenuated mitochondrial respiratory capacity. 3-NPA treatment enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction in sperm. Spermatozoa with poor fertilization rates, and spermatozoa treated with 3-NPA, had reduced penetration ability. The concentration of melatonin was decreased in semen samples with low and poor fertilization rates. Melatonin, not only decreased excessive -derived ROS, but also "rescued" the reduced penetration capacity of spermatozoa treated with 3-NPA. Taken together, the study suggested that -derived ROS and mitochondrial respiratory capacity are independent bio-markers for sperm dysfunction, and melatonin may be useful in improving sperm quality and overall male fertility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477743>ETHE1 and MOCS1 deficiencies: Disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, redox homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum- crosstalk in patient fibroblasts.</a></h1><p>Ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein 1 (ETHE1) and molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) deficiencies are hereditary disorders that affect the catabolism of sulfur-containing amino . ETHE1 deficiency is caused by mutations in the ETHE1 gene, while MoCo deficiency is due to mutations in one of three genes involved in MoCo biosynthesis (MOCS1, MOCS2 and GPHN). Patients with both disorders exhibit abnormalities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, among other biochemical findings. However, the pathophysiology of the defects has not been elucidated. To characterize cellular derangements, mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)- communication, superoxide production and apoptosis were evaluated in fibroblasts from four patients with ETHE1 deficiency and one with MOCS1 deficiency. The effect of JP4-039, a promising mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, was also tested on cells. Our data show that mitochondrial respiration was decreased in all patient cell lines. ATP depletion and increased mitochondrial mass was identified in the same cells, while variable alterations in mitochondrial fusion and fission were seen. High superoxide levels were found in all cells and were decreased by treatment with JP4-039, while the respiratory chain activity was increased by this antioxidant in cells in which it was impaired. The content of VDAC1 and IP3R, proteins involved in ER- communication, was decreased, while DDIT3, a marker of ER stress, and apoptosis were increased in all cell lines. These data demonstrate that previously unrecognized broad disturbances of cellular function are involved in the pathophysiology of ETHE1 and MOCS1 deficiencies, and that reduction of mitochondrial superoxide by JP4-039 is a promising strategy for adjuvant therapy of these disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623369>Differential Mechanism of ATP Production Occurs in Response to Succinylacetone in Colon Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Our aim was to verify the potential ability of succinylacetone (SA) to inhibit mitochondrial function, thereby suppressing cancer cell proliferation.

We checked for dysfunctional  after SA treatment.  of HT29 cells were swollen, indicating damage, whereas in HCT116 cells, several  had a diminished size. Damaged  decreased ATP production and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells. To understand SA-induced reduction in ATP production, we investigated the electron transfer chains (ETC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity, which prevents the transfer of acetyl-CoA to the TCA (tricarboxylic ) cycle by inhibiting PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) activity. In each cell line, the inhibitory mechanism of ATP by SA was different. The activity of complex III consisting of the mitochondrial ETCs in HT29 cells was decreased. In contrast, PDH activity in HCT116 cells was reduced. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)-removing reactive oxygen species (ROS) was upregulated in HT29 cells, but not in HCT116 cells, indicating that in HT29 cells, a defense mechanism was activated against ROS.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It is one of the most abundant free amino  in many excitable tissues, including the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscles. Physiological actions of taurine are widespread and include regulation of plasma glucose levels, bile  conjugation, detoxification, membrane stabilization, blood pressure regulation, osmoregulation, neurotransmission, and modulation of  function and cellular calcium levels. Taurine plays an important role in modulating glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and prevents excitotoxicity in vitro primarily through modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Taurine supplementation prevents age-dependent decline of cognitive functions. Because of the wide spread actions of taurine, its levels are highly regulated through enzymatic biosynthesis or dietary intake. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous or dietary supplementation of exogenous taurine have been shown to induce wide spread actions on multiple organs. Cysteine sulfonic  decarboxylase (CSAD) was first identified in the liver and is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in taurine biosynthesis. CSAD mRNA is expressed in the brain in astrocytes. Homozygous knockout mice lacking CSAD (CSAD-KO) have very reduced taurine content and show severe functional histopathology in the visual system, skeletal system, heart, pancreas and brain. Conversely, dietary supplementation of taurine results in significant health benefits acting through the same organ systems. Fluctuation of taurine bioavailability lead to changes in the expression levels of taurine transporters in neuronal plasma membranes, endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier and proximal cells of the kidneys. Suggesting a highly regulated mechanism for maintaining taurine homeostasis and organ systems function. Here we show how alterations in taurine levels directly affect the function of one organ system and through functional interaction and compensatory adaptation; these effects extend to another organ systems with focus on the nervous system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621967>Fructose metabolism as a common evolutionary pathway of survival associated with climate change, food shortage and droughts.</a></h1><p>Mass extinctions occur frequently in natural history. While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in oxygen availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the  to glycolysis, fructose reduced oxygen demands to aid survival in situations where oxygen availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric . Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585072>Differential contribution of pyruvate carboxylation to anaplerosis and cataplerosis during non-gluconeogenic and gluconeogenic conditions in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is an anaplerotic enzyme that supplies oxaloacetate to  enabling the maintenance of other metabolic intermediates consumed by cataplerosis. Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure metabolic intermediates derived from uniformly labeled C-glucose or [3-C]l-lactate, we investigated the contribution of PC to anaplerosis and cataplerosis in the liver cell line HepG2. Suppression of PC expression by short hairpin RNA lowered incorporation of C glucose incorporation into tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates, aspartate, glutamate and sugar derivatives, indicating impaired cataplerosis. The perturbation of these biosynthetic pathways is accompanied by a marked decrease of cell viability and proliferation. In contrast, under gluconeogenic conditions where the HepG2 cells use lactate as a carbon source, pyruvate carboxylation contributed very little to the maintenance of these metabolites. Suppression of PC did not affect the percent incorporation of C-labeled carbon from lactate into citrate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, succinate as well as aspartate and glutamate, suggesting that under gluconeogenic condition, PC does not support cataplerosis from lactate.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recessive mutations in GPT2 have been recently identified in a new syndrome involving intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), postnatal microcephaly, and spastic paraplegia. We have identified additional families with recessive GPT2 mutations and expanded the phenotype to include small stature. GPT2 loss-of-function mutations were identified in four families, nine patients total, including: a homozygous mutation in one child [c.775T>C (p.C259R)]; compound heterozygous mutations in two siblings [c.812A>C (p.N271T)/c.1432_1433delGT (p.V478Rfs*73)]; a novel homozygous, putative splicing mutation [c.1035C>T (p.G345=)]; and finally, a recurrent mutation, previously identified in a distinct family [c.1210C>T (p.R404*)]. All patients were diagnosed with IDD. A majority of patients had remarkably small stature throughout development, many < 1st percentile for height and weight. Given the potential biological function of GPT2 in cellular growth, this phenotype is strongly suggestive of a newly identified clinical susceptibility. Further, homozygous GPT2 mutations manifested in at least 2 of 176 families with IDD (approximately 1.1%) in a Pakistani cohort, thereby representing a relatively common cause of recessive IDD in this population, with recurrence of the p.R404* mutation in this population. Based on variants in the ExAC database, we estimated that approximately 1 in 248 individuals are carriers of moderately or severely deleterious variants in GPT2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589099>Redox-regulation of mitochondrial metabolism through thioredoxin o1 facilitates light induction of photosynthesis.</a></h1><p>Despite the well-known biochemistry of the major pathways involved in central carbon and amino  metabolism, there are still gaps regarding their regulation or regulatory interactions. Recent research demonstrated the physiological significance of the mitochondrial redox machinery, particularly thioredoxin o1 (TRXo1), for proper regulation of the tricarboxylic  cycle, components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and photorespiration. These findings imply that TRXo1 regulation contributes to the metabolic acclimation toward changes in the prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we analyzed if TRXo1 is involved in the light induction of photosynthesis. Our results show that the  mutant activates CO assimilation rates to a significantly lower extend than wild type in response to short-term light/dark changes. Metabolite analysis suggests that activation of glycine-to-serine conversion catalyzed through glycine decarboxylase in conjunction with serine hydroxymethyltransferase in  is slowed down at onset of illumination. We propose that redox regulation via TRXo1 is necessary to allow the rapid induction of mitochondrial steps of the photorespiratory cycle and, in turn, to facilitate light-induction of photosynthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638601>Hyperuricemia and gout caused by missense mutation in d-lactate dehydrogenase.</a></h1><p>Gout is caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints when plasma uric  levels are chronically elevated beyond the saturation threshold, mostly due to renal underexcretion of uric . Although molecular pathways of this underexcretion have been elucidated, its etiology remains mostly unknown. We demonstrate that gout can be caused by a mutation in LDHD within the putative catalytic site of the encoded d-lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in augmented blood levels of d-lactate, a stereoisomer of l-lactate, which is normally present in human blood in miniscule amounts. Consequent excessive renal secretion of d-lactate in exchange for uric  reabsorption culminated in hyperuricemia and gout. We showed that LDHD expression is enriched in tissues with a high metabolic rate and abundant  and that d-lactate dehydrogenase resides in the  of cells overexpressing the human LDHD gene. Notably, the p.R370W mutation had no effect on protein localization. In line with the human phenotype, injection of d-lactate into naive mice resulted in hyperuricemia. Thus, hyperuricemia and gout can result from the accumulation of metabolites whose renal excretion is coupled to uric  reabsorption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629068>Impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics and permeability transition induction caused by major long-chain fatty  accumulating in VLCAD deficiency in skeletal muscle as potential pathomechanisms of myopathy.</a></h1><p>cis-5-Tetradecenoic (cis-5) and myristic (Myr)  predominantly accumulate in patients affected by very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. They commonly manifest myopathy with muscular pain and rhabdomyolysis, whose underlying mechanisms are poorly known. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effects of cis-5 and Myr on mitochondrial bioenergetics and Ca homeostasis in rat skeletal muscle. cis-5 and Myr decreased ADP-stimulated (state 3) and CCCP-stimulated (uncoupled) respiration, especially when  were supported by NADH-linked as compared to FADH-linked substrates. In contrast, these fatty  increased resting respiration (state 4). Similar effects were observed in skeletal muscle fibers therefore validating the data obtained with isolated . Furthermore, cis-5 and Myr markedly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and Ca retention capacity that were avoided by cyclosporin A plus ADP and ruthenium red, indicating that cis-5 and Myr induce mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Finally, docosanoic  did not disturb mitochondrial homeostasis, indicating selective effects for Myr and cis-5. Taken together, our findings indicate that major long-chain fatty  accumulating in VLCAD deficiency behave as metabolic inhibitors, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and MPT inducers. It is presumed that these pathomechanisms contribute to the muscular symptoms and rhabdomyolysis observed in patients affected by VLCAD deficiency.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, Poldip2 deficiency induces metabolic reprograming with repressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity. Though homozygous deletion of Poldip2 is lethal, heterozygous mice are viable and show protection against aneurysm and injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia, diseases linked to loss of VSMC differentiation. Thus, we hypothesize that the metabolic reprograming induced by Poldip2 deficiency controls VSMC differentiation.  To determine the role of Poldip2-mediated metabolic reprograming in phenotypic modulation of VSMC.  We show that Poldip2 deficiency in vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of the serum response factor (SRF), Myocardin, and MRTFA and dramatically represses KLF4. Consequently, Poldip2-deficient VSMC and mouse aorta express high levels of contractile proteins and, more significantly, these cells do not dedifferentiate nor acquire macrophage-like characteristics when exposed to Cholesterol or PDGF. Regarding the mechanism, we found that Poldip2 deficiency upregulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and OGT-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation. Increased protein glycosylation causes the inhibition of a nuclear UPS responsible for SRF stabilization and KLF4 repression and is required for the establishment of the differentiated phenotype in Poldip2-deficient cells.  Our data show that Poldip2 deficiency induces a highly differentiated phenotype in VSMCs through a mechanism that involves regulation of metabolism and proteostasis.

The ultrastructure of pulmonary cells was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the expression level of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). Protein expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) in lung tissues were determined by Western blot. The results showed that histopathological scores of lung tissues, lung wet-dry weight ratio and protein in BALF in the OA group were higher than those of the control group. In the OA group, the  of pulmonary cells were shrunken, and the mitochondrial membrane was ruptured. The expression level of PTGS2 mRNA in the OA group was seven folds over that in the control group. Iron overload, GSH depletion and accumulation of MDA were observed in the OA group. Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of GPX4 and ferritin in lung tissue were down-regulated in the OA group. These results suggest that ferroptosis plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALI in our mouse model, which may provide new insights for development of new drugs for ALI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679688>Autophagic flux defect in diabetic kidney disease results in megamitochondria formation in podocytes.</a></h1><p>Podocyte injury is an important factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Podocytes are characterized by large numbers of . However, mitochondrial dysfunction as it relates to kidney pathology remains poorly understood. The present study found that podocyte  in different animal models of diabetes mellitus became elongated with the development of albuminuria, suggesting a change in mitochondrial dynamics. We then treated cells with a combination of glucose, fatty , and angiotensin II (GFA) to mimic the diabetic milieu. Cultured podocytes exposed to GFA showed megamitochondria formation and decreased autophagosome degradation. We also found that GFA treatment decreased the binding of the autophagosome to the lysosome. Our results suggest that megamitochondria are common in podocytes during diabetic nephropathy and that insufficient autophagy flux may underlie this effect. These findings have expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and identified a potential pharmacological target for treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Using a cell-SELEX-generated aptamer, we discovered a new tumor driver protein, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (LRPPRC), which is specifically overexpressed in the most lethal subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. Tar-geted LRPPRC protein knockdown is a promising therapeutic strategy for the undruggable LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). Nevertheless, LRPPRC is mainly located in  and degraded by protease. Current protein knockdown approaches, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have limitations in their applications to the proteins degraded through proteasome-independent ways. Here, we designed an aptamer-assisted high-throughput method to screen small molecules which could bind to LRPPRC directly, disrupt the interaction of LRPPRC with its stabilizing chaperon protein, and lead to LRPPRC degradation by mitochondrial protease. The screened compound, gossypol-acetic  (GAA), is an old medicine which can accomplish the new function for targeted LRPPRC knockdown. It showed significant antitumor effects even with the LRPPRC positive patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model. This work not only extended the application of ap-tamers to screen small-molecule inhibitors for the undruggable lung cancers, but more importantly provided a new strategy to develop protein knockdown methods beyond the proteasome system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626159>[Metabolic and ultrastructural adaptation mechanisms during the primary prophylactic action of low-intensity electromagnetic radiation under normal and radiation conditions].</a></h1><p>Experimental studies have established that that low-intensity ultrahigh frequency (UHF) electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has a preventive effect under the action of radiation and other pathogenic factors, which manifests itself in the accelerated development of adaptation, in the predominance of anabolic reactions over catabolic ones, and in the strengthening of the body' structural reserves. At the same time, from the standpoint of studying the mechanisms of primary prevention, it is very important not only to identify the overall adaptation effect, but also to have an idea on the specific contribution of a physical factor used in the development of adaptation.To identify metabolic and ultrastructural adaption parameters under the action of low-intensity UHF EMR on healthy animals and to determine their stability (safety), by using a model of radiation exposure.The experiments were carried on 42 mature male rats weighing 180-200g. All the rats were divided into 5 groups: 2 experimental groups of 8 animals each for the comparative study of the specific features of adaptation developed under the preliminary action of UHF EMR in healthy animals and under radiation; 2 control groups of 8 animals each, and one intact group of 10 animals. The lumbar region (the area of the projection of the adrenal glands) was exposed to UHF EMP for 2 min daily (a cycle of 10 sessions). The animals were once irradiated at 2 Gy Co gamma ray doses, by using an Agat-R apparatus. The investigation objects were the liver, adrenal glands, testes, and thymus. The investigators used biochemical assays (the levels of RNA and DNA, antioxidant activity, specific activity in the thymocyte genome), transmission electron microscopy of adrenocorticocytes in the adrenal bundle zone and Sertoli cells in the testis.  (number, average and total area, number of cristae) were morphometrically analyzed.The metabolic and ultrastructural adaption changes induced by UHF EMR in healthy animals were ascertained to be able to withstand the pathogenic effect of radiation and at the same time showed both stability (safety) and certain variability (plasticity) in their reactions. In this case, there were increases in the synthesis of nucleic  and in the activity of the antioxidant system; there was also mitochondrial structural stability that was more manifested in the adrenocorticocytes in the adrenal bundle zone. At the same time, there was also a decrease in the intensity (magnitude) of a number of adaptive indicators, although by and large they were significantly higher than the level of control (the effect of radiation).Thus, the effect of UHF EMR on healthy animals contributed to the development of adaptive rearrangements in the organs studied. The essence of these changes was mainly the enhancement of synthetic reactions, as indicated by a larger amount of RNA and DNA, the activation of cellular and intracellular regeneration with the increased processes of hyperplasia of the mitochondrial cristae and the higher levels of ribosomes and polysomes. In addition, it can be assumed that the use of UHF EMR has laid the physicochemical foundations of its antioxidant action as conformational rearrangements in the membranes, which increased their structural stability. The findings are indicative of the increased level of morphofunctional reserves in the studied cells and tissues due to their increased bioenergetic and plastic potential.This study has provided new data that expand our understanding of the features of the development of adaptive mechanisms and the formation of the body's structural and functional reserves under the primary prophylactic action of low-intensity UHF EMR, by using the model of radiation exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603468>SubMito-XGBoost: predicting protein submitochondrial localization by fusing multiple feature information and eXtreme gradient boosting.</a></h1><p> are an essential organelle in most eukaryotes. They not only play an important role in energy metabolism but also take part in many critical cytopathological processes. Abnormal  can trigger a series of human diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multifactor disorder, and Type-II diabetes. Protein submitochondrial localization enables the understanding of protein function in studying disease pathogenesis and drug design.We proposed a new method, SubMito-XGBoost, for protein submitochondrial localization prediction. Three steps are included: (i) the g-gap dipeptide composition (g-gap DC), pseudo-amino  composition (PseAAC), auto-correlation function (ACF), and Bi-gram position-specific scoring matrix (Bi-gram PSSM) are employed to extract protein sequence features, (ii) Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to balance samples, and the ReliefF algorithm is applied for feature selection, and (iii) the obtained feature vectors are fed into XGBoost to predict protein submitochondrial locations. SubMito-XGBoost has obtained satisfactory prediction results by the leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) compared with existing methods. The prediction accuracies of the SubMito-XGBoost method on the two training datasets M317 and M983 were 97.7% and 98.9%, which are 2.8-12.5% and 3.8-9.9% higher than other methods, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the independent test set M495 was 94.8%, which is significantly better than the existing studies. The proposed method also achieves satisfactory predictive performance on plant and non-plant protein submitochondrial datasets.

It is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. CI oxidizes NADH generated from the tricarboxylic  cycle to NAD, in a series of redox reactions that culminates in the reduction of ubiquinone, and the transport of protons from the matrix across the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. The resulting proton-motive force is consumed by ATP synthase to generate ATP, or harnessed to transport ions, metabolites and proteins into the mitochondrion. CI is also a major source of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, impaired CI function has been associated with a host of chronic metabolic and degenerative disorders such as diabetes, cardiomyopathy, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Leigh syndrome. Studies on Drosophila have contributed to our understanding of the multiple roles of CI in bioenergetics and organismal physiology. Here, we explore and discuss some of the studies on Drosophila that have informed our understanding of this complex and conclude with some of the open questions about CI that can be resolved by studies on Drosophila.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653868>Regulation of the ER stress response by a mitochondrial microprotein.</a></h1><p>Cellular homeostasis relies on having dedicated and coordinated responses to a variety of stresses. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a common stress that triggers a conserved pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that mitigates damage, and dysregulation of UPR underlies several debilitating diseases. Here, we discover that a previously uncharacterized 54-amino  microprotein PIGBOS regulates UPR. PIGBOS localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with the ER protein CLCC1 at ER- contact sites. Functional studies reveal that the loss of PIGBOS leads to heightened UPR and increased cell death. The characterization of PIGBOS reveals an undiscovered role for a mitochondrial protein, in this case a microprotein, in the regulation of UPR originating in the ER. This study demonstrates microproteins to be an unappreciated class of genes that are critical for inter-organelle communication, homeostasis, and cell survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553812>Subcellular NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage pathways and their roles in bioenergetics and neuronal protection after ischemic injury.</a></h1><p>NAD is a cofactor required for glycolysis, tricarboxylic  cycle, and complex I enzymatic reaction. In mammalian cells, NAD is predominantly synthesized through the salvage pathway, where nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme. Previously, we demonstrated that NAMPT exerts a neuroprotective effect in ischemia through the suppression of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mammalian cells maintain distinct NAD pools in the cytosol, , and nuclei. However, it is unknown whether  have an intact machinery for NAD salvage, and if so, whether it plays a dominant role in bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and neuronal protection after ischemia. Here, using mouse primary cortical neuron and cortical tissue preparations, and multiple technologies including cytosolic and mitochondrial subfractionation, viral over-expression of transgenes, molecular biology, and confocal microscopy, we provided compelling evidence that neuronal  possess an intact machinery of NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage pathway, and that NAMPT and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3 (NMNAT3) are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. By knocking down NMNAT1-3 and NAMPT with siRNA, we found that NMNAT3 has a larger effect on basal and ATP production-related mitochondrial respiration than NMNAT1-2 in primary cultured neurons, while NMNAT1-2 have a larger effect on glycolytic flux than NMNAT3. Using an oxygen glucose deprivation model, we found that mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and non-subcellular compartmental over-expressions of NAMPT have a comparable effect on neuronal protection and suppression of apoptosis-inducing factor translocation. The current study provides novel insights into the roles of subcellular compartmental NAD salvage pathways in NAD homeostasis, bioenergetics, and neuronal protection in ischemic conditions.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570007>Fluoxetine ameliorates adult hippocampal injury in rats after early maternal separation. A biochemical, histological and immunohistochemical study.</a></h1><p>The mother-infant relation is important for brain development and maturation. To investigate hippocampus changes, we used 18 male rat pups from three dams. Pups were divided into a maternal care (control) group, a maternal separation (MS) group and a MS plus fluoxetine (MS + Fl) treated group. On postnatal day 22, pups were weaned and their serum corticosterone level measured. At 2 months, the hippocampus was removed and processed for histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study. MS caused significant elevation of serum corticosterone level and a significant decrease in the thickness of the pyramidal and granular layers of the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampus. Both CA3 and DG areas exhibited degenerative changes in nerve cells, which were shrunken with pyknotic nucleus and darkly stained cytoplasm. Electron microscopy showed condensed chromatin, degenerated , cytoplasmic vacuoles and electron lucent cytoplasm with loss of most polyribosomes. Immunohistochemical staining showed significantly increased numbers of glial fibrillary  protein-positive cells in the CA3 and DG, and numbers of Ki-67stained cells in the DG in the MS group compared to the control group. All adverse changes were ameliorated in the MS + Fl group. Our findings corroborate the importance of the mother-infant relation to hippocampal development and demonstrate a protective role for Fl in MS pups.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618075>Synergistic activation of mitochondrial metabolism and the glutathione redox couple protects HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells from palmitoylcarnitine-induced stress.</a></h1><p>Fatty  stress can have divergent effects in various cancers. We explored how metabolic and redox flexibility in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells mediate protection from palmitoylcarnitine. HepG2 cells, along with HCT 116 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells were incubated with 100μM palmitoylcarnitine for up to 48hrs. Mitochondrial HO emission, glutathione and cell survival were assessed in HT29 and HepG2 cells. 100μM palmitoylcarnitine promoted early growth in HepG2 cells by ~8% after 48hrs vs decreased cell survival observed in HT29 and HCT 116 cells. Palmitoylcarnitine increased mitochondrial respiration at physiological and maximal concentrations of ADP while lowering cellular lactate content in HepG2 cells, suggesting a switch to mitochondrial metabolism. HepG2 cell growth was associated with an early increase in HO emission by 10 minutes followed by a decrease in HO at 24hrs that corresponded with increased glutathione content, suggesting a redox-based compensatory mechanism. In contrast, abrogation of HT29 cell proliferation was related to decreased mitochondrial respiration (likely due to cell death) and decreased glutathione. Concurrent glutathione depletion with BSO prevented palmitoylcarnitine-induced growth in HepG2 cells indicating that glutathione was critical for promoting growth following palmitoylcarnitine. Inhibiting UCP2 with genipin sensitized HepG2 cells to palmitoylcarnitine, suggesting that activation of UCP2 may be a 2 redox-based mechanism conferring protection. These findings suggest that HepG2 cells possess inherent metabolic and redox flexibility relative to HT29 cells that confers protection from palmitoylcarnitine-induced stress via adaptive increases in mitochondrial respiratory control, glutathione buffering and induction of UCP2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547522>Ursolic and Oleanolic  Induce Mitophagy in A549 Human Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Ursolic and oleanolic  are natural isomeric triterpenes known for their anticancer activity. Here, we investigated the effect of triterpenes on the viability of A549 human lung cancer cells and the role of autophagy in their activity. The induction of autophagy, the mitochondrial changes and signaling pathway stimulated by triterpenes were systematically explored by confocal microscopy and western blotting. Ursolic and oleanolic  induce autophagy in A549 cells. Ursolic  activates AKT/mTOR pathways and oleanolic  triggers a pathway independent on AKT. Both  promote many mitochondrial changes, suggesting that  are targets of autophagy in a process known as mitophagy. The PINK1/Parkin axis is a pathway usually associated with mitophagy, however, the mitophagy induced by ursolic or oleanolic  is just dependent on PINK1. Moreover, both  induce an ROS production. The blockage of autophagy with wortmannin is responsible for a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) and cell death. The wortmannin treatment causes an over-increase of p62 and Nrf2 proteins promote a detoxifying effect to rescue cells from the death conducted by ROS. In conclusion, the mitophagy and p62 protein play an important function as a survival mechanism in A549 cells and could be target to therapeutic control.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628462>Mitochondrial miR-181a-5p promotes glucose metabolism reprogramming in liver cancer by regulating the electron transport chain.</a></h1><p>Liver cancer and other malignant tumor cells rely on the glycolytic pathway to obtain energy (i.e., the Warburg effect); however, the underlying mechanism is unclear.  are sites of oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The 13 constituent respiratory chain proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome (namely, mtDNA) play essential roles. We found that in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, 11 of the 13 mtDNA-encoded genes exhibited decreased mRNA levels and 5 genes displayed decreased protein levels, including the cytochrome B (mt-CYB) and cytochrome C oxidase II (mt-CO2) genes. Mitochondrial gene sequencing revealed abnormalities in the levels of a large number of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs). MicroRNA-181a-5p (mir-181a-5p), which potentially targets genes encoding mt-CYB and mt-CO2 protein, was screened out from 549 downregulated mitomiRs via bioinformatic analysis. After overexpression of mitomiR-181a-5p, mt-CYB and mt-CO2 levels were reduced in HCC cells, and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) maintained by the electron transport chain (ETC) was decreased. Furthermore, the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) was upregulated, accompanied by elevated glucose, lactic  release, and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In vivo experiments confirmed that constitutive mitomiR-181a-5p expression caused reprogramming of glucose metabolism and promoted tumor growth and early lung metastasis in liver cancer. In summary, the present study reveals the important role of mitomiRs in glucose metabolism reprogramming in liver cancer, which is of considerable value in exploring new therapeutic targets for HCC.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, we propose a promising strategy for cancer treatment using modulation of oxidative stress by suppression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a typical antioxidant enzyme. siRNA which can be applied to the development of nucleic  drugs, enabling them to eliminate unwanted side effects, increase specificity, and avoid the problem of drug resistance, was employed for GSTP-silencing at the transcriptional level. The silencing of the pi class of GST (GSTP) that displayed the most characteristic expression profile in 13 kinds of cancer cell lines has shown significant impairment in the growth of cancer cells due to oxidative stress caused by excess ROS accumulation. Comparative proteomics between normal cells and GSTP-silenced pancreatic cancer cell PANC-1 suggested that GSTP-silencing facilitated the mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings show promise for the development of strategies toward cancer therapy based on the mechanism that allows genetic silencing of GSTP to promote oxidative stress through  dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533824>The potential of acetylsalicylic  and vitamin E in modulating inflammatory cascades in chickens under lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation.</a></h1><p>Distinct enzymes, including cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOXs), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450), produce different stress mediators and mediate inflammation in birds. Bioactive agents such as acetylsalicylic  (ASA) and vitamin E (vE) may affect enzyme activities and could be used in poultry production to control the magnitude of acute phase inflammation. Here, we characterized COX, LOX, and CYP450 mRNA expression levels in chicken immune tissues in response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and investigated whether ASA and vE could alter gene expression. Additionally, for the first time in chickens, we evaluated oxygen consumption by platelet  as a biomarker of  function in response to ASA- and vE. LPS challenge compromised bird growth rates, but neither dietary ASA nor vE significantly ameliorated this effect; however, gradually increasing dietary vE levels were more effective than basal levels. ASA regulated arachidonic  metabolism, providing an eicosanoid synthesis substrate, whereas gradually increasing vE levels evoked aspirin resistance during challenge. Gene expression in immune tissues was highly variable, indicating a complex regulatory network controlling inflammatory pathways. However, unlike COX-1, COX-2 and CYP450 exhibited increased mRNA expression in some cases, suggesting an initiation of novel anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals during challenge. Measuring oxygen consumption rate, we revealed that neither the ASA nor vE levels applied here exerted toxic effects on platelet .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582221>Prolonged hypoxia decreases nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and regulates the gene expression.</a></h1><p>Cells require proper regulation of energy metabolism to maintain cellular homeostasis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a metabolic enzyme that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, connecting glycolysis to the TCA cycle, thus regulating cellular energy metabolism. PDH is involved in multiple cellular processes, such as glucose metabolism, fatty  synthesis, and protein acetylation, all of which are mediated by acetyl-CoA. We previously demonstrated that PDH-E1β is downregulated in prolonged hypoxia and inhibits PDH activity, which serves as machinery to securely inhibit PDH activity together with PDH-E1α phosphorylation. PDH has been identified to localize to the nucleus in addition to , but its precise regulatory mechanisms in the nucleus remain elusive. In the present study, we characterized nuclear PDH during prolonged hypoxia. Nuclear PDH complex was downregulated under hypoxic conditions, and PDH activity was reduced. Depletion of HIF-1α partly recovered nuclear levels of the PDH complex. Furthermore, decreased nuclear PDH activity resulted in reduced histone H3 acetylation, altering the gene expression profile of cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia. Taken together, these findings indicate that nuclear PDH complex is downregulated under prolonged hypoxic conditions and controls gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study set out to determine whether early low-severity sepsis alters the cardiac mitochondrial function in animals fed a Western-type diet and whether dietary eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) administration protects the myocardium against the deleterious effects of sepsis and if so to seek possible mechanisms for its effects. Rats were divided into two groups fed either an 3 PUFA-deficient diet ("Western diet," DEF group) or an EPA-enriched diet (EPA group) for 5 weeks. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups: sham-operated rats and rats subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).  cardiac mechanical function was examined, and  were harvested to determine their functional activity. Oxidative stress was evaluated together with several factors involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolism. Sepsis had little effect on cardiac mechanical function but strongly depressed mitochondrial function in the DEF group. Conversely, dietary EPA greatly protected the  through a decreased oxidative stress of the mitochondrial matrix. The latter was probably due to an increased uncoupling protein-3 expression, already seen in the sham-operated animals. CLP rats in the EPA group also displayed increased mitochondrial sirtuin-3 protein expression that could reinforce the upholding of oxidative phosphorylation. Dietary EPA preconditioned the heart against septic damage through several modifications that protect mitochondrial integrity.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic  (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic , Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty  oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

Mtb H37Rv (Rv) infection induced mitofusin 2 (MFN2) degradation, leading to mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, Mtb H37Ra (Ra) infection induced significantly greater mitochondrial fragmentation than Rv infection. Mtb-mediated Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributed to the degradation of MFN2. To evaluate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the production of Parkin during Mtb infection, we analyzed Parkin production in 4-phenylbutyric  (4-PBA)-pretreated macrophages. Pretreatment with 4-PBA reduced Parkin production in Mtb-infected macrophages. In contrast, the level of MFN2 production recovered to a level similar to that of the unstimulated control. In addition, Ra-infected macrophages had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) compared to those infected with Rv.

In liver, genetic or acquired impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can reduce ATP output but also decrease fatty  oxidation, thus leading to different hepatic lesions including massive necrosis and microvesicular steatosis. Hence, a severe impairment of mtDNA homeostasis can lead to liver failure and death. An increasing number of investigations report that some drugs can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by altering mtDNA homeostasis. Some drugs such as ciprofloxacin, antiretroviral nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and tacrine can inhibit hepatic mtDNA replication, thus inducing mtDNA depletion. Drug-induced reduced mtDNA levels can also be the consequence of reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage to mtDNA, which triggers its degradation by mitochondrial nucleases. Such mechanism is suspected for acetaminophen and troglitazone. Other pharmaceuticals such as linezolid and tetracyclines can impair mtDNA translation, thus selectively reducing the synthesis of the 13 mtDNA-encoded proteins. Lastly, some drugs might alter the mtDNA methylation status but the pathophysiological consequences of such alteration are still unclear. Drug-induced impairment of mtDNA homeostasis is probably under-recognized since preclinical and post-marketing safety studies do not classically investigate mtDNA levels, mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtDNA oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate  function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet.  from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control  (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney  was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF  due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty  which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551124>L-cysteine functionalized straticulate CN for the selective enrichment of glycopeptides.</a></h1><p>The facile enrichment of glycopeptides or glycoproteins poses great challenges for glycoproteomic research. In this study, a novel hydrophilic material, named zwitterionic hydrophilic L-cysteine derivatized straticulate-CN composites (LCAC), were synthesized and evaluated for the enrichment of N-glycopeptides. LCAC exhibited good biocompatibility, excellent hydrophilicity and selectivity, by virtue of the large surface of CN and the zwitterionic property offered by cysteine. LCAC demonstrated excellent performance for N-glycopeptide enrichment with the sensitivity of 0.033 fmol/µL, selectivity of 1:100, and high recovery rate (∼85%). The performance of LCAC was demonstrated by the identification of 35 N-glycopeptides from IgG, as well as capturing 1809 human urine N-glycopeptides corresponding to 876 N-glycoproteins. Comparing the LCAC with our developed phenylboronic  functionalized material showed a certain complementary due to the different binding mechanism. The simple production and enhanced hydrophilic properties make the material a promising choice for glycoproteomics researches.Copyright © 2019.

Typically, immune-mediated disorders such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis are diagnosed.A small family of dogs with early onset muscle weakness and inflammatory muscle biopsies were investigated for an underlying genetic cause.Following the histopathological diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy, mutational analysis including whole genome sequencing, functional transport studies of the mutated and wild-type proteins, and metabolomic analysis were performed.Whole genome resequencing identified a pathological variant in the SLC25A12 gene, resulting in a leucine to proline substitution at amino  349 in the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter known as the neuron and muscle specific aspartate glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1). Functionally reconstituting recombinant wild-type and mutant AGC1 into liposomes demonstrated a dramatic decrease in AGC1 transport activity and inability to transfer reducing equivalents from the cytosol into . Targeted, broad-spectrum metabolomic analysis from affected and control muscles demonstrated a proinflammatory milieu and strong support for oxidative stress.This study provides the first description of a metabolic mechanism in which ablated mitochondrial glutamate transport markedly reduced the import of reducing equivalents into  and produced a highly oxidizing and proinflammatory muscle environment and an inflammatory myopathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664643>Allopregnanolone Reverses Bioenergetic Deficits in Female Triple Transgenic Alzheimer's Mouse Model.</a></h1><p>Previously, we reported that the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (Allo) promoted neural stem cell regeneration, restored cognitive function, and reduced Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology in the triple transgenic Alzheimer's mouse model (3xTgAD). To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain metabolism, we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling pathways while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty  metabolism, and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A) pathways while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625810>Mitochondrial Metabolic Reprogramming by CD36 Signaling Drives Macrophage Inflammatory Responses.</a></h1><p> A hallmark of chronic inflammatory disorders is persistence of pro-inflammatory macrophages in diseased tissues. In atherosclerosis this is associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, but mechanisms linking these phenomena to macrophage activation remain incompletely understood.  To investigate mechanisms linking dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and macrophage activation through modulation of immunemetabolism, and to explore therapeutic potential targeting specific metabolic pathways.  Using a combination of biochemical, immunological, and ex vivo cell metabolic studies, we report that CD36 mediates a mitochondrial metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to superoxide production in response to its ligand, oxLDL. Mitochondrial-specific inhibition of superoxide inhibited oxLDL-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine generation. RNAseq, flow cytometry, H-labeled palmitic  uptake, lipidomic analysis, confocal and EM imaging, and functional energetics revealed that oxLDL upregulated effectors of long-chain fatty  (FA) uptake and mitochondrial import, while downregulating FA oxidation and inhibiting ATP5A, an electron transport chain (ETC) component. The combined effect is long-chain FA accumulation, alteration of mitochondrial structure and function, repurposing of the ETC to superoxide production, and NF-κB activation. Apoe null mice challenged with high fat diet showed similar metabolic changes in circulating Ly6C monocytes and peritoneal macrophages, along with increased CD36 expression. Moreover, mitochondrial ROS was positively correlated with CD36 expression in aortic lesional macrophages.  These findings reveal that oxLDL/CD36 signaling in macrophages links dys-regulated FA metabolism to oxidative stress from the , which drives chronic inflammation. Thus, targeting to CD36 and its downstream effectors may serve as potential new strategies against chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic lipid mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte  were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

In a recent study, myoblasts were shown to be involved in the immune regulation, but the roles of muscle cells in AD are poorly understood. We aimed to identify the relationship between  and atopy by genome-wide analysis of skeletal muscles in mice. We induced AD-like symptoms using house dust mite (HDM) extract in NC/Nga mice. The transcriptional profiles of the untreated group and HDM-induced AD-like group were analyzed and compared using microarray, differentially expressed gene and functional pathway analyses, and protein interaction network construction. Our microarray analysis demonstrated that immune response-, calcium handling-, and mitochondrial metabolism-related genes were differentially expressed. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology pathway analyses, immune response pathways involved in cytokine interaction, nuclear factor-kappa B, and T-cell receptor signaling, calcium handling pathways, and  metabolism pathways involved in the citrate cycle were significantly upregulated. In protein interaction network analysis, chemokine family-, muscle contraction process-, and immune response-related genes were identified as hub genes with many interactions. In addition, mitochondrial pathways involved in calcium signaling, cardiac muscle contraction, tricarboxylic  cycle, oxidation-reduction process, and calcium-mediated signaling were significantly stimulated in KEGG and Gene Ontology analyses. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the genome-wide transcriptional changes of HDM-induced AD-like symptoms and the indicated genes that could be used as AD clinical biomarkers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563962>TSPO deficiency induces mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to hypoxia, angiogenesis and a growth-promoting metabolic shift towards glycolysis in glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>The ligands of mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) have been widely used as diagnostic biomarkers for glioma. However, the true biological actions of TSPO in vivo and its role in glioma tumourigenesis remain elusive.TSPO knockout xenograft and spontaneous mouse glioma models were employed to assess the roles of TSPO in the pathogenesis of glioma. A Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer was used to evaluate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in TSPO knockout and wild-type glioma cells.TSPO deficiency promoted glioma cell proliferation in vitro in mouse GL261 cells and patient-derived stem cell-like GBM1B cells. TSPO knockout increased glioma growth and angiogenesis in intracranial xenografts and a mouse spontaneous glioma model. Loss of TSPO resulted in a greater number of fragmented , increased glucose uptake and lactic  conversion, decreased oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis.TSPO serves as a key regulator of glioma growth and malignancy by controlling the metabolic balance between mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Beta-cells can stay in the off-mode, ready-mode or on-mode; the mode-switching being determined by the open state probability of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels, and the activity of enzymes like glucokinase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Mitochondrial metabolism is critical for insulin secretion. A sound understanding of the intermediary metabolism, electrophysiology, and cell signaling is essential for comprehension of the entire spectrum of the stimulus-secretion coupling. Depolarization brought about by inhibition of the ATP sensitive potassium channel, together with the inward depolarizing currents through the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, leads to electrical activities, opening of the voltage-gated calcium channels, and exocytosis of insulin. Calcium- and cAMP-signaling elicited by depolarization, and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, including the free fatty  receptors, are intricately connected in the form of networks at different levels. Activation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor augments insulin secretion by amplifying calcium signals by calcium induced calcium release (CICR). In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, use of the sulfonylureas that act on the ATP sensitive potassium channel, damages the beta cells, which eventually fail; these drugs do not improve the cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, drugs acting through the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor protect the beta-cells, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. The use of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists is increasing and that of sulfonylurea is decreasing. A better understanding of the stimulus-secretion coupling may lead to the discovery of other molecular targets for development of drugs for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619044>Betulin attenuated liver damage by prevention of hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in rats with alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Betulin, a pentacyclic triterpene, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of liver  in hepatoprotection of betulin using a rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis induced by ethanol administration (4 g/kg, intragastric) for 8 weeks. The treatment with betulin (50 and 100 mg/kg b.w., intragastric) during this period attenuated the histological signs of steatohepatitis and lowered the serum and liver triglyceride contents, as well as the serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Betulin (100 mg/kg) decreased the liver/body weight ratio and inhibited the increase in the serum levels of TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ, and hyaluronic , demonstrating hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic potential. Betulin also inhibited the formation of superoxide anions in  and the end-products of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue, the amount of which was significantly increased in ethanol-treated rats. The disturbances in mitochondrial respiration, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and decreasing of mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activities in rats with steatohepatitis, were reverted by betulin administration. The increased susceptibility of  to Ca-induced permeability transition pore formation in the hepatitis group was improved in rats treated with betulin. In conclusion, betulin, having antioxidant properties, exerts a beneficial effect in the rat model of alcoholic steatohepatitis via prevention of liver  dysfunction, which may be attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629811>Characterization of PHB in the gonadal development of the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus.</a></h1><p>Prohibitin (PHB) is an evolutionarily conserved multifunctional protein with ubiquitous expression. In this study, we cloned the PHB gene from the testis of the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus (PtPHB) and analyzed the deduced amino  sequence. The expression level of phb mRNA in larvae was analyzed using qRT-PCR. The expression level of phb mRNA and PHB protein in different tissues were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses of the PHB protein were conducted with the testis and ovaries from P. trituberculatus specimens at different developmental stages. PHB was localized with  and ubiquitin in the testis and ovaries. The PtPHB gene was found to contain an open reading frame of 825 bp, encoding a predicted peptide with 275 amino , sharing between 65.9% and 96.7% similarity with that of other species. The qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that the phb gene and PHB protein both expressed less in the testis and ovary than in other tissues, and the phb gene presented the lowest expression in the Z1 stage. Furthermore, the phb gene and PHB protein expression were different in the testis and ovaries at different developmental stages. PHB was mainly found to be co-localized with  and ubiquitin in cytoplasm and acrosome complex during spermatogenesis and in follicular cells during oogenesis. Interestingly, PHB- signals and ubiquitin signal were also found in oocytes. These results indicated that PHB might play important roles during spermatogenesis and oogenesis by regulating mitochondrial activities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Its expression was previously shown to be modulated by nutritional or immune cues, but nothing is known about its impact on the lipid landscape and ensuing functional consequences. In the present work, we used mutants lacking LIPL-5 protein and found that lipl-5 is important for normal lipidome composition as well as its remodeling in response to food deprivation. Particularly, lipids with signaling functions such as ceramides and mitochondrial lipids were affected by lipl-5 silencing. In comparison with wild type worms, animals lacking LIPL-5 were enriched in cardiolipins linked to polyunsaturated C20 fatty  and coenzyme Q-9. Differences in mitochondrial lipid composition were accompanied by differences in mitochondrial activity as  from well-fed lipl-5 mutants were significantly more able to oxidize respiratory substrates when compared with  from well-fed wild type worms. Strikingly, starvation elicited important changes in mitochondrial activity in wild type worms, but not in lipl-5 worms. This indicates that this lipase is a determinant of mitochondrial functional remodeling in response to food withdrawal.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which particulate matter 2.5 (PM) induces damage in human HaCaT keratinocytes and normal human dermal fibroblasts, and to evaluate the preventive capacity of the ginsenoside Rb1. PM induced oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation; this effect was inhibited by ginsenoside Rb1. Through gene silencing of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as , , , and , and through the use of the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), it was demonstrated that PM-induced ER stress also causes apoptosis and ultimately leads to cell death; however, this phenomenon was reversed by ginsenoside Rb1. We also found that TUDCA partially restored the production of ATP that was inhibited by PM, and its recovery ability was significantly higher than that of ginsenoside Rb1, indicating that the process of ER stress leading to cell damage may also occur via the mitochondrial pathway. We concluded that ER stress acts alone or via the mitochondrial pathway in the induction of cell damage by PM, and that ginsenoside Rb1 blocks this process. Ginsenoside Rb1 shows potential for use in skin care products to protect the skin against damage by fine particles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542563>Bax expression is optimal at low oxygen tension and constant agitation.</a></h1><p>Bax is a pro-apoptosis protein that translocates from the cytosol to the  membrane upon initiation of programed cell death. Bax subsequently disrupts the  membrane, resulting in the release of cytochrome C which activates the downstream caspases. The structure of inactive Bax has been solved, but despite intensive investigation, the mechanism by which it regulates apoptosis is not established. The low yield of Bax expression in E. coli hampers efforts to elucidate the mechanism. Thus, we undertook a systematic study aimed at improving the yield of Bax. Bacteria were grown in a computer-controlled fermenter and expression was induced by addition of Isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The Bax expression level decreased continuously when the dissolved oxygen level was kept at 30%, which is non-limiting for E. coli. Alternatively, when oxygen input was decreased with constant agitation and air flow (or ka), Bax yield increased by a factor of three. To make sure the short chain fatty  generated during micro-aerobic fermentation had no adverse effect, their concentrations were closely monitored with HPLC and their effect on cell growth and Bax expression were investigated additionally using shake flasks. Through proteomic analysis using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling, we identified degradation pathway within E. coli cells as a potential player behind the lower expression level.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520523>Impact of statins on cellular respiration and de-differentiation of myofibroblasts in human failing hearts.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast to myofibroblast trans-differentiation with altered bioenergetics precedes cardiac fibrosis (CF). Either prevention of differentiation or promotion of de-differentiation could mitigate CF-related pathologies. We determined whether 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors-statins, commonly prescribed to patients at risk of heart failure (HF)-can de-differentiate myofibroblasts, alter cellular bioenergetics, and impact the human ventricular fibroblasts (hVFs) in HF patients.Either in vitro statin treatment of differentiated myofibroblasts (n = 3-6) or hVFs, isolated from human HF patients under statin therapy (HF + statin) vs. without statins (HF) were randomly used (n = 4-12). In vitro, hVFs were differentiated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) for 72 h (TGF-72 h). Differentiation status and cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were determined by α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and Seahorse assay, respectively. Data are mean ± SEM except Seahorse (mean ± SD); P < 0.05, considered significant. In vitro, statins concentration-dependently de-differentiated the myofibroblasts. The respective half-maximal effective concentrations were 729 ± 13 nmol/L (atorvastatin), 3.6 ± 1 μmol/L (rosuvastatin), and 185 ± 13 nmol/L (simvastatin). Mevalonic  (300 μmol/L), the reduced product of HMG-CoA, prevented the statin-induced de-differentiation (α-SMA expression: 31.4 ± 10% vs. 58.6 ± 12%). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP, 20 μmol/L), a cholesterol synthesis-independent HMG-CoA reductase pathway intermediate, completely prevented the statin-induced de-differentiation (α-SMA/GAPDH ratios: 0.89 ± 0.05 [TGF-72 h + 72 h], 0.63 ± 0.02 [TGF-72 h + simvastatin], and 1.2 ± 0.08 [TGF-72 h + simvastatin + GGPP]). Cellular metabolism involvement was observed when co-incubation of simvastatin (200 nmol/L) with glibenclamide (10 μmol/L), a K channel inhibitor, attenuated the simvastatin-induced de-differentiation (0.84 ± 0.05). Direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by oligomycin (1 ng/mL) also produced a de-differentiation effect (0.33 ± 0.02). OCR (pmol O /min/μg protein) was significantly decreased in the simvastatin-treated hVFs, including basal (P = 0.002), ATP-linked (P = 0.01), proton leak-linked (P = 0.01), and maximal (P < 0.001). The OCR inhibition was prevented by GGPP (basal OCR [P = 0.02], spare capacity OCR [P = 0.008], and maximal OCR [P = 0.003]). Congruently, hVFs from HF showed an increased population of myofibroblasts while HF + statin group showed significantly reduced cellular respiration (basal OCR [P = 0.021], ATP-linked OCR [P = 0.047], maximal OCR [P = 0.02], and spare capacity OCR [P = 0.025]) and myofibroblast differentiation (α-SMA/GAPDH: 1 ± 0.19 vs. 0.23 ± 0.06, P = 0.01).This study demonstrates the de-differentiating effect of statins, the underlying GGPP sensitivity, reduced OCR with potential activation of K channels, and their impact on the differentiation magnitude of hVFs in HF patients. This novel pleiotropic effect of statins may be exploited to reduce excessive CF in patients at risk of HF.© 2019 The Authors.

It is generated through multiple mechanisms at various intracellular sites. Due to its chemical stability it can reach distant sites of action. However, its hydrophilicity can hamper lipid membrane passage. We therefore studied the kinetics of HO diffusion through subcellular membranes employing the HO biosensor HyPer in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. Plasma- and ER-membrane-bound HyPer sensors facing the cytosolic compartment reacted twice as fast to HO compared to sensors expressed in peroxisomes and . Overexpression of the HO-inactivating enzyme catalase in the ER-lumen and in the peroxisomes retarded the reaction time of HyPer, both localised within the peroxisomes as well as at the cytosolic surface of the ER. The unsaturated fatty  oleic  did not affect the reaction of the peroxisomal HyPer sensor to HO, while the saturated fatty  palmitic  accelerated its reaction time to HO in this organelle. The results show that the plasma-, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial membrane of insulin-producing RINm5F cells are permeable for HO. Nonetheless, the organelle membranes retard HO diffusion due to a barrier function of the lipid membrane, as documented by retarded reaction times of the intraorganellar sensors. Accelerated decomposition of HO by catalase, expressed in the peroxisomes or the ER, further retarded the HyPer sensor reaction time. The results show that redox signalling and oxidative stress mediated toxicity are crucially dependent on physicochemical membrane properties and antioxidative defence mechanisms in health and disease.Copyright © 2019.

Due to the little exchange of seawater and to anoxic conditions, S. constricta is exposed to considerable amounts of sulfide during low tide, but exhibits strong sulfide tolerance. Mitochondrial sulfide oxidation is a particular defense strategy against sulfide toxicity of sulfide-tolerant organisms, for which sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) is the first key enzyme. In order to investigate the mechanism of sulfide tolerance in S. constricta, its SQR (designated as ScSQR), was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA of ScSQR was 3698 bp and encoded 443 amino . The deduced ScSQR protein contained conserved FAD-binding domains, two cysteine residues, two histidines, and one glutamic , which are the essential elements for the catalytic mechanism of SQR. Subcellular localization analysis by the TargetP 1.1 prediction and the Western blot confirmed that ScSQR was only located in the . The response of ScSQR in the gill and liver of S. constricta were investigated during sulfide exposure (50, 150, and 300 μM sulfide) for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the time-course expressions of ScSQR protein in the S. constricta gill were detected when exposed to 150 μM sulfide by Western blot. The expression level of ScSQR increased significantly and showed a time-dependent pattern. In addition, under sulfide stress, the expression level of the gill was higher than that of liver. Together, our results suggest that ScSQR may perform important roles in protecting cells from sulfide stress by participating in mitochondrial sulfide detoxification and providing high sulfide tolerance to S. constricta.Copyright © 2019.

Using C-labeled choline and C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and western blotting, we show increased  choline phospholipid (ChoPL) production and activation of PCYT1A (phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1, choline, alpha), the rate-limiting enzyme of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis, during autophagy. We also discovered that the loss of PCYT1A activity results in compromised autophagosome formation and maintenance in autophagic cells. Direct tracing of ChoPLs with fluorescence and immunogold labeling imaging revealed the incorporation of newly synthesized ChoPLs into autophagosomal membranes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  during anticancer drug-induced autophagy. Significant increase in the colocalization of fluorescence signals from the newly synthesized ChoPLs and mCherry-MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) was also found on autophagosomes accumulating in cells treated with autophagy-modulating compounds. Interestingly, cells undergoing active autophagy had an altered ChoPL profile, with longer and more unsaturated fatty /alcohol chains detected. Our data suggest that  synthesis may be required to increase autophagosomal ChoPL content and alter its composition, together with replacing phospholipids consumed from other organelles during autophagosome formation and turnover.

In the present study, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were fed with fenofibrate, an agonist of PPARα, for six weeks, and subsequently challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila. The results showed that PPARα was efficiently activated by fenofibrate through increasing mRNA and protein expressions and protein dephosphorylation. PPARα activation increased significantly mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation efficiency, the copy number of mitochondrial DNA and expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO), a marker gene of . Meanwhile, PPARα activation also increased significantly the expression of NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1α subcomplex subunit 9 (NDUFA9, complex I) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (MTCO1, complex IV). The fenofibrate-fed fish had higher survival rate when exposed to A. hydrophila. Moreover, the fenofibrate-fed fish also had higher activities of immune and antioxidative enzymes, and gene expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines, while had lower expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Taken together, PPARα activation improved the ability of Nile tilapia to resist A. hydrophila, mainly through enhancing mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, immune and antioxidant capacities, as well as inhibiting inflammation. This is the first study showing the regulatory effects of PPARα activation on immune functions through increasing -mediated energy supply in fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cold stress led to significant increases in lipase activity, which is responsible for the breakdown of triacylglycerols, and carnitine acyltransferase (carnitine acyltransferase I and II) activities, which are responsible for the transport of activated long-chain fatty  into . While exogenous application of carnitine has a similar promoting effect with cold stress on lipase activity, it resulted in further increases in the activity of carnitine acyltransferases compared to cold stress. The highest activity levels for these enzymes were recorded in the seedlings treated with cold plus carnitine. In addition, these increases were correlated with positive increases in the contents of free- and long-chain acylcarnitines (decanoyl-l-carnitine, lauroyl-l-carnitine, myristoyl-l-carnitine, and stearoyl-l-carnitine), and with decreases in the total lipid content. The highest values for free- and long-chain acylcarnitines and the lowest value for total lipid content were recorded in the seedlings treated with cold plus carnitine. On the other hand, carnitine with and without cold stress significantly upregulated the expression level of citrate synthase, which is responsible for catalysing the first reaction of the citric  cycle, and cytochrome oxidase, which is the membrane-bound terminal enzyme in the electron transfer chain, as well as lipase. All these results revealed that on the one hand, carnitine enhanced transport of fatty  into  by increasing the activities of lipase and carnitine acyltransferases, and, on the other hand, stimulated mitochondrial respiration in the leaves of maize seedlings grown under normal and cold conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains challenging to study the regulation of lipid droplets in live preadipocytes using conventional microscopic techniques. In this paper, we study the effects of fatty  stimulation and cell starvation on lipid droplets using optical diffraction tomography and Raman spectroscopy by measuring size, refractive index, volume, dry mass and degree of unsaturation. The increase of fatty  causes an increase in the number and dry mass of lipid droplets. During starvation, the number of lipid droplets increases drastically, which are released to  to release energy. Studying lipid droplets under different chemical stimulations could help us understand the regulation of lipid droplets for metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672622>A Two-Step Precise Targeting Nanoplatform for Tumor Therapy via the Alkyl Radicals Activated by the Microenvironment of Organelles.</a></h1><p>With the in-depth research of organelles, the microenvironment characteristics of their own, such as the  environment of lysosomes and the high temperature environment of , could be used as a natural and powerful condition for tumor therapy. Based on this, we constructed a two-step precise targeting nanoplatform which can realize the drug release and drug action triggered by the microenvironment of lysosomes (endosomes) and , respectively. To begin with, the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were modified with triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and loaded with 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH). Then, folic  (FA) targeted pH-sensitive liposomes containing docetaxel (Lipo/DTX-FA) were prepared by thin-film dispersion method, and the core-shell AIPH/MSN-TPP@Lipo/DTX-FA nanoparticles were constructed by self-assembly during the hydration of the liposomes. When this nanoplatform entered into the tumor cells through FA receptor-mediated endocytosis, the pH-sensitive liposomes were destabilized in the lysosomes, resulting in the release of DTX and AIPH/MSN-TPP nanoparticles. After that, AIPH was delivered to  by AIPH/MSN-TPP, and the alkyl radicals produced by AIPH under the high temperature environment can cause oxidative damage to . Not only that, the DTX could enhance the anti-tumor effect of AIPH by downregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that this delivery system could induce apoptosis based on organelles' s own microenvironment, which provides a new approach for tumor therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Increasing risk of neurodegenerative disorders creates a socioeconomic burden to both patients and care givers.  are organelle that are involved in both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. There are few reports on the effect of mitochondrial metabolism on the progress of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Therefore, the present review summarizes the potential contribution of mitochondrial metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, there its potential contribution in other neurodegenerative disorders is as yet unproven. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier and pyruvate dehydrogenase can modulate mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism to attenuate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Further, it has been observed that the mitochondrial citric  cycle can regulate the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Additional research should be undertaken to target tricarboxylic  cycle enzymes to minimize the progress of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. It has also been observed that the mitochondrial urea cycle can potentially contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, targeting this pathway may control the mitochondrial dysfunction-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the mitochondrial malate-aspartate shuttle could be another target to control mitochondrial dysfunction-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676684>Multiple mitochondrial thioesterases have distinct tissue and substrate specificity, and CoA regulation, suggesting unique functional roles.</a></h1><p>Acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoA esters. Acots in the mitochondrial matrix are poised to mitigate β-oxidation overload and maintain CoA availability. Several Acots associate with , but whether they all localize to the matrix, are redundant, or have different roles is unresolved. Here, we compared the suborganellar localization, activity, expression, and regulation among mitochondrial Acots (Acot2, 7, 9, and 13) in  from multiple mouse tissues and from a model of Acot2 depletion. Acot7, 9, and 13 localized to the matrix, joining Acot2 that was previously shown to localize there.  from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney robustly expressed Acot2, 9, and 13; Acot9 levels were substantially higher in brown adipose tissue and kidney , as was activity for C4:0-CoA, a unique Acot9 substrate. In all tissues, Acot2 accounted for about half of the thioesterase activity for C14:0-CoA and C16:0-CoA. In contrast, liver  from fed and fasted mice expressed little Acot activity, which was confined to long-chain CoAs and due mainly to Acot7 and Acot13 activities. Matrix Acots occupied different functional niches, based on substrate specificity (Acot9 vs. Acot2 and 13) and strong CoA inhibition (Acot7, 9, and 13, but not Acot2). Interpreted in the context of β-oxidation, CoA inhibition would prevent Acot-mediated suppression of β-oxidation, while providing a release valve when CoA is limiting. In contrast, CoA-insensitive Acot2 could provide a constitutive syphon for long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. These results reveal how the family of matrix Acots can mitigate β-oxidation overload and prevent CoA limitation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467862>Induction of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in A549 lung cancer cells using silver nanoparticles from  and evaluation of  toxicity.</a></h1><p>In the past decade, the research communities raised wide concerns on using medicinal plants for synthesis of nanomaterials due to its effective biological activity, lower side effects and also eco-friendly manner. Our previous report concentrated on the biomedical efficacy of fine characterized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from  (cotton) leaf extract. Further, the current examination is planned to reveal the molecular mechanisms involving for activation of -mediated signaling pathway by AgNPs in human lung cancer cells (A549) using various biological endpoints such as apoptotic induction by HOECHST 33342, AO/EtBr and Rhodamine 123 staining, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry, gene and protein expressions by RT-PCR and immunoblotting respectively. This study was further extended to identify the toxicity of AgNPs using an animal model. Interestingly, we observed that A549 cells treated with AgNPs resulted in G/M arrest and ultimately leads to induction of apoptosis cell death. Moreover, gene analysis demonstrated that diminished expression of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic (Bax) mitochondrial genes. The alterations in the gene pattern may interrupt of mitochondrial membrane potential which facilitates the releasing of cytochrome c (cyt c) into cytosol. The cyt c act as a key molecule for activation of caspases (9 and 3) to initiate intrinsic apoptotic signaling cell death process. The histological analysis proven the application of AgNPs in nanomedicine is quietly harmless and would not cause any discernible stress like swelling and inflammation to the organs of mice. Taken together, this investigation may provide solid evidence for cotton crop mediated AgNPs induced apoptosis cell death pathway and offer a novel approach for cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575916>VDAC1 is essential for neurite maintenance and the inhibition of its oligomerization protects spinal cord from demyelination and facilitates locomotor function recovery after spinal cord injury.</a></h1><p>During the progression of the neurodegenerative process,  participates in several intercellular signaling pathways. Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1) is a mitochondrial porin involved in the cellular metabolism and apoptosis intrinsic pathway in many neuropathological processes. In spinal cord injury (SCI), after the primary cell death, a secondary response that comprises the release of pro-inflammatory molecules triggers apoptosis, inflammation, and demyelination, often leading to the loss of motor functions. Here, we investigated the functional role of VDAC1 in the neurodegeneration triggered by SCI. We first determined that in vitro targeted ablation of VDAC1 by specific morpholino antisense nucleotides (MOs) clearly promotes neurite retraction, whereas a pharmacological blocker of VDAC1 oligomerization (4, 4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic , DIDS), does not cause this effect. We next determined that, after SCI, VDAC1 undergoes conformational changes, including oligomerization and N-terminal exposition, which are important steps in the triggering of apoptotic signaling. Considering this, we investigated the effects of DIDS in vivo application after SCI. Interestingly, blockade of VDAC1 oligomerization decreases the number of apoptotic cells without interfering in the neuroinflammatory response. DIDS attenuates the massive oligodendrocyte cell death, subserving undisputable motor function recovery. Taken together, our results suggest that the prevention of VDAC1 oligomerization might be beneficial for the clinical treatment of SCI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639226>A new insight into the mechanism for cytosolic lipid droplet degradation in senescent leaves.</a></h1><p>Leaf senescence involves lipid droplet degradation that produces toxic fatty , but little is known about how the toxic metabolites are isolated from the rest of the cellular components. Our ultramicroscopic characterization of cytosolic lipid droplet degradation in central vacuole-absent cells and central vacuole-containing cells of senescent watermelon leaves demonstrated two degradation pathways: the small vacuole-associated pathway and the central vacuole-associated pathway. This provided an insight into the subcellular mechanisms for the isolation of the fatty  derived from lipid droplets. The central vacuole-containing cells, including mesophyll cells and vascular parenchyma cells, adopted the central vacuole-associated pathway, indicated by the presence of lipid droplets in the central vacuole, which is believed to play a crucial role in scavenging toxic metabolites. The central vacuole-absent intermediary cells, where senescence caused the occurrence of numerous small vacuoles, adopted the small vacuole-associated pathway, evidenced by the occurrence of lipid droplets in the small vacuoles. The assembly of organelles, including lipid droplets, small vacuoles, , and peroxisome-like organelles, occurred in the central vacuole-absent intermediary cell in response to leaf senescence.

In this study, H9c2 cells a type of rat cardiac myoblasts, were used as model cardiac muscle cells. The use of a lipid composition used to prepare the β-MEND (where MEND denotes multifunctional envelope-type nano device) permitted the particles to be efficiently internalized by H9c2 cells, as evidenced by flow cytometry analyses. Intracellular observations by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the β-MEND efficiently accumulated in  of H9c2 cells. We also constructed an RP/β-MEND that contained a mitochondrial RNA aptamer to achieve mitochondrial delivery in H9c2 cells.

Owing to lethality of PPR mutants, functions of many PPR proteins remain obscure. Here, we report the function of PPR20 in intron splicing in  and its role in maize seed development. PPR20 is a P-type PPR protein targeted to . The ppr20 mutants display slow embryo and endosperm development. Null mutation of PPR20 severely reduces the cis-splicing of mitochondrial nad2 intron 3, resulting in reduction in the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I. The ppr20-35 allele with a Mu insertion in the N-terminal region shows a much weaker phenotype. Molecular analyses revealed that the mutant produces a truncated transcript, coding for PPR20ΔN120 lacking the N-terminal 120 amino . Subcellular localization revealed that PPR20ΔN120: GFP is able to target to  as well, suggesting the sequence diversity of the mitochondrial targeting peptides. Another mutant zm_mterf15 was also found to be impaired in the splicing of mitochondrial nad2 intron 3. Further analyses are required to identify the exact function of PPR20 and Zm_mTERF15 in the splicing of nad2 intron 3.© The Author(s) 2019.

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats received 20% fructose in drinking water (10 treated with allopurinol and 10 received vehicle) and 10 control rats received tap water. After 14 days, the hepatic response to an acute fructose load was evaluated, and in fasted animals, respirometry studies in freshly isolated  were performed. In fasting rats, we did not find differences in systemic or hepatic uric  and triglyceride concentrations among the groups, but mitochondrial respiratory control rate was significantly decreased by high fructose feeding and correlated with a reduced expression of Complex I, as well as decreased aconitase-2 activity. On the other hand, in fructose fed rats, an acute fructose load increased systemic and hepatic uric , triglycerides and oxidative stress. Fructose feeding was also associated with fructokinase and xanthine oxidase overexpression and increased liver de novo lipogenesis program (fatty  synthase (FAS) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) overexpression, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) overactivity and decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation). Allopurinol treatment prevented hepatic and systemic alterations.

The prevention at high concentrations is evidenced by the significant inhibition of mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca and phosphate; in this condition, AGM both prevents the release of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) and enhances the release of other pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO. As these factors are released without MPT induction, the involvement of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) could be hypothesized. Cyclosporin A (CsA), a powerful inhibitor of MPT, enhanced the AGM-mediated inhibition of swelling, and surprisingly, prevented the release of cyt c and Smac/DIABLO. In the presence of Ca, AGM also activated the Bcl-2 family protein Bax, a key factor in inducing MOMP, which is inactivated by CsA. Together with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Bax forms channels in the outer membrane further supporting the involvement of MOMP in the release of pro-apoptotic factors. In view of the fact that VDAC was inactivated by ruthenium red, which in turn inhibited the release of cyt c, it can be hypothesized that, on the one hand, AGM inhibits MPT induction and, on the other, it selectively permeabilizes the outer membrane via MOMP induction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502197>Prokaryotic and Mitochondrial Lipids: A Survey of Evolutionary Origins.</a></h1><p> and bacteria share a myriad of properties since it is believed that the powerhouses of the eukaryotic cell have evolved from a prokaryotic origin.

Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric  (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on energy homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. The findings provide novel insights into the impact of this neglected foodborne mycotoxin in the dysregulation of energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

By examining the strongest signals from the attention layer in the network, we find that the second residue in the protein, that is, the one following the initial methionine, has a strong influence on the classification. We observe that two-thirds of chloroplast and thylakoid transit peptides have an alanine in position 2, compared with 20% in other plant proteins.

Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving lipid metabolism, antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of NASH. The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved lipid homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As,  are intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and important sites of lipid metabolism, we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in palmitic  (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti-NASH potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It's unknown whether long-term consumption of maleic -modified starch is harmful to the human. However, many studies have indicated that maleic  causes renal tubular damage in animal models, even as the associated pathways remain unclear. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) is the most innovative of the label-free quantitative technologies, which have better quantification performance. Therefore, SWATH technology was used to investigate the effect of maleic  on rat kidney proteome in this study.SD rats were treated with 0 mg/kg (control), 6 mg/kg (low-dose), 10 mg/kg (medium-dose) and 60 mg/kg (high-dose) of maleic . After kidney protein extraction, 28% SDS-PAGE was used, followed by in-gel digestion and desalting. Next, the samples were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with Q-TOF MS, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH technology were also used. The gene ontology and pathway analysis were accomplished. Ultimately, these protein biomarkers were validated by using scheduled high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM ).Comparisons of the control group with the other three groups revealed that 95, 130, and 103 proteins were expressed at significantly different levels from in the control group in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. According to the gene ontology analysis, the major processes that these proteins were involved in were metabolic processes, biological regulation, cellular processes, and responses to stimuli; the major functions these proteins were involved in were binding, hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and oxidoreductase activity; and the major cellular components they were involved in were the cytoplasm, extracellular region, membrane, and . According to the KEGG pathway analysis, these proteins were involved in 35 pathways, 5 of which, including the carbohydrate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, renal tubular resorption, amino  metabolism, and Ras signaling pathways, are discussed in this study. Ultimately, 19 proteins involved in 12 important pathways were validated by sMRM .It was demonstrated that maleic  caused insufficient energy production, which might lead to a decrease in the activity of the sodium-potassium ATP pump and hydrogen ion ATP pump, which could have in turn caused renal tubular resorption and hydrogen ion regulation to be blocked, thus leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules, which would then result in renal tubular acidification followed finally by Fanconi syndrome.This article is protected by copyright.

Although tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA-adding enzyme) is known to add CCA trinucleotides to 3'-ends of tRNAs, whether other RNA species can be endogenous substrates of CCA-adding enzyme has not been widely explored yet. Herein, we used YAMAT-seq to identify non-tRNA substrates of CCA-adding enzyme. YAMAT-seq captures RNA species that form secondary structures with 4-nt protruding 3'-ends of the sequence 5'-NCCA-3', which is the hallmark structure of RNAs that are generated by CCA-adding enzyme. By executing YAMAT-seq for human breast cancer cells and mining the sequence data, we identified novel candidate substrates of CCA-adding enzyme. These included fourteen 'CCA-RNAs' that only contain CCA as non-genomic sequences, and eleven 'NCCA-RNAs' that contain CCA and other nucleotides as non-genomic sequences. All newly-identified (N)CCA-RNAs were derived from the mitochondrial genome and were localized in . Knockdown of CCA-adding enzyme severely reduced the expression levels of (N)CCA-RNAs, suggesting that the CCA-adding enzyme-catalyzed CCA additions stabilize the expression of (N)CCA-RNAs. Furthermore, expression levels of (N)CCA-RNAs were severely reduced by various cellular treatments, including UV irradiation, amino  starvation, inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, and inhibition of the cell cycle. These results revealed a novel CCA-mediated regulatory pathway for the expression of mitochondrial non-coding RNAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575732>LGP2 binds to PACT to regulate RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated antiviral responses.</a></h1><p>The retinoic -inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 stimulate inflammatory and antiviral responses by sensing nonself RNA molecules produced during viral replication. Here, we investigated how LGP2 regulates the RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent induction of type I interferon (IFN) signaling and showed that LGP2 interacted with different components of the RNA-silencing machinery. We identified a direct protein-protein interaction between LGP2 and the IFN-inducible, double-stranded RNA binding protein PACT. The LGP2-PACT interaction was mediated by the regulatory C-terminal domain of LGP2 and was necessary for inhibiting RIG-I-dependent responses and for amplifying MDA5-dependent responses. We described a point mutation within LGP2 that disrupted the LGP2-PACT interaction and led to the loss of LGP2-mediated regulation of RIG-I and MDA5 signaling. These results suggest a model in which the LGP2-PACT interaction regulates the inflammatory responses mediated by RIG-I and MDA5 and enables the cellular RNA-silencing machinery to coordinate with the innate immune response.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive metabolic plasticity, TIC metabolism is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with metabolic features, with some focus on oxidative metabolism, including fatty  and lipid metabolism. These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their metabolism will require advanced methodologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610847>Metabolic stress is a primary pathogenic event in transgenic  expressing pan-neuronal human amyloid beta.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly worldwide. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a key event in the etiology of AD. We have previously modeled amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in a transgenic  strain by expressing human Aβ peptide specifically in neurons (GRU102). Here, we focus on the deeper metabolic changes associated with this Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Integrating metabolomics, transcriptomics and computational modeling, we identify alterations in Tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle metabolism following even low-level Aβ expression. In particular, GRU102 showed reduced activity of a rate-limiting TCA cycle enzyme, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These defects were associated with elevation of protein carbonyl content specifically in . Importantly, metabolic failure occurred before any significant increase in global protein aggregate was detectable. Treatment with an anti-diabetes drug, Metformin, reversed Aβ-induced metabolic defects, reduced protein aggregation and normalized lifespan of GRU102. Our results point to metabolic dysfunction as an early and causative event in Aβ-induced pathology and a promising target for intervention.© 2019, Teo et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483701>The fatty  derivative palmitoylcarnitine abrogates colorectal cancer cell survival by depleting glutathione.</a></h1><p>Previous evidence suggests that palmitoylcarnitine incubations trigger mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, yet non-transformed cells appear resistant. The mechanism by which palmitoylcarnitine induces cancer cell death is unclear. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between mitochondrial kinetics and glutathione buffering in determining the effect of palmitoylcarnitine on cell survival. HT29 and HCT 116 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, CCD 841 non-transformed colon cells and MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to 0μM, 50μM and 100μM palmitoylcarnitine for 24-48 hours. HCT 116 and HT29 cells showed decreased cell survival following palmitoylcarnitine compared to CCD 841 cells. Palmitoylcarnitine stimulated HO emission in HT29 and CCD 841 cells but increased it to a greater level in HT29 cells due largely to a higher basal HO emission. This greater HO emission was associated with lower glutathione buffering capacity and caspase-3 activation in HT29 cells. The glutathione depleting agent, buthionine sulfoximine, sensitized CCD 841 cells and further sensitized HT29 cells to palmitoylcarnitine-induced decreases in cell survival. MCF7 cells did not produce HO when exposed to palmitoylcarnitine and were able to maintain glutathione levels. Furthermore, HT29 cells demonstrated the lowest mitochondrial oxidative kinetics vs CCD 841 and MCF7 cells. The results demonstrate that colorectal cancer is sensitive to palmitoylcarnitine due in part to an inability to prevent oxidative stress through glutathione-redox coupling thereby rendering the cells sensitive to elevations in HO. These findings suggest that the relationship between inherent metabolic capacities and redox regulation is altered early in response to palmitoylcarnitine.</p></html>
