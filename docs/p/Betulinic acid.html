It is used traditionally for several pharmacological purposes including anti-, antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial, as well as tonic and sometimes as hypnotic (sedative).To determine the in vivo antidiarrhoeal, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of  fruit ethanolic extract.The fruit was macerated and extracted by 95% (v/v) ethanol. The antidiarrhoeal activity was evaluated using castor oil and  induced diarrhoea mouse model. The antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activity was investigated at graded doses (400-1200 mg/kg). The anti-inflammatory effects were tested using the carrageenan-induced paw oedema in female Wistar rats. Rat's treatment groups received tragacanth, 100 mg/kg diclofenac sodium, 800 mg/kg, 1200 mg/kg or 1600 mg/kg of an ethanolic extract of  (EEZJ). All treatment groups were fed with the compounds one hour before carrageenan injection at of rat's paw. Also, the EEZJ was further analysed by HPLC-PDA system for identification of the presence of  and quercetin.EEZJ different doses did not show inhibitory activity against castor oil induced diarrhoea except for the higher (1200 mg/kg) dose. However, the frequency of defecation of stools and watery stool were reduced significantly when compared to control group (P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.01 respectively), resulted in overall 67% inhibition of diarrhoea. Our anti-inflammatory results demonstrated that EEZJ was able to inhibit the carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats to a significant degree (p ≤ 0.05) and the paw volume and thickness of both left and right paw were affected compared to the negative control group.EEZJ possesses antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activity in a dose depending manner and may provide a pharmacological basis for its clinical use in diarrheal diseases. The activity may partially be due to the presence of  and quercetin.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28720829> is a PPARγ antagonist that improves glucose uptake, promotes osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis.</a></h2><p>PPAR antagonists are ligands that bind their receptor with high affinity without transactivation activity. Recently, they have been demonstrated to maintain insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic properties, and they serve as an alternative treatment for metabolic diseases. In this work, an affinity-based bioassay was found to be effective for selecting PPAR ligands from the dried extract of an African plant (Diospyros bipindensis). Among the ligands, we identified  (BA), a compound already known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour and antidiabetic properties, as a PPARγ and PPARα antagonist. Cell differentiation assays showed that BA inhibits adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis; either down-regulates or does not affect the expression of a series of adipogenic markers; and up-regulates the expression of osteogenic markers. Moreover, BA increases basal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The crystal structure of the complex of BA with PPARγ sheds light, at the molecular level, on the mechanism by which BA antagonizes PPARγ, and indicates a unique binding mode of this antagonist type. The results of this study show that the natural compound BA could be an interesting and safe candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and bone diseases.</p><p>Keyword:['diabetes', 'lipogenesis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28208611>-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Involves p53 and Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) .</a></h2><p>Defects in p53 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling  are frequently observed in the initiation and development of various human malignancies, including prostate cancer. Clinical studies demonstrate higher expression of NF-κB/p65/RelA, NF-κB/p50/RelB, and cRel as well as downregulation of the p53 network in primary prostate cancer specimens and in metastatic tumors.  (BA), is a triterpenoid that has been reported to be an effective inducer of apoptosis through modification of several signaling . Our objective was to investigate the  involved in BA-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. We employed the androgen-responsive LNCaP cells harboring wild-type p53, and androgen-refractory DU145 cells possessing mutated p53 with high constitutive NF-κB activity. Inhibition of cell survival by BA at 10 and 20 µM concentrations occurred as a result of alteration in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in both cell lines that led to an increased cytochrome C release, caspase activation and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, leading to apoptosis. BA treatment resulted in stabilization of p53 through increase in phosphorylation at Ser15 in LNCaP cells, but not in DU145 cells, and induction of cyclin kinase inhibitor p21/Waf1 in both cell types. Furthermore, treatment of both prostate cancer cells with BA decreased the phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK)α and I-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) inhibiting the nuclear location of NF-κB/p65 causing cytosolic accumulation and resulting in its decreased nuclear binding. We demonstrate that BA may induce apoptosis by stabilizing p53 and downregulating NF-κB pathway in human prostate cancer cells, irrespective of the androgen association, and therefore can potentially be developed as a molecule of interest in cancer chemoprevention.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178892>The protective effect of  on microvascular responsivity and protein expression in alzheimer disease induced by cerebral micro-injection of beta-amyloid and streptozotocin.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mainly caused by accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in vessels or parenchyma of the brain.

Melanoma is not only a problem for humans but also for grey horses as they have a high potential of developing melanoma lesions coupled to the mutation causing their phenotype. Current chemotherapeutic treatment carries the risk of adverse health effects for the horse owner or the treating veterinarian by exposure to antineoplastic compounds. Most treatments have low prospects for systemic tumor regression. Thus, a new therapy is needed. In this in vitro study,  and its two derivatives B10 and NVX-207, both with an improved water solubility compared to , were tested on two equine melanoma cell lines (MelDuWi and MellJess/HoMelZh) and human melanoma (A375) cell line. We could demonstrate that all three compounds especially NVX-207 show high cytotoxicity on both equine melanoma cell lines. The treatment with these compounds lead to externalization of phosphatidylserines on the cell membrane (AnnexinV-staining), DNA-fragmentation (cell cycle analysis) and activation of initiator and effector caspases (Caspase assays). Our results indicate that the apoptosis is induced in the equine melanoma cells by all three compounds. Furthermore, we succeed in encapsulating the most active compound NVX-207 in 2-Hydroxyprolyl-β-cyclodextrine without a loss of its activity.

However, its pharmacological activity related to an anti-inflammatory effect remain unknown. This present study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of methanol extracts of X. sibiricum roots (MXS), and to further determine its underlying mechanism of action in order to assess the medicinal value of X. sibiricum roots.To assess the anti-inflammatory activity of MXS in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, the production of nitric oxide (NO) was measured using the Griess reagent system. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators were quantified using an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, immunoblotting analyses were employed to detect inflammatory mediators as well as to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms suppressed by MXS.MXS inhibited LPS-stimulated NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages within the non-cytotoxic concentration range (50-400 μg/ml). In addition, mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were significantly suppressed by MXS at the concentration of 400 μg/ml. Furthermore, MXS (200 μg/ml) clearly reduced the phosphorylation levels of the inhibitor of kappa Bα (IκBα) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), without affecting changes in the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). When five major components (betulin, , β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and scopoletin) of MXS were separately investigated, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol seemed to play major inhibitory roles in the LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators such as NO, IL-6, and TNF-α.Our results demonstrate that MXS has an anti-inflammatory property in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and its anti-inflammatory activity is exerted by the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and STAT3 signaling .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The purpose of this study was a comparative analysis of selected groups of metabolites in the extracts from fruiting bodies and mycelial cultures. Phenolic acids (syringic, gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic), indole compounds (L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, 5-methyltryptamine), sterols (ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide, hexestrol, cholecalciferol), and triterpenes (, betulin) were determined quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography with UV-Vis/DAD detection, while fatty acids were assessed with the gas chromatography method. Cytotoxic activity against selected human cancer cell lines was determined using the lactate dehydrogenase test. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on lipopolysaccharide activated A549 cells. Those extracts with anti-inflammatory activity were evaluated for their inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes. The mycelium extract exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer cells, while the fruiting body extract indicated a moderate effect on the viability of melanoma and prostate cancer. Incubation of lung epithelial cells with biomass extract significantly decreased cyclooxygenase-2 levels compared to LPS activated A549 cells. This paper is the first report of a comparative quantitative analysis of the metabolites in mycelial cultures and fruiting bodies. In addition, a novel element of this study is its comparison of the cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activity of the obtained extracts. The results of comparing the composition and activity of mycelium and fruiting bodies shows that the cultures could be proposed as a potential biotechnological source for selected biologically active compounds.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30076920> as apoptosis activator: Molecular mechanisms, mathematical modeling and chemical modifications.</a></h2><p>A natural product  (BA) has gained a huge significance in the recent years for its strong cytotoxicity.

Although the major mechanism associated with its ability to induce direct cell death is mitochondrial apoptosis, there are several other mechanisms explored recently. Importantly, mathematical modeling of apoptosis has been an important tool to explore the precise mechanism involved in mitochondrial apoptosis. Thus, this review is an endeavor to sum up the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of BA and future directions to apply mathematical modeling technique to better understand the precise mechanism of BA-induced apoptosis.

Objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of , a triterpenoid in sepsis-induced AKI using cecal ligation puncture (CLP) mouse model. Mice subjected to CLP developed histologic AKI at 18h after CLP. There was an increase in renal proinflammatory response (nuclear factor-kappa B expression, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10), matrix metalloproteinase-9, plasma creatinine, renal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and oxidant stress response (malondialdehyde, inducible nitric oxide synthase, total nitrite and superoxide); decrease in anti-oxidant levels (superoxide dismutase and catalase) at 18h of CLP. However, BA pretreatment at the doses of 10 and 30mg/kg prevented the CLP-induced kidney damage by restoring the aforementioned inflammatory mediators, oxidant and anti-oxidant imbalance. These evidences suggest that, the protective effects of BA on kidney are associated with defending action against inflammatory and oxidative stress response in CLP mice and BA could be potential therapeutic agent in sepsis-induced AKI.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both KME-W and KME-E decreased epididymal fat mass by increasing fat oxidation in diabetic rats. KME-E but not KME-W exhibited greater potentiation of first-phase insulin secretion than the Px-control in a hyperglycemic clamp. KME-E also made β-cell mass greater than the control by increasing β-cell proliferation and decreasing its apoptosis. In a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, whole-body glucose infusion rate and hepatic glucose output increased with potentiating hepatic insulin signaling in the following order: Px-control, KME-W, KME-E, and normal-control. Betulin potentiated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via increased PPAR-γ activity and insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas oleanolic acid enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cell proliferation in insulinoma cells.

The hemorrhoids were induced by applying 6% croton oil preparation in the ano-rectal region. Rats were orally administered methanolic and aqueous extract at doses of 250 and 500mg/kg, each for 7 days. Pilex (200mg/kg) was used as reference anti-hemorrhoidal drug. Hemorrhoids were assessed on eighth day by measuring hemorrhoidal and biochemical parameters along with histology of ano-rectal tissue.Croton oil application caused induction of hemorrhoids as indicated by significant (p<0.001) increase in plasma exudation of Evans blue in ano-rectal tissue, macroscopic severity score and ano-rectal coefficient as compared to normal rats. It significantly (p<0.001) elevated lactate dehydrogenase and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) levels in serum and increased myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation in ano-rectal tissue along with marked histological damage as compared to normal rats.

Downregulation of DNA Polymerase-α - Helicase Complex (Replisomes) and Glyco-Genes.</a></h2><p>In normal and  cells, successful cell division requires accurate duplication of chromosomal DNA. All cells require a multiprotein DNA duplication system (replisomes) for their existence. However, death of normal cells in our body occurs through the apoptotic process. During apoptotic process several crucial genes are downregulated with the upregulation of caspase pathways, leading to ultimate degradation of genomic DNA. In metastatic  cells (SKBR-3, MCF -7, and MDA-462), this process is inhibited to achieve immortality as well as overexpression of the enzymes for the synthesis of marker molecules. It is believed that the GSL of the lacto family such as Le, SA-Le, Le, Le, and Le are markers on the human  and breast  cells. Recently, we have characterized that a few apoptotic chemicals (cis-platin, L-PPMP, D-PDMP, GD3 ganglioside, GD1b ganglioside, , tamoxifen, and melphalan) in low doses kill metastatic breast  cells. The apoptosis-inducing agent (e.g., cis-platin) showed inhibition of DNA polymerase/helicase (part of the replisomes) and also modulated (positively) a few glycolipid-glycosyltransferase (GSL-GLTs) transcriptions in the early stages (within 2 h after treatment) of apoptosis. These Lc-family GSLs are also present on the surfaces of human breast and  carcinoma cells. It is advantageous to deliver these apoptotic chemicals through the metastatic cell surfaces containing high concentration of marker glycolipids (Lc-GSLs). Targeted application of apoptotic chemicals (in micro scale) to kill the  cells would be an ideal way to inhibit the metastatic growth of both breast and  cells. It was observed in three different breast  lines (SKBR-3, MDA-468, and MCF-7) that in 2 h very little apoptotic process had started, but predominant biochemical changes (including inactivation of replisomes) started between 6 and 24 h of the drug treatments. The contents of replisomes (replisomal complexes) during induction of apoptosis are not known. It is known that DNA helicase activities (major proteins catalyze the melting of dsDNA strands) change during apoptotic induction process. Previously DNA Helicase-III was characterized as a component of the replication complexes isolated from carcinoma cells and normal rapid growing embryonic chicken brain cells. Helicase activities were assayed by a novel method (combined immunoprecipitation-ROME assay), and DNA polymerase-alpha activities were determined by regular chain extension of nicked "ACT-DNA," by determining values obtained from +/- aphidicolin added to the incubation mixtures. Very little is known about the stability of the "replication complexes" (or replisomes) during the apoptotic process. DNA helicases are motor proteins that catalyze the melting of genomic DNA during replication, repair, and recombination processes. In all three breast carcinoma cell lines (SKBR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-468), a common trend, decrease of activities of DNA polymerase-alpha and Helicase-III (estimated and detected with a polyclonal antibody), was observed, after cis-platin- and L-PPMP-induced apoptosis. Previously our laboratory has documented downregulation (within 24-48 h) of several GSL-GLTs with these apoptotic reagents in breast and  cells also.

(BA) is a pentacyclic lupane triterpene with a potent antioxidant activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the ameliorative effect and underlying mechanisms of BA on Dex-induced oxidative damage. Mice were pretreated with BA orally (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and then a single dose of Dex (25 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally 8 h after the last administration of BA to induce oxidative stress. BA pretreatment significantly alleviated Dex-induced changes of blood biochemical indices, increased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the ability of inhibiting hydroxyl radical (AIHR), reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum. Moreover, BA pretreatment enhanced the T-AOC, AIHR and the activity of peroxidase (POD) in liver, spleen and thymus. Concomitant with these biochemical parameters, BA pretreatment significantly reduced gene and protein expressions of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) in the lymphatic organs of Dex-treated mice. BA was found to effectively attenuate Dex-induced oxidative damage.

In hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-KO) mice, 2h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by 22h of reperfusion led to an enhanced expression of NADPH oxidase subunits (NOX2, NOX4 and p22phox) and isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (neuronal nNOS and inducible iNOS) in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the non-ischemic contralateral hemisphere. This was associated with elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, an indicator of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative protein modification. Pre-treatment with  (50mg/kg/day for 7days via gavage) prior MCA occlusion prevented the ischemia reperfusion-induced upregulation of NOX2, nNOS and iNOS.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of BA on calcium influx and static insulin secretion in pancreatic islets isolated from euglycemic rats. We found that BA triggers calcium influx by a mechanism dependent on ATP-dependent potassium channels and L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. Additionally, the voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent chloride channels are also involved in the mechanism of BA, probably due to an indirect stimulation of calcium entry and increased intracellular calcium. Additionally, the downstream activation of PKC, which is necessary for the effect of BA on calcium influx, is involved in the full stimulatory response of the triterpene. BA stimulated the static secretion of insulin in pancreatic islets, indicating that the abrupt calcium influx may be a key step in its secretagogue effect. As such, BA stimulates insulin secretion through the activation of electrophysiological mechanisms, such as the closure of potassium channels and opening of calcium and chloride channels, inducing cellular depolarization associated with -biochemical effects, in turn activating PKC and ensuring the secretion of insulin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There is a dearth of information of its effect in testis. This study evaluated the protective role of  (BA) against NDMA-induced redox imbalance in testes of rats.Twenty-four male rats were assigned into four groups and treated with normal saline, BA, NDMA and [BA+NDMA]. BA (25 mg/kg) was given for 14 days, while NDMA (5 mg/kg) was given on days 7 and 12.Administration of NDMA significantly increased the weight and relative weight of testes by 51 and 71%, respectively, while treatment with BA attenuated the weight-gain. Furthermore, NDMA decreased the sperm count, motility and live-dead ratio by 57, 36 and 37%, respectively, and increased total sperm abnormality by 56%. However, BA attenuated the changes in the spermiogram of NDMA-treated rats. NDMA significantly decreased the activities of antioxidative enzymes, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones, while testicular levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and total cholesterol were increased. Also, NDMA increased the activities of aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine-N-demethylase. Supplementation with BA attenuated NDMA-induced alteration in these biochemical indices.BA protects against NDMA-induced redox imbalance via activation of antioxidative pathway.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127036>Antitumor drug effect of  mediated by polyethylene glycol modified liposomes.</a></h2><p> (BA), as a natural pentacyclic lupine-type triterpene, principally derives from bark of white birch, due to its potent pharmacological properties and low side-effect, which has been demonstrated a prominent efficiency on cancer therapy. However, the poor solubility and low bioavailability limit its pharmaceutical effect. Herein, we reported the rapid efficient synthesis of the polyethylene glycol modified (PEGylated) BA liposomes using ethanol injection technique for the first time. In the study, hydrophobic BA was encapsulated in the lipid bilayer of liposomes, meanwhile hydrophilic PEG layer covered the surface of liposomes. The mean diameter of PEGylated BA liposomes was 142nm, which can effectively accumulate in the tumor tissues. In vitro drug release study showed that the PEGylated BA liposomes had a better sustained drug release effect than BA liposomes. The PEGylated BA liposomes also exhibited a better tumor inhibitory effect compared with those of free BA or BA liposomes in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore, the PEGylated BA liposomes could serve as a better alternative for the cancer therapy in future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In wild type and GPBAR1-/- mice cholestasis induced by ANIT fails to induce spontaneous itching and abrogates scratching behavior caused by intradermal administration of DCA.

We used a homology-based approach to identify and functionally characterize two new oxidosqualene cyclases (MdOSC4 and MdOSC5) and one cytochrome P450 (CYP716A175). The gene expression patterns of these enzymes and of previously described oxidosqualene cyclases were further studied in 20 apple cultivars with contrasting triterpene profiles. MdOSC4 encodes a multifunctional oxidosqualene cyclase producing an oleanane-type triterpene, putatively identified as germanicol, as well as β-amyrin and lupeol, in the proportion 82 : 14 : 4. MdOSC5 cyclizes 2,3-oxidosqualene into lupeol and β-amyrin at a ratio of 95 : 5. CYP716A175 catalyses the C-28 oxidation of α-amyrin, β-amyrin, lupeol and germanicol, producing ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, , and putatively morolic acid. The gene expression of MdOSC1 was linked to the concentrations of ursolic and oleanolic acid, whereas the expression of MdOSC5 was correlated with the concentrations of  and its caffeate derivatives. Two new multifuntional triterpene synthases as well as a multifunctional triterpene C-28 oxidase were identified in Malus × domestica.

In order to address these issues, herein, we developed  loaded polylactide-co-glycolide- monomethoxy polyethylene glycol nanoparticles (PLGA-mPEG NPs). The PLGA-mPEG co-polymer was synthesized and characterized using NMR and FT-IR. BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs were prepared by an emulsion solvent evaporation method. The developed nanoparticles had a desirable particle size (∼147nm) and exhibited uniform spherical shape under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PLGA-mPEG NPs were able to decrease the uptake by macrophages (i.e. J774A.1 and Raw 264.7 cells) as compared to PLGA nanoparticles. In vitro cytotoxicity in MCF7 and PANC-1 cells demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity of BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs as compared to free BA. The cellular uptake study in both the cell lines demonstrated time dependent uptake behavior. The enhanced cytotoxicity of BA NPs was also supported by increased cellular apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, generation of high reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle arrest. Further, intravenous pharmacokinetics study revealed that BA loaded PLGA-mPEG NPs could prolong the circulation of BA and remarkably enhance half-life by ∼7.21 folds.

Systemic exposure of atorvastatin was substantially altered with the intravenous co-administration of BA (20 mg/kg). Preincubation (incubation with inhibitors, followed by washout) with BA led to a sustained inhibition of OATP1B3, which recovered rapidly in the media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The addition of albumin to the media decreased intracellular concentrations of BA and expedited the recovery of OATP1B3 activity following preincubation. For asunaprevir and cyclosporin A (previously known to inhibit OATP1B3 upon preincubation), the addition of albumin to the media shortened recovery time with asunaprevir, but not with cyclosporin A. Overall, our results showed that BA inhibits OATP1B transporters in vitro and may incur hepatic transporter-mediated drug interactions in vivo.

However, radioresistance remains a major impediment to radiotherapy. Although BetA () can induce radiosensitization, the underlying mechanism and whether it could induce radiosensitization in oral squamous cell carcinoma are not fully understood. In this study, we showed that BetA increased radiosensitization in CAL-27 and Tca-83 cells. Radiation-triggered Sp1 overexpression was responsible for radioresistance of OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) cells. Treatment with BetA downregulated Sp1 and upregulated PTEN through inducing Sp1 sumoylation and correspondingly increased radiosensitization. Moreover, Sumoylation of Sp1 upregulated PTEN protein expression by downregulating Sp1 as well as inhibiting Sp1 DNA binding activity, thereby leading to the activation of PTEN transcription.

The effects of BA on Sp proteins and Sp-regulated gene products were analyzed by western blots, and real time PCR was used to determine microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and ZBTB10 mRNA expression.BA inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in RKO and SW480 colon cancer cells and inhibited tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing RKO cells as xenograft. BA also decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 transcription factors which are overexpressed in colon cancer cells and decreased levels of several Sp-regulated genes including survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor, p65 sub-unit of NFκB, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin D1, and pituitary tumor transforming gene-1.

It is worth noting that the biological activity of new esters of betulin is positive correlated with the length of the side chain of l-amino acid. The highest biological activity displayed compound containing lysine side chain (Lys, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2). Considering the biological activity, other derivatives can be set in the following series: Orn (-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2)>Dab (-CH2-CH2-NH2)>Dap (-CH2-NH2)>Ala (CH3)>betulin. New betulin esters were tested in normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431).

Activation of apoptosis was found in glioma cells when the cells were exposed to B10, as evidenced by increased number of TUNEL-stained cells, increased caspase 3 and 9 activities, and Bax and cleaved PARP expression. B10 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial complex I, II, III, IV, and V activities, and ATP level, and increase of mitochondrial ROS production, indicating the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. B10 reduced the expression of sirtuin (SIRT) 1 and resulted in an increase in forkhead box O (FOXO) 3a expression and acetylation.

BA treatment led to GRP78 overexpression, and GRP78 knockdown abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on glycolysis. Further studies demonstrated that overexpressed GRP78 activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor PERK. Subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2 led to the inhibition of -catenin expression, which resulted in the inhibition of c-Myc-mediated glycolysis. Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that BA interrupted the binding between GRP78 and PERK, thereby initiating the glycolysis inhibition cascade. Finally, the lung  model validated that BA inhibited breast cancer metastasis , as well as suppressed the expression of aerobic glycolysis-related proteins. In conclusion, our study not only provided a promising drug for aerobic glycolysis inhibition but also revealed that GRP78 is a novel molecular link between glycolytic metabolism and ER stress during tumor metastasis.</p><p>Keyword:['colonization', 'energy', 'glycolysis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417527> induces apoptosis and suppresses metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a high incidence and mortality malignant tumour globally.  (BA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with potential pro-apoptotic activities which widely found in many plants. In this study, we determined the effects of BA on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis in HCC cell lines and on tumour growth and pulmonary metastasis in mice. The results suggested that BA could inhibit cell viability and proliferation of HCC cell lines including HepG2, LM3, and MHCC97H. In addition, BA induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells characterised condensed nuclei and nuclear fragmentation. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that BA-induced apoptosis associated with increasing of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and decreasing of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Meanwhile, BA also reduced the reactive  species (ROS) level. Furthermore, BA also significantly inhibited HCC growth in vivo and blocked pulmonary metastasis of HCC by regulating the metastasis-related proteins including MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP2 without obvious toxicity. In all, the present study suggested that BA might be a promising anti-HCC drug candidate by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and blocking metastasis.© 2018 The Authors.

This study provides evidence that  is highly effective against the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa by inducing dose- and time-dependent apoptosis. The apoptotic process was further investigated using a proteomics approach to reveal protein expression changes in HeLa cells following  treatment. Proteomic analysis revealed that there were six up- and thirty down-regulated proteins in -induced HeLa cells, and these proteins were then subjected to functional pathway analysis using multiple analysis software. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase decarboxylating, chain A Horf6-a novel human peroxidase enzyme that involved in redox process, was found to be down-regulated during the apoptosis process of the oxidative stress response pathway. Consistent with our results at the protein level, an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species was observed in -treated cells. The proteins glucose-regulated protein and cargo-selection protein TIP47, which are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway, were up-regulated by  treatment. Meanwhile, 14-3-3 family proteins, including 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ε, were down-regulated in response to  treatment, which is consistent with the decrease in expression of the target genes 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ε. Furthermore, it was found that the antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene was down-regulated while the proapoptotic bax gene was up-regulated after  treatment in HeLa cells.

This study examined the intracellular  underlying the effects of BA on eNOS activity and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells. BA treatment induced both eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and NO production. It also increased the level of intracellular Ca(2+) and phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). Inhibition of the L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) abolished BA-induced intracellular levels of Ca(2+) and eNOS phosphorylation. Treatment with W7 (a CaM antagonist), KN-93 (a selective inhibitor of CaMKII), and STO 609 (a selective inhibitor of CaMKK) suppressed eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. Moreover, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was induced by BA, and BA-induced eNOS phosphorylation was inhibited by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. Taken together, these results indicate that BA activates eNOS phosphorylation and NO synthesis via the Ca(2+)/CaMKII and Ca(2+)/CaMKK/AMPK . These findings provide further insight into the eNOS signaling  involved in the antiatherosclerosis effects of BA.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27492479>Modulatory role of  in N-nitrosodimethylamine-induced hepatorenal toxicity in male Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a toxicant found in foods and drinking water. Several synthetic agents used in alleviation of NDMA toxicity have been associated with serious side effects. Therefore, a safe and less toxic agent is desirable. In this study,  (BA), a triterpenoid antioxidant, is proposed as a better and alternative agent to modulate NDMA-induced toxicity. Twenty-four Wistar rats were assigned into four groups of six rats each and treated with normal saline (control), BA (25 mg/kg), NDMA (5 mg/kg) and (BA + NDMA). BA was given by oral gavage for 14 consecutive days, while NDMA was administered intraperitoneally on days 7 and 12. Results showed that administration of NDMA significantly ( p < 0.05) elevated the activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase by 51%, 48% and 81%, respectively. Also, NDMA intoxication significantly ( p < 0.05) increased the levels of serum urea and creatinine by 64% and 82%, respectively, and decreased urinary creatinine by 67%. In addition, administration of NDMA significantly ( p < 0.05) increased the levels of hepatic and renal DNA fragmentation by 44% and 61%, respectively, relative to control. The number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (mnPCEs) in NDMA-treated rats (11.1 ± 2.6 mnPCE/1000PCE) was significantly higher than control (4.3 ± 1.1 mnPCE/1000 PCE). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong expressions of Bcl-2 and nuclear p53 in NDMA-intoxicated rats. Interestingly, pretreatment with BA significantly ( p < 0.05) ameliorated NDMA-induced changes in serum biochemical indices, mnPCEs, DNA fragmentation and expressions of Bcl-2 and p53 proteins. These findings suggest that BA protects against NDMA-induced toxicity via anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19325847> for cancer treatment and prevention.</a></h2><p> is a natural product with a range of biological effects, for example potent antitumor activity.

Müller cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress elicited by high glutamate concentrations can lead to toxicity, which promote the pathogenesis of retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. This study investigated the anti-oxidant activity and mechanisms of  (BA) and its derivatives in human Müller cells. Human MIO-M1 Müller cells were pre-treated in the presence or absence of BA, BE as well as their derivatives (named H3-H20) followed by incubation with glutamate. Cell viability was evaluated with the MTT and calcein-AM assays. Reactive  species (ROS) production in MIO-M1 cells was measured using CM-HDCFDA and flow cytometry. The activation of cellular apoptosis and necrosis was analyzed with annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry. The modulation of signaling pathways involved in glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity and ROS production was evaluated by immunoblotting. The BA derivatives H3, H5 and H7 exhibited minimal cytotoxicity and significant anti-oxidant activity. These compounds significantly suppressed ROS production and attenuated cellular necrosis elicited by glutamate-induced oxidative stress. The protective effects of H3, H5 and H7 in MIO-M1 cells were associated with the attenuation of Akt, Erk, and JNK signaling. The BA analogues H3, H5 and H7 are protective against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in human Müller cells, and elicit their actions by modulation of the Erk, Akt and JNK signaling pathways.

The risk of developing osteoporosis increases with aging, especially after menopause in women. Discovering the signaling pathways that play a significant role in aging- and menopause-induced osteoporosis should accelerate osteoporosis drug discovery. In this study, we found that bile acid membrane receptor Tgr5 knockout C57BL/6J mice had similar bone mass as wild-type mice during early and middle-age (before 4 months old) bone remodeling; however, Tgr5 markedly decreased bone mass in aged (more than 7 months old) and ovariectomized (OVX) mice compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, Tgr5 knockout strongly induced osteoclast differentiation but had no effect on osteoblast activity. Treatment with different TGR5 agonists consistently inhibited osteoclast differentiation. Importantly, our results showed that Tgr5 regulates osteoclastogenesis by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which is a central metabolic pathway involved in the pathophysiology of aging and age-related diseases. The bile acid nuclear receptor FXR is an established regulator of bone metabolism. We screened the derivatives of  (BA), a known TGR5 agonist, to identify novel dual agonists of FXR and TGR5. The derivative SH-479, a pentacyclic triterpene acid, could activate both TGR5 and FXR, with a better inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis compared with agonists solely activating FXR or TGR5 and additionally enhanced osteoblastogenesis. Furthermore, SH-479 therapeutically abrogated bone loss in C57BL/6J mice through the bone remodeling pathways.

Inactive pro-IL-1β is transcribed in response to innate immune receptors activating NFκB. If tissue damage occurs, danger signals released from necrotic cells, such as ATP, can activate NLRP3-inflammasomes (multiprotein complexes consisting of NLRP3, ASC, and active caspase-1) which cleaves and activates pro-IL-1β. NLRP3 activation also depends on NEK7 and mitochondrial ROS-production. Thus, IL-1β secretion may be regulated at the level of each involved component. We have previously shown that NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release can be induced in cardiac fibroblasts by pro-inflammatory stimuli. However, anti-inflammatory mechanisms targeting IL-1β release in cardiac cells have not been investigated. mTOR is a key regulator of protein , including autophagy and proteasome activity. In this study we explored whether autophagy or proteasomal degradation are regulators of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β release from cardiac fibroblasts.  Serum starvation selectively reduced LPS/ATP-induced IL-1β secretion from cardiac fibroblasts. However, no other inflammasome components, nor mitochondrial mass, were affected. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin restored pro-IL-1β protein levels as well as LPS/ATP-induced IL-1β release from serum starved cells. However, neither serum starvation nor rapamycin induced autophagy in cardiac fibroblasts. Conversely, chloroquine and bafilomycin A (inhibitors of autophagy) and  (a proteasome activator) effectively reduced LPS-induced pro-IL-1β protein levels. Key findings were reinvestigated in human monocyte-derived macrophages.  In cardiac fibroblasts, mTOR inhibition selectively favors pro-IL-1β synthesis while proteasomal degradation and not autophagy is the major catabolic anti-inflammatory mechanism for degradation of this cytokine.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757534>Triterpenoids Isolated from Ziziphus jujuba Enhance Glucose Uptake Activity in Skeletal Muscle Cells.</a></h2><p>Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.), a traditional folk medicine and functional food in China and South Korea, is known for its beneficial properties, which include anti-cancer, anti-oxidative, and anti- effects.

However, its mechanism against multiple myeloma (MM) remains elusive. Herein, for the first time, we studied the antitumor activity of BA against MM both  and . We showed that BA mediated cytotoxicity in MM cells through apoptosis, S-phase arrest, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, and overwhelming reactive  species (ROS) accumulation. Moreover, when the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) effectively abated elevated ROS, the BA-induced apoptosis was partially reversed. Our results revealed that BA-mediated ROS overproduction played a pivotal role in anticancer activity. Molecularly, we found that BA resulted in marked inhibition of the aberrantly activated NF-B pathway in MM. As demonstrated by using the NF-B pathway-specific activator TNF- and the inhibitor BAY 11-7082, BA-mediated inhibition of the NF-B pathway directly promoted the overproduction of ROS and, ultimately, cell death. Furthermore, BA also exerted enormous tumor-inhibitory effects via repressing proliferation and inhibiting the NF-B pathway in our xenograft model.

Here we evaluated the effects of BA in a mouse model of endotoxic shock. Endotoxemia was induced through intraperitoneally LPS administration, nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines were assessed by Griess method and ELISA, respectively. Treatment of BALB/c mice with BA at 67 mg/kg caused a 100% survival against a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). BA treatment caused a reduction in TNF-α production induced by LPS but did not alter IL-6 production. Moreover, BA treatment increased significantly the serum levels of IL-10 compared to vehicle-treated, LPS-challenged mice. To investigate the role of IL-10 in BA-induced protection, wild-type and IL-10(-/-) mice were studied. In contrast to the observations in IL-10(+/+) mice, BA did not protect IL-10(-/-) mice against a lethal LPS challenge. Addition of BA inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by macrophages stimulated with LPS, while promoting a significant increase in IL-10 production. BA-treated peritoneal exudate macrophages produced lower concentrations of TNF-α and NO and higher concentrations of IL-10 upon LPS stimulation. Similarly, macrophages obtained from BA-treated mice produced less pro-inflammatory mediators and increased IL-10 when compared to non-stimulated macrophages obtained from vehicle-treated mice.

To compare the influence of the fused indole or the seven-membered A-ring on the inhibitory activity, lupane A-azepanones with different substituents at C28 were synthesized. The structure-activity relationships revealed that the enzyme inhibition activity dramatically increased (up to 4730 times) when the carboxylic group of 2,3-indolo- was converted to the corresponding amide. Thus, the IC values for glycine amide and L-phenylalanine amides were 0.04 and 0.05 μM, respectively.

Because L cells express the bile acid receptor TGR5 and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV) rapidly degrades GLPs, we hypothesized that luminal TGR5 activation may attenuate intestinal injury via GLP-2 release, which is enhanced by DPPIV inhibition.Intestinal injury was induced in mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water (free access to water containing 5% DSS for 7 days).

(BA) is an active compound isolated from the bark of the birch tree Betula spp. (Betulaceae) and has been shown to attenuate hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of BA on the high glucose‑induced fibrosis response in CFs remains to be elucidated, therefore, the present study investigated the effect of BA on high glucose‑induced CFs and examined the possible mechanism underlying the effect of BA on CF transdifferentiation. CFs were pre‑incubated with various concentrations of BA for 24 h and then stimulated with high glucose (25 mM) for various times. Cell proliferation was evaluated using an MTT assay. The mRNA expression levels of α‑smooth muscle actin (SMA) and transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The protein expression levels of α‑SMA, collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, TGF‑β1, small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)2/3, phosphorylated (p)‑Smad2 and p‑Smad3 and were detected using western blot analysis. The data revealed that BA attenuated the CF proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation induced by high glucose. In addition, BA inhibited the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the CFs induced by high glucose. It was also found that BA inhibited the high glucose‑induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in the CFs. Taken together, BA suppressed the high glucose‑induced increase in the proliferation of CFs and expression of ECM via inhibition of the TGF‑β1/Smad signaling pathway. Thus, BA may offer therapeutic potential towards the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27748864> and the pharmacological effects of tumor suppression (Review).</a></h2><p> (BA), a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin from tree bark, has the potential to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells without toxicity towards normal cells in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor pharmacological effects of BA consist of triggering apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, regulating the cell cycle and the angiogenic pathway via factors, including specificity protein transcription factors, cyclin D1 and epidermal growth factor receptor, inhibiting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and nuclear factor‑κB signaling , preventing the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, and affecting the expression of topoisomerase I, p53 and lamin B1. In previous years, several studies have shown its antitumor effect, initially applied to malignant melanoma, however, it also has broad efficacies against most solid types of tumor from different regions of the body. There have been few investigations in hematological malignancies, however, this direction may offer potential in such a novel field of research.

Recent evidence suggests that rather diverse cellular signaling events may be attributed to the same common upstream switch in cellular metabolism. In this study we therefore examined the metabolic changes induced by BA (10 µM) administration, with focus on cellular glucose metabolism. We demonstrate that BA elevates the rates of cellular glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with concomitant reduction of glucose oxidation. Without eliciting signs of obvious cell death BA leads to compromised mitochondrial function, increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) 1 and 2, and liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-dependent activation AMP-activated protein kinase. AMPK activation accounts for the increased glucose uptake and glycolysis which in turn are indispensable for cell viability upon BA treatment. Overall, we show for the first time a significant impact of BA on cellular bioenergetics which may be a central mediator of the pleiotropic actions of BA.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'glycolysis', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29497292>Poly(lactic--glycolic acid)-loaded nanoparticles of  for improved treatment of hepatic cancer: characterization, in vitro and in vivo evaluations.</a></h2><p>The application of  (B), a potent antineoplastic agent, is limited due to poor bioavailability, short plasma half-life and inappropriate tissue distribution. Thus, we aimed to prepare novel 50:50 poly(lactic--glycolic acid) (PLGA)-loaded B nanoparticles (BNP) and to compare its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity with parent B.BNP were synthesized and characterized using different methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and particle size analyses. Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The anti-HCC response was evaluated through in vitro cell line study using Hep-G2 cells, confocal microscopy, in vivo oral pharmacokinetics and animal studies. Further, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to observe the changes in the expression of specific genes.Particle size of BNP was optimized through the application of the stabilizer, polyvinyl alcohol. Physicochemical characterization exhibited particle size of 257.1 nm with zeta potential -0.170 mV (optimized batch B, BNP). SEM and FTIR analyses of BNP showed that cylindrical particles of B converted to spherical particles in BNP and there were no interaction between B and used polymers. The release study of optimized BNP was highest (≥80%) than any other formulation. Later, in vitro cell culture analysis using Hep-G2 cells and confocal microscopy studies revealed that BNP had the highest inhibition and penetration properties than parent B. Oral pharmacokinetics studies using albino Wistar rats at single 100 mg dose again exhibited BNP had the higher 50% of plasma concentration (t), a higher maximum plasma concentration () and took longer to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T) than parent B. Next, our in vivo study using nitrosodiethyl amine (NDEA)-induced HCC model documented BNP decreased in number of nodules, restored body weight, oxidative stress parameters, liver marker enzymes and histological architecture than parent B. Lastly, qRT-PCR studies further demonstrated that anti-HCC properties of BNP may be due to over expression of antiapoptotic caspases i.e., caspase 3 and 8.The prepared BNP showed a better therapeutic response against HCC and could be attributed as future candidate molecule for HCC treatment.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25291962> negates oxidative lung injury in surgical sepsis model.</a></h2><p>Sepsis commonly progresses to acute lung injury and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

We determined the effect of  (BA) on oxidative lung injury in mice using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model.Five groups of mice (six in each group) received three pretreatments at 24-h interval before surgery. Surgery was done 1 h after last dosing. Sham and CLP control group mice received vehicle. BA was administered to other three groups of mice at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg dose. Lung and plasma samples were collected for analysis by sacrificing the mice at 18 h of surgery.Compared with sham, CLP significantly increased total protein, nitrite, malondialdehyde, isoprostane, superoxide, protein carbonyl, oxidative stress index, inducible nitric oxide synthase protein, and histopathologic changes and reduced the superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and total thiol levels in lungs and plasma, which were restored by BA pretreatment.BA pretreatment decreased the levels of oxidants, increased the levels of antioxidants in lungs and plasma thereby reducing the oxidative lung injury in CLP mice. Additionally, BA was found to scavenge the superoxide and nitric oxide radical in vitro.

Recent studies have shown that BA has significant cytotoxicity to various types of human cancer cells, and shows potential in cancer treatment. However, the efficacy of BA on human colorectal cancer tumor cells is still unclear. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of BA in human colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo to investigate the possible mechanism. In this experiment, we found that BA inhibited colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro with a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, BA could induce cell apoptosis by upregulating expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and downregulating protein of Bcl-2. BA could increase the production of reactive  species and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential of cancer cell, suggesting that BA induced cancer cells apoptosis by mitochondrial mediated pathways. Furthermore, BA significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and increased the expression of MMPs inhibitor (TIMP-2). In addition, the growth of tumor was significantly suppressed by intraperitoneal administration of 20 mg/kg/day of BA in a xenograft tumor mouse model of HCT-116. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis showed that MMP-2+ cells and Ki-67+ cells were reduced and cleaved caspase-3+ cells were increased in tumor tissues of mice after BA administration. The results showed that BA not only promoted the apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells, but also inhibited the metastasis of cancer cells.

It is related with genomic instability, which has been shown to occur in the presence of autophagy deficiency. Yet, the mechanism that triggers genomic instability and senescence from a condition of autophagy deficiency remains unknown. By analyzing the consequences of treating human keratinocytes (HaCaT) with the pentacyclic triterpenoid  (BA) we were able to propose that cell senescence can develop as a response to parallel damage in the membranes of mitochondria and lysosome.We performed biochemical, immunocytochemical and cytometric assays after challenging HaCaT cells with BA. We also evaluated membrane leakage induced by BA in liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles.By destabilizing lipid bilayers of mitochondria and lysosomes, BA triggers the misbalance in the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis leading to perceived autophagy impairment, lipofuscinogenesis, genomic instability and cell senescence. The progressive accumulation of mitochondria and lipofuscin, which comes from imperfect mitophagy triggered by BA, provides a continuous source of reactive species further damaging lysosomes and leading to cell aging.This work reveals that the initial trigger of cell senescence can be the physical damage in the membranes of lysosomes and mitochondria.This concept will help in the search of new drugs that act as senescence-inductors. BA is under evaluation as chemotherapeutic agent against several types of tumors and induction of cell senescence should be considered as one of its main mechanisms of action.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Focal cerebral ischemia was achieved by using the standard intraluminal occlusion method and reperfusion enabled after 2 h ischemia. Neurological deficits were scored. Infarct size was determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC) staining and the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) was determined by RT-PCR in infarct tissue. ROS generation and apoptosis in ischemic tissue were analyzed by measuring the oxidative conversion of cell permeable 2',7'-dichloro-fluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in fluorescence microplate reader and TUNEL assay, respectively. In Kunming mice, 2 h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by 24 or 72 h of reperfusion led to an enhanced NOX4 expression in the ischemic hemisphere. This was associated with elevated levels of ROS generation and neuronal apoptosis.

Among them, we previously reported the identification of a potential molecule, that is, 3{1N(5-hydroxy-naphth-1yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4yl}methyloxy  (HBA) with significant inhibition of cancer cell growth and their properties. In the present study, we have shown for the first time that HBA decreased the expression of phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) p110α and p85α and caused significant downregulation of pAKT and of NFκB using human leukemia and breast cancer cells as in vitro models. Further it was revealed that PI3K inhibition by HBA induced cell cycle arrest via effects on different cell cycle regulatory proteins that include CDKis cyclins and pGSK3β. Also, this target-specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by the increased expression of mitochondrial bax, downregulated bcl2 and decreased mitochondrial levels of cytochrome c, together with reactive oxygen species generation and decline in mitochondrial membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors such as caspase 8, caspase 9 and caspase 3 were found to be upregulated besides DNA repair-associated enzyme, that is, PARP cleavage caused cancer cell death. Pharmacodynamic evaluation revealed that both HBA and BA were safe upto the dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight and with acceptable pharmacodynamic parameters. The in vitro data corroborated with in vivo anticancer activity wherein Ehrlich solid tumor showed that HBA as a more potent agent than BA without any body weight loss and mortality.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30011885>Pharmacokinetic Comparisons of Multiple Triterpenic Acids from  Extract Following Oral Delivery in Normal and Acute Liver Injury Rats.</a></h2><p>, the dried fruit of , has been used as Chinese medicine and food for centuries.

(BA) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound isolated from the leaves of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BA on experimental MN in rats and explored the mechanisms by which it enhances antioxidant activities and resolves inflammatory condition in experimental MN. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single tail vein injection of anti- Fx1A antiserum. The rats were orally administered BA (25 and 50 mg kg  d ) or dexamethasone (DEX; 0.07 mg kg-1, reference compound) for 4 weeks after the induction of PHN. Blood, urine, and kidney tissue were collected for analysis at the end of the study. Treatment of PHN rats with BA or DEX significantly attenuated renal dysfunction, histopathological alterations and reduced immune complex deposition in the kidneys. Furthermore, BA ameliorated mRNA and protein expression of NF-κB, iNOS, TNF-α, Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 in the kidney. BA also restored malondialdehyde level and antioxidant enzyme activities in the kidney. In a nutshell, the protective effect of BA can be explained by its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, which in turn is due to downregulation of NF-κB pathway and activation of Nrf2. The results indicated that BA can effectively suppress experimental PHN in rats by regulating Nrf2/NF-κB pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrophilic antioxidants viz., L-ascorbic acid (VitC) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (l-NAC) had no protective effect on BA-induced apoptosis at the maximal concentrations tested. The lipophilic antioxidant, alpha-DL-tocopherol (VitE) showed a concentration and a time dependent effect on the protection of SK-N-MC cells from BA-induced apoptosis. The apoptotic parameters were analyzed using FACS analysis of propidium iodide (PI) stained nuclei, PS externalization using Annexin-V assay and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Generation of superoxide radical was monitored by the fluorescent dye hydroethidium (HE). Cells showed Annexin-V positivity and an increase in the propidium iodide (PI) uptake in the early hours of treatment with BA, which was concomitant with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Addition of alpha-DL-tocopherol to the cell cultures 1-h prior to the treatment with BA abolished all the effects of BA-induced apoptosis.

In animal models, a TGR5 agonist increases incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Many agonists have been developed for clinical use. However, the effects of TGR5 blockade have not been studied extensively, with the exception of studies using TGR5 knockout mice. Therefore, we investigated the potential effect of triamterene on TGR5.We transfected the TGR5 gene into cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) to express TGR5. Then, we applied a fluorescent indicator to examine the glucose uptake of these transfected cells. In addition, NCI-H716 cells that secrete incretin were also evaluated. Fura-2, a fluorescence indicator, was applied to determine the changes in calcium concentrations. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Moreover, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetes were used to investigate the effects in vivo.Triamterene dose dependently inhibits the increase in glucose uptake induced by TGR5 agonists in CHO-K1 cells expressing the TGR5 gene. In cultured NCI-H716 cells, TGR5 activation also increases GLP-1 secretion by increasing calcium levels. Triamterene inhibits the increased calcium levels by TGR5 activation through competitive antagonism. Moreover, the GLP-1 secretion and increased cAMP levels induced by TGR5 activation are both dose dependently reduced by triamterene. However, treatment with KB-R7943 at a dose sufficient to block the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) failed to modify the responses to TGR5 activation in NCI-H716 cells or CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of triamterene on TGR5 activation do not appear to be related to NCX inhibition. Blockade of TGR5 activation by triamterene was further characterized in vivo using the STZ-induced diabetic rats.Based on the obtained data, we identified triamterene as a reliable inhibitor of TGR5.

Currently, there is no efficient way to remove the virus because the EBV carriers are usually in a latent stage that allows them to escape the immune system and common antiviral drugs. In the effort to develop an efficient strategy for the removal of the EBV virus, we have shown that  (BA) slightly suppresses EBV replication through SOD2 suppression with subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage in EBV-transformed LCL (lymphoblastoid cell line) cells. Chidamide (CDM, CS055), a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), could significantly switch EBV from the latent stage to the lytic stage with increased gene expression of BZLF1 and BMRF1, but has a small effect on EBV replication due to the suppression effect of CDM-mediated ROS generation. Interestingly, a combination of BA and CDM synergistically inhibits EBV replication with ROS over-generation and subsequent DNA damage and apoptosis. Overexpression of SOD2 diminishes this effect, while SOD2 knockdown mimics this effect. An  xenograft tumor development study with the tail vein injection of EBV-transformed LCL cells in nude mice proves that the combination of BA and CDM synergistically increases superoxide anion release in tumor tissues and suppresses EBV replication and tumor growth, and significantly prolongs mouse survival.

BA pretreatment significantly reduced the inflammatory response to Carr-induced paw edema, especially at 4 h after injection. BA reduced the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CSF, KC, MCP-1 and PGE in Carr-treated mice, and increased those of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12. It also increased SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities, and GSH content, and reduced MDA content in the liver of Carr-treated mice. Besides, BA reduced neutrophil infiltration in the basal and subcutaneous layers of the paw of Carr-treated mice, decreased the expression of COX-2 protein, and reduced the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK1/2.

The examination of T. potatoria extract and its fractions was guided by bioassays for anti-mycobacterial activity against M. smegmatis (ATCC 23246) and M. aurum (NCTC 10437) using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. All the isolated compounds were structurally elucidated using spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their anti-mycobacterial activity.Two novel secondary metabolites (1, 2) named tetraceranoate and N-hydroxy imidate-tetracerane, together with five known compounds [β-stigmasterol (3), stigmast-5-en-3β-yl acetate (4),  (5), betulin (6) and lupeol (7)] were isolated and identified. Tetraceranoate exhibited the best activity against M. smegmatis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 7.8µg/mL, while β-stigmasterol,  and betulin showed appreciable anti-mycobacterial activity against both strains (MIC 15µg/mL).Seven compounds were isolated from the medium polar extract [MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v)] of T. potatoria stem bark. Only tetraceranoate one of the isolated compounds showed antibacterial activity against M. smegmatis having efficacy as high as rifampicin (one of a three drug regimen recommended in the initial phase short-course anti-tuberculosis therapy). Thus, tetraceranoate might be an interesting target for systematic testing of anti-TB treatment and management. This research supports the use of T. potatoria in African traditional medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis related symptoms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, not only malignant cells but also neighboring normal neurons and glial cells are damaged during PDT. In order to study the potential role of transcription factors-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), activator protein (AP-1), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)-in photodynamic injury of normal neurons and glia, we photosensitized the isolated crayfish mechanoreceptor consisting of a single sensory neuron enveloped by glial cells. Application of different inhibitors and activators showed that transcription factors NF-κB (inhibitors caffeic acid phenethyl ester and parthenolide, activator ), AP-1 (inhibitor SR11302), and STAT-3 (inhibitors stattic and cucurbitacine) influenced PDT-induced death and survival of neurons and glial cells in different ways. These experiments indicated involvement of NF-κB in PDT-induced necrosis of neurons and apoptosis of glial cells. However, in glial cells, it played the antinecrotic role. AP-1 was not involved in PDT-induced necrosis of neurons and glia, but mediated glial apoptosis. STAT-3 was involved in PDT-induced apoptosis of glial cells and necrosis of neurons and glia. Therefore, signaling  that regulate cell death and survival in neurons and glial cells are different. Using various inhibitors or activators of transcription factors, one can differently influence the sensitivity and resistance of neurons and glial cells to PDT.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27593449>Evaluation of seasonal changes of triterpenic acid contents in Viscum album from different host trees.</a></h2><p>Viscum album L.

The effects may be related to the presence of triterpenic acids, such as betulinic (BA) and oleanolic (OA) acids.In our investigations the content of triterpenic acids in V. album from different host trees depending on the season of harvest was determined.V. album herb was dried and extracted with ethyl acetate using ultrasound energy. The reversed phase HPLC-PDA method was used for the analysis of triterpenic acids. The structure of the target components was confirmed by mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization source.Diversity in the content of both compounds was noted; however, OA was the dominant triterpenic acid and the amount thereof was ∼10 times higher than that of BA. The analysis of changes in the amount of triterpenic acids during the spring-winter period revealed the highest content of OA in summer (from 6.84 to 13.65 mg/g). In turn, in the other seasons of harvest, the content was in the range of 4.41-9.83, 6.41-9.56 and 5.59-12.16 mg/g for spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In most cases, a similar tendency was observed for BA.In most cases, the highest amount of the investigated compounds was found in summer; thus, this period seems to be optimal for acquisition of plant material rich in triterpenic acids.</p><p>Keyword:['SCFA', 'energy', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482309>Alkyl Amine Bevirimat Derivatives Are Potent and Broadly Active HIV-1 Maturation Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Concomitant with the release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles from the infected cell, the viral protease cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor at a number of sites to trigger virus maturation. We previously reported that a -derived compound, bevirimat (BVM), blocks HIV-1 maturation by disrupting a late step in protease-mediated Gag processing: the cleavage of the capsid-spacer peptide 1 (CA-SP1) intermediate to mature CA. BVM was shown in multiple clinical trials to be safe and effective in reducing viral loads in HIV-1-infected patients. However, naturally occurring polymorphisms in the SP1 region of Gag (e.g., SP1-V7A) led to a variable response in some BVM-treated patients. The reduced susceptibility of SP1-polymorphic HIV-1 to BVM resulted in the discontinuation of its clinical development. To overcome the loss of BVM activity induced by polymorphisms in SP1, we carried out an extensive medicinal chemistry campaign to develop novel maturation inhibitors. In this study, we focused on alkyl amine derivatives modified at the C-28 position of the BVM scaffold. We identified a set of derivatives that are markedly more potent than BVM against an HIV-1 clade B clone (NL4-3) and show robust antiviral activity against a variant of NL4-3 containing the V7A polymorphism in SP1. One of the most potent of these compounds also strongly inhibited a multiclade panel of primary HIV-1 isolates. These data demonstrate that C-28 alkyl amine derivatives of BVM can, to a large extent, overcome the loss of susceptibility imposed by polymorphisms in SP1.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Considering that BA is naturally produced in small quantities in plants, we previously reported the success in engineering its production in yeast. In the present study, we attempted to improve BA biosynthesis in yeast by the use of different strategies.We first isolated a gene encoding a lupeol C-28 oxidase (LO) from Betula platyphylla (designated as BPLO). BPLO showed a higher activity in BA biosynthesis compared to the previously reported LOs. In addition, two yeast platforms were compared for engineering the production of BA, which demonstrated that the WAT11 strain was better to host BA pathway than the CEN.PK strain.

The crude extracts were evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. On the basis of results obtained, the methanolic crude extract of Cornus capitata Wall. was further sequentially fractionated in hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol. Fractions obtained were also evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory potential. The kinetic study was performed using Lineweaver Burk plot to evaluate the type of inhibition. Furthermore, in silico analysis was also carried with active sites of the enzyme (PDB ID: 3WY1) using Autodock4.Among all the plant extracts, Cornus capitata extract showed maximum inhibitory activity. Therefore its methanolic extract was further fractionated with the help of different solvents and the maximum activity was shown by the ethyl acetate fraction (IC 50 μg/mL). Kinetic analysis indicated that Vmax and Km were increased indicating a competitive type of inhibition. In docking studies, among different constituents known in this plant,  showed minimum binding energy (- 10.21 kcal/mol).

The discovery of food components that can ameliorate NAFLD is therefore of interest.  (BA) is a triterpenoid with many pharmacological activities, but the effect of BA on  is as yet unknown. To explore the possible anti- effects and their underlying mechanisms, we used insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, primary rat hepatocytes and  tissue from ICR mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Oil Red O staining revealed that BA significantly suppressed excessive triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells and in the livers of mice fed a HFD. Ca(+2)-calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase (CAMKK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were both activated by BA treatment. In contrast, the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase (S6K) were all reduced when hepatocytes were treated with BA for up to 24h. We found that BA activates AMPK via phosphorylation, suppresses SREBP1 mRNA expression, nuclear translocation and repressed SREBP1 target gene expression in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes, leading to reduced lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. These effects were completely abolished in the presence of STO-609 (a CAMKK inhibitor) or compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), indicating that the BA-induced reduction in hepatic steatosis was mediated via the CAMKK-AMPK-SREBP1 signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that BA effectively ameliorates intracellular lipid accumulation in  cells and thus is a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of  disease.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Taking protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) as an example, 4-aminophenyl phosphate (APP) can be hydrolyzed into 4-aminophenol (AP) by PTP1B, resulting in the disappearance of the phosphate group on the outer layer of MNPs and the loss of corresponding adsorptive ability. Upon addition of TC/AuNP solution, TC/AuNPs will remain in the supernatant solution after magnetic separation and a high absorbance value can be observed. So PTP1B activity is related to the concentrations of TC/AuNPs in the supernatant solution. In this work, the enzyme activity can be determined at levels as low as 0.0885 U mL(-1) and over a linear detection range as wide as 0.1 U mL(-1) to 0.9 U mL(-1).

In this study, coussaric acid (CA) and  (BA), both triterpenoid compounds, were obtained from D. kaki leaf extracts through bioassay-guided isolation. CA and BA showed anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, providing important information on their anti-inflammatory mechanism. Furthermore, they markedly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels.

Evidence suggests that oxidative stress can effectively enhance macrophage LPL production.  (BA) is a pentacyclic lupane triterpene with a potent antioxidant activity. In this study, we investigated whether BA affects the expression of macrophage LPL and how it regulates cellular lipid accumulation.We revealed that BA downregulated H2O2-simulated macrophage LPL protein, mRNA levels and its activity in both concentration- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, BA decreased LPL-involved total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in macrophages. In addition, cellular lipid staining by Oil Red O showed that BA decreased cellular lipid droplet deposition. Next, we confirmed that pretreatment with BA decreased H2O2-induced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that BA inhibited H2O2-induced membrane translocation of PKC, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Fos. Finally, the induction of LPL production and activity by H2O2 was abolished by BA, inhibition of PKC or ERK or depletion c-Fos, respectively.BA, through its role of antioxidant activity, attenuated macrophage-derived LPL expression and activity induced by oxidative stress, and effectively reduced cellular lipid accumulation, likely through inhibition of the  involving PKC, ERK and c-Fos.

The QS system in multidrug resistant opportunistic pathogen, P. aeruginosa constitutes of three main regulatory circuits namely Las, Rhl, and Pqs which are closely linked to its pathogenicity and establishment of chronic infections. In spite intensive antibiotic therapy, P. aeruginosa continue to be an important cause of nosocomial infections and also the major cause of mortality in Cystic Fibrosis patients with 80% of the adults suffering from chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Hence, targeting QS circuit offers an effective intervention to the ever increasing problem of drug resistant pathogens. In the present study, the pentacyclic triterpenes i.e. Betulin (BT) and  (BA) exhibited significant attenuation in production of QS-regulated virulence factors and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa, at the sub-lethal concentration. The test compound remarkably interfered in initial stages of biofilm development by decreasing the exopolysaccharide production and cell surface hydrophobicity. Based on the in vivo studies, the test compounds notably enhanced the survival of Caenorhabditis elegans infected with P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed that BT and BA can act as a strong competitive inhibitor for QS receptors, LasR and RhlR. The findings suggest that BT and BA can serve as potential anti-infectives in the controlling chronic infection of P. aeruginosa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we hypothesized that this natural product rich in polyphenols might protect humans against DNA damage and its consequences. This has led to our investigation to find out if the fruit extract showed an ability to decrease the frequency of DNA damage (antigenotoxicity) induced by two known genotoxins namely an alkylating agent methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and a reactive  species (ROS) inducer hydrogen peroxide (HO). Human lymphocytes were incubated with the  fruit ethanol extracts (ZFE) or  (BA) followed by an exposure to either 50 μM of MMS or 250 μM of HO. Results suggest that ZFE (250, 500, 1000 μg/ml) and BA (10, 20, 40 μg/ml) were able to inhibit the DNA damaging effect caused by MMS and HO indicative of their protection against the genotoxin. This could be attributed to the interactions of the phenolics, flavonoid and BA present in the fruits. Additional  experiments were carried since BA is an important phytochemical detected in ample amounts in the fruit extract. Mice were primed with BA (2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg body weight) for a period of 6 days. The animals were injected with MMS (10 mg/kg body weight) 24 h later and sacrificed. The genotoxic activity of MMS was inhibited in a dose - related manner by BA. BA reduced the frequency of MMS - induced DNA damage in liver, kidney and bone marrow cells of mice thereby exhibiting its antigenotoxic properties. It could also reduce total glutathione level, lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide content in liver cells of mice through the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore taking into account the antioxidant and antigenotoxic properties, the consumption of the  fruit should be more popularized worldwide.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen', 'weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875662>[Construction of cell factories for production of lupeol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae].</a></h2><p>Lupane-type triterpenoids, such as , are derived from lupeol and have excellent properties in anti-HIV, anti-cancer activities and so on.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the antifibrotic potential of butein, betulin, and  and examine their mechanisms of action in vitro. This study was conducted in rat stellate cells (HSCs) that were treated with acetaldehyde, which is the most reactive product of ethanol metabolism. Butein, betulin, and  were preincubated with rat HSCs at non-toxic concentrations. Treatment effects were measured in regard to acetaldehyde-induced toxicity and cell migration, and several markers of HSC activation were evaluated, including smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) and procollagen I expression. In addition, changes in the release of reactive  species (ROS) and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and tumor growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and changes in the production of metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) were determined.

The induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells by DCM-DS is possibly due to the activation of pro-apoptotic JNK1 and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic ERK1, which in turn down-regulates anti-apoptotic BCL-2 to increase the BAX/BCL-2 ratio to initiate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The cell cycle arrest in DCM-DS-treated MDA-MB-231 cells is possibly via p53-independent but p21-dependent pathway.

The present study was designed to explore the effects of BA on OSCC KB cell proliferation in vitro and on implanted tumor growth in vivo and to examine the possible molecular mechanisms. The results showed that BA dose-dependently inhibited KB cell proliferation and decreased implanted tumor volume. In addition, BA significantly promoted mitochondrial apoptosis, as reflected by an increase in TUNEL+ cells and the activities of caspases 3 and 9, an increase in Bax expression, and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. BA significantly increased cell population in the G0/G1 phase and decreases the S phase cell number, indicating the occurrence of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. ROS generation was significantly increased by BA, and antioxidant NAC treatment markedly inhibited the effect of BA on apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation. BA dose-dependently increased p53 expression in KB cells and implanted tumors. p53 reporter gene activity and p53 binding in the promoters of Bax were significantly increased by BA. Knockdown of p53 blocked BA-induced increase in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell proliferation. NAC treatment suppressed BA-induced increase in p53 expression.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of salinity stress on the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of triterpenoids such as glycyrrhizin, , soyasaponins, and phytosterols in licorice root, as well as providing a phonemic platform to characterize antioxidant properties, glycyrrhizin, and total phenolic content. This study also includes measuring the gene expression level and glycyrrhizin content in leaves and roots of control plants. The studied genes included squalene synthase (SQS1 and SQS2), β-amyrin synthase (bAS), lupeol synthase (LUS), cycloartenol synthase (CAS), β-amyrin 11-oxidase (CYP88D6), and β-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (CYP93E6). Our results revealed that all of the mentioned genes were upregulated following the stress condition with different transcription rates. The highest increase (12-fold) was observed for the expression of the LUS gene, which is related to the  pathway. Also, the highest content of glycyrrhizin was observed at 72 h post-treatment, which was consistent with the upregulated transcription levels of the glycyrrhizin pathway genes especially SQS1 and CYP88D6 at the same time. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis proved the key role of SQS1 gene in the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin. Antioxidant activity and phenolic content also were increased following stress condition. A comparison between the expression levels of SQS1 and other genes involved in the production of glycyrrhizin, phytosterols, and soyasaponins revealed a similar transcription trend, which shows the gene expression in the roots was significantly higher than the leaves. In contrast, SQS2 and LUS genes displayed a higher expression in leaf tissues. The genes related to  biosynthetic pathway exhibited an expression rate different from other triterpenoid pathway genes, which could be observed in the leaves and roots of control plants and the roots of salt-treated plants. Furthermore, results showed that these two SQS genes have different expression rates due to different plant tissues (roots and leaves) and stress conditions. Importantly, in contrast to previous reports, we detected the glycyrrhizin in leaf tissues.

NO bioavailability is decreased in atherosclerosis due to increased NO inactivation by reactive  species and reduced NO synthesis. Various types of vascular pathophysiology are associated with oxidative stress, with NADPH oxidases as the major source of reactive  species. These inactivate NO. Also, oxidative stress is likely to be the main cause for oxidation of the essential NOS cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)).

It is also well-known for its multifaceted pharmacokinetics, entailing antibacterial, antimalarial, anti-HIV and antioxidant merits. Considering the escalating demand with diminishing bioresource of this molecule, the present study was undertaken that revealed the untapped potentials of Ocimum calli, contrasting to that in the in vitro derived leaves, as effective production alternative of BA in three out of four tested species (i.e. Ocimum basilicum, Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Ocimum sanctum excluding Ocimum grattisimum). Callus inductions were obtained in all the four species with different 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)/α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) concentrations with kinetin. Notably, 2,4-D favoured maximum callus growth in all whereas NAA proved beneficial for the highest metabolite yield in the calli of each BA-producing species. The O. basilicum calli demonstrated the maximum growth (growth index (GI) 678.7 ± 24.47) and BA yield (2.59 ± 0.55 % dry weight [DW]), whereas those in O. kilimandscharicum (GI 533.33 ± 15.87; BA 1.87 ± 0.6 % DW) and O. sanctum (GI 448 ± 16.07; BA 0.39 ± 0.12 % DW) followed a descending order. The O. gratissimum calli revealed minimum growth (GI 159 ± 13.25) with no BA accumulation. Elicitation with methyl jasmonate at 200-μM concentration after 48-h exposure doubled the BA yield (5.10 ± 0.18 % DW) in NAA-grown O. basilicum calli compared to that in the untreated counterpart (2.61 ± 0.19 % DW), which further enthused its future application.</p><p>Keyword:['weight']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26178652>Potent Insulin Secretagogue from Scoparia dulcis Linn of Nepalese Origin.</a></h2><p>Ethno-botanical inspired isolation from plant Scoparia dulcis Linn.

The present study demonstrates the potential effects of self assembled nano size  (SA-BA) by treating human leukemic cell lines (KG-1A and K562) and its normal counterpart. Self assembly property of BA was investigated using SEM and DLS study which showed that the BA forms fibrous structure having few nanometers in diameter. Selective anti-leukemic efficacy study of SA-BA was investigated by cell viability assay. Mode of leukemic cell death and probable pathway of apoptosis was monitored by measuring ROS level, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine status and expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry. Higher efficacy of SA-BA over non-assemble BA was monitored toward cancer cells, with no relevant toxicity to normal blood cells. SA-BA facilitated reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated leukemic cell death, confirmed by pre-treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Induction of apoptosis by SA-BA treatment increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically potentiated TNF-α mediated cell death, confirmed by expression of caspase-8 and caspage-3 by immunocytochemistry. This study explored the better anti-leukemic efficacy of SA-BA over BA and this modification will enrich the use of BA in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Arthritis was induced by bovine type II collagen dissolved in 0.01M acetic acid at a concentration of 4mg/mL and emulsified in equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant.  (2mg/kg) and fluvastatin (5mg/kg) alone and in combination was administered orally from day 14 to 60. At the end of 60days, tissues and blood were isolated for evaluation of biochemical parameters. Treatment with  and fluvastatin showed significant (p<0.05) reduction in Arthritic index, Rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), total lipids and anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibody. Anti-inflammatory enzyme activities and oxidative stress were significantly decreased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the administration of both  and fluvastatin than alone treatments. Combination therapy was found to be a potential enhancer of the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 whereas it significantly blocked the expression of Toll-like receptors-2 and 4, inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, Interferon-γ, cell adhesion molecules and nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in aorta than drug alone treated groups.

(BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to have a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study was designed to determine whether BA could prevent atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (ApoE KO) mice. The mice were treated with BA for 12 weeks to examine its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Male ApoE KO mice and age-matched control group mice (C57BL/6Jms) were used as experimental systems and their systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation were measured. BA-treated ApoE KO mice showed lowered systolic blood pressure. The  parameter showed that BA decreased blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Blood glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance results, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were found to be better in BA-treated ApoE KO mice than untreated ApoE KO mice. Consistent with the change in lipid profiles, oil red O and H&E staining revealed that treatment with BA reduced atherosclerotic lesions such as roughened endothelial layers. BA ameliorated the reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, leading to the inhibition of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) expression. These results suggest that BA may be useful in the treatment and prevention of early atherosclerosis via the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ApoE KO mice.Copyright © 2017.

Expression of the neurosteroid/bile acid receptor Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) has been demonstrated in the brain and is thought to be neuroprotective. However, it is unknown how TGR5 signaling can influence the progression and associated neuroinflammation of HE. HE was induced in C57Bl/6 mice via intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM) and tissue was collected throughout disease progression. TGR5 expression was elevated in the frontal cortex following AOM injection in mice. The cellular localization of TGR5 was found in both neurons and microglia in the cortex of C57Bl/6 mice. Central infusion of the TGR5 agonist, , prior to AOM injection delayed neurological decline, increased cortical cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations, reduced microglia activation and proliferation, and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production.  treatment in vitro reduced the neuronal expression of chemokine ligand 2, a chemokine previously demonstrated to contribute to HE pathogenesis. Lastly, treatment of the microglia cell line EOC-20 with conditioned media from -treated primary neurons decreased phagocytic activity and cytokine production. Together, these data identify that activation of TGR5, which is up-regulated during HE, alleviates neuroinflammation and improves outcomes of AOM-treated mice through neuron and microglia paracrine signaling.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347681>Sorafenib in Combination with  Synergistically Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Inhibits Clonogenic Activity in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers in the world due to late diagnosis and poor response to available treatments.

However, drug development remains slow, expensive, and risky. Here, this manuscript proposes a leading compound discovery strategy based on a combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulae and pharmacochemistry, using a ligustrazine- derivative (BA-12) in the treatment of angiogenesis as an example. Blocking angiogenesis to inhibit the growth and metastasis of solid tumors is currently one recognized therapy for cancer in the clinic. Firstly, based on a traditional  plaster, BA-12 was synthesized according to our previous study, as it exhibited better antitumor activities than other derivatives on human bladder carcinoma cells (T24); it was then uploaded for target prediction. Secondly, the efficacy and biotoxicity of BA-12 on angiogenesis were evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a quail chick chorioallantoic membrane, and . According to the prediction results, the main mechanisms of BA-12 were metabolic pathways. Thus, multiple metabolomics approaches were applied to reveal the mechanisms of BA-12. Finally, the predictive mechanisms of BA-12 on glutathione metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism activation were validated using targeted metabolomics and pharmacological assays. This strategy may provide a reference for highly efficient drug discovery, with the aim of sharing TCM wisdom for unmet clinical needs.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26988305>Inhibitors of HIV-1 maturation: Development of structure-activity relationship for C-28 amides based on C-3 benzoic acid-modified triterpenoids.</a></h2><p>We have recently reported on the discovery of a C-3 benzoic acid (1) as a suitable replacement for the dimethyl succinate side chain of bevirimat (2), an HIV-1 maturation inhibitor that reached Phase II clinical trials before being discontinued.

Primary structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis and docking simulations revealed that the carboxyl group at the C-28 site of BA is very essential for CES1 inhibition. The inhibition kinetic analyses demonstrated that BA was a potent competitive inhibitor against CES1-mediated DME hydrolysis. Further investigation on the inhibitory effect of BA in living cells (HepG2) based assays demonstrated that BA displayed potent inhibitory effects on intracellular CES1 activities, with the low IC value of 1.30 μM.

(BA) and betulin (BE) are pentacyclic triterpenoids with anti-oxidative property, but little is known about their effect on RPE cells. We investigated the protective effect of BA, BE and their derivatives against cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia stress in RPE cells. Human ARPE-19 cells were exposed to BA, BE and their eighteen derivatives (named as H3H20) that we customized through replacing moieties at C3 and C28 positions. We found that cobalt chloride reduced cell viability, increased Reactive  Species (ROS) production as well as induced apoptosis and necrosis in ARPE-19 cells. Interestingly, the pretreatment of 3-O-acetyl-glycyl- 28-O-glycyl- effectively protected cells from acute hypoxia stress induced by cobalt chloride. Our immunoblotting results suggested that this derivative attenuated the cobalt chloride-induced activation of Akt, Erk and JNK pathways. All findings were further validated in human primary RPE cells. In summary, this BA derivate has protective effect against the acute hypoxic stress in human RPE cells and may be developed into a candidate agent effective in the prevention of prevalent retinal diseases.Copyright © 2018.

(Lecythidaceae) is a large tree found throughout India in deciduous forests and grasslands. C. arborea is traditionally used in tumors, , anthelmintic, bronchitis, epileptic fits, astringents, antidote to snake-venom, skin disease, diarrhea, dysentery with bloody stools, dyspepsia, ulcer, tooth ache, and ear pain.In our previous work, the methanolic extract of Careya arborea stem bark showed significant anti-inflammatory activity. As a continuity of that work, this study aimed at the isolation and evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect of coumaroyl lupendioic acid, a new lupane-type triterpene from Careya arborea stem bark. Further, to give an insight into the underlying mechanism of action of the compound on the modulation of proinflammatory mediators.Methanolic extract of Careya arborea stem bark was suspended in water, and sequentially fractionated with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. Further ethyl acetate fraction was subjected to medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) to isolate the active molecules. The isolated compounds were characterized by the various spectral techniques namely UV, IR, H NMR, C NMR, DEPT, H-H COSY, HMBC and Mass spectral techniques. In vitro COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition assays using human whole blood was performed to investigate the inhibitory effect of the isolated compounds. The resulted potent COX-2 inhibitor of the isolated constituents compound 5, designated as coumaroyl lupendioic acid (CLA), was investigated in carrageenan induced  and its effect was also compared with  (BA) at the doses of 10 and 20mgkg, p.o. using indomethacin and celecoxib (10 and 20mgkg, p.o., respectively) as reference drugs. The effect of CLA on the production of NO, MPO, PGE2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were assessed. In addition, the histopathology and immunohistochemistry (NF-ҡB, COX-2 and TNF-α protein expression) in paw tissues were also carried out.The chromatographic fractionation of the methanolic extract resulted in isolation of six new derivatives of lupane type triterpenes for the first time from the stem bark of C. arborea; 3β-hydroxy-lup-5,20 (29),21-trien-28-oic acid (Compound 1), 1, 3, 13, 16-tetrahydroxy-lup-9(11), 20(29)-diene-28-oic acid (Compound 2), 1, 7-di hydroxy  (Compound 3), 3β-O-dihydrocinnamyl  (Compound 4), 3β-O-trans-coumaryl-lup-6, 9(11), 20(29)-triene-27, 28-dioic acid (Compound 5), 16β-hydroxy-2, 3-seco-lup-5, 20(29)-dien-2, 3, 28-trioic acid (Compound 6). Among the all isolated compounds 3β-O-trans-coumaryl-lup-6, 9(11), 20(29)-triene-27, 28-olioic acid designated as coumaroyl lupendioic acid (CLA) showed higher COX-2 selectivity which is comparable to reference drug (celecoxib). CLA significantly reduced carrageenan induced  whereas CLA revealed greater effect as compared to BA at the similar corresponding doses. Moreover, CLA significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators elevated by carrageenan. CLA also preserved the tissue architecture as evidenced by the histopathology. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies revealed that CLA significantly down regulated NF-ҡB, COX-2 and TNF-α protein expression.The study gives an insight into the molecular mechanisms of coumaroyl lupendioic acid and suggests that the down-regulations of proinflammatory mediators provide credence to the ethno botanical use of the plant in the management of .Copyright © 2017.

Members of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARP) familyare involved in both DNA repair and apoptosis, playing important roles in spermatogenesis. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase can be cleaved by caspases, and the presence of its cleavage product (cPARP) in spermatozoa has been related to chromatin remodelling during spermatogenesis and to the activation of apoptotic . There are no reports on immunodetection of cPARP in ram spermatozoa; thus, we have tested a commercially available antibody for this purpose. cPARP was microscopically detected in the acrosomal ridge of some spermatozoa (indirect immunofluorescence). A preliminary study was carried out by flow cytometry (direct immunofluorescence, FITC). Ram semen was extended in TALP and incubated for 4 h with apoptosis inducers staurosporine (10 μm) or  (200 μm). Both inducers and incubation caused a significant increase in cPARP spermatozoa (0 h, control: 21.4±3.3%, inducers: 44.3±1.4%; 4 h, control: 44.3±2.4%, inducers: 53.3±1.4%). In a second experiment, we compared the sperm fractions after density gradient separation (pellet and interface). The pellet yielded a slightly lower proportion of cPARP spermatozoa (28.5±1.2% vs 36.2±2.0% in the interface; p < 0.001), and a 12-h incubation increased cPARP similarly in both fractions (p < 0.001). cPARP seems to be an early marker of apoptosis in ram semen, although its presence in untreated samples was weakly related to worse quality (pellet/interface). We suggest to study the relationship of PARP and cPARP levels with between-male differences on sperm fertility.© 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253391>Attenuation of Remifentanil-Induced Hyperalgesia by  Associates with Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Spinal Dorsal Horn.</a></h2><p>Remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia (RIH) is known to be associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.  (BA) was reported to reduce visceral pain owing to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential. Here, we -explored whether BA can attenuate RIH through inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation in spinal dorsal horn. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control, Incision, RIH, and RIH pre-treated with BA. After pretreated with BA (25 mg/kg, i.g.) for 7 days, rats were subcutaneously infused with remifentanil (40 μg/kg) for 30 min during right plantar incision surgery to induce RIH. The paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT), paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL), spinal oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators were determined. Intraoperative remifentanil infusion induced postoperative hyperalgesia, as evidenced by the significant decrease in PWMT and PWTL (p < 0.01), and the significant increase in oxidative stress and inflammation evidenced by up-regulations of malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α (p < 0.01) in spinal dorsal horn and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity (p < 0.01) in dorsal root ganglion, as well as a decrease in manganese superoxide -dismutase activity (p < 0.01) compared with control and -incision groups. All these results mentioned above were markedly reversed by pre-treatment with BA (p < 0.01) compared with RIH group. These findings demonstrated that BA can effectively attenuate RIH, which associates with potentially inhibiting oxidative stress and subsequently down-regulating MMP-9-related pro-inflammatory cyokines in spinal dorsal horn.© 2018 S.

However, the natural abundance of these triterpenoids is low, and their chemical synthesis is costly. Transcription factors have the ability to regulate the metabolite pathways of triterpenoids via multi-gene control, thereby improving metabolite yield. Thus, transcription factors have the potential to facilitate the production of birch triterpenoids. Plant bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factors play important roles in stress response and secondary metabolism.In this study, we cloned two genes, BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9, that encode bHLH transcription factors in Betula platyphylla Suk. The open reading frame (ORF) of BpMYC4 was 1452 bp and encoded 483 amino acids, while the ORF of BpbHLH9 was 1140 bp and encoded 379 amino acids. The proteins of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 were localized in the cell membrane and nucleus. The tissue-specific expression patterns revealed that BpMYC4 expression in leaves was similar to that in the stem and higher than in the roots. The expression of BpbHLH9 was higher in the leaves than in the root and stem. The expressions of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 increased after treatment with abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and gibberellin and decreased after treatment with ethephon. The promoters of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 were isolated using a genome walking approach, and 900-bp and 1064-bp promoter sequences were obtained for BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9, respectively. The ORF of BpbHLH9 was ligated into yeast expression plasmid pYES3 and introduced into INVScl and INVScl1-pYES2-SS yeast strains. The squalene and total triterpenoid contents in the different INVScl1 transformants decreased in the following order INVScl1-pYES-SS-bHLH9 > INVScl1-pYES3-bHLH9 > INVScl1-pYES2- BpSS > INVScl-pYES2. In BpbHLH9 transgenic birch, the relative expression of the genes that encodes for enzymes critical for triterpenoid synthesis showed a different level of up-regulation compair with wild birch(control), and the contents of , oleanolic acid and betulin in bHLH9-8 transgenic birch were increased by 11.35%, 88.34% and 23.02% compared to in wild birch, respectively.Our results showed that the modulation of BpbHLH9 by different hormones affected triterpenoid synthesis and triterpenoid contents. This is the first report of the cloning of BpbHLH9, and the findings are important for understanding the regulatory role of BpbHLH9 in the synthesis of birch triterpenoids.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22089811>Does NAD(P)H oxidase-derived H2O2 participate in hypotonicity-induced insulin release by activating VRAC in β-cells?</a></h2><p>NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX)-derived H(2)O(2) was recently proposed to act, in several cells, as the signal mediating the activation of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) under a variety of physiological conditions. The present study aims at investigating whether a similar situation prevails in insulin-secreting BRIN-BD11 and rat β-cells. Exogenous H(2)O(2) (100 to 200 μM) at basal glucose concentration (1.1 to 2.8 mM) stimulated insulin secretion. The inhibitor of VRAC, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB) inhibited the secretory response to exogenous H(2)O(2). In patch clamp experiments, exogenous H(2)O(2) was observed to stimulate NPPB-sensitive anion channel activity, which induced cell membrane depolarization. Exposure of the BRIN-BD11 cells to a hypotonic medium caused a detectable increase in intracellular level of reactive  species (ROS) that was abolished by diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), a universal NOX inhibitor. NOX inhibitors such as DPI and plumbagin nearly totally inhibited insulin release provoked by exposure of the BRIN-BD11 cells to a hypotonic medium. Preincubation with two other drugs also abolished hypotonicity-induced insulin release and reduced basal insulin output: 1) N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor that serves as general antioxidant and 2)  a compound that almost totally abolished NOX4 expression. As NPPB, each of these inhibitors (DPI, plumbagin, preincubation with NAC or ) strongly reduced the volume regulatory decrease observed following a hypotonic shock, providing an independent proof that VRAC activation is mediated by H(2)O(2). Taken together, these data suggest that NOX-derived H(2)O(2) plays a key role in the insulin secretory response of BRIN-BD11 and native β-cells to extracellular hypotonicity.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26467010>Growth inhibitive effect of  combined with tripterine on MSB-1 cells and its mechanism.</a></h2><p>Marek's disease (MD), a highly infectious lymphoproliferative disease in chickens, is caused by a cell-associated oncogenic herpesvirus, Marek's disease virus (MDV).

The conservation data of genus Symplocos showed risk of extinction due to restricted distribution in the wild hence systematic techniques should be developed for the maintenance of this plant.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

L.). Betulin and  are structurally related to anti-inflammatory steroids, but little is known about their potential anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, the inflammatory gene expression and the anti-inflammatory properties of betulin, , and 16 semisynthetic betulin derivatives were investigated. Betulin derivatives 3, 4, and 5 selectively inhibited the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in a post-transcriptional manner. They also inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production but had no effect on the other inflammatory factors studied. More interestingly, a new anti-inflammatory betulin derivative 9 with a wide-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity was discovered. Compound 9 was found to suppress the expression of cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as that of prostaglandin synthase-2 (COX-2) in addition to iNOS. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of compound 9 was indicated via significant suppression of the carrageenan-induced paw inflammation in mice.

For many years, compounds derived from plants have been at the forefront as an important source of anticancer therapies and have played a vital role in the prevention and treatment of cancer because of their availability, and relatively low toxicity when compared with chemotherapy. More than 3000 plant species have been reported to treat cancer and about thirty plant-derived compounds have been isolated so far and have been tested in cancer clinical trials. The mechanisms of action of plant-derived anticancer drugs are numerous and most of them induce apoptotic cell death that may be intrinsic or extrinsic, and caspase and/or p53-dependent or independent mechanisms. Alternative modes of cell death by plant-derived anticancer drugs are emerging and include mainly autophagy, necrosis-like programmed cell death, mitotic catastrophe, and senescence leading to cell death. Considering that the non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms of plant-derived anticancer drugs are less reviewed than the apoptotic ones, this paper attempts to focus on such alternative cell death  for some representative anticancer plant natural compounds in clinical development. In particular, emphasis will be on some promising polyphenolics such as resveratrol, curcumin, and genistein; alkaloids namely berberine, noscapine, and colchicine; terpenoids such as parthenolide, triptolide, and ; and the organosulfur compound sulforaphane. The understanding of non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms induced by these drugs would provide insights into the possibility of exploiting novel molecular  and targets of plant-derived compounds for future cancer therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213701>Ursolic acid-mediated changes in glycolytic pathway promote cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis in phenotypically different breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenotids with multiple biological activities are considered as promising candidates for cancer therapy and prevention. However, their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. In the present study, we have analyzed the effects of low dose treatment (5-20 µM) of ursolic acid (UA) and  (BA) on breast cancer cells of different receptor status, namely MCF-7 (ER, PR, HER2), MDA-MB-231 (ER, PR, HER2) and SK-BR-3 (ER, PR, HER2). UA-mediated response was more potent than BA-mediated response. Triterpenotids (5-10 µM) caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, an increase in p21 levels and SA-beta-galactosidase staining that was accompanied by oxidative stress and DNA damage. UA (20 µM) also diminished AKT signaling that affected glycolysis as judged by decreased levels of HK2, PKM2, ATP and lactate. UA-induced energy stress activated AMPK that resulted in cytotoxic autophagy and apoptosis. UA-mediated elevation in nitric oxide levels and ATM activation may also account for AMPK activation-mediated cytotoxic response. Moreover, UA-promoted apoptosis was associated with decreased pERK1/2 signals and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, we have shown for the first time that UA at low micromolar range may promote its anticancer action by targeting glycolysis in phenotypically distinct breast cancer cells.</p><p>Keyword:['energy', 'glycolysis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398872>Water Stress, Irrigation and Concentrations of Pentacyclic Triterpenes and Phenols in  L. cv.

Triterpenes, including oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, erythrodiol and uvaol, show antitumoral activities, and phenols such as oleuropein, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosol are natural antioxidants. The concentration of these metabolites is considered a marker of the quality of olives and olive oil. In recent years, a lack of rain water has caused important economic losses relating to olive trees grown in Jaén, Spain. In this work, we investigated the effect of water stress by drought on the concentration of pentacyclic triterpenes and phenols in the fruits, leaves, stems and roots of cv. Picual olive trees, by comparing the concentration found in water-stressed versus irrigated plants. We used HPLC-UV/Vis and HPLC-MS to identify and determine the concentration of each individual compound. Our results showed that important changes in the concentration of these compounds are produced in response to water stress in different organs.

In this work we determined the inhibitory ability of these compounds on the enzymatic, hemorrhagic, myotoxic and edema-inducing activities of Batx-I, a P-I metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops atrox venom. BA, UA and OA inhibited the proteolytic activity of Batx-I on gelatin with IC values of 115.3, 223.0 and 357.3 μM, respectively. Additionally, these compounds showed inhibition of the hemorrhagic activity of Batx-I in skin with IC 345.7, 643.5 and 1077.0 μM for BA, UA and OA in preincubation experiments. In studies with independent-injection, in which Batx-I was injected and then, at the same site, a concentration of 600 μM of each compound were administered at either 0, 5 or 10 min, BA showed a significant reduction of hemorrhage at 0 and 5 min.

It is therefore of high importance to find methods to reduce cadmium accumulation in the human body. Herein, we report that administration of  (BA) protects mice from cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced toxicity by inhibiting cadmium-induced apoptosis in both kidney and liver. Mice were given oral doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of BA daily for ten consecutive days, and were injected with one dose of 1 mg/kg CdCl2 after one hour of BA administration every day. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were assessed by ELISA. Residual cadmium was determined by atomic absorption analysis. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. Pretreatment with BA significantly reduced residual cadmium levels in the liver, kidney and testis, increased the cadmium output in urine, and reduced tissue damage induced by CdCl2. Moreover, BA prevented body weight loss by CdCl2 in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, BA treatment increased the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), decreased Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), and inhibited the levels of active caspase-3. Importantly, BA within a dose of 30 mg/kg did not induce any signs of toxicity, and protected mice from the toxicity induced by CdCl2 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that BA inhibits CdCl2 induced apoptosis in the kidney and liver, and BA may be an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of cadmium-induced diseases in humans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Damage of the parotid glands are caused by radical  species (ROS) as by-products of  metabolism. This study investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on Carbachol (CCh)-evoked secretory responses and caspase-3 activity in the isolated rat parotid gland to understand the role of oxidative stress on the function of the gland. Amylase secretion, cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and caspase-3 activity in parotid gland tissue were measured using fluorimetric methods. H(2)O(2) had little or no effect on amylase secretion compared to basal level. Combining H(2)O(2) with CCh resulted in an attenuation of the CCh-evoked amylase secretion compared to the effect of CCh alone. CCh can evoke a large increase in [Ca(2+)](i) comprising an initial peak followed by a plateau. In a Ca(2+)-free medium containing 1 mM EGTA, CCh evoked only the initial peak of [Ca(2+)](i). H(2)O(2) alone evoked a gradual and dose-dependent increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Combining H(2)O(2) with CCh resulted in a decrease in [Ca(2+)](i) compared to the effect of CCh alone. In a Ca(2+)-free medium, H(2)O(2) still evoked a small increase in [Ca(2+)](i), but this response was less compared to the results obtained with H(2)O(2) in normal [Ca(2+)](0). Combining H(2)O(2) with CCh resulted in only a small transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Following CCh stimulation, H(2)O(2) application resulted in a large increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in normal [Ca(2+)](0). This effect of H(2)O(2) was partially abolished in a nominally free Calcium medium containing EGTA. H(2)O(2) can stimulate caspase-3 activity in parotid gland tissue. Similar response was obtained with  and thapsigargin (TPS) on caspase-3 activity compared to basal. The results have demonstrated that like CCh, H(2)O(2) can also mobilise Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and facilitate its influx into the cell from extracellular medium. This effect of H(2)O(2) may be due to its activity to induce apoptosis in the parotid gland, since H(2)O(2) can stimulate the activity of caspase-3, a marker of cellular apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26721359>In vivo protective effect of  on dexamethasone induced thymocyte apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid, is strictly controlled for use due to its serious side effects, including immune suppression.

To assess the implications and investigate the mechanisms of BA-elicited immunomodulation, we hypothesized that Dex induced thymocyte apoptosis via oxidative stress could be lessened by BA.Mice were given oral doses of BA (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0mg/kg) daily for 14 days, and induced oxidative stress by giving a single dose of Dex intraperitoneal at the dosage of 25mg/kg body weight 8h after the last administration of BA.Dex administration alone significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, while significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, caspase-3 activation and cellular apoptosis. However, pretreatment with BA dose-dependently mitigated Dex-induced oxidative damage after 14 days of feeding. In addition to ROS scavenging activity in Dex-induced thymocyte, BA administration decreased lipid peroxidation, up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, restored mitochondrial function, increased Bcl-2 expression but reduced Bax expression, inhibited caspase-3 activation, and improved cell survival.These findings reveal a protective capability of BA against Dex-induced cell death by reducing oxidative stress via mitochondrial mediated signal pathway which could be the potential mechanism underlying BA-elicited immunomodulation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Acrosome reaction and apoptotic features decreased due to the reduction in intracellular calcium by the calcium chelator NP-EGTA, AM. Therefore, apoptotic cell death in acrosome-reacted sperm cells mediated by high intracellular calcium levels is possible.© 2018 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553912> inhibits the migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>The aggressive phenotype displayed by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) contributes to cartilage and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  has been demonstrated to have a positive therapeutic effect on tumor,  and immune disorder, however, the effects of  on RA FLSs have not been verified.

BA triggered an apoptosis pathway different from the one previously identified for standard chemotherapeutic drugs. BA-induced apoptosis was independent of CD95-ligand/receptor interaction and accumulation of wild-type p53 protein, but it critically depended on activation of caspases (interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme/Ced-3-like proteases). FLICE/MACH (caspase-8), considered to be an upstream protease in the caspase cascade, and the downstream caspase CPP32/YAMA/Apopain (caspase-3) were activated, resulting in cleavage of the prototype substrate of caspases PARP. The broad-spectrum peptide inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, which blocked cleavage of FLICE and PARP, also completely abrogated BA-triggered apoptosis. Cleavage of caspases was preceded by disturbance of mitochondrial membrane potential and by generation of reactive  species. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL conferred resistance to BA at the level of mitochondrial dysfunction, protease activation, and nuclear fragmentation. This suggested that mitochondrial alterations were involved in BA-induced activation of caspases. Furthermore, Bax and Bcl-xs, two death-promoting proteins of the Bcl-2 family, were up-regulated following BA treatment. Most importantly, neuroblastoma cells resistant to CD95- and doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis were sensitive to treatment with BA, suggesting that BA may bypass some forms of drug resistance. Because BA exhibited significant antitumor activity on patients' derived neuroblastoma cells ex vivo, BA may be a promising new agent for the treatment of neuroectodermal tumors in vivo.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25893306> induces a novel cell death pathway that depends on cardiolipin modification.</a></h2><p>Cancer is associated with strong changes in lipid .

(BetA) is a natural compound that selectively kills tumour cells through an ill-defined mechanism that is independent of BAX and BAK, but depends on mitochondrial permeability transition-pore opening. Here we unravel this pathway and show that BetA inhibits the activity of steroyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD-1). This enzyme is overexpressed in tumour cells and critically important for cells that utilize de novo FA synthesis as it converts newly synthesized saturated FAs to unsaturated FAs. Intriguingly, we find that inhibition of SCD-1 by BetA or, alternatively, with a specific SCD-1 inhibitor directly and rapidly impacts on the saturation level of cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrial lipid that has important structural and  functions and at the same time regulates mitochondria-dependent cell death. As a result of the enhanced CL saturation mitochondria of cancer cells, but not normal cells that do not depend on de novo FA synthesis, undergo ultrastructural changes, release cytochrome c and quickly induce cell death.

In hepatocytes from HBV-transgenic mice, we showed that BetA substantially inhibited HBV replication by downregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression, with subsequent reactive  species generation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Also, the HBV X protein (HBx) is suppressed and translocated into the mitochondria followed by cytochrome c release. Further investigation revealed that SOD2 expression was suppressed by BetA-induced cAMP-response element-binding protein dephosphorylation at Ser133, which subsequently prevented SOD2 transcription through the cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding motif on the SOD2 promoter. SOD2 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect of BetA on HBV replication, whereas SOD2 knockdown mimicked this effect, indicating that BetA-mediated HBV clearance was due to modulation of the mitochondrial redox balance. This observation was further confirmed in HBV-transgenic mice, where both BetA and PC crude extracts suppressed SOD2 expression, with enhanced reactive  species generation in liver tissues followed by substantial HBV clearance.

However, it is still controversial whether this apoptotic signaling is a relic of an abortive apoptosis related to spermatogenesis or if it should be regarded as a functional preformed pathway in mature sperm leading to stereotypical morphological changes reflecting nuclear disassembly. To address this question, apoptosis was induced using  in mature and immature ejaculated human sperm enriched by density gradient centrifugation. Execution of apoptosis was monitored by observing ultra-morphological changes via transmission electron microscopy. Typical morphological signs of apoptosis in somatic cells include plasma membrane blebbing with the formation of apoptotic bodies, impaired mitochondrial integrity, defects of the nuclear envelope, and nuclear fragmentation; these morphologies have also been observed in human sperm. In addition, these apoptotic characteristics were more frequent in immature sperm compared to mature sperm. Following  treatment, apoptosis-related morphological changes were induced in mature sperm from healthy donors. This effect was much less pronounced in immature sperm. Moreover, in both fractions, the  treatment increased the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm. The results of our ultra-morphological study prove the functional competence of apoptosis in mature ejaculated human sperm. The theory of a sole abortive process may be valid only for immature sperm.

They gained a great interest in the last decades as therapeutic agents since they provide inexpensive and less toxic products than the synthetic chemotherapeutic agents. Immunomodulators are the agents that have the ability to boost or suppress the host defense response that can be used as a prophylaxis as well as in combination with other therapeutic modalities. The anticancer activity of these immunomodulators is due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and induction of apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-metastasis effect. These natural immunomodulators such as genistein, curcumin, and resveratrol can be used as prophylaxis against the initiation of cancer besides the inhibition of tumor growth and proliferation. Whereas, immunostimulants can elicit and activate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the tumor that facilitate the recognition and destruction of the already existing tumor. This review represents the recent studies on various natural immunomodulators with antitumor effects.

This plant accumulates triterpenoids; however, compared to Medicago truncatula and Glycine max, less information regarding its composition, content, and biosynthesis is available. In this study, we analyzed the triterpenoid content and composition of L. japonicus. L. japonicus accumulated C-28-oxidized triterpenoids (ursolic, betulinic, and oleanolic acids) and soyasapogenols (soyasapogenol B, A, and E) in a tissue-dependent manner. We identified an oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) and two cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) involved in triterpenoid biosynthesis using a yeast heterologous expression system. OSC9 was the first enzyme derived from L. japonicus that showed α-amyrin (a precursor of ursolic acid)-producing activity. CYP716A51 showed triterpenoid C-28 oxidation activity. LjCYP93E1 converted β-amyrin into 24-hydroxy-β-amyrin, a metabolic intermediate of soyasapogenols. The involvement of the identified genes in triterpenoid biosynthesis in L. japonicus plants was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Furthermore, gene loss-of-function analysis of CYP716A51 and LjCYP93E1 was conducted. The cyp716a51-mutant L. japonicus hairy roots generated by genome-editing technique produced no C-28 oxidized triterpenoids. Likewise, complete abolition of soyasapogenols and soyasaponin I was observed in mutant plants harboring Lotus retrotransposon 1 (LORE1) in LjCYP93E1. These results indicate that the activities of these P450 enzymes are essential for triterpenoid biosynthesis in L. japonicus.

One handful of Tako-Na bark was boiled in water to make tea. He had vomiting and watery diarrhea six hours after drinking it. He took no medications and had no history of hypertension. The only remarkable vital sign was BP 167/90 mmHg. Physical examination revealed generalized muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 2.7 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, and transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) 5.6. He was discharged the next day with a BP 140/90 mmHg and potassium 4.2 mmol/L. Case 2: A 78-year-old man, a friend of case 1, also drank Tako-Na tea from the same pot at the same time as case 1. He also had vomiting and diarrhea six hours later. He took no medications despite past history of hypertension (baseline SBP 140-160). Initial BP was 230/70 mmHg. He also had muscle weakness. Laboratory findings were potassium 3.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mmol/L, TTKG 7.37 and normal thyroid function. He was also discharged the next day with a BP 148/70 mmHg and potassium 4.2 mmol/L.

It is used in ethnomedicinal practices for correction of gastrointestinal disturbances such as constipation and hemorrhoids. The present study evaluated the effect of A. paeoniifolius tuber on gastrointestinal motor functions.The tuber was collected in December 2011, and its methanolic extract was standardized with the major phenolic compound, , by high-performance liquid chromatography. Rats were orally administered methanolic (APME) or aqueous (APAE) extract (250 and 500 mg/kg, each) of tuber for 7 days. Metoclopramide (MET) (3 mg/kg, orally) was used a reference prokinetic drug. The gastrointestinal parameters viz. number of feces, wet and dry  and moisture content of feces, gastric emptying, and intestinal transit were evaluated. The isolated tissue preparations were used to check the effect of the extracts on fundus and intestinal contractility. The glucomannan and total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined spectrophotometrically.The pre-treatment of extracts significantly increased the number of feces, wet and dry  of feces, moisture content, gastric emptying, and intestinal transit. Results were comparable to MET. Further, APME and APAE showed a contraction of fundus and ileum in isolated preparations. APME and APAE were also found to have fair amount of glucomannan, total phenolics, and flavonoids. The results indicate the gastrokinetic potential of the tuber extracts.

In somatic cells, the loss of DeltaPsi(m) is primarily associated with several mechanisms of cell death, mainly the activation of caspases. The impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on sperm function is still not fully elucidated, although disruption of DeltaPsi(m) and activation of caspases are processes thoroughly studied in human ejaculates. Disruption of DeltaPsi(m) in sperm can be externally triggered by the antineoplastic agent  (BA). In this study, we determined whether caspase activation is necessary for the BA-induced disruption of DeltaPsi(m) in human sperm.Viable and highly motile sperm cells were selected through a swim-up process and incubated with 90 microg/ml BA. To elucidate the caspase dependency of BA-triggered disruption of DeltaPsi(m), we used the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and the caspase-3/7 inhibitor DEVD-cho.Exposing highly motile sperm to BA caused a specific disruption of DeltaPsi(m) (P < 0.001 versus control) and a corresponding increase in caspase-3/7 activity (P < 0.001 versus control). Pre-incubation of the sperm with zVAD-fmk or DEVD-cho only partially inhibited BA-induced loss of DeltaPsi(m) (P < 0.05 versus control).We found that caspases directly participate in the loss of DeltaPsi(m) caused by BA in human sperm cells.

The aqueous extract inhibited yeast α-glucosidase with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 28.6 μg/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of several compounds, including one cyanogenic glycoside [prunasin (1)], five flavonoids [(-)-epi-catechin (2), hyperoside (3), isoquercetin (4), quercitrin (5) and quercetin-3-O-(6''-benzoyl)-β-galactoside (6)] and two simple aromatic compounds [picein (7) and methylarbutin (8)]. The most active compound was 6 with IC50 values of 30 μM in the case of yeast α-glucosidase, and 437 μM in the case of the mammalian enzyme. According to the kinetic analyses performed with rat and yeast enzymes, this compound behaved as mixed-type inhibitor; the calculated inhibition constants (Ki) were 212 and 50 μM, respectively. Molecular docking analyses with yeast and mammalian α-glucosidases revealed that compound 6 bind differently to these enzymes.

The aim of this study is to evaluate antihyperlipidemic effect of  (BA) on streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA) induced diabetic mice. In this experimental study, seventy adult male NMRI mice (20-25 g) were divided randomly into seven groups ( = 10) of control, sham, diabetes, diabetes + BA (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), and diabetes + metformin (200 mg/kg). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a single dose of STZ (50 mg/kg) 15 min after an i.p. administration of nicotinamide (NA) (120 mg/kg). BA and metformin were orally administered and after two weeks blood samples were taken. Blood levels of leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile and liver enzyme were then measured. One day after the last drug administration, liver was removed to evaluate the histological changes. A significant increase ( < 0.05) in the plasma levels of leptin, alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), cholesterol, and a significant decrease in adiponectin and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed in diabetic mice. The groups treated with BA indicated a significant decrease in leptin, AST, ALT, ALP, TG, cholesterol, LDL-C and an increases in adiponectin and HDL levels, while VLDL did not show significant changes. BA was found to have positive effects on liver injury. BA has an effective role on liver damage induced by diabetes through amelioration of leptin, adiponectin, liver enzyme levels and lipid profile.

OA and UA inhibited the transcription of genes related to peptidoglycan biosynthesis, thereby preventing bacterial growth. However, it is not clear whether this is the only pathway involved in the antimicrobial activity of these compounds against S. mutans. Therefore, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarray analyses to examine the expression of genes related to essential metabolic pathways in S. mutans UA159 following incubation with OA, UA, or BA. An oligonucleotide array consisting of 5363 probes was designed to survey 1928 of the 1963 genes in the genome of S. mutans UA159. Genes that showed >2-fold changes in expression in response to the treatment conditions were annotated, and selected target genes involved in central metabolism were analyzed by qPCR. Microarray analysis confirmed that the gene expression patterns of the OA- and UA-treated cells differed from that of the BA-treated culture, indicating differences in the antimicrobial mechanism. In particular, the expression of pfk and pykF, coding for glycolysis regulatory proteins phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, respectively, were significantly decreased in the OA and UA groups (P < 0.05), as were genes involved in fatty acid and amino acid synthesis. In addition, the microarray analysis confirmed previous qPCR results showing that peptidoglycan synthesis is down-regulated in the OA- and UA-treated groups. OA and UA also appear to decrease the generation of organic acids by S. mutans UA159, which would have an anticaries effect. Overall, these findings suggest that OA and UA affect multiple genes involved in the central metabolism of S. mutans, with inhibition of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and peptidoglycan synthesis, all contributing to their antimicrobial activity.</p><p>Keyword:['glycolysis', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274214>Interactions between Triterpenes and a P-I Type Snake Venom Metalloproteinase: Molecular Simulations and Experiments.</a></h2><p>Small molecule inhibitors of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) could provide a means to rapidly halt the progression of local tissue damage following viperid snake envenomations.

Yarrowia lipolytica, as an oleaginous yeast, is a promising microbial cell factory for the production of highly hydrophobic compounds due to the ability of this organism to accumulate large amounts of lipids that can store hydrophobic products and supply sufficient precursors for terpene synthesis.

First, by screening 25 combinations of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs), each of which originated from 5 different sources, we selected two optimal -producing strains. Then, ERG1, ERG9, and HMG1 in the MVA module were overexpressed in the two strains, which dramatically increased  production and resulted in a strain (YLJCC56) that exhibited the highest  yield of 51.87 ± 2.77 mg/L.

In this study, we screened BA derivatives and found a BA derivative, SH479, that had a greater inhibitory effect on T17 differentiation. Our further analysis showed that SH479 had a greater inhibitory effect on T17 and T1, and a more stimulatory effect on regulatory T (Treg) cells. To evaluate the effects of SH479 on autoimmune diseases in vivo, we employed the extensively used MS mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results showed that SH479 ameliorated clinical and histologic signs of EAE in both prevention and therapeutic protocols by regulating the T17/Treg balance. SH479 dose-dependently reduced splenic lymphocyte proinflammatory factors and increased anti-inflammatory factors. Moreover, SH479 specifically inhibited splenic lymphocyte viability from EAE mice but not normal splenic lymphocyte viability. At the molecular level, SH479 inhibited T17 differentiation by regulating signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, DNA binding activity, and recruitment to the  promoter in CD4 T cells. Furthermore, SH479 promoted the STAT5 signaling pathway and inhibited the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) signaling pathway.

Here, we show that BA triggers apoptosis in five human glioma cell lines. BA-induced apoptosis requires new protein, but not RNA, synthesis, is independent of p53, and results in p21 protein accumulation in the absence of a cell cycle arrest. BA-induced apoptosis involves the activation of caspases that cleave poly(ADP ribose)polymerase. Interactions of death ligand/receptor pairs of the CD95/CD95 ligand family do not mediate BA-induced caspase activation. BA enhances the levels of BAX and BCL-2 proteins but does not alter the levels of BCL-xS or BCL-xL. Ectopic expression of BCL-2 prevents BA-induced caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Furthermore, BA induces the formation of reactive  species that are essential for BA-triggered cell death.

(BA) is a natural pentacyclic triterpene that has displayed moderate anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoclastogenesis activities in various experimental systems, suggesting that BA or its derivatives could have an inhibitory effect on RA. In this study, we screened BA derivatives and found a heterocyclic ring-fused BA derivative, SH479, which had greater inhibitory effect than BA on Th17 differentiation. Moreover, we investigated the immune regulatory activity and potential therapeutic effects of SH479 in an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis, the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. SH479 significantly inhibited Th1 and Th17 polarization, antigen-specific T cell proliferation and splenic lymphocyte-induced osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, it diminished arthritis scores as well as bone destruction and cartilage depletion in the CIA mouse model. The protective effect of SH479 was accompanied by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-γ, together with enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine expression including IL-10 and IL-4, as well as elevated CD4 Foxp3 cell number. At the molecular level, our results indicated that SH479 alleviated CIA through regulation of CD4 T cell subtypes by JAK-STAT . In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SH479 has therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis through an anti-inflammatory effect by shifting a pathogenic Th17/Th1 response to a Th2/Treg phenotype, and also through an additional articular bone protection effect.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In our study, we used current biomedical approaches to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of BXD and possible protective mechanism involved in inhibiting dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic ulcerative colitis model.Chronic DSS colitis was induced in C57BL/6 male mice by three cycles of 5 days of 2% DSS in drinking water, alternating with 5 days of normal water, totaling 30 days. In BXD group, the mice were administered at a dose of 8.7g/kg BXD for 5 days before and during DSS treatment via oral gavage per day. Mice in vehicle group and DSS group were given orally the same volume of drinking water, instead. Body weight, stool characters and hematochezia were observed everyday. The colorectal tissues were used to detect levels of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23 and MPO by ELISA or qRT-PCR. The expression of COX-2, 8-Oxoguanine and Nrf2 were examined by IHC, and p-p65 was examined by western blotting. ThOD and the content of MDA were measured according to kits respectively.BXD significantly protected against DSS-induced chronic ulcerative colitis by amelioration of body weight loss, DAI and histology score. The level of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, COX-2 and p-p65 were decreased significantly, while the level of IL-10 improved with the treatment of BXD. MDA, MPO and 8-Oxoguanine were decreased, meanwhile SOD activity and Nrf2 expression were elevated significantly by BXD.BXD possesses the potential of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation to treat colitis.

However, the effects of BA treatment on liver cancer have little to be known. Thus, the study is conducted to explore the in vitro and in vivo role of BA in liver cancer. And the interactions between BA and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand of APO2, also known as TRAIL, were investigated in liver cancer cells. A synergistic effect of BA and APO2 combination on apoptosis induction in liver cancer cells was observed. The cancer cells were insensitive to APO2 single therapy. However, liver cancer cells receiving BA were sensitive to APO2-triggered apoptotic response by enhancing Caspases cleavage, due to elevation of decoy receptor 1 and 2 (DcR1 and DcR2) dependent on p53. Bcl-2 family members of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, belonging to anti-apoptosis, were decreased, whereas Bad and Bak, as pro-apoptotic members, were increased for BA and APO2 combined treatment. Additionally, the mouse xenograft model suggested that BA and APO2 in combination markedly inhibited liver cancer growth in comparison to BA or APO2 monotherapy without toxicity.

However, the potential contributors eliminating pain associated with gingival inflammation are unknown. Results we examined the involvement of CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) on the mechanical sensitivity of inflamed periodontal tissue, using a mouse model of periodontitis established by the ligation of the tooth cervix of a maxillary second molar and inoculation with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Infiltration of inflammatory cells into gingival tissue was not observed following the inoculation. Under light anesthesia, the mechanical head withdrawal threshold (MHWT) on the buccal gingiva was measured using an electronic von Frey anesthesiometer. No significant changes in MHWT were observed in the mice with P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis during the experimental period. Continuous administration of CXCR4 neutralizing antibody to the gingival tissue significantly decreased MHWT and increased the number of gingival CXCR4 immunoreactive macrophages in the periodontitis group. Nitric oxide metabolites in the gingival tissue were significantly increased after the inoculation of P. gingivalis and were reduced by gingival CXCR4 neutralization. Gingival L-arginine administration induced gingival mechanical allodynia in naive animals. Moreover, the decrease in MHWT after treatment with P. gingivalis and CXCR4 neutralization was partially reversed by nitric oxide synthase inhibition in the gingival tissue. Nuclear factor-kappa B was expressed in infiltrating macrophages after inoculation of P. gingivalis and administration of the nuclear factor-kappa B activator  induced gingival mechanical allodynia in naive mice. Conclusions These findings suggest that CXCR4 signaling inhibits nitric oxide release from infiltrating macrophages and is involved in modulation of the mechanical sensitivity in the periodontal tissue in P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660337>Effect of  and its ionic derivatives on M-MuLV replication.</a></h2><p>Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is a retrovirus known causing leukemia and neurological disorders in mice, and its viral life cycle and pathogenesis have been investigated extensively over the past decades.

After a meal, approximately 95% of the bile acids are transported from terminal ileum and back to the liver via the portal vein, resulting in postprandial elevations of bile acids in blood. During the digestion of fat, components from the microbiota, including LPS, are thought to reach the circulation where it may lead to inflammatory responses after binding TLR4 immune cells. Both LPS and bile acids are present in blood after a high-fat meal; we therefore wanted to study consequences of a possible interplay between TGR5 and TLR4 in human monocytes.The monocytic cell line U937 stably transfected with the NF-κB reporter plasmid 3x-κB-luc was used as a model system to study the effects of TGR5 and TLR4. Activation of MAP kinases was studied to reveal functional consequences of triggering TGR5 in U937 cells. Effects of TGR5 and TLR4 activation were monitored using NF-κB luciferase assay and by quantification of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 using ELISA.In this study, results show that triggering TGR5 with the specific agonist  (BA), and the bile acids CDCA or DCA, activated both the main MAP kinases ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, and the NF-κB signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that co-triggering of TLR4 and TGR5 enhanced the activation of NF-κB and the release of inflammatory cytokines in a synergistic manner compared to triggering of TLR4 alone.Thus, two different and simultaneous events associated with the digestive process coordinately affect the function of human monocytes and contribute to enhanced inflammation. Because elevated levels of circulatory LPS may contribute to the development of insulin resistance, the results from this study suggest that bile acids through the activation of TGR5 may have a role in the development of insulin resistance as well.</p><p>Keyword:['fat metabolism', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183653>Synthesis, characterization and augmented anticancer potential of PEG- conjugate.</a></h2><p> (BA), a pentacyclic lupine-type triterpene, is reported to inhibit cell growth in a variety of cancers.

Among various plant secondary metabolites, terpenoids constitute the major component and triterpenoids are the 30C subset of it. In recent years, triterpenoids have drawn the attention of scientific community due to many of its potential and realized applications in medicine, drug delivery, thermochromic materials, pollutant capture, catalysis, liquid crystals, etc. In this personal review, we have discussed our computational results carried out on sixty representative naturally occurring triterpenoids demonstrating that all the triterpenoids are renewable functional nano-entities.

They do all occur in combination in European mistletoe (Viscum album L.). Commercial Viscum album L. extracts are aqueous, excluding the insoluble triterpenes. We have previously shown that mistletoe lectins and triterpene acids are effective against Ewing sarcoma in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.We recreated a total mistletoe effect (viscumTT) by combining an aqueous extract (viscum) and a triterpene extract (TT) solubilised with cyclodextrins and analysed the effects of viscumTT and the single extracts on TC-71 Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro by transcriptomic and proteomic profiling.Treatment with the extracts strongly impacted Ewing sarcoma cell gene and protein expression. Apoptosis-associated and stress-activated genes were upregulated, proteasomal protein abundance enhanced and ribosomal and spliceosomal proteins downregulated. The mechanism of action of viscum, TT and viscumTT in TC-71 and MHH-ES-1 cells suggests the involvement of the unfolded protein response.

Although several chemical and biological studies have revealed triterpenic acid as the main bioactive constituent of Jujubae Fructus responsible for immune-regulatory activity, only few pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted. To comprehend the kinetics of triterpenic acids and promote their curative application, a sensitive and efficient ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method (UPLC-MS/MS) was established.

It is generated by the enzyme endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Similar to all NOS isoforms, functional eNOS transfers electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), via the flavins flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide in the carboxy-terminal reductase domain, to the heme in the amino-terminal oxygenase domain. Here, the substrate L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO. Cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or cigarette smoking reduce bioactive NO. These risk factors lead to an enhanced production of reactive  species (ROS) in the vessel wall. NADPH oxidases represent major sources of this ROS and have been found upregulated in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. NADPH-oxidase-derived superoxide avidly reacts with eNOS-derived NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)). The essential NOS cofactor (6R-)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4) ) is highly sensitive to oxidation by this ONOO(-). In BH(4) deficiency,  reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby converting NOS to a superoxide-producing enzyme. Among conventional drugs, compounds interfering with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and statins can reduce vascular oxidative stress and increase bioactive NO. In recent years, we have identified a number of small molecules that have the potential to prevent eNOS uncoupling and, at the same time, enhance eNOS expression. These include the protein kinase C inhibitor midostaurin, the pentacyclic triterpenoids ursolic acid and , the eNOS enhancing compounds AVE9488 and AVE3085, and the polyphenolic phytoalexin trans-resveratrol. Such compounds enhance NO production from eNOS also under pathophysiological conditions and may thus have therapeutic potential.© 2011 The Authors.

Both farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contribute to the progression of NAFLD; however, it is not clear whether the actions of these two pathways are dependent on each other. Moreover, the pharmacological benefits and mechanism of  (BA) in controlling metabolic syndrome and NAFLD are largely unknown.A reporter assay and a time-resolved FRET assay were used to identify BA as an agonist of the FXR. NAFLD was induced by a methionine and choline-deficient L-amino acid diet (MCD) and high-fat diet (HFD). The pharmacological effects of BA (100 mg·kg ·day ) and potential interactions between hepatic FXR activation and ER stress pathways were evaluated by FXR silencing, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses using control and FXR mice.Activation of the FXR inhibited intracellular PERK/EIF2α/ATF4 and CHOP signalling, thereby alleviating hepatic ER stress, whereas FXR silencing resulted in an opposite effect. Furthermore, we identified BA as an FXR agonist that effectively attenuated the progression of NAFLD and metabolic disorders in both HFD- and MCD diet-fed mice and restored the hepatocellular ER homeostasis by stimulating the FXR signalling pathway and blocking PERK/EIF2α signalling. In contrast, the effects of BA were attenuated in FXR mice.Our data demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the FXR by BA reduces hepatocellular ER stress and attenuates NAFLD in an animal model of hepatic steatosis.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver', 'metabolic syndrome']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26153652>A simple and visible colorimetric method through Zr(4+)-phosphate coordination for the assay of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and screening of its inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) are promising agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and , so a colorimetric method has been developed in this work for PTP1B assay and screening of its inhibitors. The method is based on the chelation effect of zirconium (Zr(4+)) ions on the phosphate group, which may induce aggregation of 4-aminophenylphosphate-functionalized gold nanoparticles (APP/AuNPs) and the corresponding color change of the testing solution. Owing to the dephosphorylation of PTP1B, the aggregation of AuNPs will be influenced by PTP1B since there is no coordination reactivity between Zr(4+) ions and 4-aminophenol, the hydrolyzed product of APP catalyzed by the enzyme. Therefore, a simple colorimetric method for the assay of PTP1B activity can be developed. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ratios of absorbance at a wavelength of 650 nm to that at 522 nm vary linearly with the PTP1B activity in the range from 0.005 to 0.18 U mL(-1) with the lowest detection limit of 0.0017 U mL(-1).

(BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of obesity.Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA.The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Here, we showed that in LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells transiently overexpressing androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was activated and could result in up-regulated interleukin () gene expression, indicating a positive interaction between AR-V7 expression and activated NF-κB/IL-6 signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) pathogenesis. Importantly, both AR-V7-induced NF-κB activation and  gene transcription in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells could be inhibited by melatonin. Furthermore, stimulation of  mRNA expression in LNCaP cells by , a pharmacological NF-κB activator, was reduced by melatonin treatment. Our data support the presence of bi-directional positive interactions between AR-V7 expression and NF-κB activation in CRPC pathogenesis. Of note, melatonin, by inhibiting NF-κB activation via the previously-reported MT₁ receptor-mediated antiproliferative pathway, can disrupt these bi-directional positive interactions between AR-V7 and NF-κB and thereby delay the development of castration resistance in advanced prostate cancer. Apparently, this therapeutic potential of melatonin in advanced prostate cancer/CRPC management is worth translation in the clinic via combined androgen depletion and melatonin repletion.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29604267>SERCA plays a crucial role in the toxicity of a  derivative with potential antimalarial activity.</a></h2><p>Malaria is one of the most significant infectious diseases that affect poor populations in tropical areas throughout the world. Plants have been shown to be a good source for the development of new antimalarial chemotherapeutic agents, as shown for the discovery of quinine and artemisinin derivatives. Our research group has been working with semisynthetic triterpene derivatives that show potential antimalarial activity toward different strains of Plasmodium falciparum by specifically modulating calcium  in the parasite. Promising results were obtained for nanomolar concentrations of the semisynthetic  derivative LAFIS13 against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain in vitro, with a selectivity index of 18 compared to a mammalian cell line. Continuing these studies, we present here in vitro and in vivo toxicological evaluations of this compound, followed by docking studies with PfATP6, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) protein. LAFIS13 showed an LD between 300 and 50 mg/kg, and the acute administration of 50 mg/kg (i.p.) had no negative effects on hematological, biochemical and histopathological parameters. Based on the results of the in vitro assays, LAFIS13 not exerted significant effects on coagulation parameters of human peripheral blood, but a hemolytic activity was verified at higher concentrations. According to the molecular docking study, the PfATP6 protein may be a target for LAFIS13, which corroborates its previously reported modulatory effects on calcium homeostasis in the parasite. Notably, LAFIS13 showed a higher selectivity for the mammalian SERCA protein than for PfATP6, thus impairing the selectivity between parasite and host. In summary, the direct interaction with calcium pumps and the hemolytic potential of the compound proved to be plausible mechanism of LAFIS13 toxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly, no such report is available demonstrating the involvement of BA or its structural analogs in the modulation of PI3K pathway.

CBA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, increased sub-G0 DNA fraction and annexin V binding of the cells besides imparting the typical surface features of cell death. Also, this target specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by expression studies of various proteins together with reactive oxygen species generation and decline in mitochondrial trans membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors i.e., caspase 8 and caspase 9 were found to get upregulated besides PI3K associated DNA repair enzyme i.e., PARP cleavage was observed.

It is currently believed that both classes act by similar modes of action to generate aberrant noninfectious particles via inhibition of CA-SP1 cleavage during Gag proteolytic processing. In this study, we utilized a series of novel analogues with decreasing similarity to PF-46396 to determine the chemical groups within PF-46396 that contribute to antiviral activity, Gag binding, and the relationship between these essential properties. A spectrum of antiviral activity (active, intermediate, and inactive) was observed across the analogue series with respect to CA-SP1 cleavage and HIV-1 (NL4-3) replication kinetics in Jurkat T cells. We demonstrate that selected inactive analogues are incorporated into wild-type (WT) immature particles and that one inactive analogue is capable of interfering with PF-46396 inhibition of CA-SP1 cleavage. Mutations that confer PF-46396 resistance can impose a defective phenotype on HIV-1 that can be rescued in a compound-dependent manner. Some inactive analogues retained the capacity to rescue PF-46396-dependent mutants (SP1-A3V, SP1-A3T, and CA-P157S), implying that they can also interact with mutant Gag. The structure-activity relationships observed in this study demonstrate that (i) the tert-butyl group is essential for antiviral activity but is not an absolute requirement for Gag binding, (ii) the trifluoromethyl group is optimal but not essential for antiviral activity, and (iii) the 2-aminoindan group is important for antiviral activity and Gag binding but is not essential, as its replacement is tolerated.Combinations of antiretroviral drugs successfully treat HIV/AIDS patients; however, drug resistance problems make the development of new mechanistic drug classes an ongoing priority. HIV-1 maturation inhibitors are novel as they target the Gag protein, specifically by inhibiting CA-SP1 proteolytic cleavage. The lack of high-resolution structural information of the CA-SP1 target in Gag has hindered our understanding of the inhibitor-binding pocket and maturation inhibitor mode of action. Therefore, we utilized analogues of the maturation inhibitor PF-46396 as chemical tools to determine the chemical components of PF-46396 that contribute to antiviral activity and Gag binding and the relationship between these essential properties. This is the first study to report structure-activity relationships of the maturation inhibitor PF-46396. PF-46396 is chemically distinct from -derived maturation inhibitors; therefore, our data provide a foundation of knowledge that will aid our understanding of how structurally distinct maturation inhibitors act by similar modes of action.Copyright © 2016 Murgatroyd et al.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20872792> inhibits high glucose-induced vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and migration.</a></h2><p>The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells may perform a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. The principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of  (BA) on human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) proliferation induced by high glucose (HG). In this study, [(3) H]-thymidine incorporation under 25 mM HG was accelerated significantly as compared with 5.5 mM glucose, and this increase was inhibited significantly by BA treatment. We utilized Western blotting analysis to evaluate the effects of BA on cell-cycle regulatory proteins. HG induced the expression of cyclins/CDKs and reduced the expression of p21(waf1/cip1) /p27(kip1). However, BA also attenuated the expression of HG-induced cell-cycle regulatory proteins. The results of gelatin zymography demonstrated that the HG-treated HASMC secreted gelatinases, probably including MMP-2/-9, which may be involved in the invasion and migration of HASMC. Additionally, BA suppressed the protein and mRNA expression levels of MMP-2/-9 in a dose-dependent manner. BA inhibited the production of HG-induced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and the formation of DCF-sensitive intracellular reactive  species (ROS). Further, BA suppressed the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of IκB-α of NF-κB under HG conditions. Our results showed that BA exerts multiple effects on HG-induced HASMC proliferation and migration, including the inhibition of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 transcription, protein activity, and the downregulation of ROS/NF-κB signaling, thereby suggesting that BA may be a possible therapeutic approach to the inhibition of diabetic vascular disease.Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21907795> ameliorates endothelium-dependent relaxation in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats by reducing oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Zizyphi Spinosi semen (ZSS) is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese herbs with protective effects on the cardiovascular system. It is not clear whether  (BA), the key active constituent of ZSS, has beneficial cardiovascular effects on N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of BA on endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in isolated aortic rings from L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats and its underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with L-NAME (15 mg/kg/d, i.p.) for 4 weeks to induce hypertension. After treatment with L-NAME for 2 weeks, rats with mean blood pressure >120 mm Hg measured by tail-cuff method were considered hypertensive and then injected with BA (0.8, 4, 20 mg/kg/d, i.p.) for the last 2 weeks. The effect of BA on the tension of rat thoracic aortic rings was measured in an organ bath system. The levels of nitric oxide (NO), reactive  species (ROS), and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in aortas were assayed. We found that BA (0.1-100 μM) evoked a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in endothelium-intact normal rat aortic rings, which was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with L-NAME (100 μM) or methylene blue (MB, 10 μM), but not by indomethacin (10 μM). Pretreatment with EC(50) (1.67 μM) concentration of BA enhanced the acetylcholine (ACh)-induced vasorelaxation, which was also markedly reversed by both L-NAME and MB. The blood pressure in hypertensive rats increased to 135.22±5.38 mm Hg (P<0.01 vs. control group), which was markedly attenuated by high dose of BA. The ACh-induced vasorelaxation in hypertensive rat aortic rings was impaired, which was markedly improved by chronic treatment with BA (20 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks. The increase of ROS level and the decrease of NO level, SOD and eNOS activities in hypertensive rat aortas were all markedly inhibited by BA. These results indicate that BA decreased blood pressure and improved ACh-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in L-NAME-induced hypertension rats, which may be mediated by reducing oxidative stress and retaining the bioavailability of NO in the cardiovascular system.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Studies in this laboratory have now demonstrated that several triterpenoids including BA and some derivatives, celastrol, methyl ursolate, β-boswellic acid derivatives, and the synthetic analogs CDDO, CDODA and their esters decreased expression of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors and several pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes in multiple cancer cell lines. The mechanisms of this response are both compound- and cell context-dependent and include activation of both proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways. Triterpenoid-mediated induction of reactive  species (ROS) has now been characterized as an important proteasome-independent pathway for downregulation of Sp transcription factors. ROS decreases expression of microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and miR-20a/miR-17-5p and this results in the induction of the transcriptional "Sp-repressors" ZBTB10 and ZBTB4, respectively, which in turn downregulate Sp and Sp-regulated genes.

(BA) is a natural pentacyclic terpene that has been reported to be active in inhibiting various malignancies. Here, we showed that BA could inhibit aerobic glycolysis activity in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 by hampering lactate production, glucose uptake and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), as well as suppressing aerobic glycolysis-related proteins including c-Myc, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and p-PDK1/PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1). Mechanistic studies validated Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as one of key targets of BA in suppressing aerobic glycolysis, as BA administration resulted in Cav-1 upregulation, whereas silencing Cav-1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on aerobic glycolysis. Further investigations demonstrated that BA suppressed aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells by regulating the Cav-1/NF-κB/c-Myc pathway. More meaningfully, BA significantly inhibited breast cancer growth and glycolytic activity in both the transgenic MMTV-PyVT breast cancer spontaneous model and the zebrafish breast cancer xenotransplantation model without any detectable side effects in vivo.

We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species-inducing anticancer agents and many other natural products target a common pathway in cancer cells, which initially involves downregulation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1), Sp3, and Sp4, which are highly expressed in tumors/cell lines derived from solid tumors. This hypothesis is supported by several published reports showing that a large number of phytochemical-derived anticancer agents downregulate Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes involved in cell growth (cyclin D1 and growth factor receptors), survival (bcl-2 and survivin), angiogenesis and migration (MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors), and inflammation (NF-kB). The contribution of this pathway to the anticancer activity of drugs such as curcumin, celastrol, , and phenethylisothiocyanate must be determined in order to optimize clinical applications of drug combinations containing these compounds.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation', 'metabolism', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583403>NMR-based systematic analysis of bioactive phytochemicals in red wine.

However, a systematic analysis of the major healthy molecules contained in wines has not been conducted yet. Our study explored the potential arsenal of beneficial molecules contained in wine from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. The experimental approach was based on chromatography and untargeted NMR spectroscopy. In addition to already known bioactive molecules, for the first time, xanthurenic acid and oleanic acid were identified in wine in relatively high concentrations. On account of their many biological activities, these two molecules widen the range of potential beneficial effects of wine and pave the way toward the evaluation of their still unexplored sensory properties.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The derivatization reaction was screened for influential factors and statistically significant parameters with a p value less than 0.05. A multi-response optimization based on a desirability function was then applied, while simultaneously considering overall detection enhancement of compounds. Results showed that derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) in pyridine (22:13:65v/v/v) for 2h at 30°C was the most efficient method of derivatizing all the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups contained in the triterpene structures. The validity of the method was demonstrated using GC-MS analyzes of a mixture containing eleven standards (β-amyrin, α-amyrin, lupeol, erythrodiol, uvaol, betulin, oleanolic acid, , ursolic acid, maslinic acid and corosolic acid). These compounds are representative of different classes of terpene compounds bearing different functional groups such as alcohols, diols, and carboxylic acids. The derivatization procedure was then tested on four plant extracts: apple pomace, salvia sclarea (dried leaves and flowers), sea buckthorn (Hyppophae rhammnoides L.) berries, and B. serrata resin. The identification of triterpenes was based on the comparison of their retention time and mass spectra to those of standards. The presence of compounds already identified in the literature was confirmed and new ones such as maslinic and corosolic acids were identified in apples, sea buckthorn and salvia sclarea.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we performed bio-guided fractionation of Betula utilis Bark (BUB), in which it was extracted in methanol and fractionated with hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, n-butanol and water. All six fractions were evaluated for their in-vitro anticancer activity in nine different cancer cell lines and ethyl acetate fraction was found to be one of the most potent fractions in terms of inducing cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. By utilizing column chromatography, six triterpenes namely betulin, , lupeol, ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid and β-amyrin have been isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of BUB and structures of these compounds were unraveled by spectroscopic methods. β-amyrin and UA were isolated for the first time from Betula utilis. Isolated triterpenes were tested for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against six different cancer cell lines where UA was found to be selective for breast cancer cells over non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A). Tumor cell selective apoptotic action of UA was mainly attributed due to the activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway via up regulation of DR4, DR5 and PARP cleavage in MCF-7 cells over non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells. Moreover, UA mediated intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption also play a key role for its anti cancer effect. UA also inhibits breast cancer migration.

In the present study, the effects of three plant-derived natural compounds, i.e., sulforaphane (SFN), ursolic acid (UA) and  (BA) on nucleolar state were investigated in breast cancer cell lines of different receptor status, namely MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells. Cytostatic action of phytochemicals against breast cancer cells was observed at low micromolar concentration window (5-20µM) and mediated by elevated p21 levels, and cell proliferation of SFN-, UA- and BA-treated normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) was unaffected. Phytochemical-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation was accompanied by increased levels of superoxide and protein carbonylation that lead to disorganization of A- and B-type lamin  and alterations in the nuclear architecture. Phytochemicals promoted nucleolar stress as judged by the nucleoplasmic translocation of RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3/TIF-IA, inhibition of new rRNA synthesis and decrease in number of nucleoli. Phytochemicals also decreased the levels of NOP2, proliferation-associated nucleolar protein p120, and WDR12 required for maturation of 28S and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs and formation of the 60S ribosome, and phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein that may result in diminished translation and inhibition of cell proliferation. In summary, three novel ribotoxic stress stimuli were revealed with a potential to be used in nucleolus-focused anticancer therapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the poor prognosis is due to the lack of therapeutic efficacy of chemical agents and irradiation in hypoxic tumor areas. New therapeutic strategies could improve the treatment of glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a conjugate of cisplatin (DDP), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, and  (BA), a natural product from plane tree bark, in glioblastoma cells under different  conditions. We investigated the effects of the BA-DDP conjugate κN',N''-{3-acetyloxy-BA-28-[2-(2-aminoethyl)aminoethyl]amide} dichlorido platinum(II) (APC) and its precursor 3-acetyloxy-BA-28-[2-(2-aminoethyl)aminoethyl]amide (DE9B) on cytotoxicity, cell growth, apoptosis, migration and radiosensitivity compared to BA or DDP alone under different  conditions. Based on the EC values, the precursor DE9B exhibited the strongest cytotoxic effects of the analyzed chemotherapeutic agents. The BA-DDP conjugate APC achieved a moderate cytotoxic effect in glioma cells. Both of the newly developed agents induced cell growth delay, apoptosis and inhibition of migration. Furthermore, additive effects could be achieved in combination with irradiation. In contrast to those of BA and DDP, the cell biological effects of APC and DE9B were not influenced by the  concentration. In this study, the linking of BA and DDP did not produce a compound with additive therapeutic effects on glioblastoma cell lines in vitro.

In this study, the effects of BA on normal neuronal cell apoptosis and the mechanisms involved were studied using differentiated PC12 cells as a model. Treatment with 50 μM BA for 24 h apparently induced PC12 cell apoptosis. In the early stage of apoptosis, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased.

Renal fibrosis is a complication of kidney injury and associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In our previous investigation, a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid,  (BA) was found to have protective effect on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal fibrosis. This prompted us to explore the therapeutic value of UA, a chemically related compound to BA in CKD. CKD was induced by feeding adenine with the feed at a concentration of 0.75% for 28 days. UA at the dose rate of 30 mg/kg in 0.5% carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) was administered by oral route, simultaneously with adenine feeding for 28 days. Adenine feeding increased the kidney weight to body weight index, decreased the kidney function due to injury as indicated by increased markers like serum urea, uric acid, creatinine, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and initiated the fibrotic response in kidney by increasing the profibrotic proteins viz. transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin and collagen.

It has been shown to a possess variety of beneficial effects in many disease conditions. However, its efficacy against CKD is yet to be explored.The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of BA on renal fibrosis in the rat model of adenine-induced CKD.CKD rats gained significantly less weight during the experimental period when compared to control rats and BA treatment did not significantly increase the weight gain in CKD rats. CKD rats showed elevated levels of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and uric acid along with increased levels of kidney injury markers such as cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Further, in comparison to control rats, kidney samples from CKD rats revealed increased profibrotic protein levels like transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin, collagen type I and hydroxyproline indicating a progressive fibrotic response. These data are further fortified by histological findings where kidney damage and fibrosis are clearly evident as dilatation of tubules, glomerular degeneration and vacuolation along with deposition of collagen fibers. However, the above-mentioned findings in CKD rats were significantly reversed by BA-treatment revealing its nephroprotective potential and anti-fibrotic activity.The biochemical mechanism of the nephroprotective and anti-fibrotic effect of BA in the adenine-induced CKD rats might be mediated by inhibition of pro-fibrotic protein production thereby hindering the kidney tissue damage along with improvement in kidney function.

Alterations in cellular bioenergetics through the regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling may be a prerequisite to stemness.  (BA) is a well‑known bioactive compound with antiretroviral and anti‑inflammatory potential, which has been reported to exert anticancer effects on various types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. The present study aimed to investigate whether BA could inhibit pancreatic CSCs via regulation of AMPK signaling. The proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells was examined by MTT and colony formation assays. The migratory and invasive abilities of pancreatic cancer cells were assessed using wound‑scratch and Transwell invasion assays. In addition, the expression levels of candidate genes were measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results revealed that BA inhibited the proliferation and tumorsphere formation of pancreatic cancer cells, suppressed epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion, and reduced the expression of three pluripotency factors [SRY‑box 2 (Sox2), octamer‑binding protein 4 (Oct4) and Nanog]. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that there was a significant inverse association between the expression levels of phosphorylated (P)‑AMPK and Sox2 in pancreatic cancer, and it was revealed that BA may activate AMPK signaling. Notably, knockdown of AMPK reversed the suppressive effects of BA on EMT and stemness of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, BA reversed the effects of gemcitabine on stemness and enhanced the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.

In the current study, we demonstrated that BA suppressed HG-induced MC proliferation, arrested HG-induced cell-cycle progression, reversed HG-inhibited expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). It also suppressed HG-induced fibronectin (FN) expression in MCs. Furthermore, BA inhibited HG-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK in MCs. In conclusion, our present study demonstrated that BA inhibited HG-induced cell proliferation and FN expression in MCs via inhibiting ERK1/2 and p38MAPK . Thus, BA may serve as a potential drug for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Recently,  and its derivatives have attracted attention because they showed anti-cancer effects via a ROS- and -related mechanism. However, the source of ROS overproduction and the role of  were poorly identified, and the weak in vivo antitumour activity of these compounds limits their development as drugs.Cytotoxicity was detected using MTT assays. In vivo anti-HCC effects were assessed using nude mice bearing HepG2 tumour xenografts. Cell cycle analysis, apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry. ROS production was detected using a microplate reader or a fluorescence microscope. Changes in gene and protein levels were measured by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Other assays were performed using related detection kits.B5G9, a piperazidine derivative of 23-hydroxy  (23-HBA), showed excellent in vivo anti-HCC effects, with a tumour growth inhibitory rate of greater than 80%, and no significant side effects. B5G9 stimulated the production of ROS, which were derived from the , but it had no effect on various other antioxidant systems. Moreover, B5G9 induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which was characterized by morphological changes, membrane potential collapse, membrane permeabilization, and decreases in the O consumption rate and ATP production. Furthermore, mtDNA-depleted ρ0 HepG2 cells were less sensitive to B5G9 treatment than wt HepG2 cells, indicating the importance of  in B5G9-induced cell death.We discovered a piperazidine derivative of 23-HBA, B5G9, with excellent anti-HCC effects both in vivo and in vitro and no obvious toxic effects. The underlying mechanism was associated with -derived ROS overproduction, and  played essential roles in B5G9-induced cell death. This study identified a potential agent for anti-HCC therapy and elucidated the -related mechanism of BA and its derivatives.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772482>Inhibitory ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT against colorectal cancer by triterpenoids extracted from Rhus chinensis Mill.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown that the etiology and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer are closely related to the tumor microenvironment, and the cancer tissue is still in the state of "energy deficit" and has to promote energy generation through high glycolysis. Rhus chinensis Mill is a Chinese herbal medicine used to treat various types of solid tumors in China. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease group caused by abnormal changes in glucose metabolism resulted in lactic acid production, which remodels acidosis.Although previous studies have shown that the active compounds of Rhus chinensis Mill. can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, whether its triterpenoids could effectively regulate glycolysis involved in CRC have not been systematically investigated.In this study, the extraction of triterpenoids extract from Rhus chinensis Mill. was obtained, and cell viability assay, the percentage of apoptosis for CRC cells were counted, and matrigel invasion assay and production of lactic acid and glucose uptake assay was determined. we further examined the expression of the key glycolytic enzymes and acid-sending ion channel (ASIC) family members of SW620 cells, and some key proteins in the glycolytic pathway were further verified.Notably, triterpenoids (TER) of Rhus chinensis Mill. showed effective anti-proliferative activity and significantly altered protein levels associated with CRC cell survival and glycolysis metabolism. TER could down-regulate the expression of ASIC2, in CRC SW620 cell line. Most importantly, the levels of ASIC2 and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) were also down-regulated by TER. Furthermore, inhibition of activated the ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT1 pathway and target gene transcript expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in parallel to reduce, and resulted in the reduced invasion ability by TER treatment.The potential pathways and targets that involved in glycolysis to excert the anti-CRC effects of main compounds in triterpenoids of Rhus chinensis Mill. were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Our findings thus provided rational evidence that inhibition of the ASIC2-induced calcineurin/NFAT pathway by triterpenoids in Rhus chinensis Mill. profoundly suppressed cell growth and invasion in CRC, which target alternative glycolysis in colorectal tumor cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

M. discoidea and X. aethiopica are plants native in Ghana and the West-African region and used traditionally to treat different pathologies including inflammatory conditions. The antiinflammatory effect of BA and XA was established by an in vivo assay using the carrageenan-induced pleural  model in mice. Also, the ability of BA and XA to increase catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione levels and decrease lipid peroxidation level in reactive oxidative assays was assessed. In addition, the ability of XA and BA to prevent potential lung tissue damage was quantified. Pretreatment with BA and XA reduced significantly, signs of : neutrophil infiltration, oedema, and alveoli septal thickening in carrageenan-treated lung tissue. Additionally, BA or XA pretreatment lowered the degree of lipid peroxidation in the lung tissue while increasing the levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione in vivo. Comparatively, XA was more efficacious than BA in the prevention of lung tissue damage. BA and XA derived from X. aethiopica and M. discoidea possess antiinflammatory and in vivo antioxidant activities in mice pleurisy model. The effect of these compounds gives credence to the traditional use in the management of inflammatory conditions of the airway.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword:['inflammation']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26704543>Biocompatible polymers coated on carboxylated nanotubes functionalized with  for effective drug delivery.</a></h2><p>Chemically functionalized carbon nanotubes are highly suitable and promising materials for potential biomedical applications like drug delivery due to their distinct physico-chemical characteristics and unique architecture. However, they are often associated with problems like insoluble in physiological environment and cytotoxicity issue due to impurities and catalyst residues contained in the nanotubes. On the other hand, surface coating agents play an essential role in preventing the nanoparticles from excessive agglomeration as well as providing good water dispersibility by replacing the hydrophobic surfaces of nanoparticles with hydrophilic moieties. Therefore, we have prepared four types of biopolymer-coated single walled carbon nanotubes systems functionalized with anticancer drug,  in the presence of Tween 20, Tween 80, polyethylene glycol and chitosan as a comparative study. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies confirm the bonding of the coating molecules with the SWBA and these results were further supported by Raman spectroscopy. All chemically coated samples were found to release the drug in a slow, sustained and prolonged fashion compared to the uncoated ones, with the best fit to pseudo-second order kinetic model. The cytotoxic effects of the synthesized samples were evaluated in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3) at 24, 48 and 72 h. The in vitro results reveal that the cytotoxicity of the samples were dependent upon the drug release profiles as well as the chemical components of the surface coating agents. In general, the initial burst, drug release pattern and cytotoxicity could be well-controlled by carefully selecting the desired materials to suit different therapeutic applications.</p><p>Keyword:['metabolism']</p></html>
