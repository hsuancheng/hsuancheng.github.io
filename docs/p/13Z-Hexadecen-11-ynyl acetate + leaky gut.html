In poultry production, the restrictions in the use of antibiotic growth promoters have increased the chances of birds being susceptible to different enteric diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms which compromise intestinal function is pertinent. Based on our previous observation which showed the primary chicken enterocytes in culture undergoing dystrophic changes on treatment with phorbol myristate  (PMA), we surmised that this model, which appeared to mimic increased intestinal permeability, may help to understand the mechanisms of this problem. As genomic and proteomic changes are associated with many physiological and pathological problems, we were interested to find whether certain proteomic changes underlie the morphological alterations in the enterocytes induced by PMA. We exposed primary enterocyte cultures to a sub-lethal concentration of PMA, extracted the proteins, and analyzed by mass spectrometry for differentially regulated proteins. Our results showed that PMA affected several biological processes which negatively affected their energy metabolism, nuclear activities, and differentially regulated the levels of several stress proteins, chaperon, cytoskeletal, and signal transduction proteins that appear to be relevant in the cause of enterocyte dystrophy. Phorbol myristate -affected signal transduction activities also raise the possibilities of their increased susceptibility to pathogens. The changes in enterocyte integrity can make intestine vulnerable to invasion by microbial pathogens and disrupt  homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490117>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension:  Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the  microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and  dysbiosis, OSA and  dysbiosis, and whether  dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and  dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in  dysbiosis.  dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the  wall barrier resulting in " ." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH. dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing  dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on  dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596218>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension:  Dysbiosis as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases.
